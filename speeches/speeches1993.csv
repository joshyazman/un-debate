"1",23,"AFG",48,1993,"Permit me  first of all  tocongratulate Ambassador Insanally on his unanimouselection as President of the United Nations GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I am confident that under his dynamic and wise leadership  coupled with thesupport of that able and consummate diplomat  HisExcellency Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations  the deliberations of this Assembly willproduce constructive and fruitful results in meeting some ofthe major challenges our world is facing at this time and inlaying a sound foundation for international relations in theforeseeable future.Our appreciation is also extended to His ExcellencyStoyan Ganev  the President of the General Assembly at itsforty-seventh session  for his successful conduct of thatsession of the Assembly.I would also like to take this opportunity to welcomethe new Member States that have joined us. I expect thattheir participation at this session will contribute significantlyto international peace and cooperation.The world has witnessed phenomenal changes withinthe last two or three years. With the collapse of Sovietcommunism  many new independent States have emerged and several countries whose citizens lived unwillingly behindthe Iron Curtain for almost half a century have rejoined thefree world. The bipolar world has disappeared and the coldwar has practically ended. These great changes provide anopportunity for us to reduce international tensions  to attaintrue parity among nations  to put an end to wastefulinvestments in destructive and devastating armaments and tofree up our resources for more productive use by all ourcitizens.On the other hand  however  we also see that thesechanges in the world have created substantial uncertaintiesand in many instances have given rise to extremely tragicregional  local  ethnic and religious conflicts which  unlessaddressed by the international community  will endangerworld peace. These conflicts  combined with the continuingproblems of poverty  the widening gap between the rich andthe poor  and the scourge of drug use and drug traffickingcould offset the advantages we all hope to gain from therecent changes. Do we have the vision  the creativity andthe resolve to ensure that the world takes positive advantageof the new realities for the benefit of all countries andpeoples? Or will we continue to be myopic  dogmaticallyblind and self-centred  and risk losing this great opportunity?The Afghan people have a special stake in the choicewe collectively make. We wish to ensure that our choice isthe right one and that all countries  including Afghanistan share fully in the benefits that should flow from the newrealities. Our special stake is based on our belief that thechanges that have taken place in the world are partly theresult of the enormous sacrifices made by our nation duringthe 14 years of struggle against Soviet occupation andcommunist rule.In this context  I would like to say a few words aboutsome of the issues confronting the world community today issues which we must address in this Assembly. I will thendiscuss the situation in Afghanistan and state what ourexpectations are of the United Nations and the worldcommunity.One of the issues confronting us is that of Bosnia andHerzegovina. The country’s situation is indeed tragic  andwill be a test case to determine whether we in theinternational community have the sense of justice and canmuster the resolve to end this tragedy successfully andForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 21justly. The continuing occupation of Bosnian Muslimterritories by the Serbs  backed by the armed might ofSerbia  the intransigence of the Serbians vis-à-vis theSecurity Council resolutions  and the untold atrocitiescommitted against the innocent Bosnian Muslim populationis not only an affront to this Organization but also an insultto humanity. The delegation of the Islamic State ofAfghanistan believes that aggression must not be rewardedand that any territorial gains that were made as a result offorce should and must be rectified. A definitive time limitshould be set by which the Serbs should agree to the termsof the London Conference and withdraw from the seizedterritories. Otherwise  the current arms embargo againstBosnia should be lifted and other urgent and effectivemeasures  including the use of force  should be consideredby the United Nations and the international community toensure that the Bosnian tragedy is ended and the Serbianaggression repulsed.The Palestinian people have suffered long. The IslamicState of Afghanistan would like to see peace finally achievedfor these people in a way that meets their national objectivesand satisfies their right to self-determination. We believethat the declaration of principles on Palestinian self-rulesigned in Washington on 13 September 1993 will serve asthe basis for a long-term solution to the Palestine problemand ensure peace and stability only if it is followed byearnest negotiations that lead first  to the withdrawal ofIsraeli forces from the occupied territories; secondly  to theestablishment of an independent Palestinian State thatincludes the Holy City of Jerusalem  one of the three mostsacred cities of the Islamic world; thirdly  to the return ofthe Palestinian refugees; and fourthly  to a resolution of theproblem of Israeli settlements in a manner acceptable to thenew Palestinian State.Kashmir is another tragic issue that requires urgentattention. This issue has not only caused substantialsuffering to the people of Kashmir  but has become thesource of friction between two important neighbouring Statesin South Asia and has prevented the full realization of theeconomic and trade potentials that exist within and outsidethe region. The Islamic State of Afghanistan therefore urgesthe resolution of this issue by these two States throughnegotiations under United Nations auspices or under anyother arrangements that may be acceptable to both sides taking into account the wishes and aspirations of the peopleof Kashmir.In the case of Somalia  the Islamic State of Afghanistanis distressed by the chaos which has resulted from increasingcivil upheaval. We support the peace-keeping efforts of theUnited Nations and hope that international participation canensure a safe end to the turmoil in Somalia and theestablishment of a viable government to protect the interestsand rights of the Somali people. We believe all peacefulavenues that might help in solving this problem should beexplored.The Islamic State of Afghanistan supports everyequitable international effort to prevent the proliferation ofnuclear weapons. However  given that most of the tragediesaround the world are caused by the massive increase in theavailability of conventional weapons  my delegation wouldwelcome and support a resolution to control the productionand sale of such weapons. Such a resolution should alsoprovide for effective arms collection programmes incountries which are saturated with weapons that are causinginternal and regional instability.Now I would like to focus the attention of theAssembly on my own country  Afghanistan. As all of youknow  Afghanistan has suffered enormously within the past15 years. I do not wish to go into the details of thedestruction that has taken place  but I would like to highlighta few points very briefly.The Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  hasaptly summarized the tragedy of Afghanistan:""Few countries in history have suffered to theextent Afghanistan has over the past fourteen years.Aside from the physical destruction  which was oftennothing short of cataclysmic  the results of the warinclude well over a million people killed  over 2 milliondisabled  nearly 6 million refugees in neighbouringcountries  and 2 million internally displaced persons.""Almost the entire transportation  communication  andpower infrastructure in Afghanistan has been either wipedout or severely damaged. The agricultural system is in totaldisarray  with the irrigation system destroyed  muchlivestock killed and the agricultural credit and extensionservices totally defunct. The placement of millions of minesthroughout the country makes it impossible to revive theagricultural sector. Forests are denuded and the environmentspoiled. Attempts to provide health care  medicine immunization and so on are stymied by the destruction of somany hospitals and clinics. Mental health problems resultingfrom many years of war and bombings have no relief. Inaddition  thousands upon thousands of amputees requireartificial limbs. Thousands of schools have been destroyedand many of our teachers and professors have been killed orexiled. Indeed  illiteracy has overtaken almost our entirepopulation. A whole generation of Afghans has noexperience of normal life or of education in any form.22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe other two urgent problems we have are both linkedto the lack of jobs and of economic alternatives withinAfghanistan: the problem of large numbers of weapons inprivate hands and the problem of illicit drugs. I shall returnto both of these matters a little later.Let me describe the plight of one individual  AbdulRahim. This man escaped to Pakistan from the war inAfghanistan nine years ago. He was newly married  withone baby  and during his years in Pakistan he had two morechildren. Two of his brothers were killed in battle  and thethird died of disease that went untreated because of poormedical facilities. He is responsible for two of his widowedsisters-in-law and their five children. Thus  as he returns tohis village in Afghanistan he is the head of a family oftwelve. He finds that his parents  who had refused to leave are no longer there. It will be some time before he learns oftheir fate. His home is reduced to a pile of rubble  as obviously  are those of his neighbours. The shops of thevillage are gone. The once-paved road that came almost tothe village is an unrecognizable path of dust and rocks.There is no water and no electricity. Worse  there are notrees or source of wood  and winter’s shadow grows longerwith each cold night. In his once productive fields lieburned tanks and odd pieces of metallic rubble. His cousinsnervously talk of land mines  one of which killed an oldneighbour the day before his return. His family is concernedabout lack of flour  tea and sugar. This person is just anexample; there are millions of people like him inAfghanistan.One of the most damaging legacies that Afghanistanhas inherited from Soviet occupation  Communist rule andthe long  drawn-out war is a substantial break-up of our civiland military administration and the virtual collapse of oureconomic and financial institutions. In the past year theGovernment has taken substantial steps to correct thesituation. Indeed  progress has been made in re-establishingcentral authority and in reviving public and private economicand financial institutions. None the less  considerable workand much assistance will be required before we begin toovercome those shortcomings.In addition  given the destruction that has taken place we are in need of a massive reconstruction programmewhich we are unable to undertake unless we are assisted bythe international community. Last year the GeneralAssembly adopted a resolution calling for reconstructionassistance to Afghanistan. Not much has happened sincethen. A similar draft resolution will be presented to theAssembly this year  and we hope that it will be supportedand that many can take part in putting it into effect.When we raise the question of assistance forreconstruction and revitalization of the economy  our requestis gently dismissed with the reply that once security isestablished  Afghanistan will be helped. While granting thatsecurity is important for a full-fledged reconstructionprogramme  I would suggest that a reasonable degree ofpeace and security does exist in large parts of Afghanistan.In these areas reconstruction is possible and  if started  couldserve as a catalyst in revitalizing the entire Afghan economy.There are only a few areas where tensions exist and wherethere may be intermittent fighting. We should also bear inmind that it may not be possible to have full peace andsecurity in the country unless we are able to start the processof reconstruction and provide people with productiveeconomic opportunities to make it attractive  and indeedpossible  for them to give up their arms. The vicious circleof security first and then reconstruction or economic revivalfirst and then security must be broken if we are to make anyprogress.Another dimension of security is obviously political.To ensure that the entire Afghan nation participates indetermining the country’s future political structure  we planto hold elections in the course of the coming year. We havetherefore requested the United Nations to help organize andsupervise the election process.Now I should like to come back to the two or threepoints which I mentioned earlier.One issue worth mentioning here and which has hadboth regional and international implications is that ofnarcotic drugs. At the present time the illicit cultivation production  stocking  smuggling of and trafficking in narcoticdrugs are without a doubt critical problems that facehumanity. Regrettably  one of the legacies of the long waris the transformation of some parts of our country intostaging areas for illicit drug activity. This phenomenon which is the result of the unavailability of economicalternatives  is a source of great pain to us. The IslamicState of Afghanistan  despite its scarce resources  hasundertaken serious measures in the struggle against illicitdrugs. We shall spare no efforts in combating these illegalactivities. However  we must not overlook the reality thatAfghanistan  with its extremely limited means and massiveeconomic and financial needs  is not in a position toaccomplish effectively this task on its own. Afghanistanneeds urgent support from the international community tointensify the struggle against cultivation and of trafficking indrugs.Another area where we require cooperation is that ofland mines. Last year the Secretary-General’s report broughtForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 23to the attention of the world the fact that there are more than10 million land mines in Afghanistan. It should also bementioned that  on average  about 300 people fall victim toland mines each month. The agricultural sector  thetraditional base of the Afghan economy  will never berevived until these mines are cleared. We of course expressour gratitude for the past and ongoing mine-clearingprogrammes of the United Nations and experts from othercountries. However  there is an urgent need for greaterassistance by interested countries both in actualmine-clearing operations and in training Afghan citizens soas to enable us to complete this task in as short a time aspossible. In this connection  the delegation of the IslamicState of Afghanistan wholeheartedly supports the new item introduced by the European Community  on the currentagenda of the General Assembly concerning mine-clearingprogrammes for war-stricken countries.We Afghans want to reconstruct our country and toheal the wounds of the war that was imposed upon us. Welook forward to a normal life in which all our citizensparticipate fully in the political  economic  and social life ofthe country  without any prejudice and withoutdiscrimination based on ethnicity  religious sect  language orgender. Here we consider it particularly important thatAfghan women play an effective and positive role in theprocess of rebuilding Afghanistan. We want to raise thestandard of living of our people. We want to live in peacewith all our neighbours and to cooperate fully with them sothat we can use the vast resources of our region to themaximum advantage of all our peoples. Indeed  we want toserve as a transit and trade route in our region. To this end the Islamic State of Afghanistan intends to devise areconstruction and development strategy that takes intoaccount not only Afghanistan’s own requirements  but alsothe requirements of the region.We are of course distressed by the recent upheavals inTajikistan. We have made every effort to ensure thattensions along the Tajik-Afghan border are reduced. For thispurpose  official visits at the highest levels have beenexchanged between the two countries. These visits haveresulted in mutual understanding on important issues.Appropriate communiqués to this effect have been issued inKabul and Dushanbe. We welcome the decision of the Tajikauthorities to solve their internal political problems throughnegotiations so that the Tajik refugees now in Afghanistancan return to Tajikistan voluntarily with confidence  insecurity and with honour  in accordance with internationalnorms. To this end we are planning to reach a trilateralagreement between Afghanistan  Tajikistan and the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees.The Islamic State of Afghanistan stands firm in supportof human rights. This we consider not only an internationalcommitment  but also a religious conviction. The fact thatafter the collapse of the communist regime in Afghanistanand the takeover by the Mujahideen  no policy of revengeagainst the former regime members was pursued is a goodindication of this commitment. It is true  however  that dueto the massive number of weapons now in private hands inour country some individual incidents of human rightsviolations have taken place  and skirmishes between differentarmed groups have regrettably led to the loss of innocentlives. Therefore  the Islamic State of Afghanistan is takingmeasures to collect heavy arms from various armed groups.We seriously hope that these efforts will bear fruit in the nottoo distant future.I also want to make it clear that  having been thevictims of terrorism ourselves  the Afghan nation opposesterrorism in any form or shape. We will never tolerateterrorism or allow Afghan territory to be used for such acts.Terrorism and the killing of innocent people is abhorrent toour religious beliefs and to our traditions. God Almightycondemns the killing of innocent people and says that whenanyone kills an innocent person  it will""be as if He slew the whole people"". (The Holy Koran V:35).24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe world is also witness to the fact that throughout theunequal war against the former Soviet Union the Afghans atno point carried out any acts of terrorism against Sovietcitizens or Soviet property.I would like to conclude by stating that the internationalcommunity will draw maximum advantage from the changesthat have taken place in the world if we assumeresponsibility for  and become committed to  workingcollectively towards improving the lives of all peoples  whileeach country maintains its full independence and enjoysequal rights and privileges as a separate nation. Allcountries represented in this body should be thinking notonly of the prevention of conflicts  but also of engaging ourenergies to uplift the economic  social  and political lives ofevery nation and citizen so that all are safe  secure and free.It is with such vision  such commitment  such sense ofsharing  that we will be able to realize the objectives forwhich this Organization was founded. For the attainment ofthese goals  we must ensure that new opportunities in theworld are not wasted and that the sacrifices of millions ofpeople who gave their lives for freedom and dignity  as wellas the silent suffering of those who despaired under years ofpoverty and oppression  were not in vain.For our part  I would like to assure the Organizationand the international community that Afghanistan will be afull and cooperative partner in all constructive collectiveefforts aimed at ensuring international peace  stability progress  freedom and justice.May God bless everyone present and help us all in ourefforts."
"2",62,"AGO",48,1993,"First of all  Sir on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Angola andon my own behalf  I congratulate Ambassador Insanally48 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionwarmly on his unanimous election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. I amconvinced that his proven experience and dedication to thenoble ideals of our Organization constitute a secureguarantee of the success of this session.To Mr. Stoyan Ganev  his predecessor  I should like toexpress my sincere gratitude for his exemplary and unselfishmanner of directing the forty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly. The results we obtained during that session areundeniable testimony to his valiant contribution in the searchfor just and lasting solutions to the grave problems withwhich we are confronted.We are very pleased to welcome the new Members ofour Organization. Their admission confirms the universalvocation of the United Nations at a time when its actions arefelt all over the world.To the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali I also want to express my Government’s satisfaction at thedevotion and energy he has shown during the first year ofhis difficult mandate  whose principal objective was theconstant search for adequate solutions to the problems thatafflict all mankind. We would not be wrong to say thatunder his leadership concrete and decisive steps have alreadybeen taken towards the resolution of certain issues thatseemed too difficult to resolve.In this context we salute his efforts  within theframework of the restructuring and revitalization of theUnited Nations system  to give the system a new vitality inthe fulfilment of its mission. We also support themechanisms established for the prevention of conflict  asexplained in the report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" whose sub-title includes the words ""Preventive diplomacy"".My Government continues to support such initiatives andcommends the United Nations for the General Assembly’sunanimous adoption of resolution 47/120 B at its forty-seventh session on 20 September 1993.Therefore  the restructuring and revitalization of ourOrganization should include reform of the Security Councilso that it can respond to the realities of today’s world. Weunderstand that restructuring the Security Council -specifically its enlargement - so that it can permit equitablerepresentation of all the regions of the globe is aimed atguaranteeing greater representativeness  credibility andefficiency. We think that the time has come for the defenceof peace and international security to be the responsibility ofall States.Significant and far-reaching achievements have occurredand are still occurring in international relations  after the endof the East-West confrontation and the cold war. Theseevents are taking place in spite of the proliferation of armedconflicts that put at risk the hope for peace and stability conditions that are indispensable for the promotion ofmutually advantageous international cooperation.With the signing of the peace accords in Washingtonbetween the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and theGovernment of Israel  a new era has opened up for the peaceprocess in the Middle East. My Government commends thesigning of these accords and hopes that the internationalcommunity will continue to work for the rights of all thepeople of that region  in particular so that the opportunity forthe Palestinian people to live in peace and freedom will bean irreversible reality.Regarding South Africa  it was with great satisfactionthat we heard  in the speech by Mr. Nelson Mandela in thisHall on 24 September 1993  the announcement of theorganization of free and democratic elections in April 1994and the call for the lifting of the sanctions. We alsocommend the creation of the Transitional Executive Council which will put an end to three centuries of white minoritydomination. From this rostrum  my Government would liketo add its voice in support of all the initiatives that aim fora peaceful and negotiated solution in South Africa for thepeaceful transition of power to the black majority.In this context  my Government hopes that theinternational community will remain vigilant in order todeter any attempt by extremist groups to derail the presentdemocratic process  which will culminate in theestablishment of the right to one man  one vote  in SouthAfrica.While there has been encouraging progress with regardto the conflicts in the Middle East and apartheid  it isunfortunate that the same is not true in relation to otherconflicts  such as those in East Timor  the formerYugoslavia  some States of the former Soviet Union Somalia  Liberia and my own country. As a matter of fact these conflicts and civil wars continue daily to kill thousandsof human beings and to impede the social and economicdevelopment of the countries involved. We should like theinternational community  and the United Nations inparticular  to give more attention to the resolution of theseconflicts  on the basis of international justice and legality.I should like to express our solidarity with  andencouragement to  the Government of Mozambique and ourForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 49Mozambican brothers and sisters  so that they may  withdetermination and patience  continue on the paths that willlead that country to a lasting and peaceful solution within theframework of the accords signed in Rome  whoseimplementation should be scrupulously observed by allinterested parties  under the supervision of the UnitedNations.We welcome the positive signs which resulted from therecent meeting regarding East Timor between the Ministersof Foreign Trade of Portugal and Indonesia  under theauspices of the Secretary-General.We hope that this profitable dialogue will lead to a justsolution that takes into account the aspirations of theMaubere people in accordance with the relevant resolutionsof the General Assembly and of the Security Council.With regard to Western Sahara  my Governmentsupports the holding of the referendum on self-determinationfor this Territory under the terms of the resolutions of theOrganization of African Unity and of the United Nations.My Government also hopes that the existing obstacles willbe overcome as soon as possible.There have lately been startling changes in the worldeconomic situation. This applies especially to third worldcountries  particularly in Africa. In this regard  while wewitness almost linear economic growth in the developedcountries  a substantial decrease has been recorded in theless developed countries.The indebtedness and the debt servicing of the lessdeveloped countries  together with the great decrease in theprices of raw materials and the recession in the industrializedcountries  constitute the principal obstacle to theirdevelopment and to their full participation in the worldeconomy.In summary  it may be said that the socio-economicsituation of the developing countries - in particular  thecountries of Africa - is alarming and requires the assistanceof international financial institutions.Nevertheless  we are opposed to the doctrine that hasbeen termed the états en échec - the failed States - accordingto which these countries are not able to resolve theirproblems by themselves and  therefore  need new ""tutors"".It seems to us important that certain political situationsthat are a legacy of the past be revised with a view toreaching agreement and reducing the great barriers that existand the mechanisms that jeopardize real cooperation for theeconomic  technical and scientific advancement of thedeveloping countries. In this context  we propose arestructuring of the mechanism of international managementfor economic development and cooperation.My Government shares the opinion that a successfuloutcome to the forthcoming world conferences on economicand social development and on population is of greatimportance to the international community so that there maybe  at the highest level  an open and frank dialogue with aview to finding the most equitable solutions to the mostdiverse and burning issues concerning mankind: poverty hunger and malnutrition - in a word  ""underdevelopment"" -that grip a great part of our planet.I should like to refer also to the importance that myGovernment attaches to environmental issues and theattention that it pays to implementation of therecommendations and decisions of the Rio Conference of1992. In this context  the Government of Angola hasestablished the post of Secretary of State for theEnvironment  whose purpose is to apply therecommendations and decisions of the Rio Conference. Inaddition  an inter-ministerial commission  with an essentiallyconsultative role  has been set up to study and follow closelyprojects related to the activities of the United NationsEconomic and Social Council’s Commission on SustainableDevelopment.The promotion of and universal respect for humanrights remain the prerequisites for the strengthening ofinternational peace and security.The Republic of Angola actively participated in theWorld Conference on Human Rights  which was held inVienna  and supported the consensus view. Nevertheless Angola continues to believe that  in the broad sense  humanrights are universal. We believe that there must be noselectivity in the observance of human rights. Nowhereshould human rights serve as a pretext for interference in theinternal affairs of sovereign States Members of the UnitedNations.The world and the United Nations have witnessed theevolution of the political situation in my country in recentyears - in particular  since 1988. To make possible a betterunderstanding of the phenomena that have contributed to thedramatic situation in Angola  allow me to provide a briefhistorical overview.50 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe Angolan Government is ever-conscious of theintrinsic link between peace and socio-economicdevelopment  not just for Angola but for all of southernAfrica. My Government took the initiative of presenting apeace programme to the then Secretary-General of theUnited Nations. This programme contained the principlesthat culminated in the signing of the Accords in New Yorkin December 1988. We recall that these accords providedfor the withdrawal of Cuban soldiers from Angola and theirreturn to Cuba  as well as for the withdrawal of the apartheidforces from Angolan territory and the implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978) concerning theindependence of Namibia. At that time the internationalcommunity greeted with satisfaction the New York Accords which opened a new era in the relations between States inthat region.With regard to the internal conflict in Angola  theGovernment was aware of the fact that only domestic peace achieved through dialogue and political mediation  wouldmake possible the creation of a favourable framework for asolution of the conflict. Apart from its own efforts  theGovernment showed that it was sensitive to Africaninitiatives that sought to contribute to the restoration ofpeace in Angola.Thus it was that  in the framework of the Government’sinternal peace plan  we arrived in Gbadolite in June 1989.Unfortunately  the Accords lasted only a short time becauseUNITA’s friends and allies wanted a different solution. Thefailure of the Accords was due essentially to bad faith on thepart of the head of UNITA.In spite of this failure  the Angolan Governmentcontinued to commit itself to economic and political reforms as well as to a negotiated solution of the conflict. Itcontinued to promote genuine national reconciliation  whosefundamental purpose was to put an end to the conflict withUNITA.After New York and Gbadolite  peace negotiationscontinued - the Portuguese Government mediating - and theBicesse Accords were signed on 31 May 1991. After aperiod of 18 months  during which the Angolan people livedin relative peace  the country’s first multi-party electionswere held on 29 and 30 September 1992.As the Assembly is aware  the United Nationsconsidered these elections to be to be free and fair.UNITA was not satisfied with the defeat that theAngolan people had inflicted on it through the ballot-box and once again showed its Fascist character. It did nothesitate to take up arms again to take power by force. Itresumed its previous role as a militarist organizationincapable of conforming to democratic rules.Jonas Savimbi’s military option plunged our countryinto a civil war that has caused incalculable loss of humanlives  the destruction of social and economic infrastructureand the displacement of millions of citizens  with suchconsequences as hunger  poverty  sickness and lack of properclothing.As we stated in the Security Council on 15 September1993  the situation in Angola is exceptionally tragic andrequires special attention from the international community.Daily  thousands of people die as a direct or indirectconsequence of the war. Children  elderly people andwomen are direct victims of these acts of war. We candeclare  without fear of contradiction  that the criticaleconomic and political situation in Angola today bears nosimilarity whatever to the situation in Somalia  Bosnia Cambodia or any of the republics of the former SovietUnion. It is our profound hope that peace will be restoredto those regions.The international community seems insensitive to ourtragedy. It is as if the Angolan people were paying the pricefor playing the democratic game. Indeed  how are we tounderstand the curtain of silence that envelops my country?A poor loser will not hesitate to defy the internationalcommunity with impunity unless it punishes him once andfor all. How can one explain that UNITA still maintainsoffices in certain democratic countries and that some of itsofficials are still received with great pomp by officials whodo not hide their aversion to totalitarianism and are the mostardent defenders of human rights?On behalf of the Government of the Republic ofAngola and of its martyred people  who are dying daily bythe thousands  I appeal to the United Nations and theinternational community from this rostrum to help my peopleand compel the UNITA leader  Jonas Savimbi  once and forall to abandon his military adventurism and respect the willof the Angolan people  as freely expressed at the ballotboxes in September 1992.Speaking to the Security Council last week during itsconsideration of the evolving situation in Angola  we askedourselves how long that great organ  responsible forinternational peace and security  would permit the leader ofUNITA to perpetrate with impunity heinous massacres thatForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 51shock the human conscience. These acts discredit anddishonour the United Nations itself and the Security Council whose resolutions have been purely and simply ignored. Wewould like to remind this Assembly that since the beginningof the war in Angola in October 1992 the Security Councilhas adopted 10 resolutions condemning UNITA anddemanding that it abandon the military option and resumedialogue aimed at restoring peace.Yet UNITA has met neither demand. Worse yet  inreaction to Security Council resolution 864 (1993) of 15September 1993  which provides for the imposition ofsanctions  UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi attempted onceagain to dupe international public opinion and the SecurityCouncil by declaring a false cease-fire and stipulatingconditions at variance with the spirit and letter of theBicesse Accords  the Abidjan Protocol and the electoralresults.The truth  however  is quite different. Not only was theunilateral cease-fire declared by UNITA not respected  butwe witnessed an increase in military operations throughoutour national territory. As a result  fighting in Kuito andother regions has recently intensified in a desperate UNITAattempt to reoccupy new areas and consolidate its position.Moreover  by making new proposals outside the negotiatingframework  Savimbi revealed his obvious intention to ignorethe resolutions of the Security Council and seize power forhimself at any cost  including the death of hundreds ofthousands more Angolans. Savimbi does not want peacewithout power. Savimbi only wishes to gain time.Obviously  the Government of Angola cannot accept thepolicy of fait accompli that UNITA wishes to implement byproposing a cease-fire in situ. We believe that there is nogood will on UNITA’s part and that it does not wish toestablish dialogue to put a definitive end to the war. Thisarmed party is plotting a dangerous manoeuvre with the aimof shirking its obligation to fulfil the Bicesse Accords andthe resolutions of the Security Council.The United Nations has a great responsibility in theAngolan process and must not be complacent as regardsUNITA. It is important that the prestige of this Organizationin the peaceful settlement of the conflict not be jeopardizedor challenged by the irreverence of the leader of a rebelpolitical organization. The Government of Angola  theUnited Nations and the troika of observers of the Angolanpeace process have all fallen victim in succession toUNITA’s bad faith over the past 12 months  a bad faith thathas characterized the behaviour of Mr. Savimbi in everymeeting held since the Namibe  Addis Ababa and Abidjanmeetings.In Abidjan the Angolan Government bent overbackwards to be flexible. In spite of the involvement of theUnited Nations Secretary-General’s Special Representativeand of the leaders of the delegations of the observer States UNITA did not sign the Protocol of Understanding whichwas negotiated and agreed upon to lead to the establishmentof a complete cease-fire in Angola. We would like to pointout that President Houphouët-Boigny and his Minister ofForeign Affairs have done their best in the search for a justsolution to the Angolan conflict. These efforts have notbeen successful  due solely to the obstinacy of Mr. Savimbi who says ""Yes"" one day and ""No"" the next.We therefore consider that it is crucial that theinternational community identify the transgressor and movevigorously against him in Angola in an act of justice towardsour people and Government  so that our hopes for theestablishment of democracy will not be frustrated in themidst of the transitional process currently taking placethroughout the world. We want a lasting peace based onviable conditions for reconciling all Angolans.In that context  my Government proposed  on 22September 1993  the following conditions to resolve thepost-electoral crisis caused by UNITA.First  UNITA must withdraw its military forces fromthe areas they occupied illegally following the multi-partyelections held on 29 and 30 September 1992  and must thenobserve the cease-fire under the terms of Security Council851 (1993) of 15 July 1993.Secondly  after the declaration of a cease-fire humanitarian assistance should be implemented and theurgent evacuation of the wounded  sick  interested personsand foreigners accomplished.Thirdly  UNITA must accept fully and unequivocallythe validity of the Bicesse Accords and the results of theelection held in September 1992.Fourthly  UNITA must respect the legislation producedby the instruments of sovereignty established by theelections.The Angolan Government reiterates its willingness toresume negotiations as soon as the conditions for thosenegotiations have been established.52 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionIn my statement to the Security Council on 15September 1993 I alerted its members to the crimescommitted by UNITA against defenceless civilianpopulations. These crimes range from the cold-bloodedmurder of medical personnel and hospital patients  and thehunting down and physical elimination of journalists  familymembers of Government officials and UNITA dissidents tothe bombardment of cities by long-range guns and missiles.I also had the opportunity to discuss the situation prevailingin some regions of Angola  where  as in Kuito  thepopulation has had to eat the flesh of human corpses inorder to survive. UNITA has encircled Kuito for more thaneight months and does not allow humanitarian assistance tobe distributed to the population or allow foreigners to leavethe areas in which they found themselves when the warresumed.In Somalia  one warlord  General Mohammed Aidid has been labelled an undesirable person by the UnitedNations. An international arrest warrant was issued for thatSomali leader. Several days ago the General Assemblyelected a group of international jurists whose mandate is tojudge those accused of war crimes allegedly committed inthe former Yugoslavia. And what is to be said of JonasSavimbi?Are the crimes that are being committed in Angolaunder Mr. Savimbi’s order not worse than those which theUnited Nations has attributed to General Aidid or the crimesthat it intends to judge in the former Yugoslavia? Themurder of medical personnel and patients in hospitals; thehunting down and execution of journalists; family membersof Government leaders and dissidents from UNITA  JonasSavimbi’s organization; the incineration of politicaladversaries in huge bonfires; the indiscriminatebombardment of cities with long-range guns and missiles;and UNITA’s ties with the forces of apartheid - what doesall this mean? Are these not crimes against humanity?The sanctions that the Security Council decreed andwhich entered into force on 25 September constitute proofof the commitment of the international community to theAngolan conflict. We hope that these signs will behonoured by Mr. Savimbi and his allies so that dialogue canbe resumed as soon as possible  on the basis of the BicesseAccords  the Abidjan Protocol and on fulfilment ofparagraphs 6 and 12 of Security Council resolution 851(1993).In conclusion  I should like once again  on behalf of theGovernment of the Republic of Angola  to express ourprofound gratitude for the wide range of support theinternational community has provided to alleviate thesuffering of our people. We hope this assistance willcontinue in an even more substantial way. We wish to payhere a special debt of gratitude to the humanitarianorganizations and in particular the World Food Programme which  in spite of UNITA’s irresponsible and criminalactions  has continued its operations  risking the lives of itsown personnel.We express also our gratitude to the countries that indiverse ways have given humanitarian assistance to thepeople  who still are in need of it now.Once again  I wish the President every success in thework of the forty-eighth session of the General Assemblyand hope that its results will contribute to the strengtheningof international peace and cooperation."
"3",109,"ALB",48,1993,"I deem it a special pleasureand honour to extend my cordial congratulations to thePresident on his election to preside over the GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I also wish to expressmy high esteem for the excellent way in which the formerPresident  Mr. Ganev  presided over the proceedings of theforty-seventh session of the General Assembly.May I hail the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and in particular for his dynamicrole and valuable personal contribution.The Albanian delegation takes this opportunity to greetthe six newest Member States. In particular  we welcomethe presence here of our neighbour  the Former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia  whose stability  territorial integrityand international recognition are of great importance forstability in the Balkans.Since the last session of the General Assembly we haveseen many important events. We have witnessed theendeavours of peoples for progress  prosperity  harmony andunderstanding  peace and cooperation  as well as forsurvival. The end of the cold war paved the way for theattainment of the peoples’ denied aspirations toself-determination and national identity  democracy andequality. It brought their national and spiritual assets closerto each other and enhanced their endeavours to occupy theirrightful place in the list of civilized nations of the world.But these endeavours were also accompanied by crisesand conflicts  which have grown and are now among ourmost serious challenges. We hail with the greatest pleasuretoday the impressive progress made by Israel and the PLO as manifested in the historic agreement to put an end toyears and years of hostility. This remarkable achievementis the best proof that if willingness is shown by all parties a suitable and acceptable solution can always be found. Thisis the right moment to recall the worthy contribution madeby the major actors in world diplomacy to this end andexpress our conviction that with such a commitment theywill continue to deal with other similar crucial questions.At last year’s session of the General Assembly theAlbanian delegation had the pleasure to declare in this Hall44 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionthe victory of the democratic forces and their commitmentto Albania’s reintegration into the community of democraticand civilized nations. Today  from the same rostrum  I havethe honour and the obligation to state that my country’sdemocratic transformation has been successful  embracing allfields and spheres of human activity. This transformationhas once and for all determined the direction in whichAlbanian society will go  and it is forging ahead fast. Aftermore than a year of such government  Albania has taken bigsteps in the setting up of qualitatively new political andsocial structures and institutions  as well as in theobservation and legal guarantee of the rights and freedomsof individuals.We can truly speak now of an overall democraticrestructuring of Albanian society. Our goal is to consolidatethe constitutional democratic political order by setting updemocratic institutions with a view to taking action onvarious political subjects and non-governmental organizationswith a view to guaranteeing participation by all citizens inthe running of the country. Albania is being led by peoplepossessed of new aspirations  ideologies and ideas. TheGovernment and its programme enjoy general approval which ensures political stability at home.Making headway in Albania along with generaldemocratic reform is economic reform  aimed at a totalrestructuring of a closed and inefficient economy on the pathto a free and open market economy. This restructuring isdifficult and truly painful  given the conditions of a countrythat had known no reform or any kind of cooperation. Theeconomic recession the world is experiencing today has aconsiderable bearing on the outcome of reform in Albania.Furthermore  the strict implementation of United Nationssanctions  and the considerable economic losses consequentupon it  have influenced the rhythm of Albania’s economicrecovery. To be successful  Albanian economic policy alsocounts on assistance and cooperation through programmes ofsuch important world economic institutions as theInternational Monetary Fund  the World Bank and theEuropean Community  and on specific programmes of aidand cooperation with member countries of that Communityand a number of other States. Albania has surpassed thestage of emergency aid and is working intensively to carryout capital-producing projects  in which an important role isalso played by United Nations agencies such as the UnitedNations Development Programme and the United NationsChildren’s Fund. In spite of the fact that the Governmenthas been in power for only a short time  positive results areevident.Application of a strict monetary policy has reducedinflation from a monthly rate of 15 per cent in 1992 to 0.9per cent in March 1993. Since August of last year  theAlbanian currency has shown a fairly fixed exchange rate inrelation to hard currencies  and the budgetary deficit hasbeen reduced significantly. As result of the massiveprivatization of agricultural land  production has increased by25 per cent.It is only natural that at this time Albania has to copenot only with the difficulties of transition and worldeconomic recession  but with those caused by the long warin Bosnia and Herzegovina and other complex politicaldevelopments in the region  which negatively affect ourefforts to restore our ruined economy and hinder thepromotion of the democratic process not only in Albania butin the entire Balkan region. We consider the creation of ademocratic space and a climate of peace  security andstability in the former Yugoslavia and all over the Balkansto be factors of decisive importance for the future of thisregion  which has been overburdened with so many conflicts.We are resolved to contribute constructively to theestablishment of such a democratic space of peace understanding and cooperation among the Balkan countries.The priority of Albanian foreign policy is the creationof favourable conditions for the democratic transformationand total revival of the country. We see the solution of allour problems precisely in the creation of this democraticspace in the Balkans and the full incorporation of this regionin the European process of integration. In this context Albania’s permanent political goal remains step-by-step andoverall integration in Europe by encouraging parallelcooperation with the European collective economic  politicaland security forums and structures. Reliable guarantees ofaccelerated integration are advanced democratic legislationworked out in compliance with European standards and theinstitutional restructuring of State administration and localgovernment  along with total privatization of the economyand the general encouragement of local and foreign privateinitiative and activity in Albania. Reference should also bemade at this point to direct assistance from an importantforum of European democracy  the Council of Europe.Albania regards the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationas an institution of effective vitality  which is indispensableto organized concrete inter-State cooperation towards a realcollective security system in Europe and the entireEuro-Atlantic area. Our relations with this importantpolitical and military organization for security in Europe areintended to constantly enhance cooperation towards fullintegration in its structures. In close cooperation with otherForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 45Euro-Atlantic institutions  the Conference on Security andCo-operation in Europe and the North Atlantic CooperationCouncil also have a very important role to play insafeguarding peace  not only through confidence-buildingmeasures and increased understanding among theparticipating states  but also in the prevention of conflictsand the peaceful settlement of disputes. We are confidentthat only a common security policy is conducive to a climateof mutual confidence  capable of coping with newchallenges. Through the position we have expressed at theseforums  Albania has proved that it consistently abides by thisassessment.The protection and observance of human rights  one ofthe fundamental issues of the new world democratic ordertoday  are closely linked with stable development democratic transformation  political stability and internationalsecurity  especially of the underdeveloped and turbulentregions of the world. Human rights are indissolublyinterwoven with the aspirations of mankind to well-beingand socio-economic and political progress  freedom anddemocracy. It is imperative for all members of theinternational community at present to commit themselves according to their respective domestic conditions  to jointefforts to translate these aspirations into reality for the sakeof a civilized and advanced world. The Albanian people who will never forget the high price paid during half acentury of brutal dictatorship  attaches a high value to humanrights and political and civil freedoms. In compliance withthis assessment  our Government considers support fordemocracy and human rights to be the guide of its politicalorientation. It is determined to build a modern State and acivilized society  based on respect for the human rights of allstrata of the population without exception or discrimination.Albania has adhered to two basic United Nations pacts onhuman rights and is making preparations to adhere to aseries of other conventions. Not long ago  for the first timein the history of the country  the Albanian Parliamentendorsed the Constitutional Law on Fundamental Rights andFreedoms  thereby testifying to our determination to puthuman rights at the forefront of the stable foundations of thenew Albanian democratic society we are building.We consider respect for minority rights to be animportant and indivisible aspect of human rights. Albania’spolicy in this field rests on the principles of full equality andnon-discrimination  the creation of a broad democratic spaceso that persons belonging to national minorities can asserttheir own national identity  and the creation of a climate ofexemplary trust and coexistence. Minorities are an integralpart of the political  social and economic life of Albania; asprotagonists of the democratic development andtransformation of the country  they have access to realrepresentation in all socio-political structures  at State andlocal levels of administration. Their situation in economicand social domains will improve hand in hand with that ofthe rest of the population.The end of the cold war freed mankind from the fear ofglobal confrontation  even though peace and security are stillseriously threatened by a number of regional conflicts. Insome regions of the world  the actions and practices of someStates where totalitarian and ultranationalist regimes are inpower run counter to the aspirations and endeavours of thepeace-loving international community. More than 30 armedconflicts  accompanied by savage crimes and great sufferingfor the civilian population  are currently ablaze in variousregions of the world. These conflicts  which are a flagrantviolation of human rights and which are attended by all theinevitable consequences  have seriously shocked mankind.The conflict in the former Yugoslavia  especially inBosnia and Herzegovina  which is the bloodiest and mostdangerous conflict known in Europe since the Second WorldWar  has not yet found a stable solution. The monstrousmassacres carried out against the innocent civilianpopulation  ""ethnic cleansing"" - that barbaric form ofgenocide - and all the other inhuman acts associated withthis conflict have once more testified to the fact that it isimpossible to reform totalitarian and ultra-nationalistsocieties. This conflict is a challenge to civilized Europe  tothe conscience and humanitarian sentiments and passions ofthe whole of peace-loving mankind. That is why a firmcollective answer from mankind is required. We have seenthat the imposition of sanctions  despite the effect on theSerbian economy  was not the only or the most effectivemeans to put an end to the war and restore peace. This isbecause the practical commitment of some countries did notmatch their verbal statements in support of the sanctions.That is why sanctions failed to paralyse and seriouslydamage the Serbian war machine. Time has proved that thesanctions needed to be accompanied by other  simultaneous measures of pressure.We think that a convincing example should be set foreverybody  demonstrating that the reaction and the stand ofthe United Nations will always be the same in cases ofaggression. It is the Organization’s duty to use all means atits disposal to implement the principles of the Charter  tomake peace  and to fulfil the hopes of mankind.But we understand that the United Nations sanctions  asthe only means based on the world community’s consensus will continue to be applied  putting the necessary pressure on46 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionthe Belgrade authorities until a final solution of the wholeYugoslav crisis is found  including an overall improvementof the situation in Kosovo.The Yugoslav crisis is multidimensional andcomplicated because of many interlacing factors andinterests. It is evident that its most tragic and bloodiestmanifestation is the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina which for more than a year has been the centre of theattention and the efforts of public opinion and of thediplomacy of the major Powers of the world. I would liketo stress that my country has condemned the Serbianaggression  and has hailed and unreservedly supported all theendeavours of the international community to establish peacein Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Republic of Albania willsupport any solution to the Bosnian conflict which is basedon a free and fair agreement. Solutions which legalizeterritorial annexation and ""ethnic cleansing"" at the expenseof other peoples such as the Muslim population in Bosniacan hardly be heralds of peace.Moreover  we would like to remind this importantinternational forum that the other aspects of the Yugoslavcrisis should not be neglected either  for these could haveconsequences of tragic proportions not only within theformer Yugoslavia but also in the Balkans and beyond.In that light  I would like to point out that the Albanianfactor in the former Yugoslavia  especially the Kosovo issue is of a crucial importance to finding an equitable and lastingsolution to the crisis. Therefore  we insist that this problemhas to be properly addressed. If  in assessing this factor there is insistence on the rigid position that Kosovo is anintegral part of Serbia  that it is annexed to Serbia and thatthe Albanian people in the former Yugoslavia are a minority then nothing will be achieved  but the idea of creating a""Greater Serbia"" will be reconfirmed and legalized at theexpense of other peoples.We think that the breakup of the former Yugoslavia -which was also the cause of what is now called theYugoslav crisis - puts the issue of succession in the formerYugoslav federation in an entirely new light: it brings upthe question of considering the peoples’ right ofself-determination  and the expression of their free will as totheir political status. If this means war  as some peoplethink  then it is up to the United Nations and the SecurityCouncil to intervene and guarantee respect for the principlesof the Charter. We firmly maintain that no forcible changeof borders or territorial gains through aggression and ""ethniccleansing"" will be recognized.The choice is clear: if we want people to believe in thenew world order  we must create all the legitimateinternational conditions needed to realize and defend theiraspirations  by setting up an entirely new type of system ofUnited Nations protection for defenceless countries andpeoples.As to the national question of the Albanians  we see itssolution in the creation in the former Yugoslavia and allover the Balkans of a broad democratic space that wouldallow freedom of communication and freedom of movementamong the more than 7 million Albanians who live  interritorial continuity  in that space. We are against territorialfragmentation and division  and the hermetic sealing of asingle people within the borders of neighbouring countries.I believe that I am also expressing the opinion of manycountries represented here when I say that the outbreak of aconflict in Kosovo would be the start of a great tragedy.Albania expresses its profound gratitude to the internationalcommunity for all the efforts it has made to prevent aspillover of the conflict to Kosovo and to support the deniedrights of the Albanian people there. I also express mygratitude to the United Nations  which has clearly warnedthat any warlike act by Serbia in Kosovo will pose a threatto international peace and security. We highly appreciatethis support and call for a serious commitment by theinternational community to take all the necessary urgentmeasures to prevent the Bosnian tragedy from recurring inKosovo.Albania has long made it clear that placing Kosovounder the control and protection of the United Nations is theonly guaranteed way of preventing conflict and discouragingthe silent ""ethnic cleansing"" that Serbia is practising there.It would also create a favourable climate for dialoguebetween the legitimate Albanian representatives of Kosovoand the Serbian authorities on the political status of theprovince and on any other issue linked with the question ofsuccession to the former Yugoslavia.Therefore  we reiterate our stand that only the UnitedNations  and primarily the Security Council  shouldexpeditiously take the necessary measures to prevent conflictin that region.At a time when the concept of using peace-keepingforces prior to a conflict has been consolidated in theory andhas been put into practice  preventive deployment is fullyjustified in the case of Kosovo  because of the threat that theoutbreak of an intra-Balkan armed conflict would pose tointernational peace and security.Forty-eighth session - 27 September l993 47We are profoundly concerned about the issue ofKosovo and the grave situation created there since theelimination of its autonomy in 1989 and its completeannexation and subjection to Serbian military and policeauthority  and we call for proper attention to the fact that apeaceful settlement of the Yugoslav crisis should cover theentire space of the former Yugoslavia and all its aspects andproblems. Any partial settlement without the necessaryinternational safeguards would be unstable and would not doaway with the germs of new conflicts.To sum up  I would like to reiterate that the Republicof Albania sees in the United Nations an organizationcapable of implementing the principles of its Charter andcoping with all the challenges that result from the dynamicdevelopments of our time  especially serious problems in thefields of security  disarmament  sustainable socio-economicdevelopment  environment and so on.We see the United Nations also as the primaryinstitution responsible for the collective safeguarding ofpeace and security in the new era. Albania will renderunreserved support to all initiatives aimed at enhancing theefficiency of this universal Organization."
"4",177,"ARE",48,1993,"On behalf of the delegation ofthe United Arab Emirates  it gives me great pleasure toextend to you our sincere congratulations on your election asPresident of the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. We are fully confident that your vast experiencein the area of international relations will enhance theOrganization’s role and promote its goals.I also wish to express our appreciation of the tirelessefforts undertaken by your predecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev in his judicious and capable management of the previoussession.It also gives me great pleasure to extend our sincerethanks to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations  for his dedication to the importantresponsibilities with which he has been entrusted and tocommend his efforts aimed at enhancing the Organization’srole in addressing the issues that concern the internationalcommunity and in devising peaceful and just solutions to theproblems of development and peace as well as the issuesinvolved in maintaining regional and international security.I should like also to welcome the countries that haveacceded recently to the membership of the Organization andto wish them success and prosperity. There is no doubt thattheir presence among us accentuates further the universalityof the United Nations and will contribute positively to therealization of our common goals and interests in consonancewith the Charter.On this occasion  I should like  on behalf of the peopleand Government of the United Arab Emirates  to extend oursincere condolences and profound sympathy to the peopleand Government of friendly India over the tragic loss ofthousands of lives as a result of the recent earthquake.This forty-eighth session of the General Assembly isconvened against the backdrop of new political realities thathave wrought dramatic changes in both regional andinternational relations. The most notable changes have beenthe diminished threat of nuclear war and an end to theproblems that had plagued the international community sincethe creation of the United Nations as a result of the era ofbipolarity and competition over spheres of influence.Although these changes have had a positive effect  theinternational arena has witnessed several new regionalconflicts that have been generated by ethnic bigotry 14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionreligious fanaticism  expansionist tendencies and the spreadof the phenomenon of terrorism  which is still sweeping oversome parts of the world and which continues to pose a threatto peace and security at the regional and international levels.Given the existence of such a situation  it is incumbent onthe international community as a whole to address theseproblems and to find effective solutions thereto in theinterests of stability  development and abiding peace and inorder to lay the foundations of the new world order to whichall the countries of the world aspire so that they may be ableto face up to the many major challenges that have come toconfront humanity as a whole.The role and responsibilities of the United Nations andespecially those of the Security Council have expanded since the end of the cold war  particularly in the areas ofdevelopment and the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. There is no doubt that the adoption by the GeneralAssembly of the ""Agenda for Peace"" and other measuresaimed at restructuring and revitalizing the Organization inthe areas of economic and social development constitute aconstructive  positive step towards the shouldering by theinternational community of its immense responsibilities inthis regard. This will enhance the credibility of the UnitedNations and increase its ability to become a truly effectivemulti-purpose instrument in dealing with existinginternational issues.We believe that within the new context of internationalrelations  the restructuring and reform of the United Nationsshould embrace the Security Council as the organresponsible for the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. In restructuring the Council  the principle ofequitable geographical representation of all regional groupsshould be taken into consideration so that it may reflect thechanges and transformations that have taken place in theinternational political arena. Those changes andtransformations call for a new approach in addressing theissues of peace  security and development at the internationallevel. Such an approach should stem from a soundunderstanding of the realities of an interdependent world sothat it may enable the international community to findsolutions that would go to the roots of old and new problemsalike.In this regard  we wish to stress that the issues ofpeacemaking and peace-keeping at both the regional andinternational levels in the context of preventive diplomacyshould be addressed in a manner that takes intoconsideration the historical  geographical  political  socialand cultural characteristics of each and every State. In sodoing  the international community should keep in view theimportance of coordination and cooperation between theUnited Nations and regional organizations  in the search forpeaceful and commonly agreed solutions for existingconflicts and disputes  on the basis of international legalityand the Charter of the United Nations.The recent events in the Gulf in the wake of theliberation of the sister State of Kuwait have produced a newpolitical reality which reinforced the belief in the importanceof settling disputes by negotiation and other peaceful meansas prescribed by the Charter of the United Nations and theprinciples of international law  in the interests of buildingmutual trust and consolidating peace and security  as well aspromoting stability  coexistence and good-neighbourlinessbetween the States of the region.Given our adherence to these principles in our relationswith other States both regionally and internationally  theUnited Arab Emirates has declared its readiness and sinceredesire to conduct a direct dialogue with the Islamic Republicof Iran with regard to Iran’s occupation in 1971 of the threeislands of Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa  whichbelong to the United Arab Emirates. From this rostrum where many peace calls have been made  we appeal onceagain to the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond positivelyto our call for dialogue and to start negotiating an end to thisoccupation and to return the three islands to the sovereigntyof the United Arab Emirates.The United Arab Emirates works jointly with otherStates members of the Gulf Cooperation Council  within aframework of cooperation and solidarity in defining itspolicies and its regional and international relations on thebasis of existing geographic  political and economic realities and in a manner that is consistent with its national interestsand its Arab and Muslim identity. In their recent Summitmeeting held in Abu Dhabi in December 1992  the leadersof the Gulf Cooperation Council affirmed the importance ofresorting to dialogue and negotiation as a principalinstrumentality for settling disputes between States bypeaceful means  in consonance with the tenets of IslamicSharia as well as the commitment of the Gulf CooperationCouncil to the Charter of the United Nations and to thenorms and principles of international law.Mrs. Osode (Liberia)  Vice-President  took the Chair.The Gulf Cooperation Council also affirms theimportance of respecting the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of States  and non-interference in their internalaffairs. We believe that every State is entitled to choose itsown political system and to exercise sovereignty over itsForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 15natural resources in line with its development objectives andenvironmental policies. We reject the use of force  or thethreat of the use of force as a means of settling disputes.We hold that resorting to peaceful means in the settlementof disputes would enable the States involved to harness theirresources in the interests of social and economicdevelopment.The Iraqi regime still pursues a policy ofprocrastination with regard to the implementation of allrelevant Security Council resolutions. In view of this  theinternational community must oblige that regime toimplement those resolutions to respect the political system sovereignty and territorial integrity of the State of Kuwaitand to refrain from reiterating its expansionist aims.Security Council resolution 833 (1993) relating to thedemarcation of boundaries between Kuwait and Iraq guarantees the inviolability of the international boundariesseparating the two countries in accordance with Chapter VIIof the Charter. The resolution is a positive step and afundamental international contribution towards achievingregional and international peace and stability.We also urge the international community to pressurethe Iraqi regime to abide by international humanitarian lawand release immediately all Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaitiprisoners of war and detainees. An end should be put to thishuman tragedy which violates the basic norms ofinternational humanitarian law.At the same time  we should like to emphasize that itis imperative to maintain the unity and territorial integrity ofIraq and declare that the suffering and hardships endured bythe Iraqi people are the responsibility of the Iraqi regimebecause of its refusal to implement fully all relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions.The positive international developments resulting fromthe end of bipolarity and the collapse of military allianceswere bound to produce their effects in our Arab region.Today  dialogue and cooperation between the big Powers and the peaceful settlement of regional disputes  havereplaced the confrontations of bipolarity.The United Arab Emirates welcomed the convening ofthe Madrid Peace Conference and the holding of bilateralnegotiations. It also welcomed the multilateral negotiationsin which it participated. Likewise  it welcomed thedeclaration of principles concluded between the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel as a positivebeginning and a first step towards a just  comprehensive anddurable settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict and theQuestion of Palestine  on the basis of international legalityas reflected in the relevant United Nations resolutions  mostnotably Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and338 (1973)  as well as the ""land for peace"" principle. Sucha settlement should enable the Palestinian people to exercisetheir national inalienable rights  including the right ofself-determination  and bring about a total Israeli withdrawalfrom the occupied Arab territories  including the Holy Cityof Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan.We support the sustained efforts undertaken by theLebanese Government to extend its national sovereignty overall the Lebanese national soil. In this regard  we call for thefull implementation of Security Council resolution 425(1978). This will contribute to the consolidation of peaceand stability and to the creation of the conditions necessaryfor the social and economic development of the States andpeoples of the region.My country is extremely concerned over thedeterioration of the security situation in the sister State ofSomalia  which has resulted in many injuries and fatalities.We support the efforts undertaken by the United Nations andregional organizations aimed at alleviating the suffering ofthe people of Somalia and creating a secure environmentconducive to the continuation of aid and humanitarian reliefprogrammes and the rebuilding of national infrastructures particularly those relating to social and economicdevelopment.In view of the strong historical ties between our peopleand the people of Somalia  the United Arab Emirates hasextended humanitarian and financial assistance to thatcountry  in addition to its participation in United Nationspeace-keeping forces. We sincerely hope that all Somalifactions  taking into account the interests of the people ofSomalia  will cooperate  unite and reconcile in order tofacilitate the United Nations mission in Somalia and resumenegotiations and dialogue for the sake of achieving stability peace and security in that country.The people and Government of the United ArabEmirates have followed with deep sorrow the tragedy thathas beset the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina for wellover 18 months. My country has also condemned the actsof killing  displacement  ethnic cleansing  genocide and rapeperpetrated by Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats who aresupported by the regular army of Serbia and Montenegro.The victims of such atrocities have been largely the BosnianMuslims. My country supports the Security Council andGeneral Assembly resolutions relating to the trial and16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionpunishment of the perpetrators of war crimes in Bosnia andHerzegovina. The implementation of these resolutions willgo a long way towards demonstrating that the internationalcommunity honours its obligations and that the UnitedNations lives up to the Charter and principles of internationallaw.The partition plan recently proposed in the Geneva talksfor the settlement of the dispute in Bosnia and Herzegovinalacks fairness and justice because it legitimizes aggressionand ""ethnic cleansing"" and rewards the aggressors byallowing them to annex the territories they have conqueredby force. In the face of this tragic situation  the internationalcommunity bears the historical and moral responsibility ofdefending a State Member of the United Nations andpreserving its independence  sovereignty  territorial integrityand enabling it to exercise its legitimate right ofself-defence.The progress recently achieved in the recentnegotiations between the political parties of South Africa which culminated in a decision to form the TransitionalExecutive Council  represents a positive step towardsestablishing an interim Government and finalizing thearrangements for the elections to be held early next year.This progress may also be a significant step towards theformulation of a permanent constitution  which would leadto the establishment of a democratic and a united State freeof racial discrimination.One of the great challenges that still face theinternational community is the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction  particularly nuclear weapons. This posesa grave threat to international peace and security; hence  itis the responsibility of the international community toencourage the adoption of confidence-building measures onthe regional and international levels to create a secureinternational environment. We believe that the nuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty is the key to strengthening allinternational efforts and regional initiatives aimed atpreventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction andremoving the dangers that continue to threaten both regionaland international peace and security.In this regard  we welcome the positive steps recentlytaken in the field of disarmament  including the Conventionon the Prohibition of the Development  Production Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on TheirDestruction  which was signed by the United Arab Emirates as well as by a majority of the States of the world. Weshould also like to reaffirm the importance of establishingzones free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of massdestruction  including the Middle East.Despite the progress achieved in the case of certaininternational political and social problems  we are yet towitness any noticeable improvement in the internationaleconomic environment. The gap between North and Southis getting increasingly wider  and living conditions in manydeveloping countries are constantly deteriorating under theheavy burden of foreign debt  the continuing decline in theprice of commodities  and the terms of trade as well as thenegative impact of protectionist policies on those countries’balances of payments. Given this situation  it has becomethe collective responsibility of the international communityto restructure the existing international economic relations ina manner that would ensure effective cooperation inpromoting economic development in many countries especially in the developing world  and thereby to improvetheir living conditions.Economic cooperation has expanded to new horizons especially in the areas of development and environment.That was underscored by the forty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly through the creation of the high-levelCommission on Sustainable Development. This indicatedthat the international community is well aware of the natureof existing international problems and the importance ofregional and international cooperation in achieving the goalsof peace and development.The member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council(GCC) have played an active role in the field of regional andinternational economic cooperation through the constructiveand practical positions they have adopted and through theircontributions and assistance to the developmental efforts ofmany third world countries. This stance stems from theGulf Cooperation Council countries’ belief in the principlesof economic cooperation between States  and especially withthe sisterly Arab and Islamic States. When measured againstthe gross national product  the percentage of aid extended bythe GCC countries to developing countries is greater thanthat provided by the developed countries  even though theeconomies of the GCC countries are based primarily on oil a depletable resource. These contributions have been madedespite the need of all our countries to devote all theirenergies to the process of rebuilding and maintaining theirsocial and economic infrastructures that have been adverselyaffected by the wars and disputes of the last two decades.The spirit of tolerance and commitment to humanvalues and to the principles and purposes of the UnitedNations Charter should guide us on the road to the betterForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 17future that we all aspire after - a future that looks moreattainable than ever before  in view of the regional andinternational changes that have taken place over the past fewyears. All States  big and small  developed and developing must seize this historic opportunity to build on themomentum of change in order that peaceful dialogue mayprevail  consolidating the foundations of regional andinternational peace and security and peaceful coexistence."
"5",224,"ARG",48,1993,"I congratulate Ambassador Insanally on hiselection. I have no doubt that he will conduct our work ina wise and balanced manner  in the same way as hispredecessor  the then Minister for Foreign Affairs ofBulgaria  Mr. Ganev.Once again  we welcome the new Member States  theCzech Republic  the Slovak Republic  The Former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia  Monaco  Eritrea and Andorra.We also reiterate our gratitude to and support for theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Ghali  who with clearobjectives and diplomatic efficiency has undertaken the newtasks of the United Nations in an international climate thatis problematic but promising.Serious conflicts  such as that in the former Yugoslaviaand the sensitive situation in Somalia  still remain  and arethe object of the work and efforts of the United Nations.There are long-standing regional confrontations and frictionsresulting from certain national  cultural or religiousidentities; ignored for long periods  they are now demandingtheir rights  and not always in a peaceful manner.Moreover  there are still sharp economic imbalancesbetween nations and regions  as well as the serious risk thatthe Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) negotiations will fail because someGovernments insist on maintaining anachronistic protectionistpolicies that adversely affect the trade opportunities ofcountries such as Argentina.Above and beyond these problems  this is also a timeof hope and optimism; we are heartened by the expansion ofdemocracy  the globalization of the concept of human rights and the economic openness and reform in regions wherestate control once prevailed and where today the basis forfreedom and the continual quest for peace is growing.Perhaps there is no better symbol of this hope andoptimism than the historic agreement between Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization.The Arab-Israeli conflict has until now been one of themore disturbing issues in contemporary history and one ofthe greatest obstacles to peace and stability. Theconsequences of this prolonged and painful confrontationhave been felt everywhere; hence all humankind rejoices atthe agreements that have been reached.Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 25These agreements undoubtedly reflect the tenacious andintelligent diplomacy of the parties  the special contributionof Governments such as those of the United States  theRussian Federation and Norway and the support of themembers of the Security Council; but  above all  they attestto the courage  intelligence and maturity of the peoples andleaders of Israel and Palestine. Today we wish to pay atribute to all of them.Since its origin  the conflict in the Middle East hasbeen of particular concern to Argentina  inter alia  becausethe Arab and Jewish communities in our country havealways coexisted peacefully. That is why we have alwayshoped for peace and respected the need to avoidconfrontation and achieve a just and lasting solution takingaccount of the interests of both parties.The agreements reached can be considered as abreakthrough in that direction. They open the door to aglobal settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict  and that is whywe rejoice at their attainment and firmly support them. Wecall upon all States  particularly those which have interestsor influence in the Middle East  to join resolutely in thesupport that the circumstances require.The Republic of Argentina considers the maintenanceof international peace and security as essential. Hence  myGovernment considers that the efficient functioning of theSecurity Council must be a priority for the Organization.Argentina has therefore clearly defined its position onan eventual restructuring of the Security Council. In ouropinion  that body has recovered the role assigned to it bythe Charter. Any changes in its structure should therefore bemade solely on the basis of consensus  always respecting theprinciple of the sovereign equality of States  and taking carenot to endanger its ability to fulfil effectively theresponsibilities assigned to it by the Charter. Hence wemust act with the utmost prudence  and on the basis of theaforementioned principle  in making changes that wouldintroduce structural modifications  creating  for example  newcategories of privilege. In any case  it would be counter-productive to ignore the position of those countries that haveactively demonstrated their firm and continued support forthe Council’s important work.Mr. Bull (Liberia)  Vice-President  took the Chair.Argentina  for example  resolutely and actively supportsthe system of collective security provided for in the Charterand the decisions of the Security Council. That support hasbeen repeatedly demonstrated through concrete action inaccordance with Council decisions  and in particular throughour active presence in peace-keeping operations.At present  Argentina is participating in ninepeace-keeping operations; in the last few months alone  wehave pledged to send three new groups of our armed forcesto Mozambique  Kuwait and Cyprus: a field hospital  a unitof engineers and an infantry battalion respectively.Argentina has the firm political determination to supportUnited Nations peace-keeping operations  within its means.At the same time  I am obliged to mention some issues thatcurrently affect the normal development of the operationsand that somehow limit the ability of Member States toparticipate to the extent they would desire.We consider it a priority to do as much as possible inorder to guarantee the safety of the men and women whoparticipate in peace-keeping operations.The arrears in the payment by Member States of theircontributions and the subsequent delays in reimbursementsto troop-contributing Governments have created very seriousfinancial problems for those Governments. For that reason -and also because of their own domestic budget limitations -these countries find it ever more difficult to increase theircontributions of troops and equipment. A mechanism shouldbe established at once to find a solution. In this context  wewelcome the efforts of the office of the Secretary-General as well as the initiative with respect to creating stand-byforces.The priority goal of peace also imposes on us a firmcommitment to each State in the struggle against theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Thiscommitment is one of the main focuses of Argentine foreignpolicy. Hence  we have brought total transparency to theArgentine nuclear programme. With that aim in view  weand Brazil have signed an agreement on full-scopesafeguards with the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA); we have already ratified it. In the same spirit  wehave discontinued the missile project CONDOR II.In addition  together with Brazil and Chile  we havepromoted amendments to the Treaty of Tlatelolco that wouldstrengthen that major agreement and make it effective; wehope that these will soon be approved by the ArgentineParliament.At the same time  Argentina has been admitted to theMissile Technology Control Regime  whose guidelines wehave included in our domestic legislation  and is a member26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionof the so-called Australian Group. We are among theoriginal signatories of the Convention on ChemicalWeapons  and we participated actively in its drafting; wewill soon start the proceedings for its legislative approval.We firmly support the negotiation  in the framework ofthe Conference on Disarmament  of a treaty to ban allnuclear tests. The moratorium respected in practice by thenuclear Powers points to the existence of favourableconditions for the total ban of such tests.In the field of armaments  we support the UnitedNations Register of conventional weapons  to which we haverecently supplied all the relevant information and data. Weare particularly interested in the functioning of the Registerin our own region; last March  in Buenos Aires  weorganized  jointly with the United Nations  a very successfulregional seminar on this very important subject.Latin America is now going through a promising stage.The climate of cooperation and harmony prevailing in theregion contributes to political stability and economicdevelopment. The expansion and consolidation ofdemocracy and economic and social growth have also beenstimulated as a result of the strong impetus given to theprocess of regional integration. As regards the CommonMarket of the South (MERCOSUR)  Argentina expresses thefirm political will and determination to contribute to itsstrengthening. In this context we must acknowledge thepositive role of the Rio Group  which has been consolidatedas an increasingly useful and trustworthy mechanism fordialogue  cooperation and consultation.The Group’s information and internal communicationsystems have been enhanced  which enables it to take unifiedpositions on common problems. This has increased itsinfluence in the United Nations and the Organization ofAmerican States (OAS)  where it has played a constructiveand effective role  for example in relation to the crisis inHaiti.Indeed  Haiti is a case in which we note the opening ofa path towards democracy - albeit with certain difficulties.Argentina welcomes the agreement reached under theauspices of the United Nations and the OAS for therestoration of democracy in that nation  through thesuccessful mediation of Mr. Dante Caputo  whoseperformance is a source of legitimate pride for my country.Provided that the Haiti agreements are respected in theirentirely  effective 30 October the Argentine Republic willcontribute  in the framework of relevant Security Councilresolutions  a field hospital to be used in the operation theUnited Nations and the OAS will conduct together to supportthe consolidation of democracy in that country.As regards El Salvador  we note with satisfaction thesubstantive progress represented by the peace agreementsrecently signed. We trust that the elections to be held nextMarch will mark a decisive stage in efforts to consolidatedemocracy.We also express our support for the re-establishment ofconstitutional order in Guatemala and we encourage itspeople and Government to continue their efforts tostrengthen democracy and the rule of law.There has been remarkable progress in the consolidationof a climate of peace and détente in Latin America as awhole  thanks to the restoration of democracy and toeconomic reforms. There is still one case about which weare concerned and about which we have repeatedlyexpressed our hope for profound change. The best option isto move forward in the same direction as the rest of thecontinent. Delays will only bring about more suffering forits people and more concern on the part of their LatinAmerican brothers.The strengthening of a climate of harmony in LatinAmerica requires new ideas leading to the development ofa structure of regional security adapted to the present timesand based on cooperation  balance and transparency. Webelieve that cooperative security is a realistic and feasibleproposal for Latin America  and we urge the countries of theregion to give it special consideration.Latin America must enter fully into the newinternational context. In accordance with the Secretary-General’s ideas on the role of regional organizations asstated in his ""Agenda for Peace""  it should strengthen thecontribution of the Organization of American States to themaintenance of international peace and security.Argentina shares with the rest of the internationalcommunity the constant anguish caused by the conflictunfolding in the former Yugoslavia and supports effortsaimed at an urgent solution.We are contributing significantly to the work of theUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  a force thathas helped save thousands of lives and has worked toprevent the intensification of conflict in the areas where it isdeployed.Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 27We support the resolutions of the Security Council onthis subject  and strongly condemn the practice of ""ethniccleansing"" and other war crimes. Consequently  we supportthe establishment of an international tribunal to try thoseallegedly responsible for violating international humanitarianlaw. We particularly condemn the inhuman attacks on thecivilian population in Bosnia and Herzegovina and reaffirmthe need to reach an agreement acceptable to all partiesinvolved  based on the principles of the London Conference.We are deeply concerned particularly about the seriousconsequences that civil and international armed conflictshave on children. We urge the international community asa whole to devote the utmost attention to this seriousproblem and to initiate with the greatest urgency appropriateassistance plans to alleviate the suffering of children especially in situations like the one in Somalia or the formerYugoslavia. This question - like those concerning the family -should be given the greatest attention by organizations suchas the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).With respect to Cyprus  I reiterate our support for aprompt solution to the conflict  and we urge the parties toaccept the plan developed by the Secretary-General’smission of good offices.I also reaffirm our express support for United Nationsresolutions aimed at guaranteeing the territorial integrity ofKuwait and peace and security in the region. We willcontinue to support the recently adopted Security Councildecisions that  in connection with this specific case  demandrespect for the inviolability of the international border - thathave already been defined - and the right of navigationalaccess.As regards South Africa  we welcome  together with therest of the international community  the recently adoptedlegislative measures aimed at guaranteeing free and fairelections next April and establishing the TransitionalExecutive Council. We continue to support the multipartynegotiating process towards a democratic  united and non-racial South Africa. This is another of those world eventsthat are on the point of crystallizing in the next few months and whose importance is really much greater than we couldhave imagined even just a few months ago.I must mention once again the question of the Malvinasislands  just as we did a few weeks ago before the SpecialCommittee on decolonization. I reaffirm Argentina’swell-founded and unequivocal sovereign rights over thoseterritories and over the South Georgia and South Sandwichislands. The peaceful and negotiated recovery of the islandsis a central and permanent issue in our foreign policy.The United Nations Special Committee ondecolonization  at its recent session  adopted  for the firsttime without a vote  a resolution on this question  in whichthe parties are once again urged to start negotiations. Wetherefore stand ready to do so.As I informed the Special Committee  our relations withthe United Kingdom would be excellent but for the conflictin the South Atlantic  where apart from the central disputethere are problems in specific areas. However  within thisoverall picture  there has also been progress in some of thoseareas.We have made progress in reducing the securityrestrictions inherited from the 1982 conflict and we havereached a provisional understanding on fishing for 1993.We now have to negotiate a new agreement - which is beingmade difficult because of certain recent unilateral Britishjurisdictional decisions over the South Georgia and SouthSandwich islands - that must necessarily reflect Argentina’slegitimate decision now to relate its own catch to the actualpotential of the area.As regards oil  there is still an impasse  both because ofthe rejection of a specific proposal for cooperation putforward by Argentina and because of the United Kingdom’spreference for acting unilaterally. We are still convincedthat there is no realistic alternative to cooperation. We aresure that potential investors will also see it that way  becausetheir situation would be highly uncertain and unstable in anyother context.Argentina’s relationship with the islanders is an area inwhich there have been important developments in the lastfew months.Since the last session of the General Assembly  therehave been communications between the inhabitants of theislands and Argentina. I personally have been in touchseveral times with some of them. My Government reiteratesits conviction that it is in everybody’s interest to establishnormal relations between the islands and the continent. Wereaffirm that Argentina and the United Kingdom are the onlyparties to the dispute  but we underline also our willingnessto conduct a dialogue with the inhabitants of the territorybecause they deserve our consideration and respect. We arealso aware of the weight their opinion carries in London.28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe dialogue with the islanders has wide support in mycountry  and is a natural development in the civilized searchfor a solution to the conflict. It is important that theislanders themselves also understand that this is an inevitablestep  because the only realistic alternative is to marchforward together.The recent World Conference in Vienna ratified theuniversal and binding nature of respect for human rights.Today it is no longer possible to claim  as despoticgovernments have in the past  that the treatment States affordtheir citizens is exclusively an internal affair.It is a fact that the principle of absolute sovereignty hasbecome relative and that the international community  actingwithin the framework of the United Nations  has laid thelegal foundations for denouncing violations of human rightswherever they occur and for implementing specific measuresto ensure that human rights can be exercised to the full. Wetherefore support the establishment of the post of HighCommissioner for Human Rights.Furthermore  in the opinion of the ArgentineGovernment  there must be universal and complete freedomof the press  because this is a fundamental guarantee ofrespect for other essential human rights. Whatever excessesthere may be in the exercise of press freedom are nothingcompared with the awful drawbacks of policies that restrictthat freedom.Argentina supports the restructuring of the UnitedNations economic and social system in order to increase itseffectiveness and global credibility in that area.In the field of the environment and development  wecontinue to give high priority to the implementation ofAgenda 21 and the Conventions on climatic change andbiodiversity and to the use of the global environment facilityas a financial mechanism for implementing environmentalprojects in the those and the related areas of marinepollution and the ozone layer.Argentina will participate actively in the InternationalConference on Population and Development to be held in1994. We support the negotiating process now under wayand we agree with the conceptual framework agreed uponfor the programme of action in that field.We shall also participate actively in the World Summitfor Social Development  and we stress the great importanceof the negotiating process and of what is included in theSummit’s agenda.I should like to refer to the deterioration in theOrganization’s financial situation  which is so seriouslyaffecting its regular activities and is endangering the normalfunctioning of peace-keeping operations.Reality tells us that the only way to solve the problemis the timely payment in full of the financial obligations ofMember States. Such payment is a fundamental factor inrestoring the financial soundness of the United Nations  butit is undoubtedly not the only one. We consider that it isindispensable for immediate steps to be taken to make theallocation and use of the Organization’s scarce resourcesmore efficient  thus avoiding administrative disorder andpossible irregularities or substandard management practices.A proper balance between budgetary control and theimplementation of activities will enable us to achieve thefinancial consolidation needed to fulfil the goals set out inthe Charter.In conclusion  we wish to reiterate our firm convictionthat  despite the serious problems that still obtain  we arewitnessing an encouraging development in the principles thatin their time guided the founding fathers of the UnitedNations.Those ideals of universal peace today seem more withinour grasp and in that context the Argentine Republic  ademocratic and peace-loving nation  is genuinely willing tocontribute to strengthening an international system based onlaw and justice  and guaranteed by the United Nations."
"6",249,"ARM",48,1993,"Allow me to congratulateHis Excellency Mr. Insanally on his election to thepresidency of the forty-eighth session of the United NationsGeneral Assembly. Given his talent and experience  I amconfident that he will guide this session to the successfulcompletion of the noble mission entrusted to it by theCharter of the United Nations. I would also like to expressmy appreciation and thanks to his predecessor  Mr. Ganev for the contribution he made to accomplishing the tasks ofthe last session.I wish to take this opportunity to extend my warmwelcome and congratulations to the six States that have beenadmitted to membership of the United Nations over the pastyear.I stand before the Assembly as the Foreign Minister ofa small  land-locked  newly independent country of 3.5million under complete blockade  with no energy resources still not recovered from the devastating earthquake of 1988 flooded by hundred of thousands of refugees fleeing theconflict between Nagorny-Karabakh and Azerbaijan  andunder constant provocation by Azerbaijan to be drawn intothat conflict.I am also the Foreign Minister of the only democracyin the region  an island of stability in a sea of political chaosand turmoil  a country with close to 30 registered politicalparties  a free press and freedom of conscience and religion and with laws guaranteeing civil and political rights andfreedoms. The Government of Armenia has also madeheadway towards establishing a market economy and hastaken several significant steps to integrate its economy intothe global economy. Armenia has moved swiftly in manyareas of reform. Most agricultural land and homes andmany small enterprises have already been privatized  and atax programme  a pricing policy and legislative reform tocreate the legal framework for a free-market economy areeffectively under way. Nevertheless  substantial work willneed to be done if these advances are to contributeeffectively to a successful transition.It is encouraging to see that the United Nations hasrecognized that full integration of the economies in transitioninto the world economy will not only help those economiesbut also have a positive impact on world trade  economicgrowth and development  and is prepared to support theprocess of bringing about economic reform and restructuringthrough its special bodies and specialized agencies.I wish to take this opportunity to convey myGovernment’s deep gratitude to the Secretary-General forestablishing the United Nations - United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) interim office in Armenia.As a result of adverse natural and geopolitical circumstances Armenia is currently in a state of economic and social crisis.We see the importance of short-term assistance in thesetimes of great need  but at the same time are fully aware thatit is the pursuit of long-term goals that will bring Armeniato function at full capacity as a member of the internationalcommunity. We are convinced that the presence of UnitedForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 7Nations specialized agencies in Armenia such as the UnitedNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  theWorld Food Programme (WFP)  the United NationsEnvironment Programme (UNEP)  and the United NationsFund for Population Activities (UNFPA)  providing technicaland advisory assistance and coordination would enhance thedurability of the transition that is well under way.As we and other nations grapple with problems uniqueto each  the collapse of regimes and empires continues tofuel violent conflicts throughout the world. But there is anapparent change in the pattern of international conflicts.Very few wars are fought between nation States any more.The rest are struggles for self-determination turned intobloody conflict and civil war in one and the same nationState. These movements need a forum in which to lodgetheir claims  identify and understand their rights  negotiatewith government authorities  establish just administration oftheir affairs  and peacefully work out realistic political andterritorial arrangements for the future.Now more than ever  it is incumbent upon the UnitedNations to revisit its provision of non-intervention in matterswhich are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction ofMember States  and to define more stringently the extent ofthe impact of a conflict on the peace and security of othernations. Having in clear view the essential role the UnitedNations can play in enhancing peacemaking effortsthroughout the world  we concur with recent proposals inacademic circles that the United Nations transform thenear-moribund Trusteeship Council into a modern clearing-house for self-determination.Under the proposed system  a ""trust territory"" would bethat part of a Member State voluntarily placed intotrusteeship by the Government of that State for the purposeof resolving a self-determination claim under United Nationssupervision without prejudicing the final status of theterritory. We believe that the trusteeship system could savelives and prevent the escalation of a self-determinationstruggle to a devastating civil war  or worse  to a regionalconflict involving other countries.The conflict over Nagorny-Karabakh has claimed thelives of more than 10 000 people and has caused close to amillion innocent people to be uprooted from their homesduring the past five years. This conflict continues tothreaten the security and stability of the whole region. Theinternational community has yet to come to grips with theroot cause of the conflict and devise appropriate measures tofind a peaceful solution.Armenia’s position on the Nagorny-Karabakh conflicthas been clear and consistent since day one. The conflict isbetween the people of Nagorny-Karabakh  who are strivingfor their self-determination  and the Azerbaijani Government which is refusing to address the rights and security concernsof the people of Nagorny-Karabakh.As an interested party  Armenia has advocated anunconditional cease-fire and has fully supported all theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)initiatives. The Government of Armenia sees no alternativeto the peaceful settlement of the Karabakh conflict  than thatwhich can be reached within the framework of the CSCEMinsk Conference.The recent developments of the peace process arepromising. Nagorny-Karabakh has at long last beenrecognized as a party to the conflict and direct talks betweenthe leadership of Nagorny-Karabakh and Azerbaijaniauthorities  mediated by the Russian Federation  havebrought about a cease-fire  which has continued to hold formore than a month now and is unprecedented in thefive-year history of this bloody conflict. On 28 Septemberduring its meeting in Paris  the Minsk Group produced the""Adjusted timetable of urgent steps to implement SecurityCouncil resolutions 822 (1993) and 853 (1993)""  to whichArmenia has given its agreement  and is hopeful that asimilar position will be adopted by the main parties to theconflict  Azerbaijan and Nagorny-Karabakh.There is now a genuine opportunity for peace.Therefore  the convening of the Minsk Conference must notbe delayed. Once peace is established  legal questions  firstand foremost among which is the issue of the status ofNagorny-Karabakh  can be negotiated. The clear position ofthe Government of Armenia is to accept and be gratified byany solution agreed upon between Nagorny-Karabakh andAzerbaijan at the Minsk Conference.The CSCE has an explicit security role in the newworld order  consistent with the provisions of Chapter VIIIof the United Nations Charter. Last May  theSecretary-General of the United Nations and the Chairmanof the CSCE Council agreed on a framework for cooperationand coordination between the United Nations Secretariat andthe CSCE  namely through the regular exchange ofinformation in the fields of early warning  conflictprevention and the promotion of democratic values andhuman rights. The CSCE is also striving to obtain UnitedNations observer status  an initiative which Armenia fullysupports.8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe successful cooperation between the United Nationsand the CSCE over the Nagorny-Karabakh conflict can serveas a case study in how to reconcile  practically  theconflicting claims of regionalism and universalism. Suchcooperation will enhance the role of regional organizationsin conflict prevention  peace-keeping and the peacefulsettlement of disputes.Armenia appreciates the Secretary-General’s report ""AnAgenda for Peace"" which embodies the notions ofpeace-keeping  peacemaking and post-conflict peace--building. History has taught us  however  that developmentis intrinsic to peace  and that the two can no longer bethought of as separate processes. Starvation  poverty andpoor living conditions in many parts of the world loom asserious threats to stability and peace. The United Nations inits commitment to secure peace for all the Earth’sinhabitants must place development high among its priorities.Indeed  it must establish economic and social developmentas guiding principles for the Organization’s activities.Armenia fully supports the Secretary-General’s initiative foran agenda for development and looks forward to contributingto this important milestone towards world peace. Armeniaalso gives its full support to the convocation of the 1995World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen.Today  the proliferation of weapons of mass destructionposes another grave threat to both global and regionalsecurity and stability. Armenia supports the indefiniteextension of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)beyond 1995. The United Nations should work to ensureuniversality and strict compliance with the Convention onthe prohibition of chemical weapons.Development and human rights are also mutuallyinclusive values. There can be no genuine developmentunless systems of thought and government are based onrespect for the full spectrum of the rights of individuals. Itis auspicious that this year coincides with the forty-fifthanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.The spirit of the Declaration and the Vienna WorldConference on Human Rights held last June willundoubtedly deepen the understanding of the significance ofhuman rights for stability  freedom  peace  progress andjustice.It is my Government’s strong conviction that theadoption and implementation of all human rights principlesby nation States will create solid ground for unity andharmony throughout a world which is being transformed andis searching for new constants.For more effective implementation of the principles ofhuman rights we feel it is imperative to establish the post ofhigh commissioner for human rights and a permanentinternational criminal court where cases of gross violationsof human rights and other crimes against humanity aresubmitted and prosecuted.In 1995  the United Nations will celebrate its fiftiethanniversary. In the past 50 years  the Organization hasgrown and has witnessed historic events  in many of whichit has played a considerable role. As the Organization hasentered a period in which it is being called upon to take anincreasingly active guiding role in a changing world  it toomust be prepared to respond effectively to these changes.Armenia supports the call for restructuring the SecurityCouncil that has been placed before the United Nations byits Member States. Because the international community islooking to the Security Council to take a more dynamic rolein the maintenance of international peace  it is necessary thatthe Security Council increase its membership in order that itmay be able to address the issues before it in a morebalanced and equitable way.Improving the United Nations administrativeperformance must also become a top priority at this time.We welcome the current initiatives of the Secretary-Generalto streamline the Organization’s administrative andmanagement structures and procedures to meet the demandsthat are now being placed upon the Organization.As the world seems to have grown accustomed to thedreadful routine of tragic news coming from various regionalhotbeds  it is inspiring to reflect on some of the morepositive reverberations of the end of the cold war  which canbe epitomized by the historic accord between the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel signed recently.It is my privilege to salute the leaders of Israel and the PLOfor taking this courageous step.No less significant are the processes currently in motionin South Africa. Armenia joins the other Member States insupporting the negotiating process there  and believes thatlifting economic sanctions at this time could encourage thepeople of South Africa to take up the task of building a trulyfree and democratic country.In the United Nations  the end of the cold warcontinues to translate into ever closer cooperation betweenits Members. In 1992  as in 1991  despite the large volumeand the diversified nature of the issues examined in theSecurity Council  none of the members of the Councilexercised its right to veto. There is a growing harmony ofForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 9interests among nations that is creating an atmosphere oftrust and cooperation  which are the prerequisites for therealization of the goals envisioned by the founders of theUnited Nations 48 years ago in San Francisco.Indeed  for the first time since its inception  the UnitedNations has been given the opportunity to become what itwas intended to be: a collective security system  with aCharter providing for special forms of cooperation betweensovereign States  designed to ensure peace and prosperitythroughout the world."
"7",282,"ATG",48,1993," In 1965 three ofthe Caribbean’s most outstanding statesmen created aninstitution to foster cooperation and to quicken the pace oftheir countries’ development. Errol Barrow of Barbados Forbes Burnham of Guyana and V.C. Bird of Antigua andBarbuda met at Dickenson Bay  Antigua. There  they signeda historic document creating the Caribbean Free TradeAssociation (CARIFTA).Although the three countries they led were not yetsovereign States  those enlightened statesmen envisioned theemergence of an independent  English-speaking Caribbeancapable of playing a meaningful role in international affairs.The entire Caribbean  beginning in 1492 and continuingthroughout its modern history  had been an object ofinternational intrigue and international competition. Howfitting  then  for that region to help shape world history onceit had taken hold of its own ambitions and aspirations.In 1973  CARIFTA was transformed into a moreextensive institution called the Caribbean Community(CARICOM). Today  exactly 20 years after itsestablishment  all citizens of the 13 countries of CARICOM whether living in the Caribbean or in the diaspora  celebratethis historic moment when a most able son of Guyana iselected to preside over the forty-eighth session of theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations.Your brilliant academic career  your outstandingdiplomatic skills and your warm  personable style ofleadership assured your unanimous election. Antiguans andBarbudans rejoice with you and your country  and mydelegation pledges its fullest support and cooperation.My delegation is appreciative of the role played by thenon-English-speaking countries that are members of theLatin American and Caribbean Group of States  whose fullsupport was necessary to achieve this noble objective. The12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session33 States of the region have quietly made tremendousprogress  in this and other forums  in strengthening thebonds of cooperation and friendship that bind us. Andthough we are divided on a single but important trade issue we expect that an amicable solution will shortly be found tothe satisfaction of both sides.During the past year  our regional group of Statesworked together to find a solution to the Haitian crisis. Thedelegations of Brazil and Venezuela  regional members ofthe Security Council  made every attempt to include theentire region in the Council’s decision-making process as itpertained to Haiti  another regional member. The UnitedStates must also be congratulated in that regard.The peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean noweagerly await the return of President Aristide to Haiti on 30October three weeks from today  when history will reverseitself. Despite the violence and the dilatory tactics employedby the military leaders in Haiti  Antigua and Barbuda isconfident that the forces of good will  decency anddemocracy will prevail.I wish to point out that no previous Security Councilembargo intended to compel compliance with the will of theinternational community was ever as swiftly effective as wasthe embargo imposed on the illegitimate regime in Haiti.My delegation regards this episode as a turning-point in thehistory of Security Council actions to safeguard internationalpeace and security.Threats to international peace and security  up until theSecurity Council action on Haiti  have been narrowly definedas the use of force by one sovereign State against another or some form of violent confrontation between or amongStates. A small State like mine  incapable of waging warand no longer an object of conquest  defines internationalpeace and security more broadly.Grinding poverty and the resultant ecological disasterwhich characterize Haiti are threats to the peace and securityof that sovereign State and its neighbours. Not force  notviolent threats  but poverty and its attendant consequencesthreaten international peace and security. Antigua andBarbuda  a small island State and an ally of democracy andlegitimacy in the Americas and certainly in this forum  takesgreat pride in knowing that all of CARICOM pressed thiscause here at the United Nations and elsewhere and thatHaiti can count on us never to relent.Antigua and Barbuda will never relent in its struggleagainst illegal drug trafficking  either. Located between thesuppliers of the South and the markets of the North  we havebeen thrust by geography into the battle against this scourge.We pledge our slender resources in the global struggleagainst this global enemy.Apartheid  another global enemy  is in its death throes.My small country takes pride in knowing that our voice hashelped to topple that evil system in South Africa. From themoment of our independence 12 years ago  in 1981  mysmall country has supported the legitimate aspirations ofoppressed peoples everywhere  but especially those of themajority population in South Africa.In April of next year  when democratic elections areheld to choose a representative government in South Africa Antigua and Barbuda will also be able to celebrate a victoryof right over wrong  of democratic ideals over dictatorship of good over evil. The international community must beginpreparing to come to the assistance of an anaemic SouthAfrica whose need for economic good health in apost-apartheid world is even now apparent.In April of next year  as apartheid suffers its finaldefeat  the Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States will convenein Barbados. This Conference is the first test of the will ofthe international community since the Earth Summitconvened in Rio last June. You will recall  Mr. President that the most significant conclusion of last year’s EarthSummit was the determination that industrial civilization isfundamentally flawed.Development based on the current model ofconsumption  distribution and disposal practised by thedeveloped world is unsustainable. Abundant quantities ofharmful gases and toxins  emitted into the atmosphere  arealtering our global environment  and fatal consequences havebeen forecast for the Earth’s climate  its biodiverse flora andfauna  its agriculture  all living animals and human healthand well-being.It should be borne in mind that while the contributionby small island States to climate change  global warming andsea-level rise is zero  the effects of climate change  globalwarming and sea-level rise will reduce small island Stateslike mine to zero. Our very existence is at stake; our peaceand security are threatened by the actions of large andwealthy States whose presumptions about the Earth’sresources need to be completely revised.The Barbados Conference will articulate a programmeof action intended to eliminate these man-induced  loomingcatastrophes and to achieve sustainable developmentbeginning in small island States. The internationalForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 13community’s support and good will are required ifsustainable development is to be made real and disaster is tobe prevented.Small island States are the foot-soldiers in this battle tosave the planet. We will be the first casualties but we willnot be the last if drastic changes are not quickly broughtabout in the developed world.On Earth’s last uninhabited continent  disaster can alsobe avoided. Antarctica  a pristine and icy wilderness whosewaters abound with the most significant link in the oceans’food chain  whose winds control the earth’s weather systems whose tundras conceal the secrets of the Earth’s past  andwhose icebergs determine sea-levels world wide  must neverbecome the possession of large States alone. Antigua andBarbuda will never acknowledge sovereignty over Antarcticaby any State.In fact  working alongside like-minded delegations  wewill continue to press for a mining and oil exploration banin perpetuity  certain that any other arrangement will lead toa precipitation of ecological decline worldwide  to thedetriment of small island States among others. In our view Antarctica must be declared a world park  control overwhich should be exercised by our world body.The world’s many peoples must learn to live inharmony with the Earth’s environment and peaceably amongourselves. Ethnic strife and wars have taken more lives inthe last year than comprise the entire population of mycountry and several other CARICOM States combined. Allmultiracial and multi-ethnic societies must learn to settlehistoric and current rivalries peacefully; when they fail to doso  resources which could well be spent on development arenecessarily diverted to peace-keeping.The peace-keeping missions now undertaken by theUnited Nations cost more than $3.5 billion annually; as aconsequence  development assistance is severely restricted.Peaceful States like mine therefore have an economicinterest in seeing a decline in the need for peace-keeping.Sadly  it is anticipated that more civil strife and many moreethnic and religious conflicts will occur in the near futureand that the United Nations will be called on to help.My delegation therefore applauds Liechtenstein for therole it has decided to play in this forum. That smallEuropean State is attempting to find a structured solution tothe unyielding demand by rival groups within States for ameasure of self-determination. The size of a country bearsno relation to the intellectual capacity of its statesmen or toits capacity for generating great ideas. Antigua and Barbudawill work alongside this small State in promoting apermanent solution to destructive ethnic conflicts withinStates.The world’s indigenous peoples must also findpermanent protection  and the injustices they have longendured must also quickly cease. Towards that end  ourUnited Nations declared 1993 the International Year of theWorld’s Indigenous People. It is not yet clear just howmuch impact the declaration has had; a fund has beenestablished in the Americas to support the indigenouspeoples of my region  and Brazil and Venezuela have showncourage in their support for the Yanomami  an Amazonianforest people.Antigua and Barbuda also supports the establishment ofan annual International Day of the World’s IndigenousPeople. Having lost the indigenous Arawaks and Caribs ofAntigua and Barbuda  beginning in 1492  my country isduty-bound to ensure that powerless indigenous people theworld over  who have inhabited the lands of their ancestorsfor many generations  are adequately remembered andprotected by our United Nations.The people of Antigua and Barbuda condemn theperpetrators of the fierce conflict which continues to rage inBosnia and Herzegovina  and we deplore the attacks onUnited Nations peace-keepers in Somalia as much as weabhor the destructive campaign waged by mercenaries inAngola. The civil wars in Liberia and Mozambique arebrutish and unyielding  and the civil strife which has eruptedin Georgia will likely match both in ferocity anddestructiveness.In the Middle East  the slow trickle of peace has turnedinto a gushing stream with many tributaries. It is our hopethat the Israelis and until the Palestinians will be able to findthe source of a lasting flow of peace. Until Israel is allowedto exist within secure borders and until the Palestiniansachieve a sovereign State of their own  peace in that regionmay slowly evaporate.We rejoice at the wave of peace which has engulfedLebanon. Its very industrious citizens  flung far and wide bya conflict that seemed unending  can now give back to theirhomeland some of the talent and wealth which their richculture bestowed upon them. Lebanon can surely count onits prodigious sons and daughters in the diaspora for everyassistance; their generosity is as legendary as their love fortheir old country.We welcome the finalization of the demarcation of theboundary between Kuwait and Iraq which was accomplished14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionby the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Commission in May 1993.We also welcome the adoption by the Security Council ofresolution 833 (1993) in which it guaranteed the inviolabilityof the boundary between the two States. This guaranteeshall serve as a deterrent against future conflict betweenthese two neighbours while enhancing stability and securityin the region.My people celebrate with the countries of the CentralAmerican region as peace rains down upon them. If futurecivil wars are to be prevented  however  the economicsystems which prevail in Central America must become farmore inclusive. In distributing wealth  methods must befound to direct more than a trickle towards the poor.We note that the impoverishment of Cuba’s people isdue overwhelmingly to exogenous circumstances  and so oursympathies lie with the people of this sister Caribbean State.In the early decades of this century  Cubans welcomed poorworkers from neighbouring Antigua to their shores. Today standing in solidarity with the Cuban people  Antiguans andBarbudans seek a speedy end to their suffering.I would be remiss in my duty  as I conclude  if I didnot convey to the outgoing President  Mr. Stoyan Ganev ofBulgaria  the gratitude of my delegation for the importantrole he played during the preceding session of the GeneralAssembly. It was under his watch that six new Membersjoined our Organization. I welcome to membership theCzech Republic  the Republic of Slovakia  Eritrea  Monaco The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  and Andorra.Their presence greatly enhances our institution’s legitimateclaim of universality  as membership climbs to 184.In that regard  my delegation would note that Antiguaand Barbuda supports a manageable enlargement of theSecurity Council to reflect the new realities. However  ourdelegation will not join any consensus on enlargement if thequalifying criteria for new membership implicitly require acertain level of wealth and/or a certain population size.Although we harbour no ambitions to sit on the SecurityCouncil  my small country cannot agree to be excluded fromthe Council in perpetuity. Such exclusion would make usless sovereign than larger States.The moral conscience of our institution can best bearticulated frequently by small States with no materialinterest in the outcome of disputes. But even moreimportant is the fact that our own survival requires us tocontribute to the construction of a new world order that willhave its basis in Security Council decision-making. Wewish merely to retain our option  for we know not whatfuture generations will encounter.My delegation concludes by recalling that on 31 March1918 - 75 years ago - another generation of Antiguans andBarbudans challenged an unconscionable system ofexploitation that left us materially impoverished. Ourgrandmothers and grandfathers  then youthful and vigorous were determined to fashion for themselves and their progenya future that would be superior to their own inheritance. In1918  brutality was the response to their legitimate cry forworkers’ rights.Twenty years later - in 1938 - a sympatheticCommission was to determine that the deplorable conditionsthen extant in my country required massive infusions ofpublic finance and good will in order to achieve a markedturn-around. When  in 1943 - 50 years ago  and 25 yearsafter the 1918 revolt - a nationalist named V. C. Bird pickedup the mantle of leadership of the workers’ organization  mysmall country began its metamorphosis in earnest.Seventy-five years after March 1918  the Antigua andBarbuda that has evolved bears no resemblance to theAntigua and Barbuda that history left behind. WhenV. C. Bird and his trade-union colleagues quickened ourstride towards freedom and an improved material condition beginning in 1943  they had a vision of an Antigua andBarbuda which  50 years later  has become virtual reality.As V. C. Bird and his generation pass the mantle ofleadership to their successor generation  our old men havevisions  and our young women have dreams. Antiguans andBarbudans are aware that there are detractors abroad whomay wish to see our freedom snatched from us. We havepaid a price for our freedom  which we will for ever defend.And we are aware of the role played by the United Nationsand international law in safeguarding the sovereignty ofsmall States.We shall therefore for ever remain wedded tomultilateral institutions like the Caribbean Community  theOrganization of East Caribbean States  the Organization ofAmerican States  the Commonwealth and this body - theUnited Nations - which  together  strengthen our sovereignty.Multilateralism is the greatest ally of our freedom  and theUnited Nations the greatest guarantor.As Antiguans and Barbudans recall the courage of theheroes of 1918  we pledge never again - never again - toallow injustice and brute force to raise their ugly heads inour beautiful  beloved Antigua and Barbuda. My generationwill continue to do all that is necessary to bequeath to futuregenerations a peaceful legacy  where justice rules  ignoranceis banished  and legitimate leadership springs from thepeople’s choice. That is our pledge."
"8",329,"AUS",48,1993,"I warmly congratulateAmbassador Insanally  on his election as President of theforty-eighth session of the General Assembly. As a fellowCommonwealth member with Guyana  Australia is verypleased to serve in the Assembly under his presidency.This session of the General Assembly will deal with aparticularly heavy and important agenda. It will do so at atime when hopes for  and expectations of  the UnitedNations have never been greater - but when  at the sametime  many doubts have been raised about the capacity of theUnited Nations system to cope. We will be relying verymuch  Mr. President  on your wisdom and your experienceas you preside over our deliberations.The world is a rather less happy place than we allhoped it would be after the end of the cold war. Economicand social deprivation continues to be a harsh daily realityfor many of our countries and our peoples. Not even themost advanced countries are immune. The developedWestern economies are limping  with low growth rates historically high unemployment rates  increasing disparitiesas a result between rich and poor  and a continuing inabilityso far to reach agreement - either between themselves orwith the rest of the world’s trading nations - about theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade liberalizationmeasures so necessary to give a new kick-start to worldtrade and economic growth.In the non-Western world  rates of growth have beenextraordinarily uneven. The spectacular advance in someregions  in particular East Asia  has been in stark contrast tothe continuing terrible deprivation and poverty in others.Some States have simply been unable to cope with explodinginternal economic  political and social problems  and for allpractical purposes have collapsed  leaving the internationalcommunity to respond  somehow  to the humanitarian crisesthat have followed so often.In security terms  the end of the cold war has seen theend of the super-Power nuclear-arms race and has relievedus of the immediate threat of nuclear devastation. We haveseen major achievements in nuclear-arms reduction; and forthe first time in the history of the nuclear age acomprehensive test-ban treaty  which would ban all nucleartests in all environments for all time  seems within ourreach. We could help to make it even more so by adoptingby consensus a resolution in this Assembly supporting thenegotiation of that treaty. A very great deal  of course depends on the current moratorium on all nuclear testingbeing maintained. We in Australia very strongly supportwhat President Clinton said in that respect this morning.This year we signed at last  after 20 years ofnegotiation  the chemical weapons Convention. But muchremains to be done to bring this and other instruments intoeffective operation. And there are still too many countriesunwilling to submit themselves to the disciplines  moreimportant and more necessary now than ever  of the nuclearnon-proliferation Treaty.The threat of conflicts between States has certainly notdiminished with the end of the cold war. If anything  theremoval of the cold-war gridlock - the discipline imposed bythe super-Powers on each other and their respectivesupporters - has created more room than ever for States tomanoeuvre. Some are beginning to do so  and some arebound to seek to do so in the future. Some of the emergingeconomic Powers have yet to acquire political or militaryprofiles commensurate with their new wealth  and theprocess of adjustment certainly has ample potential togenerate regional tensions. Should those tensions escalateinto conflict  the unhappy reality is that proliferation of moresophisticated conventional weapons and proliferation of thecapacity to develop weapons of mass destruction make anyprospect of major regional conflict an alarming one for theworld as a whole.The release of cold-war pressures has been associatedwith another major new development of security concernwith which we are all now disturbingly familiar: theresurgence of ethno-nationalism  often taking a violent form.Some ethnic groups are being prepared to pursue theirclaims for self-determination within the framework ofexisting States  arguing essentially for minority human rightsprotection - claims of right which  on first principles  weshould all be prepared to acknowledge and support. Butmany other such groups have made clear that they will besatisfied by nothing less than their nations becoming States causing the fragmentation of existing States in the process and creating some very real dilemmas for the internationalcommunity as a result. Again  the proliferating availabilityof weaponry of every degree of sophistication has given asharp new edge to these concerns.Looking out upon a world with all these characteristics it is easy to be pessimistic and fatalistic. But I do not thinkwe should retreat into that habit of mind. For everythingthat has gone wrong over the last few years  there issomething else that has gone right. To match against theawful continuing tragedy in the former Yugoslavia  we have for example  this month’s peace agreement in the MiddleEast - of course  only the first step in what remains a longjourney  but an enormously encouraging onenotwithstanding. And to match against the continuing chaosand uncertainty in Somalia  and the at best very limitedsuccess of the United Nations operation there  we have nowthe unquestioned success of the United Nations operation inCambodia - and the end at last to more than 20 years ofwhat has been a real twentieth-century tragedy involvingbloody war  civil war  genocide  invasion and civil waragain.A terrible conflict continues in Angola  but peace is athand at last in Mozambique; and in South Africa the finaldeath of apartheid is imminent  as testified last week in thisplace by Nelson Mandela. Military regimes have given wayto democratic ones throughout Latin America. Manyproblems remain to be solved in the former Soviet Union but Governments that can credibly claim to reflect the willof their peoples are in place throughout Central and EasternEurope. The military regime in Myanmar  or Burma continues to resist the obvious mood of its people for libertyand democracy  but elsewhere in the region traditionallymonolithic government structures - driven in many cases byeconomic imperatives - are beginning to show signs offlexibility and responsiveness.But while I do not believe that we should be undulypessimistic or fatalistic about the condition of the worldaround us  nor can we afford to be complacent. There ismuch more that we can and should be doing to reinforce andstrengthen the international community’s capacity to governitself better  and in particular to better guarantee themaintenance of peace and security in the post-cold-warworld. It is on this subject - the role of the United Nationsand the international community generally in securing peacein the world of the 1990s and beyond that I want specificallyto focus my remarks today.A little over a year ago  following a unique meeting ofthe Security Council  Secretary-General Boutros-Ghalipublished ""An Agenda for Peace"". It was and remains aremarkable document  one which poses most of the questionswe need to address if we are to have a fair chance ofmaintaining international peace and security in the world oftoday and the foreseeable future. Since that time  aworldwide debate has taken place on the issues described in""An Agenda for Peace""  which has involved not onlyGovernments and officials  but has reached out to embraceForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 25universities  foundations  non-governmental organizationsand many organs of the public media as well. This debategenerated resolutions at the last session of the GeneralAssembly  several worthwhile changes to some proceduresand structures within the Secretariat  and the prospect offurther changes to come.It cannot be said  however  that the issues raised by""An Agenda for Peace"" are now all settled  either in theoryor in practice. We still do not have even a completely clearand consistent shared vocabulary to define the ways in whichit is possible for the United Nations and other organs of theinternational community to respond to security problems:""peacemaking""  for example  means different things still todifferent people; so do ""preventive diplomacy"" and ""peacebuilding""; the conceptual boundary between ""peace-keeping""on the one hand and ""peace enforcement"" on the other is notdrawn in the same way by everyone who uses these terms.Nor do we seem yet to have clear and universalagreement even as to the kind of problems which justify asecurity response by the international community. Shouldwe recognize  for example  a humanitarian right ofintervention and  if so  in what circumstances and to whatextent? When does an economic or social problem becomethe kind of security problem which justifies the mobilizationof the response strategies spelt out in Chapters VI and VIIof the United Nations Charter?Even when it comes to applying a very familiarresponse to a new problem - for example  establishing apeace-keeping operation like the 30 which have now beeninitiated since 1946 - there does not yet seem to have beendeveloped a commonly accepted check list of criteria toguide decision-makers in determining when precisely theoperation should be set in train  how it should be structured managed and resourced  or how long it should continue.Every situation  of course  has its own characteristics  but isit really necessary for decisions on these matters by theSecurity Council or others to be made on so evidently adhoc a basis?When it comes to thinking about how the UnitedNations - and others in the international community including regional organizations - might best be structured organized  managed and funded to most effectively addressthe international peace and security agenda  it is not clear tome that we have yet heard the last word in that debate.An extraordinary amount has been achieved in thetumultuous period since 1989 in responding to the newdemands and challenges that have been unceasingly hurledat the United Nations  but a good deal more remains to bedone if the United Nations in particular  the only fullyempowered body with global membership that we have  isto be as effective as we would all want it to be.It is much easier  of course  to ask all these questionsthan to answer them. Identifying problems is always easierthan defining acceptable solutions. But I believe that we allhave a responsibility to each other and the internationalcommunity to try to answer these questions and to keep onworking away at the answers until we find common ground.So it is in that spirit that I put before the Assembly today adetailed study of these questions  which tries to answer themin a way which might help us find a little more of thatcommon ground.The study  in the form of a book entitled Cooperatingfor Peace  has been distributed  I hope  to delegations as Ispeak. I do not pretend for a moment that this says the lastword on any of the enormously complex and sensitive issueswith which it deals. It is simply an Australian contributionto the debate which was so thoughtfully and constructivelyinitiated by the Secretary-General last year.The study seeks to do three things in particular. First it suggests ways of bringing a little more clarity - to theextent this is presently lacking - into the concepts andvocabulary that we use in defining security problems defining possible responses and matching responses toproblems. Secondly  it suggests specific criteria that mightbe applied by decision-makers in deciding what  if any response is appropriate to a particular new security problem.And  thirdly  it suggests a priority list of areas in whichfurther United Nations reform might usefully be pursued. Inthe short time that remains to me I shall try to give a quick outline sketch of what we are trying to say in each of theserespects.First of all  on the issue of concepts and terminology it is perhaps worth making the point at the outset that this isnot just something for academics to wrangle about. Itmatters in practice. If decision-makers do not share thesame basic way of looking at issues and the same basicvocabulary in defining them  there is a very real risk thatthey will talk past each other - or  at the very least  find itvery much harder to produce responses which are timely properly graduated  effective in practice  affordable andbroadly consistent from one case to the next.Just as importantly  the choice of words can sometimessignificantly influence the way in which we think aboutmatters of substance. To give just one example: If we use as many people still do  the expression ""peace-making"" todescribe military enforcement action  then  simply becausethis is such an innocuous and constructive soundingexpression  there is a danger that we may over time becomea little more relaxed than we should be about taking suchaction. It is much better  I suggest  to confine the expression""peace-making"" to diplomatic-type activity to resolve conflictand to reserve the expression ""peace enforcement"" todescribe the always dangerous  always messy  and whatshould always be the last-resort  activity of applying militaryforce.In the study we define security problems  in more orless escalating order of seriousness  as ""emerging threats"" ""disputes""  ""armed conflicts"" and ""other major securitycrises."" We make the point that security is not strictly orsolely a military concept and that threats to security  asmany speakers in the general debate have already said  canthese days come very much from factors such as explodingpopulation pressures  environmental degradation  massinvoluntary movements of people and the illicit narcoticstrade  among other things.Equally  we define possible responses to securityproblems  again in escalating order of severity  in terms of""peace- building "" ""preventive diplomacy "" ""preventivedeployment "" ""peace- making "" ""peace-keeping "" ""sanctions""and ""peace enforcement."" We are at pains to emphasize thatit is only as a last resort that security solutions should beseen as coming out of the barrel of a gun. We give muchmore emphasis than has been common elsewhere to theconcept of ""peace-building "" which we define in the study asextending not just to post-conflict economic developmentand institution-building strategies  but to a whole variety ofpreventive strategies  both within particular countries and inthe form of international treaty-type régimes addressing bothmilitary and non-military threats to security.In defining criteria for embarking on peace operations -whether peace-keeping or peace enforcement - the mostcrucial consideration is that there be a clearminded focus onthe objectives of the exercise and the likely effectiveness ofthe operation in achieving those objectives. No operationsof this kind should ever be embarked upon for the sake ofbeing seen to be doing something. Although it is not alwayspossible to analyse or predict with certainty  it should alwaysbe possible to avoid embarking on operations which aremanifestly likely to be ineffective and which  as such  put atrisk the most crucial United Nations resource of all  itscredibility.In the case of peace-keeping we suggest in Cooperatingfor Peace that there are seven basic conditions for ensuringan effective operation: clear and achievable goals; adequateresources; close coordination of peace-keeping with anyongoing peacemaking activity; a capacity to be and to beseen to be absolutely impartial as between the parties whohave been in conflict; a significant degree of local supportfor the peace-keepers; evident support for the operation fromexternal Powers that may have been involved previously insupporting one side or the other; and a ""signposted exit"" that is  a clearly designated termination point  or set oftermination criteria.When it comes to peace-enforcement operations  oursuggested criteria for determining involvement are quitecomplex and vary according to whether one is talking aboutan operation in response to cross-border aggression  as withIraq and Kuwait; about one in support of peace-keepingoperations  the basic rationale for United Nationsinvolvement in Bosnia-Herzegovina; or about peaceenforcement in support of humanitarian objectives  as inSomalia. Without going into all the necessary detail now  Ithink the basic considerations always come down to thefollowing: widespread international support; clear andachievable goals; adequate total resources to meet thosegoals; and clearly defined termination or review points.If the United Nations is to play with maximumeffectiveness the central role it needs to play in maintaininginternational peace and security  then further change  furtherreform in the United Nations system  really is necessary.Some of that change is bound to be painful for some people but that is the way of change. Putting it simply and starkly:Unless the United Nations develops a comprehensivecapacity to address today’s and tomorrow’s problems - notyesterday’s - there is a very real risk of the United Nationsgradually losing  with Governments and peoples around theworld  the credibility it needs to survive.In the study we identify a number of priority areas forchange. The first is to restructure the Secretariat to ensurethat the Secretary-General has an effective chain ofcommand exercising authority over major United Nationsoperations and to consolidate and coordinate in a moreorderly and manageable way the present sprawl ofdepartments and agencies. We support the proposal that theSecretary-General create a new senior structure at UnitedNations Headquarters under which he would have fourDeputy Secretaries-General responsible  respectively  forpeace and security  economic and social operations humanitarian operations and administration and management.Each such Deputy Secretary-General would have fullexecutive responsibility for the operational issues fallingwithin his or her portfolio  subject only to direction by theSecretary-General. This would be a big change  and it is notthe first time it has been proposed  but it is the one that more than anything else  would create the conditions formore orderly and effective management throughout theUnited Nations system.The second priority need is to resolve once and for allthe United Nations critical funding problem. Variousadventurous ideas have been canvassed for externalfunding - money coming from sources other than MemberStates - and we suggest that at least one of those ideas namely  a small levy on international airline travel  befurther explored. But overwhelmingly  of course  theproblem is one that has been created by Member States including the richest of our number  and it is entirely withinour ability to resolve by meeting our assessed contributionsfor regular budgets and peace operations in full and on time.It is an abuse of good management principles and of basiccommon sense to be forcing the Secretary-General to spendso much of his time pleading for debts to be honoured. Inthat respect I echo the sentiments expressed a few minutesago by Mrs. Brundtland.If the bulk of current arrears were to be paid by the endof this year  the United Nations finances would be in a quitehealthy position  with the Working Capital Fund  the Peace-keeping Reserve Fund and the Special Account allreplenished and the Organization in a position to meet alloutstanding troop-contribution costs.The third priority is to improve the management ofpeace operations  both at Headquarters and in the field.Some very significant and useful steps have already beentaken in this regard in the context of the creation of the newDepartment of Peace-keeping Operations  but more remainsto be done  including in particular the development over timeof a properly constituted General Staff to plan and managethe military dimensions of such operations.The fourth priority is to give special attention to themachinery of preventive diplomacy  again both atHeadquarters and in the field. These efforts have beenlargely ad hoc in the past  although the Department ofPolitical Affairs is gradually building a core of appropriateexpertise. Quite apart from anything else  there is anoverwhelming cost advantage in doing more to stop disputesbecoming armed conflicts. We estimate the cost of keeping100 well-qualified  experienced practitioners of preventivediplomacy in the field for a year to be $21 million; comparethat with this year’s peace operations budget of $3.7 billion -and compare it  moreover  with the $70 billion that it isestimated to have cost the United Nations coalition to fightthe six-week Gulf war.The fifth priority is to rethink the whole system ofhumanitarian relief coordination. Despite advances that havebeen made with the creation of the Department ofHumanitarian Affairs  we think some basic structuralproblems remain. We propose that they be addressed in aradical way by the creation of a new disaster-responseagency  combining the relief and basic rehabilitationfunctions of the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  the United NationsChildren’s Fund (UNICEF)  and the World Food Programme(WFP)  which would work in turn directly to the suggestedDeputy Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs.The sixth priority  as we see it  is to take various stepsto raise the profile within the United Nations system ofpeace-building. This is  after all  the point of intersectionbetween the Organization’s peace and security role and itseconomic and social role  and it should be given recognitionand emphasis as such. The pursuit of peace and security hasto include the satisfaction of basic human needs  as well asthe direct prevention  containment and settlement of armedconflict. Much of the United Nations system is in factalready concerned with peace- building in the form ofactivities such as international law-making  disarmament economic and social advancement  sustainable development democratization and institution building. But much morecan be done  organizationally  to link these activitiestogether  to recognize their security significance  and toensure that they are pursued with a sense of commonpurpose.The remaining priority  a very large subject in itself  aswe all know  is to regenerate the Security Council - notbecause it is now working ineffectively  but because itsmanifest lack of representativeness is beginning to impactupon its legitimacy. The Security Council is the linchpin ofthe whole United Nations peace and security system  and itis in no one’s interest that its credibility should be allowedto gradually erode. The outstanding questions about the sizeand shape of the Council should certainly be resolved by thetime of the United Nations fiftieth anniversary in 1995.This  indeed  remains an ideal target date for theachievement of a whole range of necessary organizationalreforms.Running right through the study - and underlying all thesuggestions we have been making about structure andprocess - is a single sustaining idea  that of cooperativesecurity. This embraces two perhaps rather more familiarideas  common security and collective security. But theoverall flavour of cooperative security can perhaps best becaptured by describing it  in a little more detail  as anapproach that emphasizes reassurance rather than deterrence;that is inclusive rather than exclusive; that favoursmultilateralism over unilateralism or bilateralism; that doesnot rank military solutions over non-military ones; thatassumes that States are the principal actors in the securitysystem  but also accepts that non-State actors have animportant role to play; that does not particularly emphasizethe creation of formal security institutions but does not rejectthem either; and that above all stresses the value of creatinghabits of dialogue.A good deal of the spirit of cooperative security is infact to be found in the Charter of the United Nations.Paragraph 4 of Article 1  a provision much neglected in thepast  designates the United Nations as a ""centre forharmonizing the actions of nations"" - not the sentiments ofnations  but the actions of nations. In Articles 55 and 56Member States pledge themselves to create the""conditions of stability and well-being which arenecessary for peaceful and friendly relations amongnations"".Underscored in that context are the promotion of higherstandards of living  the solution of economic and socialproblems and respect for human rights.Too often during the cold war we looked past theseobligations and concerns  because we were preoccupied withmilitary means of survival. But the threats that concerned usthen no longer exist; and what was written in San Francisco before the cold war froze our capacity to deal with manyother kinds of threats to security  should now be seen as acompelling guide.Our survival in the 1990s and beyond will depend onour developing a new understanding of what constitutessecurity and what contributes to it. It will depend on ourcapacity to think clearly about how to react to new securityproblems as they arise. It will depend on our willingness torethink and to reshape our institutions  including the UnitedNations  so that they can cope with new realities. But above all  it will depend on our all developing and sustaininga real commitment to cooperating for peace."
"9",376,"AUT",48,1993,"Ishould like to begin my statement by expressing my mostsincere condolences to the victims of the terrible disasterwhich has taken place in India and to the Indian population.Please allow me first of all to congratulate you Mr. President  on your election to your important office. Iknow that your many years of experience as your country’sPermanent Representative at the United Nations and youruniversally admired expertise will greatly enhance thedeliberations of this body.Since the Gulf War the United Nations - whether inmediating among warring factions or in saving lives inwar-torn areas - has been more than ever at the centre ofworld politics  with its tireless struggle for sustainabledevelopment  its daily fight to protect human rights and itsactive peace-keeping. In Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  theinternational community has a United NationsSecretary-General committed to the difficult task of adaptingthe Organization to a much-altered world political climateand of strengthening it to face the new challenges ahead. Ihave great respect for his incisive judgement and tirelessservice which provided us with his visionary report ""AnAgenda for Peace"".The Secretary-General’s first official visit to Austrialast June gave us an opportunity to discuss the most pressingchallenges facing the United Nations in the post-communistera. They have special importance for Vienna as one of thethree official seats of the Organization. We would like tosee an Organization whose structure  management andfinancing enable it to fulfil the responsibilities entrusted toit in the Charter. In this context we have taken note withsatisfaction of the Secretary-General’s assurance tostrengthen the United Nations Office at Vienna.One of the United Nation’s most important tasks is tosafeguard human rights. The Organization’s internationalefforts in this area have saved human lives  brought aboutthe release of prisoners  prevented torture  helped to locatemissing persons  promoted health and literacy programmesand safeguarded the rights of displaced persons and refugees.In June this year my country had the honour to hostthousands of delegates and representatives ofnon-governmental organizations in Vienna at one of the mostsignificant events in this field: the World Conference onHuman Rights.I should like to take this opportunity to thank onceagain all participants for their constructive cooperation and8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioncommitment and for their valuable support they gave me asPresident of the Conference. It was the active collaborationof the participating States and the effective support of theUnited Nations Secretariat  under the AssistantSecretary-General Fall  that made the Conference such aresounding success  one that would not have been possiblewithout the committed participation of the non-governmentalorganizations  which sent more than 2 700 representatives tothe World Conference. Never before have so manyhuman-rights organizations been involved to such an extent at all levels  in the events of such a major internationalConference as was the case at Vienna.With the final document of the Conference  the ViennaDeclaration and Programme of Action  the internationalcommunity has adopted a document of major significance.It is a forward-looking  action-based platform  which notonly strengthens basic principles but also represents animportant advance in the protection of human rights - allhuman rights - world wide. The document affirms theuniversal character of human rights and the principle that theprotection of human rights is a legitimate concern not onlyof individuals and States but also of the entire internationalcommunity. It establishes a link between human rights democracy and development and underscores the specialresponsibility of States to take concerted measures to protectparticularly vulnerable groups in society. It calls for astrengthening of the United Nations Human Rights Centreand for increasing its resources so that it can effectivelymeet rising demands.When the report of the World Conference comes up fordiscussion before the General Assembly in the weeks ahead we must do more than complacently acknowledge itsaccomplishments. The results of the World Conferenceshould be translated into concrete action in all areas  fromthe rights of women and children to the integration of thehandicapped  the plight of indigenous peoples and the rightsof minorities to the right to development. Such newelements as a High Commissioner for Human Rights or aDecade for Human Rights must also be among the decisionsof this session of the General Assembly. Withoutunderemphasizing other elements of the Conference’soutcome  I note that the recommendation to create an officeof High Commissioner for Human Rights has beenhighlighted by some eminent speakers  among them UnitedStates President Clinton  the Foreign Minister of the RussianFederation  Mr. Kozyrev  and the Norwegian Prime Minister Mrs. Brundtland.Around the world  we are coming to realize that activeprotection of minorities is an elementary part of the politicaland social stability of the countries in which they live  aninsurance against regional conflicts. In this spirit  the Statesmeeting at Vienna reaffirmed their commitment to theDeclaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to Nationalor Ethnic  Religious and Linguistic Minorities  adopted at theforty-seventh session of the General Assembly.As a major media event  the Conference alsocontributed greatly to sensitizing the public around the worldto the issue of human rights. In Vienna the humandimension - or  as the United Nations Secretary-General sofittingly called it  the ""irreducible human element"" - founda firm place on the international political agenda. This hasgiven rise to great expectation among our citizenry and in allof us. It is incumbent upon the members of the internationalcommunity to keep the promises made in the ViennaDeclaration and Programme of Action  for  in the end  thesuccess of the Vienna Human Rights Conference will bemeasured by whether it was able to reverse the general trendand build communities which provide the individual with adecent human existence complete with civil  political economic  social and cultural rights. We have here goalsthat will have a global impact on the evolution of humanity even if their implementation is only in the incipient stage.In the past 12 months the situation in the Balkans hasdeteriorated dramatically. The tireless efforts of theSecretary-General and the peace mediators in Geneva havenot yet been able to end the fighting or bring about concreteprospects for a just and peaceful solution in keeping with thevalues enshrined in the United Nations Charter and in theNovember 1990 Paris Charter. Despite tremendousachievements by the High Commissioner for Refugees andother humanitarian organizations  and the many thousands oftroops in the service of the United Nations Protection Force(UNPROFOR)  the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina continuesto claim thousands of lives.Thus far over 200 000 people have been killed  andanother 2 million have been driven from their homes orforced to flee. Entire towns and districts lie in ruins.Several cities have been declared safe areas by the UnitedNations  but life within them has still not returned to normal.Although the violation of the independence and territorialintegrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina  and of human rights bythe Serbian side  was condemned by the Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) as early asApril of last year  and ""ethnic cleansing"" has come under theharshest criticism in the world community  there has stillbeen no progress in halting that abominable practice. Themost serious violations of human rights continue to be theorder of the day. In the meantime  there is already evidenceForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 9that the cruel methods used by the aggressor have beenemulated by the victims. Austria has condemned thiscriminal behaviour in the strongest terms and will tirelesslycontinue to demand that it cease  no matter where it takesplace or who its victims are.Fundamental principles of international order  as theywere precisely defined and affirmed at the LondonConference in August last year  continue to be grosslydisregarded. Specific resolutions  such as the monitoring offrontiers between Bosnia and Serbia or the return ofrefugees  have still not been implemented. The armsembargo decreed by the Security Council in September 1991has done nothing but hurt the victims of aggression. As aresult  the legitimate Government of Bosnia and Herzegovinais in effect being hindered from fully exercising its right toself-defence  under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter without being afforded adequate protection within theframework of a collective security system.Against this backdrop  the proposed peace plans underdiscussion at the negotiations in Geneva raise a number offundamental issues. In tenor  they all call for recognizing astatus quo established by the use of violence and against allprinciples and declarations. This fact makes the spread orprolongation of the conflict likely. There is even the dangerthat Bosnia and Herzegovina  a State Member of the UnitedNations  will be divided up in a move sanctioned - evenencouraged - by the international community. This wouldlend formal legitimacy to advantages gained by force. Themost recently proposed partition plan for the country wouldseriously undercut its sovereignty by eliminating anyeffective central authority  in flagrant contradiction of theSecurity Council’s renewed expression of support for thesovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 24 August thisyear.This continuing violation of international law  humanrights and humanitarian law puts fundamental principles ofinternational conduct in jeopardy while seriouslyundermining the reputation of the international organizationsinvolved. The failure of the system of collective security isespecially alarming in this regard.The same can be said for the situation in Croatia. Overa fourth of the country remains in the hands of theaggressor  contrary to the Cyrus Vance plan ofJanuary 1992  which was endorsed by the Security Council.Neither the demilitarization of these areas to be monitoredby United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) troops nor the return of the civilian populations that have beenexpelled  has yet been realized. Just a few weeks ago thecapital of Croatia was shelled by ground-to-ground missilesfired from areas ostensibly under UNPROFOR protection.Currently overshadowed by the war in Bosnia andHerzegovina  the situation in Kosovo remains tense. Arational solution is nowhere in sight. If anything  thelikelihood of an outbreak of violence has increased in recentdays. The expulsion of the long-term missions of theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)in July of this year could well lay the groundwork for evenmore brutal actions by Serbia against the Albanianpopulation. All in all  we are confronted with a situation inwhich Serbia appears increasingly to be exercising the powerof an occupier in a region whose population is almost90 per cent Albanian and which for decades has enjoyedcomplete autonomy. Austria stands fully behind the effortsof the international community to bring the Kosovo crisisunder control. In the end  a lasting peaceful solution to theBalkans problem is inconceivable without a just andequitable solution for Kosovo and for minorities in otherregions.Austria is focusing its efforts on providing humanitarianrelief. Since the outbreak of the conflict  this relief has beenhandled primarily by the large-scale private charity appeal""Neighbours in Need""  which provides on-site aid for theneedy. Several other European countries are also involvedin its activities. The Secretary-General’s recent words ofpraise for its services are sure to inspire its organizers toeven greater efforts. Austria  with a population of just7 million  is also caring for the needs of over 70 000refugees on its own territory.Though the recent course of events in the formerYugoslavia gives us little cause for optimism  the latestdevelopments in the Middle East fill us with renewed hope.After a period of stagnation  the peace process begun inMadrid in 1991 has been given a vital new impetus with therecent agreement  on 13 September  between Israel and thePLO in Washington. However  the limited powers ofself-government for the partitioned areas now agreed to areonly an initial step. The ultimate goal must be to achievefull rights of self-determination for the Palestinians as partof a final settlement based on the relevant resolutions of theSecurity Council and other bodies of the Organization.The pressing task now is to improve the difficult livingconditions in the occupied territories through generouseconomic and financial aid from the world community.Austria  which has always been committed to a peacefulsettlement in the Middle East  will maintain its support forthis cause by actively participating in the international10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionassistance measures now being planned. As part of themultilateral negotiations  Austria will seek further ways tomake significant contributions in the areas of water andenergy resources.Nevertheless  a lasting peace in the region will only beachieved when Israel and the Arab countries concludetreaties based on the principles of land for peace  securityand regional cooperation. From this standpoint  theagreement between Israel and Jordan on a frameworkagreement for peace is an encouraging sign  portendingfurther progress  we hope  in the bilateral negotiationsbetween Israel and Syria and Israel and Lebanon in the verynear future.We very much welcome the remarkable success of theUnited Nations operation in Cambodia. The twoco-Presidents of the Conference - France and Indonesia -Japan and Australia  as well as the permanent members ofthe Security Council  have made an invaluable contributionto the peace process. We also particularly congratulate theSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General  Mr. Akashi and his colleagues  who have assured the success of theoperation in the transitional phase.Last year I was pleased to announce in the GeneralAssembly the official end to the dispute between Austria andItaly regarding the treatment of the German-speaking andLadin population of South Tyrol  a topic which was thesubject of United Nations resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661(XVI) and which had been pending before this internationalbody since 1960.A year later I can say that the autonomy established forthe German-speaking and Ladin population of South Tyrolappears to be effective in safeguarding the ethnic identityand the economic  social and cultural development of theseethnic groups  though certain problems remain unresolvedand new problems have arisen from the dynamics ofevolution.The settlement of this dispute in June last year hashelped to reduce tensions between the various ethnic groups.Even with this dispute settled  Austria would like to expressits direct interest in helping solve new problems related tomatters involving South Tyrol. Given the new spirit inAustrian-Italian relations since the settlement of this dispute I am confident we will be able to solve any matters relatingto autonomy in a manner agreeable to all parties involved.The East-West confrontation has now been replaced byan array of regional armed conflicts. There is an increasingneed for United Nations peace-keeping operations andincreasing demands are being placed on them. This trendhas accelerated in the past 12 months: almost80 000 soldiers  police  military observers and civilianexperts from 75 countries are now involved in the 17 UnitedNations peace missions around the world.In 1992 the costs for these United Nations missionssoared to $2.1 billion - twice the regular United Nationsbudget - pushing the Organization to its limits under thecurrent financing arrangement. New approaches must befound to finance these United Nations actions. TheVolcker-Ogata report  ""Financing an Effective UnitedNations""  points to financing options which could serve as avaluable basis for the work of the Fifth Committee.The most urgent challenges facing the United Nationstoday are to develop global collective peace-keeping effortsand to overcome the financial crisis. In his ""Agenda forPeace: Preventive diplomacy  peacemaking andpeace-keeping""  the Secretary-General outlines possibleapproaches to active peace management by the UnitedNations. It is now up to the Member States to give theSecretary-General the resources he needs to carry out hisambitious plans. It is obvious that more security requiresgreater solidarity and increased contributions  whether in theform of troops or of higher membership payments. Giventhe current back payments still due  the first priority must beto motivate late payers to send in their contributions on time.Austria takes its obligations very seriously and is proud ofhaving always fulfilled them on time.The increasing consensus within the Security Counciland its new decision-making capability have contributed tothe quantitative and qualitative expansion of peace-keepingoperations and to an increasing variety of needs by thecommunity of nations for troops  officers  civilian police andcivilian experts. The purpose of the large-scale internationalmanoeuvres called ""Exercise 93""  recently conducted by theUnited Nations in Austria with great success  was to achievethe optimum management and coordination of military andcivilian organizations in responding to disasters.As things stand now  election assistance andmonitoring  the protection of human rights  disasterassistance  reconstruction aid  humanitarian relief and tasksof a similar nature are already considered integral parts ofthe new United Nations peace operations  to be put intoeffect as soon as hostilities cease.Austria heartily welcomes this new development having itself sent troops  military observers  police orForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 11civilian experts to 12 of the 21 new United Nationsoperations since 1988. In keeping with theSecretary-General’s ""Agenda for Peace""  the AustrianFederal Government decided on 25 May of this year to laythe necessary groundwork on a national level to put Austrianparticipation in United Nations peace operations on a newlegal footing. We will now be able to comply more quicklyand efficiently with future requests by the United Nationsand regional organizations and with the military  police andcivilian requirements they entail. To be more specific  therewill be an initial phase for the setting up of a disaster reliefservice  a mechanism for seconding staff to the UnitedNations Secretariat  a staff course for high-level officers police actions and humanitarian and disaster relief.Austria is especially interested in the civiliancomponents of peace-keeping operations. To this end  atraining centre for civilian peace-keeping and peace-buildinghas been set up in Schlaining  Burgenland  with the supportof the Federal Government. In September of this year thefirst fellowship programme devoted to ""peace-making andpreventive diplomacy"" was held there  a programmeorganized by the United Nations Institute for Training andResearch (UNITAR); it was impressive in the quality of bothits speakers and its participants. The successful InternationalPeace Academy seminars on conflict resolution should alsobe mentioned in this regard. In cooperation with the UnitedNations  national and international experts will be trained inSchlaining in the civilian responsibilities of the UnitedNations peace operations. Special emphasis will be placedon the following tasks: sustainable development  theprotection of human rights and the rights of national andethnic minorities  humanitarian relief and the development ofdemocracy.In this age of interdependence  our efforts to securepeace globally and collectively cannot be limited topeace-keeping operations; they must also include economicand social developments. Hunger  underdevelopment pollution  crime  drug abuse and refugee flows all poseequally serious threats to global stability and thus to worldpeace. The increasingly global nature of these dangersrequires concerted international cooperation. The UnitedNations is the ideal forum to engage in the quest forsustainable development  that is  development which iscompatible with ecological and social concerns. After all the United Nations mandate covers the full range of humanexperience: political  economic  social and cultural.The ""Agenda for the People""  as Secretary-GeneralBoutros Boutros-Ghali so fittingly called it  is in fact the truechallenge facing the United Nations as the twentieth centurydraws to a close. Large conferences such as those in Rio Vienna  Cairo  Beijing and Copenhagen should give globalanswers to global issues. And no matter what the event - beit the Earth Summit  the Conference on Human Rights  theConference on Population and Development  the Conferenceon Women or the World Social Conference - the focusshould always be on the individual human being and his orher development and membership in the community.In his declaration of principle before this year’s sessionof the Economic and Social Council  the Secretary-Generalunderscored the historic opportunity which the simultaneousstructural reform and redefinition of United Nations policyoffer for the United Nations Member States. The crucial testfor the new United Nations will be the implementation ofthis ""Agenda for the People""."
"10",401,"AZE",48,1993,"Allow me first to congratulate Mr. SamuelInsanally on his election to his responsible post  and to wishhim every success in his work.Allow me also to express gratitude to the President ofour last session  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  for his able guidance ofour work  and to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General  for his dynamic  tireless work to restructure theOrganization and enhance its effectiveness  given thequalitative changes occurring in the system of internationalrelations.I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate thenew members of the United Nations: the Czech Republic the Slovak Republic  The Former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia  Eritrea  Monaco and Andorra.The forty-eighth session of the General Assembly istaking place at a momentous time. The twentieth century which has experienced two of the most destructive wars inthe history of mankind  as well as the cold war and the armsrace  which have depleted natural and financial resources the intellectual and moral potential of civilization  isnevertheless ending on an optimistic note. Totalitarianregimes have fallen  scores of countries have gainedindependence and universal values of democracy and themarket economy are now finding new advocates throughoutthe world.We are proud that our small country  which straddlesEurope and Asia  a country with an ancient culture and aproud history  has not been left behind in the truly universalhistorical process of the triumph of democracy and nationaland economic revival. Azerbaijan regained its independenceless than two years ago. The path travelled by our countryover these 22 months has not been without difficulties andhas been marked by contradictions and tragic events.Nevertheless  we are convinced that the young State ofAzerbaijan is following the only true path leading to genuineindependence.This has been borne out by the results of the recentpresidential elections held at the beginning of October  whenthe overwhelming majority of the people of Azerbaijan votedfor Mr. Heydar Aliyev  an experienced politician andrecognized leader of our country  who is firmly committedto the idea of building a democratic  secular society with amarket economy.Unfortunately  the natural historical process of the fallof empires and the acquisition of independence andstatehood by their peoples is often accompanied by excessesof extreme nationalism. Many attempt to exploit thedemocratization of the social and political life of youngindependent States to undermine their internal stability.22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionNationalist separatist movements are often used as a way toachieve these ends.Unfortunately  Azerbaijan has fallen victim to such actsof provocation. For six years now the Republic of Armeniahas been waging an undeclared war against Azerbaijan tofulfil its territorial claims. The sad facts of Armenia’saggression are as follows: 20 per cent of the territory ofAzerbaijan is now occupied by Armenian troops  and1 million of our country’s civilians have no homes or meansof survival. The economic infrastructure of the AzerbaijaniRepublic’s occupied region has been destroyed. Uniquehistorical and cultural sites of Azerbaijan have beendestroyed. And all this is occurring under the cover of anongoing propaganda campaign and alleged non-involvementby the Republic of Armenia in the aggression.Azerbaijan has often proclaimed  and continues toproclaim  its commitment to the principle of the peacefulsettlement of disputes. We welcome and commend theefforts of the international community  the United Nationsand the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe(CSCE) as well as the efforts made by individual States -Russia  the United States  Turkey  Iran and Kazakhstan - inrecent years to achieve a peaceful settlement of theArmenia/Azerbaijan conflict.Azerbaijan welcomed the Security Council’s adoptionof resolutions 822 (1993) and 853 (1993) calling for theimmediate  complete and unconditional withdrawal of theoccupying forces from Azerbaijan territory that had beenseized. Azerbaijan also welcomed the initial timetable -worked out within the framework of the Minsk Group of theCSCE - of urgent steps to implement Security Councilresolutions 822 (1993) and 853 (1993)  several revised draftsof which  however  were aborted because of the Armenianside.Azerbaijan stresses its commitment to the initialapproach of the CSCE - that is  that the Minsk Conferenceshould be preceded by the complete liberation ofAzerbaijan’s occupied territories. This was stressed inparticular by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan G. A. Aliyev  yesterday during the reception for CSCErepresentatives who are now visiting the region.We are confident that  despite certain difficulties -sometimes substantive - in the approach to the terms of thepeaceful settlement of the conflict  the political realism andthe sense of responsibility for the fate of our people shownby the Azerbaijan side will be appreciated by our negotiatingpartners.Azerbaijan  which is richly endowed with a variety ofnatural resources and which has a fairly well-developedindustrial potential  has all the conditions necessary toovercome our objective difficulties in this transitional periodtowards a market economy.However  since one out of everysix inhabitants of our country has been forced to leave hishome and now has no means of survival  as a result of thehostilities and occupation of one fifth of our territory  thehumanitarian assistance provided by various internationalorganizations that have enormous experience in this area isassuming great importance for our country.In this difficult period for my country  Azerbaijan - andprimarily the people of Azerbaijan  who have suffered most -has been given all round support and assistance by theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees  the International Committee of the Red Cross  theUnited Nations Children’s Fund  the World HealthOrganization and the International Federation of Red Crossand Red Crescent Societies. On behalf of my people andGovernment  I take this opportunity to express profoundgratitude to all international organizations  humanitarianinstitutions and specialized agencies and the peoples andGovernments of many States that have responded to thesuffering of the Azerbaijan people who have fallen victim toaggression.The Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan alsoexpresses profound gratitude to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for having established a UnitedNations - United Nations Development Programme InterimOffice in Azerbaijan. We are deeply convinced that theactivities of this Office will help to strengthen and expandthe comprehensive relations between our Republic and theUnited Nations system. We are convinced  also  that thiscooperation will be mutually advantageous in view of theinitial results of interaction between the Republic ofAzerbaijan and the system of specialized agencies of theUnited Nations  the majority of which our country joined in1992 and 1993.We attach overriding importance to internationalcooperation in the field of the environment and sustainabledevelopment and also to the comprehensive expansion ofworld trade and the elimination of all barriers that restrictthat process.Azerbaijan welcomed the decision to convene a WorldSummit for Social Development and is prepared to take anactive part in preparing for that Summit  the successfulconvening of which we believe will lay the basis for anForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 23effective global development strategy for the twenty-firstcentury.Our country is taking an active part in the preparationsfor the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements(Habitat II)  which will take place in 1996 in Istanbul.Thus despite the objective and subjective difficultiesencountered by my country  Azerbaijan  during the past yearhas been taking decisive action to integrate itself fully intothe world community. We are convinced that integrationinto the world’s political  economic and humanitarianprocess is possible only by increasing cooperation betweenStates at the bilateral and multilateral levels.Our country shares the general conviction regarding theneed to reduce the threat of the use of weapons of massdestruction and subsequently to destroy them  has acceded tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons andis taking an active part in the preparatory work for theReview Conference that will take place in 1995. Azerbaijansupports the indefinite extension of that Treaty and believesthat it should be made universal. We are convinced that thenon-proliferation Treaty is an instrument that strengthens allinternational efforts and regional initiatives that seek toprevent any proliferation of weapons of mass destruction andto eliminate obstacles that threaten international and regionalpeace and security.In this connection we welcome the positive steps takenrecently in the area of disarmament  including the adoptionof the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons andon Their Destruction  which was signed by Azerbaijan andthe majority of countries of the world.One outstanding example of our progress towardsbuilding a democratic  lawful State was Azerbaijan’saccession to the basic instruments of international law in thearea of human rights  such as the International Covenant onCivil and Political Rights  the International Covenant onEconomic  Social and Cultural Rights  the Convention on theRights of the Child  the Convention relating to the Status ofRefugees (1951) and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Statusof Refugees  and some others. Our country is veryinterested in the various initiatives being taken in the area ofprotecting human rights. The idea of establishing  within theUnited Nations system  a new post of high commissioner forhuman rights  reflects an intention to enhance internationalcooperation in this area. We are prepared actively toparticipate in the discussions on this question.Another pressing issue  one that requires urgent andconstant attention  is that of refugees and displaced persons.It is time for the international community to draw up properrules and standards to govern massive  forced migrationswhich could help overcome their main causes andconsequences.Desirous of making a worthy contribution to the variousareas of the activities of the United Nations  Azerbaijansubmitted its candidacy for  and was elected to  theCommission on Human Settlements and theIntergovernmental Committee on Science and Technologyfor Development. We are convinced that the great scientificpotential and practical experience of our specialists will helpthese commissions to do effective work.In 1995 the United Nations will celebrate its fiftiethanniversary. In the almost five decades that have elapsedsince the United Nations was created  its historic meaningand universality have become strikingly clear. Today it istime for serious  meaningful changes  changes commensuratewith the needs of our rapidly changing world. We believethat  given the new context of international relations  therestructuring of the United Nations  and particularly of theSecurity Council  must meet the great expectations ofMember States. Expansion of the membership of theSecurity Council  the need for which is the subject of seriousdiscussion  should help the Council continue effectively todischarge its primary task  that of the maintenance ofinternational peace and security.Of course the role andresponsibility of the Secretary-General will shift towardsenhanced peacemaking and diplomatic activity.In conclusion  we look to the future with optimism  toa future where peace and cooperation will prosper. We callupon States Members of the United Nations to make everyeffort to promote the establishment of a safe  secure common home. We are sure that constructive discussionsand debates at this session will make an importantcontribution to the building of a better world in the comingcentury."
"11",447,"BDI",48,1993,"Itis with genuine pleasure that we speak from this UnitedNations rostrum and join previous speakers in sincerelycongratulating you  Sir. I do so on behalf of the people andthe Government of Burundi and on our own behalf. It is inrecognition of your distinguished qualities that the Assemblyhas chosen you to preside over its work at this session. Weare convinced that your wisdom and your political anddiplomatic experience will enable you to guide the work ofthe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly in amasterly  successful way.We also congratulate the other members of the Bureauof the General Assembly.We wish also to pay a well-deserved tribute to yourpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev  for the skilland vision with which he guided the work of the Assemblyat its forty-seventh session.Further  we express our gratitude to theSecretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the vision with which he hasguided the Organization and for his tireless efforts to ensurethe maintenance of international peace and security.The Republic of Burundi warmly welcomes thecountries that have recently joined the United Nationsfamily; we welcome the representatives of the CzechRepublic  the Slovak Republic  The Former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia  Eritrea  the Principality of Monacoand the Principality of Andorra.The people and the Government of Burundi join therest of the international community in conveying sincerecondolences to the Government and the people of India onthe earthquake that has struck their country and that hascaused the death of some 20 000 people. We assure thepeople and the Government of India of my country’ssympathy and moral support in this harsh ordeal inflicted byNature.The people of Burundi  through me  is honoured andpleased to send a message to the international communityrepresented here in the General Assembly. That message which is being delivered on the morrow of the victory ofdemocracy in our land  is one of peace  friendship  fraternityand solidarity.The beginning of this century was marked bydevastating wars that led to the crystallization andbipolarization of international relations. The ensuing coldwar  with the two major ideological and military blocs inconfrontation  was reflected in many countries by theestablishment of totalitarian power. Africa  which was at thesame time emerging from the long night of colonialism found itself unwillingly involved in the dynamics of thatrationale. Peoples who had theoretically been freed from thecolonial yoke nevertheless found themselves  to their greatconsternation  confronted with authorities that had beenimposed upon them or established by force  and that weredevoid of any legitimacy  just like the colonial order that hadtheoretically been brought to an end.In that context the rights and freedoms of the humanperson were openly flouted. The State based on law becamea mirage  the right to life and the growth of the human spirita utopian ideal. In their concern to consolidate their power which lacked any popular base  some leaders inflamed andexploited inherent differences based on ethnicity andregionalism  which they imbued with political significance.Our country did not escape that state of affairs. Thepast 30 years have been marked by ethnic upheavals thathave traumatized our people. In truth  the history of thepeople of Burundi is replete with tragedies. Political forceshave exploited ethnic differences with impunity and havefought to control the State for their own interests.Outright crimes against humanity have been committedby individuals and by organized groups  some of which haveenjoyed the protection and blessing of the State  which lentitself to the perpetration of such base actions. That sowedmistrust and suspicion among the ethnic groups in ourcountry  thus traumatizing the people and creating uneaseabout the future. So violent did the tragedy become thatthere were those who wondered how Burundi would evermanage to emerge from the toils of the violence in which ithad become enmeshed.Burundi’s recent political development demonstrates itspeople’s ability to shake off those toils and to rid themselvesfrom their fears.The ideology of human rights and its corollary democracy in the management of public affairs  have takenthe place of violent  repressive and exclusionary measures tosuch a degree that the people of Burundi have graduallycome to realize that in order to solve their problems theymust turn to a democracy that transcends differences divisions and hatreds.We made a choice. Today  we are more than everconvinced that that choice was a good one. The people ofBurundi embarked upon this process  at first hesitant butconfident  with of course the inevitable ups and downs  andthey succeeded in holding free  just and open elections.Today  the people of Burundi are proud  proud ofhaving managed to overcome the many difficulties andobstacles strewn on their path towards democracy and proudtoo of being able to take full control over their history in anopen  just and equitable way.The date of 1 June 1993 will remain a memorable onein our country’s history. On that day  for the first time inBurundi’s history  free  pluralist and open elections wereheld  designed to give the country truly democraticinstitutions. The positive manner in which the variousprotagonists have accepted the people’s verdict demonstratesthat the people of Burundi are henceforth convinced that thepath of democracy - and especially in its electoral aspect  inwhich the people’s will is expressed and legitimacyconferred - is the only proper way to resolve the problemsentailed in the access to and exercise of power.Further  the legislative elections of 29 June 1993 wereto confirm the will of a people desirous of living henceforthin peace.We should like to take this opportunity to extendheartfelt thanks to all who  from near or far  supported ourcountry in its march towards democracy. We have greatlyappreciated the material  technological and financial supportprovided by friendly countries and international andintergovernmental organizations that have enabled us toorganize in a suitable manner Burundi’s first free  pluralistelections.The democratic administration of a society we are nowin the process of undertaking cannot be viewed as an end initself. Rather  it is a means to consolidate peace  tostrengthen confidence among the various components of ournation and to accelerate the economic  social and culturaldevelopment to which all men aspire.Today  therefore  the Government of Burundi isbending every effort to achieve the gradual elimination of allthe obstacles that have paralysed or retarded the Burundipeople’s drive towards growth and overall development. Weare working towards this end  and we are convinced thatwith the support of the international community we can meetthe challenge.Forty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 3It is at present our most heartfelt hope that the peopleof Burundi will henceforth be safe from ethnicconfrontations. We want no more blood shed in ethnicconfrontations anywhere in the land  in the homes  in thehills  in towns and provinces  in schools and barracks.Never again! That is the watchword of the whole of thepeople of Burundi.We also want the people of Burundi to accept theirhistory as it is. Mistakes have naturally been made  andthere are other serious problems that continue to weigh onour democratic process. Nevertheless  they must notobstruct or paralyse us. Setbacks and problems exist to beovercome. Mistakes must be recognized as such andcorrected. That is one of the basic tenets for a new Burundi.Yes  we must accept our history the better to face thefuture. We want that future to be a safer and securer onefor all. Thus  the Government we formed following theelections last June is an open Government. In it  we havebrought together people from every ethnic group  from everyregion of the country and of different political persuasions.All those people from every social background anddiffering political persuasions are working together withmight and main to ensure that the process of democratizationin Burundi will be irreversible. We consider that to be thebest way to reach our goal  namely  to reconcile the peopleof Burundi with themselves and with their State the better tocommit themselves to the battle for their economic  socialand cultural development.Guided by that will  the Government has just proposed and the National Assembly has ratified  an amnesty lawunder which more than 5 000 of our compatriots - 70 percent of our country’s prison population - are to regain theirfreedom and thereby take part in building a democraticBurundi  confident and more integral.We wish to tell the world that through that amnesty lawthe people of Burundi mean to make a new start towards abetter development of their destiny and the installation ofpeace in the subregion.While granting amnesty to those who  at home orabroad  have derogated from the fundamental rights of thepeople of Burundi as a whole and of individual members ofthat people in particular  we want to accept our historywithout thereby becoming its prisoners. Through a nationalpardon  we want to establish a context of security for allthose in Burundi who  in their hearts or in the eyes of thenation  are responsible for acts committed in the course ofpast tragedies. Indeed  given the tragic acts our people haveknown  sometimes the result of shared responsibilities butoften arising out of imprecise causes  we must wipe the slateclean. We must view the future with greater clarity confidence and serenity. That is a solid basis for domesticpeace  but it can also contribute to the restoration andoptimum consolidation of security and peace in oursubregion.The happy outcome of democracy in our country hasthus become an unprecedentedly powerful catalyst in thesettlement of another thorny problem affecting oursubregion. I refer to the question of refugees  of whomthere are some 200 000. These compatriots who are victimsof tragedies of the past three decades and who have beenforced to stay in exile  seeking refuge in neighbouringcountries here and there throughout the world  have had theirhopes rekindled. For them - and they are perfectly right -the triumph of democracy has removed the essential reasonfor their leaving their country. Today they have chosen toreturn to their homeland  which welcomes them with openarms.Before talking about the conditions that will have to bemet before these compatriots can be assured of a safe return I should like first to discharge the duty of thanking allcountries  particularly our neighbours Tanzania  Rwandaand Zaire  and all the international organizations  especiallythose in the United Nations system  and in particular theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) that for some 20 years have enabled them to continue to feellike human beings.The Government of Burundi must now continue thisprocess by ensuring the happy return and the effective anddignified reintegration of these citizens into the country’seconomic  social and cultural life. To succeed  we shallhave to mobilize many material and financial resources tomeet emergency needs and satisfy long-term requirements.We make an earnest appeal to the international communityto provide such support as we engage in this highlyhumanitarian process.We are faced with a massive and spontaneous return ofBurundi refugees from neighbouring and distant countries.We are honoured and filled with joy at the confidence andspontaneity of our compatriots. At the same time  lack ofthe means and the infrastructure that we need to cater forthem causes us deep concern. We are now identifying indetail all the steps that will have to be taken if we are toorganize  before next December  a conference to informsponsors to help finance this large-scale operation.4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionIn the meantime  we are using the modest means at ourdisposal  while relying on national solidarity and  especially on the laudable intervention of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees  to whom we again express ourdeep gratitude. Pending the establishment  in the receivingareas  of a medium-term plan for the gradual repatriation andreabsorption of these returnees into a global  integrateddevelopment programme  we have just published anemergency plan to deal with the arrival of 50 000 peoplebetween now and February 1994. The latter  because of theprecariousness of their conditions  are returning right away.This will enable us  having secured the necessary means  toalleviate their suffering and to accord them the dignity towhich they are entitled.In the economic field  our major concern is to ensurea just and appropriate link between human  natural andfinancial resources so that we may provide the goods andservices to satisfy the constantly increasing needs of ourpopulation. Development of the rural sector will requirespecial attention from the public authorities  given the factthat more than 90 per cent of our population live in thecountryside. We want to modernize the rural economy  andthe spirit of enterprise  self-improvement  research andcreativity will play a very important part in the economicapproach of the new era.A conference of donors to help finance Burundi’s sixthfive-year economic and social development plan will beorganized in the near future. We believe that theinternational community will give us its usual support andthat the resources necessary for implementation of the planwill be forthcoming.Moreover  the Government of Burundi will pursue thestructural adjustment programme  with the support of theWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund.Development of the private sector will be encouraged  andnon-strategic public enterprises will be progressivelyprivatized  either in terms of property or in terms ofmanagement.Within the framework of liberalization of the Burundieconomy  the Government will reinforce the free-trade zonefor the purpose of diversifying exports. We invite investorswho are so inclined to come and operate in Burundi  wherethe current political and social environment  the free-tradezone and the investment code are very favourable tobusiness.In the social and cultural field  we shall promote thework ethic and ingenuity and  thereby  commit ourselves topositive values  in keeping with our traditions and culture.As we have already pointed out  democracy in Burundiis a living reality that has to be consolidated. This newpolitical situation will change relations between Burundi andits foreign partners. That is why  henceforth  my country’sforeign policy will be based on the following guidingprinciples: good-neighbourliness and effective cooperation;non-interference in the affairs of other States; theconsolidation of peace through respect for and the promotionof the rights and freedoms of the human person; mutuallyadvantageous international cooperation based oninterdependence and solidarity between peoples and nations;regional integration against the background of the emergenceof free-trade zones in which there is no place for selfishnational purposes; and  finally  integration of the Burundieconomy into the world economy.We believe that respect for these principles will notonly strengthen the determination of the Government of ourcountry to implement a foreign policy in keeping with thedemands of its domestic policy but also foster harmoniousrelations with our foreign partners.We realize that  without development  there can be nohealthy democracy. Democratization is therefore acontinuing process  a process that never ends - to the extentthat it is not enough to create or reform political institutions;that it is especially necessary to resolve substantial problems particularly those related to health  nutrition  education housing and people’s general well-being.Solutions must be found for these problems  but at thesame time we must confront challenges linked to them - forexample  population growth  the steady drop in the prices ofraw materials  the poor performance of our economies  theweight of external debt  natural disasters and endemicdisease  especially malaria and AIDS  which have become areal scourge  principally in Africa.The survival of democracy on our continent will dependon our achieving a just balance in international economicrelations. The security and stability that are indispensable ifsound democracy is to be guaranteed will remain underthreat so long as the problems of debt and hunger - in aword: development - are not attacked head on.The international community would therefore be failingin its duty were it to permit the gap between the prosperouscountries of the North and the poor countries of the South toForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 5remain indefinitely. Thus  we appreciate the variousinitiatives to reduce the burden of foreign debt on thedeveloping countries. We believe that economic recovery inAfrica will be achieved  in particular  when external debt issubstantially cancelled and additional financial resourcesprovided. Is it right that financial flows from the South tothe North should be greater than those from the North to theSouth  as is the case today? This is a bitter reality  whichrequires of us profound changes. Thus  the United Nationsmust do all in its power to rethink cooperation machinery with a view to coming up with a solution that will reversethe tendency towards the impoverishment of Africa inparticular.Despite the problems we have just mentioned  we mustnot allow ourselves to be discouraged. Our efforts atdemocracy and development go hand in hand with a sinceresearch for regional solidarity  in the first place  and then forinternational solidarity. We know full well that  whileimposed choices are intolerable  it would be an aberration ifwe were to fail to act together. It is by combining andharmonizing their forces that States can make the best oftheir advantages. Burundi must not stand aside from thismovement towards solidarity. In our subregion  Burundiwill commit itself to the promotion of various types ofcooperation with its neighbours.We intend to strengthen existing instruments in thecontext of that cooperation  such as the EconomicCommunity of the Great Lakes Countries  the Kagera RiverBasin Organization and the Preferential Trade Area  with aview to the gradual establishment of a free-trade zone. TheGovernment of Burundi will spare no effort to sparksubregional cooperation aimed at increased well-being forour peoples.It is high time that we in the third world engaged insome self-examination. It is high time that we grew out oflooking only outwards. We must explore our own capacityfor self-development: development directed at ourselves andmaintained by ourselves. We must learn to plan and managebetter. Above all  we must learn to work better  to workprofitably: all of us  from the humblest peasant to theloftiest dignitary. Africa is overflowing with wasted orunexploited potential. We must contemplate a developmentfor ourselves  a development adapted to our needs andmaking use of our assets. International solidarity can beeffective only in the radically new context where we takeresponsibility for ourselves and where exchanges aremutually advantageous.The world is radically changing. Peoples aspire togreater freedom and dignity. Mankind needs to makeenormous efforts to overcome the obstacles on its path:poverty  war  famine  sickness  the destruction of theenvironment  overpopulation. These are all challengesfacing our planet.The detente and the will for peace that characterizerelations between the major Powers following the cold warcan make it possible to achieve global security understanding and cooperation; they affect the need forpolitical settlements of the conflicts that have broken out inmany parts of the world. Burundi advocates dialogue andjoint efforts to end disputes  and we can only welcome thesepositive developments in international relations.But internationally speaking we are at the turning pointbetween two eras. The era of the cold war and a bipolarworld has ended. But today the world is newly assailed  andthe inevitable seismic shock waves are shaking the globalvillage. Peoples and nations everywhere are seeking newguidelines for building the new world order that has been solate in coming.Ancient rivalries we thought had been overcome areagain rising to the surface and are disturbing balancesachieved at great cost. On the threshold of the twenty-firstcentury  Europe has been jolted by separatist nationalism.The plan to build a communal supranational political entityis not exempt from the harsh test posed by the eruptionstaking place in the multinational States of the long-standingdemocracies. The situation in the former Yugoslavia speaksunfortunate volumes in this regard.Africa is being undermined by areas of disturbingdestruction. It has been all the more marginalized since theend of the division of the world into two blocs because it isno longer a bargaining chip. Where else in the world arethere so many countries without State authority  withoutsocial organization? Where else are there so manyfratricidal wars with no solution in view? Somalia  Liberia Angola  Mozambique and Rwanda are all loci of tensionwhere instability threatens Africa as a whole  as well asworld peace.Burundi firmly supports the resolution of conflicts inthe framework of regional and subregional organizations.Hence  we praise the efforts of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) and subregional organizations in Africa toarbitrate conflicts and help the parties to find negotiatedsolutions to their disputes.6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionIn connection with the prevention of conflicts and withconfidence- and security-building among the States of oursubregion  we have established a permanent consultativecommittee on security questions in Central Africa  with thecooperation of the United Nations. In the committeemeetings already held  a common determination has emergedto establish a confidence-building machinery  and to limitweapons in order to benefit the development and well-beingof the peoples of the subregion.Moreover  Burundi welcomes United Nations action which despite many difficulties continues to play a role andto achieve success. A recent example is that of Cambodia where a Government of National Unity has just been formedafter a long process carried out under United Nationssupervision. The United Nations is doing all it can torestore order in Angola  Somalia and the former Yugoslavia.We urge the United Nations to proceed on this path.We hail the historic agreement recently signed atWashington between the State of Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization. This development is an importantmilestone in the settlement of the Palestinian problem.Burundi attaches great significance to this event  whichwithout question will set its stamp on the end of the century.Closer to home  in Rwanda  Burundi hails and supportsaction taken by the United Nations in cooperation with theOrganization of African Unity to guarantee our Rwandesebrethren a climate favouring genuine national reconciliation.The deployment of a neutral international force  as requestedby the two parties  should be arranged as quickly aspossible. Such a force is among the prerequisites for theconsolidation of peace in Rwanda  and hence throughout thesubregion - especially in Burundi  where similarities inethnic  linguistic and cultural matters place us in a delicateposition with respect to the Rwandese political conflict.Burundi also welcomes the positive developments in thesituation in southern Africa. Negotiations under way amongthe various political players in South Africa have alreadyproduced encouraging results that are strengthening mutualtrust. The Government of Burundi was pleased by thedecision of the Conference for a Democratic South Africa(CODESA) recognizing that Walvis Bay and the surroundingarea belong to Namibia. That decision marks the totalindependence of Namibia and is in keeping with theconsolidation of peace in the region.That is true also of the decision in South Africa to setup a Transitional Executive Council open to all politicalgroups; this will lead to elections next year.Burundi enthusiastically welcomes the recent events inSouth Africa that enabled the historic leader of the AfricanNational Congress of South Africa (ANC)  Mr. NelsonMandela  to call for the lifting of economic sanctions againsthis country. Burundi considers that those events are theculmination of the first phase of a process that will lead tothe emergence in South Africa of a democratic regime freeof racial discrimination.Burundi hopes that the Transitional Executive Councilwill be able to complete negotiations on the transition todemocracy. That would open new prospects not only forsouthern Africa but also for the entire continent  which inrecent years has followed with special attention the obstaclespreventing all the daughters and sons of Africa fromenjoying their national rights  thus compromising the entirenetwork of mutually advantageous relations that could bedeveloped between South Africa and the rest of thecontinent.Concerning the difficulties facing our Organization  itis an open secret that we are facing financial adjustmentproblems. The number of peace-keeping operations  thefrequency of special missions  the diversity and thecomplexity of prevailing situations all call for greaterresponsibility in the payment of assessments due theOrganization.Burundi also encourages the current restructuring of theUnited Nations system  which will allow it to measure up tothe numerous new tasks awaiting it and enable it to have animage which is a true mirror of the present world.Our country praises the exceptional courage and selfdenial demonstrated by the staff of the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees. It goes withoutsaying that refugees and displaced persons endure the mostpainful sufferings because of conflicts. The United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees constantly gives them hopeby providing them with the basic necessities.Burundi  as a country that has been sheltering refugeesbut that also has citizens of its own living in exile  cantestify today to its convictions and achievements on thequestion of refugees. We are convinced that only therepatriation and reinstallation of refugees and displacedpersons can remedy the problem  which has becomeworldwide in scope and difficult to overcome.We would be remiss not to congratulate thenon-governmental organizations of the world  which  throughForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 7their actions  have lessened the suffering of millions of men women and children in distress.In order to be lasting and irreversible  the democraticreforms chosen by our populations must have internationalsupport  because  indeed  democracy against a backdrop ofsocial unrest  unemployment and poverty runs the risk ofbeing just a caricature.From this rostrum  in the same way that we called onthe international community to witness our democraticinstitutions  we would like to ask it to support our effortsthrough international cooperation based on interdependenceand solidarity among peoples and nations.The economic situation in the world today constitutesfor us a subject of deep concern. The developed countrieshave been hit by a recession  and it is not easy to overcomeit. After years of more or less favourable economicconditions  growth in their economies is now slowing down.Short-term projections are not very encouraging either.Unemployment has reached disturbing proportions  therebycausing a resurgence here and there of xenophobia andmicronationalism  victims of which are for the most partforeigners who have become true scapegoats for the ills thatare distressing the societies in the developed countries.The developing world is the most severely affected interms of the well-being of its population. While South-EastAsia and Latin America have positive economic indicators we must note that Africa is going through a difficult periodand that the stakes are high. The drop in export earnings linked to the undervaluing of raw materials  weighs heavilyupon the external debt that today so hinders the freedom ofaction of most African countries. The outlook for recoveryand growth in the short term will likely remain bleak for theAfrican continent.We would like to recall  however  that there have beendelays in the implementation of the New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s  adopted by the GeneralAssembly two years ago. Similarly  progress achieved inimplementing the New Agenda for the 1990s in favour ofthe least-developed countries is still not up to theexpectations of our populations.The International Conference on African Developmentis currently being held in Tokyo. We sincerely thank theorganizers of that meeting  especially the Government ofJapan. We wish that Conference success  and we also hopethat it will lead to concrete commitments on the part of thedonors to help us recover and to develop on the basis of ourown needs and priorities. Burundi is represented in Tokyoat a high level  and it will make its contribution to achievingthe goals of that Conference.Obstacles to healthy international economic cooperationare still numerous and of many kinds. The external debtcrisis remains a major hindrance to the recovery of oureconomies. The main creditors must make greater efforts toease the weight of this debt  the servicing of which is aheavy burden on the meagre export earnings of ourdeveloping countries. At this time  we would like to expressour deep gratitude to friendly countries which have alreadyundertaken measures - or are in the process of so doing - toreduce or cancel the debt which we owe them. We ask themto take relevant measures to give a strong boost todevelopment financing  the drying up of which concerns us.In this regard  Burundi places great hope in traditionalsources of financing  the funds for which have beenincreased. But we also place great hopes in the GlobalEnvironment Facility. Our delegation would like from thisrostrum to repeat the need for rapid conclusion to thenegotiations on the restructuring of that fund so that it mayreflect its true world calling with regard to its compositionand to transparent management and democratic managementin its functioning. Similarly  it is also important for theCommission on Sustainable Development to move fromrhetoric to an operational phase.The series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) negotiations ought to have been concluded in 1991 but they continue to run up against a number ofdisagreements which are causing major concern in the worldeconomy  in particular with respect to the future of themultilateral trading system. We urgently appeal to theprincipal protagonists to show political will sufficient tobring about a favourable ending to the Uruguay Round. Theinternational community would in no way benefit from atrade war. There would be no winner and no loser in thatwar.Each year the United Nations enjoys greaterparticipation at the level of Heads of State and Government.This is due to the fact that they firmly believe in theirreplaceable role of this Organization in respect of thebalance and functioning of the world. We firmly believe inthis Organization  and therefore we permit ourselves theliberty of hoping for the promotion of internationalcooperation which takes account of the diversity of eachcountry and which is committed to complementary actionswith shared and fully assumed responsibility.8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe United Nations indeed is an Organization ofpowerful countries and weaker countries. Here  therefore we find the principles of justice  transparency and solidarityin international affairs as something which must berespected  so that no State need feel excluded or bulliedbecause of its size. Rather  each State should feel protectedagainst insecurity and arbitrariness  against hunger  againstpoverty  against epidemics of all kinds.It is true  and we strongly emphasize this  that theweaker countries must not always put forward theirweakness as a pretext to demand or to call for protection orassistance from the international community. They too musttake charge of their own destinies. They must organizethemselves in such a way that the United Nations or otherorganizations would intervene only to give them support fora self-centred and self-supported development programme.It is our deepest wish that this world Organization thatwe share would continue to pursue its ideals and to achieveits goals. We would wish that international solidarity mightbe a genuine reality and that the relations among Statesmight henceforth be based on a more just and moreequitable economic and political order.It is our hope to see our Organization help the poorestpopulations on our planet avoid hunger  poverty and wars.Long live the United Nations!Long live international solidarity!"
"12",494,"BEL",48,1993,"I have the honour of speaking on behalf of the EuropeanCommunity and its member States.Allow me  first of all  Mr. President  to pay a tribute toyour predecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  who conducted theGeneral Assembly’s proceedings during its forty-seventhsession.The Assembly has unanimously decided to entrust toyou  Sir  the conduct of this the forty-eighth session. Wewelcome that decision as we are familiar with your personalqualities and your professional experience. We also see thisas a well-earned tribute to your country  the Republic ofGuyana  and to the contribution made by the Caribbeanregion to the activities of our Organization. The EuropeanCommunity and its member States  which continue to enjoyfruitful relations with the countries of the Caribbean  within10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionthe dynamic framework of the Lomé Convention  assure youof their fullest cooperation.We welcome also the admission to our Organization ofthe Czech Republic  the Slovak Republic  Eritrea  thePrincipality of Monaco  the Former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia and the Principality of Andorra.In his address to the Assembly last year  my Britishcolleague  Mr. Douglas Hurd  made the point that  after abrief interlude of optimism  the world had entered a periodof instability and of challenges to law and order. This trendhas increased over the past 12 months. We now have tocope with new crisis situations  while - speaking only aboutEurope - a just and lasting solution to such a long-standingproblem as that of Cyprus has yet to be found  despite thecontinued efforts of our Organization.Long restrained by the so-called balance of terror  latentantagonisms have resurfaced in the Balkans  the Caucasusand Central Asia. The collapse of the old institutionalframeworks has led to the emergence of forms of rapidlycompeting nationalisms. The personal ambitions of certainrulers and the propaganda machines they control haveplunged clans or whole peoples into conflicts marked by theblind use of violence. In that process  the basic rights of theindividual and the elementary rules of internationalhumanitarian law have been constantly flouted.In other countries  the economic and social crisis hascontinued to provide fertile ground for religiousfundamentalism  enabling it to increase the number both ofits followers and of its victims. Elsewhere  the existence ofa large immigrant population has served as a pretext forreactions of racial intolerance  which have even led todeliberate criminal acts. All these forms of fanaticismdesignate human beings as the enemy to be destroyed. Theymust be fought not only through political declarations andlaws but also through a more sincere and committedengagement in favour of the human values which shouldunite us all across continents and cultures.The proliferation of these situations has gone hand inhand with a growing desire to possess weapons of massdestruction. In this connection  we are concerned by theactions of Member States of our Organization which haveample resources  bear regional responsibilities and claim tobe lovers of peace. The proliferation of these weaponsrepresents a grave threat to both global and regional securityand stability. It is of the utmost importance that the Non-Proliferation Treaty should be unconditionally extended in1995 for an indefinite period.Economic underdevelopment and the unacceptableliving conditions of hundreds of millions of inhabitants ofthe planet constitute another major concern for the EuropeanCommunity and its member States.The outcome of three decades of developmentcooperation cannot be regarded as positive. This means thatall of us  countries of the South and of the North  must takeserious stock of the situation. We know that it is pointlessto speak of peace in the world if we do not at the same timework towards global economic and social development. Theforthcoming world conferences in Cairo  Copenhagen andBeijing will be important landmarks in this process.Our concerns have not blinded us to the importantefforts undertaken in all regions of the world towardsdemocratization and economic recovery.The Republics which made up the former Soviet Unionhave pursued the immense task of creating a political economic and social framework designed to strengthen theirsense of identity as individual nations. We must help thesecountries find ways of achieving deep-rooted nationalreconciliation while fully respecting each other’s territorialintegrity. The European Community and its member Stateswill continue to support them substantially through technicalassistance and partnership agreements. They will alsomaintain their trade with the countries of Central and EasternEurope  in particular through new or strengthened associationagreements.The European Community and its member Statessupport President Yeltsin in his efforts to promote economicand political reform as well as to strengthen democracy inhis country.It is in Africa that the gap between objectives andrealities remains most discouraging. Two hundred millionpeople across that continent live in abject poverty. However in spite of armed conflicts and acute economic problems there are undeniable signs of the dawn of a new political era.It is of course up to the African people to determine thepace and practical form of their democratic development.Some dictators  however  are still clinging to the power theyhave long exercised for their own exclusive benefit. Theirarmies  for whose services they somehow manage to pay  arelike a weapon permanently aimed at their own people.Despite appearances  they are now no more than ananachronistic element of underdevelopment.South Africa is approaching the historic moment whenthe democratic majority of its people will accede to power.Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 11The path leading to this has  alas  been littered with furthermassacres and attacks. The European Community and itsmember States reiterate their support for the negotiatingprocess pursued by President Frederik De Klerk and Mr.Nelson Mandela and appeal to the international communityto assist South Africa in this crucial phase by helping toorganize elections and to rebuild and develop the country.In Asia  the positive trend of the past few years hasbeen maintained. On the economic front  the Asiancountries of the Pacific Rim  particularly China  arecharacterized by remarkable dynamism. The EuropeanCommunity and its member States hope that this progresswill swiftly bear positive results for the living and workingconditions of their populations.Latin America is a continent at peace  continuing itseconomic recovery in accordance with the objectives ofdemocratically elected Governments. In several of thesecountries  rapid population growth  social imbalances anddrug-trafficking are  however  still a considerable handicapin the march towards progress.More attention has been paid by the authorities to theindigenous peoples  but certain tragic events have occurredto remind us of the precarious conditions in which thosepeoples live.The European Community and its member Stateswelcome the substantially improved prospects for peace andstability in the Middle East. They hope that following therecent Israeli-Palestinian agreements new decisive steps willbe taken by Israel and the Arab countries directly concernedin the Middle East peace process. The recentIsraeli-Jordanian declaration of principles is a positive movein this direction. We call upon this Assembly to takeaccount of these major developments when considering thesituation in the Middle East.The European Community and its member States  inkeeping with their long-standing position  stand ready toassume  in close coordination with the competentinternational institutions  an important part in the generalcoordination of the assistance offered by the internationalcommunity to the Palestinian people in the occupiedterritories. In this connection donor countries will  above all have to be guided by criteria of efficiency and speed.During this difficult period the United Nations has notbeen merely a passive onlooker.The World Conference on Human Rights made itpossible to adopt a Final Declaration which reaffirms andenriches the universal consensus on the essential respect duein all circumstances to the human person. The ViennaProgramme of Action provides for a large number ofmeasures to ensure greater respect for  and promotion of such rights throughout the world. The European Communityand its member States will endeavour  from the presentsession  to achieve application of these measures  inparticular as regards increased resources for the Centre forHuman Rights and the appointment of a United Nations highcommissioner for human rights.Active preparations have continued for other worldconferences  on population  social development and thepromotion of women. The follow-up to Rio was ensured bythe first meeting of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment  which  from the outset  established a relationof partnership  which we consider to be highly promising.The ""Agenda for Peace"" has been discussed in variousbodies. The warm welcome it has received has beenfollowed by various practical measures of implementation.We would  however  like our Assembly to show morewillingness to abandon its reservations regarding certaintypes of preventive action which have already been adoptedin practice by the Security Council and theSecretary-General.The Organization itself has embarked on and madeprogress with a series of restructuring measures. The mostcomplex is probably the restructuring of the SecurityCouncil  but it is encouraging that this topic is now thesubject of open dialogue.Pending a reform which would not compromise itsefficiency  the Council has kept up the pace of its activities.It has given a larger place in practice to the concepts ofpreventive diplomacy and cooperation with regionalorganizations. The Secretary-General has resolutely backedthis trend both through his numerous visits on the ground orthose of his personal representatives and through theadjustments he has made within the Secretariat. These havefocused particularly on strengthening the departmentsresponsible for managing peace-keeping operations. Theindispensable extension of these services has not yet beencompleted and will require further assistance from theMember States. Indeed  there has been an overwhelmingincrease in the United Nations operations in this area overthe last few years. They have not simply multiplied: theirobjectives have also diversified. In several cases  thetraditional task of peace-keeping has had to be supplemented12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionor  initially  replaced by the much more delicate task ofrestoring peace.The Organization has  in the eyes of some  met withfailure in the very difficult situations with which it has hadto cope in the former Yugoslavia and Somalia. Theduplicity of some warlords constitutes a permanent threat ofdestabilization.But  in no circumstances has the internationalcommunity chosen to combine humanitarian-aid missionswith peace-restoring missions. The use of force has beenseen only as a last resort in order to come to the help ofpeople held hostage by self-proclaimed leaders. OurOrganization has consequently been constrained to use under certain circumstances  means corresponding to theprovocations it has had to face. We must  however  drawlessons from the experience acquired through these variousoperations.The breadth and complexity of humanitarian crisesthroughout the world also require greater coordination ofhumanitarian assistance both during strategic planning ofoperations and during their implementation on the ground.The spirit of perseverance  in compliance with theCharter and human rights  is more necessary than ever. Itenabled Cambodia to implement the Paris Agreements inconditions which proved to be very difficult - as indeed theyhad promised to be. This represents a great victory for theCambodian people as well as a remarkable success for theUnited Nations  and was achieved through unprecedentedeffort: by numerous Governments  by thousands of officialsand volunteers  and also by large numbers of soldiers dozens of whom sacrificed their lives. The EuropeanCommunity and its member States pay tribute to the ""BlueHelmets"" who  frequently killed in cold blood  have beenvictims of their duty throughout the world. Their safety  aswell as that of all United Nations staff  must be improvedand the pursuit of their aggressors must be organized moreeffectively.The European Community and its member States arealso convinced of the need to react to the consequences ofthe presence of mines resulting from armed conflicts. Thesedevices claim numerous victims every year amongst thecivilian population and jeopardize the rehabilitation of vastareas of territory ravaged by war. We ask this Assembly toconsider the draft resolution which we have submitted onthis subject with a view to a more systematic and effectiveorganization of assistance in mine-clearing. We alsowelcome the French initiative of asking the United NationsSecretary-General to convene a conference to review the1981 Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Useof Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemedto Be Excessively Injurious or to Have IndiscriminateEffects.Thus  the overall picture of activities by the UnitedNations and its Members during the last 12 months is farfrom disappointing  and I could have listed many otherpositive developments. However  when we consider thedifficulties facing us  it is hard to claim categorically that whatever happens  the United Nations will be able to meetthe challenges of the future effectively.The Secretariat’s capacities are being used to the full;they are no longer sufficient to deal with Member States’wishes in every case. The Organization’s coffers are emptyor virtually so. The development of new activities ishampered more and more often by disagreements about theallocation of costs. Most of the major contributors  who areseriously affected in their own countries by an unfavourableeconomic situation  regard strict budgetary restraint as moreimportant than ever. The cost of peace-keeping operationsalone will be $3.6 billion for 1993.In addition to the immediate cash-flow problems  thereis an increasing structural deficit in the balance between theability to take multilateral action and ever-increasing requestsfor intervention. What can we do to ensure that the UnitedNations does not fall victim to its own success? We feelthat finding a solution entails three areas of action.First  of course  all Member States must pay theircontributions fully and in a timely manner. That is afundamental obligation with which the European Communityand its member States never fail to comply. The effort thisrequires is neither more nor less than that demanded of othercontributors  be they ""big"" or ""small""  for each MemberState is required to make a contribution in line with itsability to pay. Failure to pay represents a serious breach ofthe commitments entered into  and it is all the moreregrettable that certain defaulting countries at the same timelay claim to a privileged role in the Organization’s debatesand decisions.Secondly  the various reforms undertaken in order toimprove the operational efficiency of the Organization haveto be pursued with a maximum of determination. We havein mind in particular the management of the Secretariat  thecontrol of its expenditures and the forthcoming restructuringin the economic and social sector. It is unacceptable that theobjectives set could not be met owing to interminableForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 13negotiations or power struggles between senioradministrators.Thirdly  although the United Nations remains anintergovernmental body  it is called upon more and morefrequently to fulfil a central government task  withresponsibility for solving each and every problem that mayarise.In order to cope with this growing tide of demands  theSecretary-General in his ""Agenda for Peace"" has quiterightly stressed the need for cooperation with regionalorganizations and arrangements.But are they ready? Do they exist everywhere? Doesthe strengthening of cooperation between the United Nationsand regional organizations offer real prospects if the latter donot become effective centres of decision and action? Wefeel that  without the capacity for swift and ongoingintervention on a regional scale  preventive diplomacy by ourOrganization is a resource which is undoubtedlyindispensable but of limited scope. It will indeed facilitatesuccesses here and there  but will be insufficient to come togrips with the most deep-rooted and most threateningantagonisms. If nothing changes  the danger of entirecountries imploding is real. The situation will channelmultilateral resources more and more into makeshift rescueand rehabilitation operations  to the detriment of collectivesustainable development objectives.In this connection the positive effects of an area ofstability such as the European Community no longer need tobe demonstrated. The European Community was inspired atthe start by a profound desire for peacemaking andreconstruction. The same needs and aspirations are to befound elsewhere in the world but have not been matched bya comparable response.We believe that there is no alternative to theestablishment of such areas in every continent. The resolutepursuit of regional economic integration is a decisive andindispensable step in that direction. The benefits ofeconomies of scale and the free movement of persons andgoods then contribute as much to consolidating peace as tosharing prosperity. By uniting to form centres of stabilityand progress  the participating countries gradually freethemselves of the mounting problems and crises which  atthis time of tremendous change  tend to be more than theycan cope with on their own.In addition to these areas of stability  it is alsonecessary to create or strengthen broader regionalmechanisms  making it possible for a number of subregionsto develop principles of peaceful and prosperous coexistence.Here  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europecan serve  if not as a universal model  at least as a source ofinspiration. Even if its ability to intervene directly islimited  it constitutes an indispensable platform for dialogue.When internal or bilateral crises occur  it encourages theneighbouring countries to show moderation and thuscontributes to limiting the conflict. As respect for commonrules grows  more concrete collective actions can beenvisaged.These are the essential tools for achieving the threefoldobjective which the Secretary-General recommends in hislatest report on the activities of the Organization: peace development and democracy.Already 32 years ago  a young Egyptian jurist declaredat the Academy of International Law:""To encourage assemblies of States in a world thatis becoming more and more Balkanized  to playthe role of bringing peoples together and to offermassive and constant aid to underdevelopedcountries: these should be the primary objectivesof the international organization."" (Recueil descours  Académie de Droit International  La Haye 1960  II  pp. 69-70)This jurist is today at the head of our Organization.To be sure  in all continents regional bodies havealready embarked on this course of action: in the past yearthey have contributed  in cooperation with the UnitedNations  to crucial mediation and peace-keeping ventures -but always after the conflict had flared up. Areas of genuinestability and more reliable regional mechanisms would makeit possible to forestall major crises by reducing their causes.Regional integration indeed can only help contain thecollective frustrations and anxieties that fuel nationalistmovements. It also provides a formidable incentive foreconomic growth and therefore a strategic element incombating poverty. Finally  regional economic integration as it is progressively being built  simply eliminates theoption of war from the thinking of the Governments andpeoples involved.The disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and itstragic consequences make it all too clear that the commentswe have just made relate to a course of action that willprove long and demanding rather than a miracle cure.14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionNeither the European Community nor the Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe has been able to preventthe outbreak of the conflict and the subsequent series ofdisasters. Like the United Nations and the United States ofAmerica  the European Community and its member Stateshave consequently been accused of lacking strategy and ofindifference. For the European Community and itsmembers  one of the lessons to be learned from thiscatastrophe is that the deepening of its own internal relations- more Europe rather than less Europe - would strengthenthe role it must play as an instrument for promoting stabilityand peace in Europe and neighbouring areas.No one can dispute  however  the fact that the EuropeanCommunity and its member States have endeavoured tomediate from the earliest days of the conflict. It was themembers of the European Community who  going againstthe current  managed to persuade the whole Security Councilto react to the worsening situation. Without compromisingtheir positions of principle  and despite numerousdisappointments  the member States of the Community haveat no point wearied of their thankless task.The efforts deployed at the London and GenevaConferences bear witness to this. As you are aware  theEuropean Community and its member States have played afundamental role on the ground  particularly through theactivities of their monitors  in the implementation ofsanctions and through their contribution to the UnitedNations Protection Force and to measures to help the victimsof the civil war.The European Community and its member States alsoreiterate their readiness to participate in the implementationof a peace plan accepted by all the parties.The Treaty of Maastricht on the European Union shouldprovide us with the means of strengthening the Union’sability to act in the world  in particular by implementing thecommon foreign and security policy. Once it has enteredinto force - which should happen in the next few days - thatTreaty will enable the European Union to play an enhancedrole in all areas of international policy and security and willestablish close working relations between the EuropeanUnion and the Western European Union. Moreover  theimminent enlargement of the European Union to include newmembers will simply increase its ability to exercise astabilizing influence over adjacent countries.The enlargement of the European Union and itsreadiness to conclude association and cooperation agreementsof ever wider scope with virtually all regions and countriesof the globe are proof of our sincere desire to forge aheadwith the building of Europe while at the same time openingEurope to the world. This is the kind of Europe that isproving increasingly able to serve the objectives of theCharter. It provides encouragement to other countries andregions to unite  to join together  as Europe has done  in thecommon task of achieving greater peace in tomorrow’sworld."
"13",539,"BEN",48,1993,"On behalf of the delegation of Benin and on behalf of theGovernment and the people of Benin  I should like to extendmy warm congratulations to Ambassador Insanally on hiswell-deserved election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at this session. His unanimous election as leaderof our deliberations testifies to his abilities; it is alsorepresents an honour for his country and draws attention tothe role played by Caribbean countries in the internationalarena.I take this opportunity to extend my sincerecongratulations to his predecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  whoForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 43ably presided over the work of the General Assembly at itsforty-seventh session.It is also a great pleasure and a privilege for me to paya well-deserved tribute to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali Secretary-General of the United Nations  who effectively andsuccessfully heads this global Organization and who isworking intensively to restore peace and security to thevarious hotbeds of tension throughout the world.The delegation of Benin solemnly welcomes the newStates that have joined the world community to make theircontribution to respect for the common basic values of thenew society which together  we  the people of the world  areendeavouring to build. I welcome the Czech Republic  theSlovak Republic  Eritrea  the Principality of Monaco and thePrincipality of Andorra  whose admission enhances theuniversality of this Organization.We are meeting here  as we do each year under similarcircumstances  to consider together ways and means ofpromoting peace and prosperity for all our peoples.Since the last session of the General Assembly  wehave witnessed many important events that have given theinternational community as a whole new prospects and newchallenges in its quest for peace.We welcome the fact that the confrontation between thetwo blocs  which for so long had created political tension has today been replaced by the universal values ofdemocracy and equality in international relations. Thesevalues are interdependent with economic and socialdevelopment and with the security of all States.It is also encouraging to see that renewed confidence inthe effectiveness of the United Nations in settling conflictshas strengthened the credibility and the capacity to act of theOrganization  opening up new areas in which it is able toencourage the settlement of a vast range of problems thatafflict humankind.In just five years  the tasks of the Organization in thearea of maintaining peace have increased and widenedconsiderably.Despite positive developments  changes currently underway that were designed to provide for greater freedom andencourage the establishment of more just and more dynamicsocieties have unfortunately also become the source of newchallenges and even greater uncertainty in internationalrelations. Each day  in one place or another on our planet civil wars  territorial partition  ethnic confrontations andtribal or religious struggles demand the urgent interventionof the United Nations.We can see  therefore  how difficult is the task of theOrganization  which is obliged to respect a fragile balancebetween the sovereignty of States and the duty to intervene.In Europe  the political picture has changeddramatically in just a few years. The hopes born of thedisappearance of the Berlin Wall have been virtually dashedby another  anachronistic war in the former Yugoslavia andby the situation in some of the States that emerged from thedisintegration of the Soviet Union  thus threatening stabilityand security on the old continent.In Africa  major civil wars continue to rage. Thesewars are responsible for the untold suffering and destructionwhich are hampering efforts at socio-economic developmentand recovery in our continent.Africa needs peace and security. Without them thecourageous and far-reaching reforms undertaken at thepolitical and economic levels cannot be successful.The twenty-ninth summit of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) held in Cairo in June of this year provided uswith an opportunity to adopt a mechanism for theprevention  management and settlement of conflicts. Thatmechanism is an important step forward in the acceptance ofthe imperative of peace  which is so essential todevelopment. Indeed  conflict management remains a majorconcern for our countries  as the massive movements ofrefugees that result from conflicts distract us  to our sorrow from the paramount task of development.West Africa  which until now has been a peaceful landof asylum  welcoming refugees from the rest of the continentand even beyond  is now living through a particularlydifficult time  with an unprecedented increase in emergencysituations and in the number of refugees  which in less thanfour years has risen from 20 000 to 1.2 million.Here  I would pay a tribute to the humanitarianactivities and the considerable efforts of the United Nationsto settle conflicts in Africa and elsewhere in the world.Because of the support of the United Nations  theLiberian conflict today offers encouraging prospects for apeaceful and lasting settlement. The major protagonists in44 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionthe Liberian tragedy now seem disposed towards dialogueand agreement. They met in Geneva from 10 to17 July 1993  with the help of representatives of theSecretary-General of the Organization of African Unity andthe Executive Secretariat of the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS) and of the Acting Presidentof that Community  to seek ways and means of silencing theweapons of war and restoring peace to their country. Thosepresent at the Geneva meeting successfully prepared acomprehensive agreement that takes account of all aspects ofthe Liberian tragedy.In Cotonou on 25 July 1993  representatives of thevarious factions and of the interim Government of Liberiasigned that peace agreement  thanks to the mediation of Mr.Nicéphore Soglo  President of the Republic of Benin  andActing President of ECOWAS. Benin is pleased by thewillingness of our Liberian brothers to enter into thisagreement and by their spirit of constructive and fraternaldialogue  without which nothing positive could have beenachieved. Benin continues to believe that dialogue is theonly way of restoring peace to this war-torn country.We welcome the positive results thus far achieved inthe implementation of the agreement  most notably theobservation of the cease-fire by all the warring factions andthe cessation of hostilities.In particular  the delegation of Benin welcomes theunanimous adoption by the Security Council of resolution856 (1993)  which supports the efforts of ECOWAS andapproves the deployment in Liberia of an advance team of30 military observers to participate in the work of the JointCease-fire Monitoring Committee. We also welcomeresolution 866 (1993)  which establishes the United NationsObserver Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL).This Mission can be made possible only by amobilization of the international community to support theefforts of ECOWAS by  inter alia  contributing to thespecial trust fund  which would facilitate the dispatch ofreinforcements to ECOMOG by the African States and helpprovide for the upkeep of the contingents made available toECOMOG by the participating States  as well as by helpingin carrying out the work of removing mines  providinghumanitarian and developmental assistance and promotingthe healthy evolution of the electoral process.The three signatories of the 25 July 1993 peaceagreement met in Cotonou from 15 to 18 August 1993 to setup the Council of State  the transitional executive body. The25 July peace agreement promises finally to put an end tothe very long  devastating war in Liberia.From this rostrum  I would like to make an appeal toall the parties who signed that agreement  urging them tocontinue to abide by the commitments entered into duringthe Cotonou talks and to work with ECOWAS and theUnited Nations for the proper and swift implementation ofthose commitments  in order to put an end to the sufferingof the Liberian people and ensure that the nationalreconciliation process will proceed to its successfulcompletion.Along the lines of the solution under way in Liberia we should work to ensure that peace returns to Somalia Angola  the Sudan and Mozambique.In Angola  for example  despite the great hopes andexpectations aroused by the agreements reached in Estoril Portugal  we are seriously disturbed and deeply saddened bythe resumption of hostilities following the refusal of UNITAto recognize the results of the free elections of 29 and30 September 1992.Benin welcomes the change in the position taken by theUnited States Government  which has now granteddiplomatic recognition to the legal Government of Angola.This action by the Clinton Administration strengthens theposition of the international community in support of theverdict of the ballot box rather than the compulsion of thegun.In South Africa  developments are encouraging. Themultipartite talks made it possible to reach an agreement on inter alia  the establishment of a transitional executivecouncil and the holding of the first democratic andnon-racial elections in the history of South Africa  scheduledfor 27 April 1994.The Government of Benin supports the courageous andresponsible appeal by the Chairman of the African NationalCongress  Mr. Nelson Mandela  before the SpecialCommittee against Apartheid in this prestigious Hall of theGeneral Assembly on 24 September 1993. He invited theinternational community to lift all economic sanctionsagainst South Africa  except for the arms embargo. Giventhe positive development that will lead this country  whichis undergoing a process of reform  to implement theprinciple of ""one man  one vote""  the time has come for allMembers of our universal Organization to support thepeaceful transformation of South Africa.Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 45Benin wishes to see the African continent free itself ofall fratricidal and internal wars  of all conflicts that impedeits development. It is my firm hope that the logic of warwill now progressively yield to the logic of peace anddevelopment in Africa.Turning to the Middle East  26 years after Israel’soccupation of the Arab territories  Benin cannot but greetwith joy the historic agreement between the IsraeliGovernment and the Palestine Liberation Organizationgranting autonomy to Gaza and Jericho.That agreement marks the beginning of a just andlasting peace that will allow every State in the region including Palestine and Israel  to live within secure andinternationally recognized borders guaranteed by theinternational community. Our duty is thus to encourage thetwo essential parties  as well as all parties involved  toundertake or to continue the dialogue necessary for acomprehensive peace in the Middle East.In the Persian Gulf region the full restoration of thesovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait helped toreaffirm the fundamental principles governing inter-Staterelations. In this connection we sincerely hope that SecurityCouncil resolution 833 (1993)  on the demarcation of theinternational border between Iraq and Kuwait  will berespected by all States. Pending issues such as that of theKuwaiti prisoners of war must be settled so as to open theway to fraternity  cooperation and solidarity in thatsubregion.The atmosphere of relaxation of tension which beganwith the end of the cold war and which has made possiblea new spirit of consensus  inter alia in the Security Council is still rather uncertain for much remains to be done toconsolidate peace.We must recognize today that the idea of peace can nolonger be based on a build-up of weapons; it must be based rather  on concerted efforts on their reduction and completeelimination. The balance of terror is now yielding to ameeting of the minds  the hearts and the actions of man.That is why the signing of the United NationsConvention on the Prohibition of the Development Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons andon Their Destruction  in Paris on 13-15 January 1993  notonly helps to strengthen international peace and security butalso offers prospects for international cooperation in the areaof using the chemicals industry for peaceful purposes.Benin  which is dedicated to peace and economic andsocial progress  urges the international community to refrainfrom any military use of science so that science can bedevoted to development  and international peace andsecurity.The decision by Russia  the United States of America the United Kingdom and France to extend their moratoriumon nuclear testing until September 1994 proves that theGovernments of those nuclear Powers are increasinglyinterested in measures that will make it possible to usescientific and technical developments exclusively forpeaceful purposes.My country joins the rest of the internationalcommunity in congratulating the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea on the reversal of its decision towithdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT)  for that withdrawal from theTreaty would only have weakened it  given that its strengthlies in its universality.The determination shown by Member States to movetowards the solution of regional conflicts and the new senseof urgency over new threats to the well-being of the planetcreate a historic opportunity for us to tackle the economicproblems facing all of our countries.Indeed  this forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly is taking place against a background of generaleconomic crisis. In the new economic order which ischaracterized by increased trade between three dominantgroups - Western Europe  North America and the Pacific-Asia zone - Africa is virtually left out.The developed North seems to have less and less needof Africa’s products and Africa for its part no longer has themeans to buy the goods and services of the North. What ismore  the international community does not seem veryanxious to find a better way of dealing with the Africancountries’ debt burden.This situation cannot but lead to a slowing down intrade on the world market and directly affect Africaneconomies which are already suffering.In these circumstances our survival necessarily requiressustained regional integration so that we can be in a betterposition to deal with the vicissitudes of the internationaleconomic environment and take up the challenge of how todevelop our own continent.46 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionIn his ""An Agenda for Peace"" the Secretary-Generalemphasized the role of regional organizations in establishingpeace and preventive diplomacy. This role naturally extendsto development too. We cannot overemphasize theimportance of integration for development.In the case of Africa such integration is a means ofencouraging trade  investment  and research and developmentcooperation among African countries.That is why the Heads of State or Government of themembers of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS)  meeting in Cotonou from 22 to24 July 1993  adopted and signed a revised Treaty of theEconomic Community of West African States and reaffirmedtheir determination to bring a new dynamism to the processof regional integration.If the development of Africa is primarily theresponsibility of the Africans themselves  it is no lessimportant for the international community to recognize theprinciple of shared responsibility and full partnership withAfrica.In this connection we should note that theimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s is not living up to allthe hopes that the African countries placed in it. It isnecessary further to strengthen national capacities and tocreate a climate that is favourable to development.While Benin welcomes the study on the need and thefeasibility of the establishment of a fund to diversify Africancommodities  we strongly hope that bolder action will betaken with a view to implementing the new programme andensuring the input of the major financial contributions whichare necessary for the establishment of the fund in 1994.Hence we must increase the quality and the quantity ofassistance to Africa.In this spirit Benin will in a few days be participatingin the Tokyo International Conference on AfricanDevelopment. This Conference  to be held against thebackdrop of the new world economic and political order ofthe post-cold-war era  will provide the internationalcommunity with a new framework for discussing how toreaffirm the question of Africa’s economic development asone of the major concerns of the world today.Our hope  widely shared by African countries  is thatthe Conference  apart from adopting a declaration  willactually lead to specific actions and commitments in supportof Africa.The African countries also hope that the TokyoDeclaration of 9 July 1993 of the Group of Sevenindustrialized countries - which was designed to replace theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World BankStructural Adjustment Programme with another mechanismthat would be better adapted to the conditions and realitiesof developing countries - will soon take effect.If this new mechanism is to have some hope ofsucceeding  it will have to be drawn up followingconsultations with the countries that are actuallyexperiencing the harsh social consequences of the StructuralAdjustment Programme.If we are to win this wager for development  to whichAfrica aspires  we have to involve women and children  whorepresent the majority of the populations of our countries and so  above all  we have to educate and train young peopleand adults.In this connection  the Government of the Republic ofBenin is actively preparing for the International Year of theFamily in 1994. We shall also be participating with greatinterest in the International Conference on Population andDevelopment  to be held in Cairo from 5 to13 September 1994. In addition  we wish to make a realcontribution to the preparatory work for the WorldConference on Women  which will be held in Beijing in1995.The fact that these various conferences are to be heldshows that matters relating to social development areeliciting unprecedented interest in the world. This can alsobe seen from the decision to convene a World Summit forSocial Development in 1995. This renewal of interest ismotivated by the profound changes in the social and politicalsituation in the world  and the shifting of priorities at theState level.Democracy cannot become stronger unless there is atleast a minimum level of prosperity for peoples. Oneobstacle to this strengthening of democracy and thus the fulldevelopment of human rights is poverty  the poverty inwhich the majority of our populations live.The right to development has been ignored for too long.It must now be regarded as a priority right  a sacred right.Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 47This right to development is the right to dignity  to personaldevelopment  and is not compatible with the subhumanstatus afflicting millions of human beings  particularly inAfrica  Asia  Latin America and the Caribbean.The right to development is a human right and anational right  and that is why we welcome the conclusionsof the World Conference on Human Rights  which was heldin Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993. That Conferencecertainly marked the beginning of a new era which  we trust will witness the gradual elimination of the currentinternational economic order  in which two thirds ofmankind cannot meet their basic needs and in which600 million human beings are living in almost absolutepoverty. The elimination of such poverty is one of the basicobjectives of Agenda 21. The establishment of anInternational Day for the Eradication of Poverty  the first ofwhich will be celebrated on 17 October next  is one step inthis direction.We can never say often enough that the majorecological problems facing our countries today have aplanetary dimension that requires a world-wide approach.This is why the United Nations Conference on Environmentand Development  held in Rio in June 1992  madesustainable development one of the major concerns of theinternational community.That Conference marked a turning-point in the way thatwe look at our future. It must now be approached in anintegrated manner as we work on our development policies.Agenda 21  the basic document that emerged from thatConference  is an enormous programme of action for the latetwentieth and early twenty-first centuries. It requiresGovernments to adopt national strategies focused onsustainable development  in close cooperation with theprivate and public sectors.Here I am happy to draw attention to the majorimportance my country attaches to follow-up of the decisionsand recommendations of Rio. Benin welcomes theestablishment of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment  which held its first session here in New Yorkfrom 14 to 25 June 1993  and we welcome the work of theIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee for the elaborationof an international convention to combat desertification inthose countries experiencing serious drought and/ordesertification  particularly in Africa. That Committee hasalready met  from 24 May to 3 June 1993 in Nairobi andfrom 13 to 24 September 1993 in Geneva.Pursuant to the Rio recommendations  on 9 to13 August 1993 Benin held a national seminar on follow-upstrategies to implement the results of the United NationsConference on Environment and Development  includingconsideration of chapter 12 of Agenda 21  on how to combatdesertification and the impact of drought. The seminar washeld at a time when the international community and thedevelopment partners of the third world countries were fullyinvolved in thinking about what strategies should be used tomake this concept of sustainable development operational.This seminar was proof of the political will of theGovernment of Benin to abide by the commitments weentered into at Rio.The Cotonou seminar recommended  inter alia  theestablishment of a national commission on sustainabledevelopment. A drafting committee for a national Agenda21  the major guidelines for which were decided on by theseminar  has been set up. It should finish its work by theend of this year.In two years  we shall be celebrating the fiftiethanniversary of the founding of the United Nations.The years that have passed since 1945 have beenmarked by ongoing  fundamental change and by aconsiderable increase in the membership of the Organizationas well as by a significant widening of the Organization’sarea of activity.It is thus obvious that the Organization needs to berestructured to meet our world’s current requirements. Thisis why Benin supports the efforts under way to restructureand revitalize the United Nations in its economic and socialsectors and related areas.In the view of the delegation of Benin  the reformshould be designed to ensure better coordination of theactivities of the United Nations and wiser utilization of itshuman and financial resources.Benin  while still open to dialogue in negotiations endorses the view of the Group of 77  particularly on thequestion of how to allocate seats on the governing bodies ofbodies such as the United Nations Development Programme the United Nations Fund for Population Activities and theUnited Nations Children’s Fund.In the political area  my country is willing to considerall proposals that take account of the concerns and interestsof all the various actors  large and small  in the internationalpolitical arena at the end of this second millennium.48 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionReform of the Security Council is a matter of particularimportance to all Member States. Benin will follow closelyany proposal for reform that might strengthen theeffectiveness of the Council and avoid transforming it intoa forum for sterile debate or logjams or into an instrumentthat benefits only a privileged few.Before I conclude my statement  I should like to recallthat if we wish to approach the next millennium intranquillity  if we wish to draw satisfaction from the effortsmade so far along the tortuous and difficult path towardsdevelopment  we must do everything possible to give moresustained attention to the principle of world-wide partnershipand the duty to show solidarity which is necessarily impliedby the new international order that now governs theinternational community.It is Benin’s wish that mankind  when it draws up itsfirst balance sheet of this new era  should see a drop in thenumber of ills that continue to undermine the twentiethcentury  namely poverty  famine  endemic diseases such asmalaria  the AIDS pandemic and its devastating human social and economic consequences  illiteracy  environmentaldegradation  underdevelopment  and all those other ills thatbeset us.In an increasingly interdependent world  and faced withthis challenge  nations must agree to yield part - only part -of their national sovereignty to our universal human values and to show greater determination to coexist despite cultural political  social and economic differences. Only in that waycan the world of the twenty-first century be a morehospitable one for people  wherever they may live andwhoever they may be."
"14",585,"BFA",48,1993,"Before I begin my statement  I should like to offermy condolences to the Government and people of India onthe natural disaster that has just struck them. I should liketo assure them  on behalf of the people of Burkina Faso  thatwe grieve most profoundly with them.I wish  at the outset  to congratulate Mr. Insanally onhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsforty-eighth session and to wish him every success in thedischarge of the important responsibilities thus madeincumbent upon him.I should also like to pay a tribute to his predecessor Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria  for the dedication with whichhe presided over the work of the Assembly at its fortyseventh session.I wish also to take advantage of this opportunity towelcome the new States that have joined our Organization.We look forward to their active participation in the work ofthe Assembly so that we might  together  strive to preservethe peace  bring development to our peoples and ensurejustice among nations.May I also convey to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the most sincere congratulationsand encouragement of the Government of Burkina Faso inrespect of his tireless efforts day after day to safeguardpeace throughout the world and also to revitalize the UnitedNations system.While the ideals enshrined in the United NationsCharter remain as valid as they were on the very first day the international community continues to suffer theaftershocks of East-West confrontation. What I said at theforty-seventh session remains true:""The collapse of one of the two blocs did not solve theworld’s problems. Rather  it emphasized the NorthSouth split; old wounds that are still open; internalcontradictions within regions; and divisions amongnations."" (A/47/PV.21  p. 86)In Africa  prospects run from an anxious outlook insome cases to measured hope in others. In this connection acting on his own convictions as well as on those of BurkinaFaso as a whole as to the needed and indeed indispensableintegration of our continent  President Blaise Compaore hasbecome active in subregional mediation and is thus makingour contribution to the realization of this grand design forAfrica.In Angola  the process sponsored by the United Nationsand the international community as a whole is now beingtorpedoed by UNITA and Mr. Jonas Savimbi  with theirrefusal to accept the outcome of the elections. The sufferingof the Angolan people has been exacerbated  and this todayis the part of the world where  more than anywhere else people are dying as a result of civil war. Having learnedfrom the experience of Angola  the Security Council hasissued useful  indeed necessary  recommendations forMozambique. RENAMO is somewhat slow in implementingthese measures. We invite them to pursue the path ofnegotiations  to overcome the reluctance shown  and to moveresolutely with the Government of Mozambique towardsreconciliation and reconstruction.In Somalia  after an encouraging start  United Nationsaction is running into obstacles that are having an adverseeffect on the very nature of the peace-keeping operation.We are still convinced that while firmness is necessary dialogue and negotiation with all parties are equallynecessary.In South Africa  acts of violence continue. Each weekthe macabre death toll is mounting as a result of attacks onpublic transportation. This is not a climate conducive tosignificant  indeed decisive  elections. However  the will forchange which guides the majority of the protagonists in thetragedy that is apartheid in its death throes must prevail overall manner of extremism. In view of this  Burkina Fasohails the statement made by the President of the AfricanNational Congress  Mr. Nelson Mandela  before the SpecialCommittee against Apartheid on 24 September 1993.As for Rwanda  Liberia and Western Sahara  BurkinaFaso hopes the agreements achieved can indeed beimplemented so that the people of these regions may at longlast know peace.The eruption of crises of ethnic  religious or otherorigin is continuing  while the conflict in Bosnia andHerzegovina goes on and on  in contempt of internationallaw and of the Security Council. We must thereforewelcome the fact that in Cambodia and in El Salvador theprocess set in train has led to a beginning of normalization Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 35and we must encourage Kuwait and Iraq to abide bySecurity Council resolution 833 (1993).While in political terms the picture is mixed  ineconomic terms it is bleaker. The world economy is inrecession. Weighed down by its debt  by the fall in rawmaterial prices  by the deterioration in its terms of trade andby natural disasters  fluctuations in climate  desertificationand drought  Africa is staggering from one calamity to thenext. Structural adjustment programmes have beensqueezing even harder a continent that has been relegated tothe sidelines notwithstanding its resources and the sacrificesit has been making. The problems are known  and torehearse them here now would sound like a litany and sterilerepetition. The solutions  too  are known. In this respect the New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990shas yet to be implemented.A year after the Rio Conference on Environment andDevelopment  the commitments and the promises made havestill to take tangible form. However  the same minoritycontinues to lay waste the planet’s natural resources  whilepoverty is increasing and putting down roots in regionswhere it used to occur only from time to time or was onlya localized phenomenon.The global village is no longer just a slogan; it hasbecome a living reality that at the same time affects theconcept of security. New laws are surfacing everywhere inan effort to stem a new deluge  immigration. Thesemeasures are an illusion and will remain so long as peopledo not realize  or refuse to realize  that the root of theproblem lies in the socio-economic inequalities that afflictthe world.In addition  population growth will cause unbearablepressure if real development policies are not put in placenow. The tragedy lies more in the concentration ofresources for a minority than in their scarcity. A communitythat is aware of its shortcomings and blind spots can stillheal itself if it has the will to find and to take the necessarymedicine.The General Agreement on Tariffs and Tradenegotiations - the Uruguay Round - must be concluded asquickly as possible and must take into account the needs ofthe developing countries.Once again  it is the concept of security that has led tothe monstrous stockpiles of weapons of destruction. Nuclearweapons are the crowning achievement of this marchtowards the abyss. To limit the risks  a Non-ProliferationTreaty was opened for signature  and almost all States havebeen invited to sign and ratify it. This is a praiseworthyinitiative  but it is not enough. For the Non-ProliferationTreaty to have any meaning  in due course the nuclearweapon States must give them up  and we must see ourplanet totally and genuinely freed from the nuclear threat.The preservation of the species and of the planet isthreatened in two ways: the nuclear menace and the harmwe are doing to the environment.Burkina Faso is participating actively in the work of theIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee for the elaborationof an international convention to combat desertification andof the Commission on Sustainable Development.It is interesting to note that the harm being done to theenvironment in the southern hemisphere comes more fromthe effort to survive than from the unbridled desire toconsume at all costs. The relationship established betweendevelopment and environment also establishes therelationship between respect for human rights anddevelopment. One of the great truths brought out andaccepted at the World Conference on Human Rights  held inVienna  is that there is a right to development. We cannottalk about human rights if elementary human rights - themost elementary human rights - are compromised byeconomic  financial and trade policies and strategies towhich some people fall victim. To commit oneself to humanrights nowadays is to commit oneself to changing the worldeverywhere and to accepting in every individual the personthat we want to be and to defend. It is humankind as awhole that we must defend  or nothing; any other approachmeans giving in to harmful and questionable divisionsbetween people.In the same context  the twin scourges of AIDS anddrug abuse must be fought on all fronts  using all availableresources. From 8 to 13 February this year Burkina Fasoheld a series of national seminars on drugs  in which wereaffirmed the need to provide help and support for the mostdisadvantaged countries in order to curb this threat.We have deadlines in 1994 and 1995  and must preparewith hard work and dedication to confront then the problemsof population at the Cairo World Conference; to promotewomen’s rights at the conference in Beijing; and  inCopenhagen  to focus on and respond to the need for socialdevelopment.The problems I have enumerated require constantcooperation from everybody. As we leave the cold warbehind  we have no better instrument for cooperation than36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionthe United Nations. However  the United Nations is in aworrying state because its finances are in a bad way  andthat is because some of the largest contributors have notfulfilled their obligations. It is therefore difficult to talkabout reforming  restructuring and revitalizing theOrganization when the primary task has not beenaccomplished. This is the first problem  because it is themost urgent.The second problem has to do with the chaotic situationin the world. This situation is giving rise to peace-keepingoperations  and their frequency and diversity have had aneffect - and in future will have an even greater effect - onthe functioning of the Organization. We approve of theSecretary-General’s pointing to preventive diplomacy as oneof the solutions. In this respect  at the last summit meetingof the Organization of African Unity  in Cairo in June 1993 Africa set up a conflict prevention  management andsettlement mechanism.The third problem arises from the Organization’sstructural inadequacy to respond to the nature of theproblems it will encounter from now on. Here again  thoughwe need imagination to open up new approaches and applyfresh solutions to old and new problems  we must not losesight of the fact that everyone must participate in theproposed solutions.The fourth problem stems from the notion ofdemocracy. It has been repeatedly proclaimed to be a cureall  but it cannot remain just a battle standard that we wavein front of the new troops who have just been won over tothe cause. Democracy must be transformed into a means ofaction for achieving better things  for achieving more.Whether within States or between States  democracy is aplant that does not stop growing once it has started.Thus we come to the question of how a body withlimits can function for and on behalf of all. For themoment  other considerations apply to the Security Council because it is the direct inheritor of the balance of power thatarose out of the Second World War. Forty-eight years later the debate can certainly be opened. However  as BurkinaFaso said during the forty-seventh session ""Clearly  the role and composition of the SecurityCouncil must be reviewed. But we fear that thediscussion might be limited to merely expanding a clubwhose members would continue to view their status asa privilege  not a weighty responsibility. The spirit andperhaps even the nature of the Council must bechanged. Clearly  we must begin the debate on theSecurity Council even if we are still bound by theterms of Article 108 of the Charter. Thedemocratization of international relations is necessary.""(A/47/PV.21  p. 87)It was in this political  economic  social andinternational environment that we heard the news on13 September 1993 that two brothers  who had sprung fromthe same land but had until now refused to recognize eachother  had met. Burkina Faso hails their mutual recognition.It is up to the Palestinian and Israeli leaders and peopleswhether this is the useful and welcome prelude to theirtaking a long and complex path  accompanied by theinternational community  offering its best wishes and itsgood offices.This hope is like a guttering flame that must be keptburning; it is the image of our human condition  which wemust constantly watch over. Only together can we succeedin doing so."
"15",628,"BGD",48,1993,"At this juncture on the eve of the twenty-first century  when the concepts ofdemocracy  human rights and world-wide cooperation are onthe ascendancy  I stand before this session of the UnitedNations General Assembly to share with MembersBangladesh’s views on the current world situation. I amhere to affirm our commitment to the emerging faith in theprospects for peace  prosperity and balanced developmentthroughout the world. In the light of the realities of theworld today  the United Nations is universally accepted asthe most effective platform for multilateralism. I should liketo take this opportunity to reaffirm our unwaveringconfidence in the United Nations.Before proceeding  I should like to extend toAmbassador Insanally our most cordial greetings on hiselection to the presidency of the forty-eighth session of theUnited Nations General Assembly. We are confident thathis wisdom and experience will add new dimensions anddynamism to the activities of the United Nations.At the same time  we are also grateful to ourSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessiondetermined efforts  which have given new vigour to theactivities of this forum. He has been guiding the UnitedNations with great dexterity and success through a criticalperiod of transition. I should like to reiterate our continuedsupport for his endeavours in fulfilling his important task.Five new nations have recently joined us in the UnitedNations. I welcome them in our midst. We look forward toworking in close cooperation with our new Members:Andorra  Eritrea  the Czech Republic  Monaco  The FormerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Slovakia.An unprecedented rise in democratic aspirationsworld-wide precipitated the end of the cold war. There is agrowing optimism about the prospect of a new worldeconomic order based on equitable distribution of resourcesand human rights. Bangladesh is proud to have played adefinite role in the world-wide resurgence of democracy.About two and a half years ago  we succeeded inestablishing a truly democratic Government following theelimination of the old autocratic regime  which had lastedabout a decade.Democracy and development are mutually reinforcing.Our success on the road to democracy depends largely onour ability to tackle the challenge of alleviating poverty. Wehave many limitations: there is a lack of capital; we lagbehind in technology. Handicapped by resource constraintsas we are  it is not possible for us to undertake this difficulttask alone: we need the cooperation of all.Today  democracy is universally recognized as the bestpolitical system. Democracy aims at building a prosperoussociety by creating avenues for the unstinted development ofhuman creativity and skill. If the process of development isdisrupted  democracy and stability are threatened. Nurturingthe emerging democratic spirit in the third-world countriescalls for sincere cooperation from the developedindustrialized nations.Today there exists a yawning gap between theeconomies and cultures of the developed countries of theNorth and those of the developing countries of the South.But one must realize that poverty is not the same asbankruptcy: the South  where Bangladesh belongs  has aglorious past  when there was economic and culturalprosperity. We are now engaged in the task of building anew future based on our culture  tradition and availability ofresources. For us  it is a matter of pride and satisfaction thatour people’s love for freedom has found concrete shape inthe establishment of democracy.We want to emphasize human creativity and humancapacity to toil. The much-talked-about new concept of a""human development index"" does not seem to be adequate:we feel that it must capture the indigenous culture andvalues of differing civilizations. We believe that a newdimension will be added to the overall developmentframework of the less developed countries if this proposal isaccepted.Our prime objective is to build a prosperous society andeconomy by consolidating national independence sovereignty  human rights and democracy. This calls forguaranteeing the security of small States like ours. As wework on new equations in international relations  the UnitedNations must take effective measures to ensure the securityof small States. The hopes and aspirations of millions ofpeople are linked to this. We feel that in the new worldorder that is taking shape following the end of the cold war mutual respect between large and small States should be theonly recognized norm. In order to ensure a future free fromwar and conflict  it is imperative that we ensure thesovereignty of small States.We believe that the international rule of law has a vitalrole to play in ensuring the security of small and weakStates. The priority areas in this context are: a river-waterconvention; the law of the sea; environmental protection; andthe status of refugees  economic migrants and displacedpersons. Universal acceptance of the jurisdiction of theInternational Court of Justice without reservation has becomean urgent necessity in the pursuit of peace.We all live on the same planet. World civilizationtoday and its accumulated store of knowledge is the jointachievement of all peoples of the world. Everyone has aclaim to an equal share of the world’s resources andprosperity. The great disparity that exists in the field oftechnology must be removed; therefore  we want a free flowof technology. We feel that the exclusivity of intellectualproperty rights is a great hindrance  frustrating the transferof technology; we call upon all concerned to refrain fromtaking a selfish view in this regard. A similar discriminatoryattitude is also evident with regard to the flow ofinformation: this is contrary to the concept of a free flow ofinformation throughout the globe. In order to establish awell-balanced world community  it is imperative to ensurethe free flow of both information and technology.Our existence is inseparable from the existence of ourplanet  and the existence of our planet is threatened today.The ecological balance is being disrupted  but the blame isbeing conveniently shifted to the developing countries:Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 21unfair conditions regarding the environment are beingimposed on them. In many ways  the industrially developedcountries are mainly responsible for environmental pollution.Given the resource constraints of the developing countries their capacity to pollute the environment is veryinsignificant: they are more preoccupied with resolving theireconomic problems. We believe that the majorresponsibility for the prevention of environmental pollutionlies  therefore  with the developed countries. Thoseindustrially developed countries that pollute the environmentin catering for their peoples’ demands for high living mustbear the responsibility of mending the damage done.We are acutely conscious of the need to protect theenvironment. We are frugal in our use of fuel  electricityand water resources. Bangladesh’s industrial sectorcontributes only marginally to environmental pollution. Ourjute industry and jute products are more acceptable  inenvironmental terms  than various chemical and syntheticproducts. However  in the face of the massive expansion ofthe use of synthetic fibres that pollute the environment ourjute industry is threatened with extinction. Millions ofpeople in several countries  including Bangladesh  depend onthe jute industry for their living. Thus  the production ofsynthetic fibres must be stopped  in the interests of theenvironment as well as of the millions who toil in the jutesector.We call upon the donor countries and the aidorganizations  in providing assistance  to pay due attentionto our indigenous initiatives and development programmes.The success of the development process would thus becomealmost impossible. Unrealistic conditions create unnecessaryobstacles in the way of the development process and thesmooth progress of democracy.In this context  I admit that a State cannot hope tobecome self-reliant through external aid and assistance alone.What we really need is liberalization of trade.Unfortunately  however  in the field of external trade thedeveloping countries are being subjected to all sorts ofdiscrimination by the developed countries. This must giveway to strong and realistic North-South trade links based onequality. To this end  the immediate and satisfactoryconclusion to the Uruguay Round of negotiations hasbecome imperative. Together with development assistance we seek trade and investment. In Bangladesh we havecreated a highly congenial climate for external investment.Contemporary experience has proved that the desireddevelopment cannot be achieved through dependence onexternal assistance alone; it is essential that trade andinvestment be expanded at the same time.We are engaged in an earnest endeavour to achieveeconomic prosperity by building upon our indigenousheritage. We are striving to forge a more productive andefficient workforce. We have made considerable progress inthe field of structural reform of the economy. Inflation is atits lowest level. After long years of recession  there hasbeen a definite increase in the rate of growth in agricultureand industry.We have also made considerable progress in theexpansion of education. We have launched the programmeentitled ""Food for Education"" as a means of ensuring theright to education of the poorer sections of our population.We aim to achieve a literacy rate of 60 per cent by the year2000. We have initiated a national social programme witha view to restricting the population within a desirable level.Our efforts have brought us to the threshold ofself-sufficiency in the production of food grains.In consonance with current world trends  we have alsosubscribed to a market economy. As I said earlier  ineconomic considerations poverty is the main economicchallenge that we face. In tackling this challenge  we haveadopted a new development model  whose purpose is toensure extensive participation by the people in thedevelopment process. We have adopted the ""Daal Bhaat""programme  which envisages the provision of basic nutritionfor the poor and deprived masses and the development ofhuman resources.We are expanding sanitation and primary health carefacilities throughout the country. Special priority is beinggiven to the integration of women in the developmentprocess. In this area  the Grameen Bank  the RuralDevelopment Board and the Agricultural Bank are makinga commendable contribution.We must encourage regional cooperation as asupplement to our efforts in multilateral cooperation.Against this backdrop  the seven countries of South Asia setup the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation(SAARC). As the current Chairperson of SAARC  I amtrying to intensify development cooperation between themember countries. During the seventh SAARC Summit which was held in Dhaka in April this year  we adoptedsome specific programmes for poverty alleviation. Besides initiatives have also been taken to further promotecooperation in various fields  including trade  education andculture.Along with regional cooperation  we have attachedpriority to the development and strengthening of good22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionneighbourly relations and to the resolution of outstandingbilateral problems with our neighbours. Unfortunately however  some issues remain unresolved with our neighbourIndia  the most important one being the sharing of water.We have not yet succeeded in convincing India as to whatis our fair share of water from the rivers that flow throughthe two countries. We share 54 rivers. Historically  andunder international law  we have a right - an inherent andlegal right - to the water resources of the common rivers.But since completion of the Farakka Barrage  India has beenunilaterally drawing Ganges water upstream. Withdrawal ofwater during the dry season causes serious drought  whilethe release of excess water during the rainy season producessevere floods in Bangladesh. This has created unimaginableadverse effects on the economy and environment ofBangladesh.The pledges given by India when the Farakka Barragewas commissioned remain unfulfilled. This unilateralwithdrawal of water  in complete disregard of the interestsof the people of Bangladesh  has brought more than40 million people in the Ganges basin - or  rather  thePadma basin - face to face with catastrophe  with disaster.The Farakka Barrage has become  for us  an issue oflife or death. Owing to obstruction of the natural flow at theBarrage  a process of desertification is evident throughoutthe northern and western parts of Bangladesh. As a result vegetation is dwindling  and  in the south  the spreadingsalinity threatens industries and agriculture with ruin.Increased siltation is reducing the navigability of rivers.Fish and animals will soon be in danger of extinction.Innumerable people  in various occupations  who dependedon the river Padma for their living are becomingunemployed. Many are being uprooted from their homesand hearths.While the whole world is voicing concern aboutprotection of the environment  a large proportion ofBangladesh’s population is being pushed to the threshold ofpoverty and destruction. This is nothing but a grossviolation of human rights and justice. To put it simply  oureconomic structure is faced with disaster because of theFarakka Barrage.India could have played an important role instrengthening mutual trust between the two countries if ithad lived up to its pledges on the question of water sharing.We feel that this is still possible. We believe that the worldcommunity sincerely wishes to see Bangladesh succeed in itsstruggle to dislodge the burden of poverty that hasaccumulated over the ages. But how can we  with ourmeagre resources  ever hope to achieve that objective ifman-made obstacles stand in our way? Bangladesh wishes therefore  to draw the attention of the world community tothis issue  in the interest of establishing human rights protecting the right to natural resources and ensuring theprocess of development. Something must be done urgentlyto end this inhuman treatment of the people of Bangladesh.We firmly believe that arrangements must be made to ensurea fair sharing of the water resources of the Ganges bysigning a permanent agreement immediately.We believe in the policy of friendship  cooperation andpeaceful coexistence with all countries of the world. Wehave unwavering faith in the principle of the resolution of allproblems with all countries  and particularly with ourneighbours  through peaceful negotiations. Congenialconditions have been created for the return of the tribalrefugees who left their homes in the Chittagong Hilldistricts and have been in India for a long time. Thisbecame possible following a bilateral understanding that wasreached with India last May.Despite obvious economic  social and environmentaldifficulties  Bangladesh has given shelter to 250 000 refugeesfrom Myanmar. Bangladesh has not sent back even onesingle refugee by force. I am happy to report that afterconstructive negotiations with all parties concerned including Myanmar and the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  a congenialatmosphere has been created for the safe and voluntaryrepatriation of the refugees. We hope this will lead to apermanent solution of the problem.Our hopes for a new  peaceful international order wereraised following the end of the cold war. But these hopesseem to be fading in the face of current realities. The forcesof communalism  racialism and regional hegemony areraising their heads in different regions of the world. As aresult  mankind is threatened. The blatant violation of thenational and human rights of the Bosnian Muslims at thehands of the armed Serbian aggressors is a matter of greatshame for the whole of mankind. The oppression andgenocide unleashed by the Serbs against unarmed civiliansin the name of the abhorrent policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" isa source of agony for all people of conscience. Theunabated perpetration of this genocide naturally focusesattention on the unequal application of the concept of humanrights. A nation and its existence as a State are beingobliterated solely because of religious hatred. The doublestandard of supplying arms to the Serbs and the Croats whilethe Muslims remain unarmed is tantamount to violation ofhuman rights. In the interest of establishing human rightsForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 23and justice  we call upon the United Nations and all thepowerful States of the world to take definite steps topreserve the independence and sovereignty of the people ofBosnia and Herzegovina.Bangladesh has always hoped for world peace andprosperity. Active participation in United Nationspeace-keeping efforts has been a priority for us. Some ofthe significant examples of such participation are themonitoring of elections in Namibia  policing the cease-fireline in the Gulf  clearing mines and contributing toreconstruction efforts in Kuwait and assisting the UnitedNations peace efforts in Cambodia  Somalia andMozambique. We strongly support the strengthening of thefinancial and institutional base of peace-keeping and itsgrowth. We are concerned at the observation on thefinancial crisis of the world body made by theSecretary-General in his report. We urge the affluentMember States to come forward and assist in overcomingthe crisis to keep the United Nations strong and effective.The recent historic accord between the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel is a positive firststep towards the establishment of a long-waited peace in theMiddle East. We welcome this initiative. We hope thatIsraeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories including Jerusalem  and the establishment of an independentPalestinian State will be the final objective of these efforts.We remain steadfast in our support for the struggle ofthe people of South Africa to achieve their cherished goal ofequal rights and majority rule. In response to the appealmade here in the Assembly by Nelson Mandela  ourGovernment is moving towards lifting economic sanctionsagainst South Africa.Vicious cycles of starvation and violence  a breakdownof central authority and endless conflicts continue to bedevilin varying ways the situations in Somalia  Angola  Liberia Rwanda and Mozambique. We call upon the United Nationsto take comprehensive measures to establish peace in theseareas in a more effective manner.Thirteen years ago  during a similar session of thisforum  Bangladesh’s great leader and a champion of theinterests of the third world  the late President Ziaur Rahman issued a clarion call:""We must face the challenge of the contemporaryworld. The need of the hour is for bold andimaginative action. We will not find solutions if wecling to outdated concepts and institutions. We mustact in concert and work for a better and nobler life forall sectors of the family of mankind."" (Official Recordsof the General Assembly  Eleventh Special Session  3rdplenary meeting  para. 46)His words are all the more significant today.We are poised at a critical juncture in the advancementof world peace and stability. No doubt violence  aggression racism  ethnic and religious conflict and gaping social andeconomic disparities still exist. Despite these contradictions there is today a greater confidence and conviction that abrave new world is truly within our reach. We are facedwith a rare opportunity to sustain the momentum towards thepeaceful resolution of conflicts  to strengthen the rule of lawand to raise the quality of life in greater freedom.Democratic values  the human spirit  human solidarity andthe appropriate realization of human development are centralto achieving these objectives. Today  as we approach theend of the twentieth century  we look forward to a balanced tolerant and happy world community where democracy peace  development and human welfare will be equallyavailable to all. This was really the driving force behind theestablishment of the United Nations. We have spent half acentury in pursuit of this goal. As we enter the comingcentury  this must not remain a mere dream. Let this be ourpledge to the next generation."
"16",674,"BGR",48,1993,"I would first of all like tocongratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to thisresponsible post  and to wish you success.On behalf of the Republic of Bulgaria  let mecongratulate the delegations of the States that have joined theUnited Nations as new Members this year - the CzechRepublic  the Slovak Republic  The Former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia  Eritrea  Monaco and Andorra.Three years ago  in this same Hall  I had the honour ofaddressing the world forum. My message was on behalf ofdemocratic Bulgaria  a country where changes fully andgenuinely match the ideals and values uniting the nations inthe world Organization. Since then  as indeed over the pastyear  under the Bulgarian presidency of the GeneralAssembly  we have witnessed diverse and often contradictingtrends in international life. If there is a dominating feeling though  it is one of optimism and of trust  on the part ofboth Governments and nations  in the United Nations as aspokesman for and guarantor of the political will of theworld community for peace and sustainable democraticdevelopment. We have seen a number of encouragingexamples of this.The democratic changes in Eastern Europe have addedan element of dynamism to building European unity and theEuropean civil society  a society open to the rest of theworld. Important forums of the European Community  theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and theCouncil of Europe provide a frame and a foundation for theemerging European unity and security. Bulgaria has been anactive participant in the European organizations. It will bethe first post-Communist country to assume the presidencyof the Committee of Ministers of the oldest Europeanorganization - the Council of Europe. It is also acoordinator of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Group bringing together the countries of that region.After the Berlin wall  the walls of Jericho cametumbling down. There began the long-expected unravelingof the Gordian knot in the Middle East  the place wherethree world cultural and religious traditions coexist. Wewelcome also the development of democratic processes inSouth Africa that will lead to the establishment of a unitedand non-racial society.Humanity has bid farewell to chemical weapons; and ithas succeeded in convening world conferences on subjectsbelieved until recently to defy consensus  such as humanrights and protection for the victims of war.The democratic changes in Eastern Europe and theformer Soviet Union continue to be an important conditionfor the positive changes in international life at the turn ofthis century. The heightened attention of the worldcommunity to the social and political tensions in Moscow isas understandable as is the broad international support forthe reform-minded and democratic forces in Russia  supportwith which Bulgaria fully agrees. The dramatic events inMoscow which we witnessed over the weekend prove howdifficult and painful the transition from post-Communist6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionsociety to democracy and a market economy is  and whatdangers and risks it entails. The United Nations cannotsimply stand by and watch with indifference the difficultiesof the countries in transition. If we are to live up to thename ""United Nations"" we have to render our moral political and financial support to these nations.The collapse of totalitarian rule  and the breakup of theSoviet empire and of the Warsaw Treaty  created anunexpected paradox: less danger to world peace and  at thesame time  less peace in the world and more challenges andtrials for the United Nations.Regional conflicts have proved to be a key problem forthe new democracies. Think of the consequences of theworld community’s failure to handle the war in the formerYugoslavia! The stakes are always high but they are evenhigher in the Balkans where conflicts threaten to spill overand embroil other States.Bulgaria’s civilized and good-neighbourly Balkan policyentitles it now  as indeed at the very outset of the Yugoslavcrisis  to insist on firm judgement and energetic steps on thepart of the General Assembly  the Security Council and theSecretary-General to contain and end the barbaric war inBosnia and Herzegovina  and to prevent other smoulderingconflicts in former Yugoslavia from flaring up.Recent attempts to find concerted ways of coordinatingthe peace-keeping efforts of the United Nations and theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have beenfollowed with keen interest in Bulgaria. We have alreadyvoiced our support for the constructive engagement ofPresident Clinton’s Administration  notably the preventivestationing of a contingent of troops under a United Nationsflag in Macedonia.Bulgaria is against re-drawing borders and gainingterritory by force. It has been consistent in its position infavour of a peaceful solution of the Yugoslav crisis.By virtue of its geopolitical situation  Bulgaria has akey role to play in implementing the economic sanctionsagainst Serbia and Montenegro. We share the longest landborder with Serbia and we are not involved  either directlyor indirectly  in the hostilities in former Yugoslavia.Without Bulgaria the sanctions will be doomed to failure.Fully aware of our responsibility  we adhere strictly to therelevant resolutions of the Security Council in the face ofgreat economic sacrifice. Measured against our potential the losses are indeed huge. The embargo has closedBulgaria’s direct route to the markets of Western Europe.Consequently  its losses for 1992 were estimated - withexpert assistance from the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) - at $943.6 million. The 1993 figure isexpected to be several times higher. The effect of thesanctions may lead to halting and thwarting economicreform  as well as jeopardizing the democratic process andsocial peace in Bulgaria. In other words  the price Bulgariais paying for peace and security in the Balkans and inEurope may prove fatal to its internal peace and stability.Direct losses from the sanctions against former Yugoslavia Iraq and Libya  are commensurate with one half ofBulgaria’s external debt to commercial creditor banks  andthey dim the prospects for economic recovery  developmentand integration into the world community.As a State Member of the United Nations Bulgariafulfils its international obligations in good faith  convincedthat any civilized country concerned about world securityshould uphold a common cause - even at the cost ofsacrifice. Yet  is it not fair for a country in our position toseek assistance and understanding from the worldOrganization and its Member States?There is an urgent need to devise a working mechanismof awarding compensation to Member States which sustainlosses as a result of the strict implementation of thesanctions imposed by the Security Council. The provisionsof Chapter VII of the Charter are equally important andshould be applied strictly. Article 50 of the Charter could bebacked up by relevant agreements for concrete aid toMember States affected by sanctions against third countries.The forms of compensation could include  among others measures to ease the economic situation of the affectedcountry  such as concluding stand-by agreements with theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)  facilitating the debt-servicing and settlement procedure  financing major transportand communication infrastructure projects nationally andregionally - in our case  new bridges on the River Danube an international airport  motorways linking Bulgaria andGreece  Bulgaria  Macedonia and Albania such asThessaloniki-Vidin and Sofia-Skopje-Tirana - speeding upthe ratification of the European Association Agreementbetween Bulgaria and the European Community and anearlier accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade.The Bulgarian delegation at this session of the GeneralAssembly will put forward proposals on some of the aboveissues. We rely on the support and cooperation of the StatesMembers of the Organization in this regard.Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 7Considering that no international organization at themoment is in a position to award direct compensation forlosses sustained as a result of economic sanctions  theindirect ways of compensation could be of crucialimportance.The problem of international sanctions andcompensation merits serious attention. It calls for anin-depth analysis  as it vitally concerns a number of StatesMembers of the United Nations. The time is ripe to lookinto these issues at a special forum for which Bulgaria offersits hospitality.United Nations peace-keeping operations haveconstituted a most significant and prominent part of theworld Organization’s work over the past year. I could notemphasize more the importance of the Secretary-General’sreport entitled ""An Agenda for Peace""  which developed theconcept of crisis management through preventive diplomacy.Bulgaria supported this political strategy and backed up itswords with actions by sending Blue Helmets to Cambodia.Once again  the international community seems to havebeen inadequately prepared for mounting such operations.The question of the safety of United Nations personnelproved particularly poignant. Bulgaria lost 10 volunteers inCambodia  not to mention the cost of its involvement  whichhas not yet been fully estimated.Early warning for potential conflicts calls for effectiveinternational mechanisms to monitor the human rightssituation  including that of individuals from minority groups- because conflicts brew wherever individual human rightsare trampled upon  wherever the universal values of moderncivilization are replaced by survival instincts and politicalpluralism and the diversity of ideas  by intolerance xenophobia  racism  religious and political bigotry andviolence. The idea of creating a new post within the UnitedNations system  that of a high commissioner for humanrights  is an expression of the desire to step up internationalcooperation in this field. We are prepared to participateactively in discussing this matter.Let us look at the United Nations potential for crisismanagement. Many of the proposed ideas hold out promise.But if they are to materialize  the United Nations must liveup to its coordinating  organizing and mobilizing role infinding the relevant political and military means. In theYugoslav crisis  for instance  the Euro-Atlantic and Europeansecurity organizations could have taken up some of itsfunctions.Here is a case in point. The North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) has undergone a significant evolutionin its attitude towards the conflict. As well as becoming amajor challenge  the Yugoslav crisis has provided an impetusfor the alliance to review its priorities and objectives.Bulgaria openly declares its readiness to enhance itscooperation - including as a full member - with NATO andits member States. Our good bilateral relations and securitycooperation with Turkey and Greece illustrate clearly ourapproach and intentions. It would be beneficial to Balkanand European security if these relations could be developedfurther into cooperation between allies within NATO.Bulgaria is willing and able to shoulder responsibility andact as a reliable partner.Addressing today’s global social and economicproblems calls for new approaches in the work of the UnitedNations specialized bodies in these areas. New ways andmeans should be sought to facilitate access to technicalassistance and modern technologies. There is a need fordaring and pragmatic initiatives in areas such as tradeliberalization  the future of the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT)  external debt  labour migration unemployment  environmental safety and the proliferation ofenvironmentally friendly technologies. The Republic ofBulgaria is ready to cooperate in any of the above-mentionedefforts as a member of various United Nations bodies including possibly the Economic and Social Council.The strengthening of the regime of the Treaty on thenon-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the preparationfor the review Conference in 1995 are of paramountimportance. Bulgaria shares the view that the non-proliferation Treaty should become universal and be ofindefinite duration.Bulgaria’s expectations for the future role and functionsof the United Nations determine its attitude towards theongoing reform of the world Organization. On the basis ofits history of nearly 50 years  the Member States can identifyelements of its Charter and structure that need revision andothers that are universal and lasting and whose validityshould not be questioned. Clearly  such decisions can bereached only after serious debate and by consensus of theMember States  notably the permanent members of theSecurity Council. It is essential to preserve the SecurityCouncil as an effective decision-making mechanism if itsrepresentation is broadened. The powers and responsibilityof the Secretary-General will certainly change  with anincreasing emphasis on his diplomatic and peace-makingefforts.8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe Bulgarian delegation is taking part in the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly and making itscontribution as an active member of the internationalcommunity. Our commitment to the problems and the futureof the Organization is prompted by our awareness of beingamong the staunchest supporters of its cause and noblemissions."
"17",719,"BHR",48,1993,"At the outset  I take pleasure  Sir  in congratulatingyou sincerely  on behalf of the delegation of the State ofBahrain’s delegation  on your election as President of theAssembly at this session. As you assume your importanttask  it is my pleasure also to wish you success in carryingout your duties and to assure you of my delegation’s fullcooperation with you in making the work of this session asuccess.I take this opportunity to convey thanks andappreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  whoconducted the proceedings of the last session with skill andefficiency.It is also my pleasure to mention with greatappreciation the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to further theobjectives of the United Nations and his tireless drive toenhance the Organization’s role in maintaining internationalpeace and security.I should also like to take this opportunity to extend ourwarmest congratulations to the delegations of the SlovakRepublic  the Czech Republic  the Former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia  Eritrea  the Principality of Monacoand the Principality of Andorra on their accession to themembership of the United Nations.Because of the important issues on our agenda  thissession of the General Assembly is a significant one indeed.These issues under consideration demand close attention  ifwe are to benefit from the object lessons of the past informulating future parameters  as is required by theever-accelerating changes in the international arena. As welook at the historical events  that have followed upon oneanother  we find that the world is in the midst of aqualitative transformation that is virtually unprecedented. Ifwe examine the causes and aspects of that transformation we shall find that the conflict that raged between the easternand the western blocs was no mere ideological disputearticulated in academic forums. Rather  it was a violentpolitical type of rivalry that escalated into grave militaryconfrontations that were  at times  direct and at others indirect  between the super-Powers. The past few years however  have witnessed the end of that conflict  and this inturn has entailed major changes in the political outlook ofvarious world Powers.It is regrettable indeed that  in the midst of thesechanges  new problems have surfaced and have thusstrengthened our conviction that the ending of the cold warwill not make the world a more secure and stable place. Forall its conflicts and tensions the cold war  when it ended contrary to all expectations has brought to the surface thebanes of extreme nationalism and such aberrations as ""ethniccleansing""  things which had been dormant in EasternEurope and Central Asia.This has led  in certain regions  to acts of violence thatthreaten to change the very nature of relations betweenStates at a time when the path of international politics hasbecome really bumpy as a result of the restructuring of theworld order. This is a time of profound change in the livesForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 5of States and nations in which people’s aspirations afterstability and development merge with the fears generated bythe gap between a developed  affluent world and a worldthat is unable to meet the minimum requirements of decentliving.The major transformations that are taking place today in the areas of politics  technology and information underscore the fact that our world has become a truly globalvillage and that the scientific revolution is about to bringdown the barriers and boundaries between its variouscountries and regions. It is regrettable indeed  at such ajuncture  that while we stand on the threshold of a newcentury of man’s history  we perceive that the interests ofhumanity lag behind the advances made by science andtechnology. It is paradoxical indeed that the increasedinterdependence dictated by the developments that are takingplace at the present time should go hand in hand withpolitical fragmentation and clash of interests as individualStates pursue their own narrow interests and ambitions.Such a situation should urge us to look at what is goingon around us with a large magnifying glass so that we maybe able to fathom the depths of international problems andscrutinize their interlocking strands on the wider screen ofthe global scene. If we take the measure of the rapidchanges in the international arena  we may be able to foreseethe enormity of the dangers that the future may bring andthe extent of the harm to peoples’ security and stability thatmay result therefrom. For  in a world whose spaces anddistances have shrunk and whose different parts have comecloser together more than at any other time before  peacecannot be achieved in one region while the peace of anotherregion is left at the mercy of tensions. It is thereforeincumbent upon us all to develop a practical strategy for thefuture through a new outlook that would be capable ofgrasping and understanding the nature and drift of thechanges and harnessing them in the service of humanity asa whole and for the strengthening of security throughout theworld.After this introduction  which reflects the way we seethe past and look at the present  my delegation should liketo share with you certain thoughts on the building of thepost-cold-war world:Firstly: there should be agreement on new conceptsconcerning the issues of world peace and developmentthat would rid the world of the residues and perceptionsof the ideological and strategic thinking that prevailedthroughout the cold-war period;Secondly: appropriate criteria should be defined for theachievement of world stability through the commonsecurity of all States;Thirdly: existing and traditional boundaries betweenStates should be respected  and all boundary disputesshould be resolved by peaceful means that are agreedupon by the parties concerned; andFourthly: there should be support for the UnitedNations  as the appropriate international tool for theestablishment of a new international order wherejustice  equality  respect for international resolutionsand the abandonment of double standards prevail.War and peace are inseparable opposites. Given thisperspective  the most difficult task in international politics isto devise an effective machinery to prevent the causes ofwar on the one hand  and to preserve  maintain or keep thepeace  on the other. It is our conviction that currentinternational developments have created favourableconditions for making use of the United Nations potential tocreate a political climate that would be favourable fordeveloping the foundations of a collective security system.Here it should be pointed out that one of the mostimportant means suggested for promoting collective securityis the use of preventive diplomacy to prevent disputes fromarising between parties and to prevent existing disputes fromescalating  and the development of preventive deployment ofUnited Nations forces in such a way as to allow those forcesto defuse potential tensions in any region of the world. Wehope that Member States will reach a consensus on theformation of such forces  and that cooperation between theUnited Nations and regional organizations can be enhancedso that the regional organizations’ experience and theirhuman and material resources in the field of peace-keepingcan be tapped.In this context  I applaud the current cooperationbetween the United Nations and the League of Arab Statesand emphasize the importance of enhancing andstrengthening the existing relations between the twoorganizations in all fields.The United Nations now approaches its fiftiethanniversary. The peoples of the world  with their hopes andaspirations  continue to look to the Organization to lead theway to the turning of a new leaf in the history ofinternational relations so that they can finally enjoy thesecurity  peace and stability for which they have longyearned.6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe world Organization has managed  since itsbeginnings  to achieve some of the purposes of the Charter but has failed to achieve others. It is now at a juncturewhere new hopes  accompanied by new problems  havearisen. Over the last five decades  the membership of theOrganization has risen from 51 States in 1954 to 184 in1993. This calls for restructuring the Organization’sprincipal organs  especially the Secretariat and the SecurityCouncil. We welcome the Secretary-General’s statement  inhis Agenda for Peace  that important steps have been takento reorganize the Secretariat in order to avoid duplicationand overlapping of functions and to enhance itseffectiveness. We call for further reforms to be effected methodically  so that the Secretariat can perform its duties tothe optimum.As for the Security Council and its role in themaintenance of international peace and security  thedevelopment of this important organ and the review of theprovisions relating to its membership have recently been theobject of world attention. Consequently  the GeneralAssembly has included in the agenda of its forty-eighthsession an item entitled ""Question of equitable representationon and increase in the membership of the Security Council"".The inclusion of this item has taken place in responseto the desire of many States to emphasize the importance ofadequate and equitable representation in the membership ofthis important organ in line with the increase in themembership of the Organization and the glaring disparitybetween the composition of the Council and the membershipof the United Nations. From 20 per cent in 1945  theproportion has dropped to 8 per cent now. We support thecall for a review of the composition of the Security Councilthat would ensure equitable geographical representation.I should like  in this connection  to refer to theresolution adopted by the Arab League Council at its regularsession  held in Cairo from 19 through 21 September 1993 which calls upon the United Nations to take dueconsideration of the need for equitable geographicalrepresentation and to establish a permanent seat on theSecurity Council for the Arab Group.We should like to stress that it is vitally important toensure that in adopting any of the proposed formulas forincreasing the membership of the Security Council  caremust be taken that this should not lead to impeding theproper functioning by the Council in carrying out its duties and that the power of veto should not be used as a means ofundermining the decision-making process or of diluting theurgent nature of critical issues  especially those which haveto do with peace and security.In recent weeks  a ray of hope that augurs well for thefuture of world peace has appeared on the horizon of theMiddle East and the world at large: namely  the accordsigned by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) andIsrael. We have consistently encouraged any sign ofmovement towards a peaceful  just and comprehensivesettlement of the Palestine question. There is firm hopetoday that this step will be a precursor to a real opening forpeace and stability in the Middle East region.While we welcome this significant and historic step  weview it as a first step on the road to a just  lasting andcomprehensive solution to the Palestine question and theArab-Israeli conflict  based on Security Council resolutions242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and other resolutions ofinternational legality as well as the land-for-peace principle.We hope that efforts will continue to be made towards thespeedy implementation of the provisions of the accord andthat the negotiations between other Arab parties and Israelwill make progress on the other tracks so that the existingopportunities for peace may be put to good use.We look forward to the day when the Israeli forces willwithdraw from the Gaza Strip  the West Bank  includingHoly Jerusalem  the occupied Syrian Golan Heights and theoccupied Lebanese and Jordanian territories  and to the daywhen the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people including the right of return for the Palestinian refugees  willbe guaranteed  in consonance with relevant United Nationsresolutions.It should be emphasized that stability in the MiddleEast is fully dependent on its being freed from chemical biological and nuclear weapons. Declaring the Middle Easta region free of weapons of mass destruction would enableits States to focus their attention on questions of economic scientific and technological development and wouldencourage them to cooperate in the field of peaceful uses ofnuclear energy and to make a constructive contribution to themaintenance of world peace.Two devastating wars have swept over the Gulf  andtheir consequences have adversely affected development inthe area. It behooves us  therefore  to intensify efforts tokeep that important area free of any further tensions  throughthe settlement of disputes by peaceful means and throughrespect for the principles of territorial integrity and politicalindependence  the sovereignty of States over their ownresources  non-interference in the internal affairs of otherForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 7States and strict observance of the norms of internationallegality.We should like to emphasize the need for Iraq toimplement Security Council resolutions relevant to itsaggression against the State of Kuwait  and in particular theprovisions of Security Council resolution 687 (1991)relating  inter alia  to the release of Kuwaiti and otherprisoners of war and detainees  and to recognize theinternational boundaries between Kuwait and Iraq asdemarcated and set out in Security Council resolution833 (1993).We also hope that the dialogue between the UnitedArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran will lead tothe settlement of all outstanding questions regarding thethree islands of Abu Mousa  Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunbin a manner that would guarantee the rights of the UnitedArab Emirates as set out in the resolutions of the Gulf StatesCooperation Council.The international arena has witnessed somedevelopment  this year  in relation to the situation inSomalia. Although that situation continues to irk theconscience of the international community  the UnitedNations has been able  through the efforts of a large numberof its members  to restore peace in most parts of Somalia.Security Council resolution 814 (1993) has had a positiveeffect in improving the situation after the drawn outsuffering experienced by the people of that country. Weshould like to voice support for United Nations efforts torebuild the political  economic and social infrastructure ofSomalia. We hope that the Somali people will be able toreach comprehensive national reconciliation between thevarious factions.The world has been following the tragic situation inBosnia and Herzegovina. Despite all the efforts deployed inan attempt to contain the conflict  we see no glimmer ofhope that aggression against that country will cease. TheSerbian side rejected the Vance-Owen peace plan  while theGovernment of Bosnia-Herzegovina accepted it. Massacresand acts of aggression against Bosnian cities continueunabated  and the Serb forces have committed the mostatrocious crimes of genocide and ""ethnic cleansing"" in opendefiance of the international community. Yet the SecurityCouncil has not taken any effective measure to suppress theaggression or to enable the legitimate Bosnian Governmentto defend itself. That  surely  sends the wrong message toall those who do not believe in the system of internationalcollective security and could give rise to a surge of violenceand extremism that would have an adverse effect on theUnited Nations endeavours to contain existing and potentialconflicts in the world.The international community is duty-bound to moveurgently to stop the aggression against the Republic ofBosnia and Herzegovina  to safeguard the legitimate rightsof its people  to force the aggressors to comply with theprinciples of international legality  to prevent anydemographic change or any territorial gains through thepolicy of fait accompli pursued by the Serbs and the Croats and to enable the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina toexercise the right of self-defence by lifting the embargo onarms supplies to it.It is regrettable  at a time when the features of a newworld order are beginning to take shape  that Central Asiashould be in the grip of a situation of instability thatthreatens to tear it apart. Internal strife continues without letup in Tajikistan and Georgia and the war between Armeniaand Azerbaijan has grown even more vicious. In thisconnection  my delegation supports Security Councilresolutions 822 (1993) and 853 (1993)  which reaffirm thesovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and of allother States in the region and the inadmissibility of the useof force for the acquisition of territory. We reaffirm ourendorsement of the efforts made by the United Nations andregional organizations to restore stability in that region.For years  the Cyprus problem has continued to defysolution. We are encouraged  however  by the efforts of theSecretary-General to bring the two Cypriot parties closer toagreement. Despite the remaining obstacles that obstruct thesettlement of this problem  it is our view that the goodoffices of the Secretary-General should continue until asolution that would be satisfactory to both parties may bereached.With regard to the situation in Cambodia  positiveresults have been achieved  and the United Nations  throughthe United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia(UNTAC)  has been able to restore political stability to thatcountry. We should like on this occasion to extend oursincere congratulations to the people and Government ofCambodia on the outcome of their efforts in pursuit ofnational reconciliation and peace. We also commend theconstructive efforts of UNTAC in carrying out its mandatein Cambodia.South Africa is now going through a significant andcrucial phase in its march towards political reform. Themain features of this reform are the agreement on thedrafting of a new constitution  the formation of a new8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessiontransitional multi-party Government  and the agreement tohold constitutional elections in April 1994. Thesedevelopments demonstrate the sincere desire of all parties inSouth Africa to turn a new leaf in their relations. Wesupport the reforms currently under way in South Africa andwelcome Nelson Mandela’s call  in his recent address at theUnited Nations  for lifting the economic sanctions now inplace against South Africa.Although the fires of the cold war have been put outand have become something of the past  we cannot but voiceour concern over the numerous difficulties which continueto beset the world economy. The gap is still wide betweenthe average per capita income in developing countries andthat in developed countries. In 1992  that figure was over$18 000 in the developed countries  while in the developingcountries it did not exceed $800. There are distressingindications that the rate of world economic growth lagsbehind the rate of world population growth.The continuing social deterioration and lack ofeconomic security which result from continuous politicalupheavals will undoubtedly impede economic developmentin the long term. So long as the world economy continuesto stagnate  the urgent social problems connected with theeconomy  in the areas of population  health  housing andenvironment  will continue to defy solution.Any change in the world economy  whether it benegative or positive  affects every State. The worldeconomy stands in need of the political will that should leadall the States of the world  especially the developedcountries  to cooperate in solving those problems that face usall. This makes it incumbent upon us all to strengthen therole of the United Nations  as the Organization that hascontinued for about half a century  to embrace the countriesof the world with the distinctive and varied experiences eachand every country has gained in the areas of developmentalcoordination and cooperation.Over the past decades  the world has been focusing oneconomic development owing to the immediate and speedyreturns it generates for the world economy. Voices havebeen raised in the United Nations  in recent years  urgingthat attention should be paid to social development as well.This has led to the adoption by the General Assembly ofresolution 47/92  in which it decided to convene a WorldSummit for Social Development early in 1995. We hopethat those in charge of preparations for that conference willreach agreement to further those objectives of the Charter setout in Article 55  relating to the promotion of higherstandards of living  conditions of economic and socialprogress and development as well as to the resolution ofinternational economic and social problems.Our planet faces man-made environmental threatswhose consequences are unpredictable. The Earth Summitin Rio de Janeiro was an important step towards worldpartnership in combating those environmental threats. Weshould like  in this context  to reiterate our support for theefforts to contain the threats to our environment  and wehope that the programmes adopted by the Rio Summit especially those included in Agenda 21  will beimplemented.The attention focused on population problems stemsfrom the tremendous density of population in some countriesand the adverse effects that density has on development. Wewelcome the efforts by the United Nations and particularlyby the United Nations Population Fund  to address suchissues. We hope that the International Conference onPopulation and Development scheduled to be held in Caironext year  pursuant to General Assembly resolution 47/176 will adopt recommendations that may ensure the resolutionof urgent population and development problems in the nextdecade.Several years have passed since the world firstwitnessed that novel  unique situation in the history ofinternational relations  namely the ending of bipolarity. Theresult of this is that the world now stands at the crossroadsof history  where it faces difficult challenges. This isespecially so because certain evil tendencies have caused theeruption of volcanoes of malevolent hatreds and racism which have destroyed many hopes and shattered theexpectations of millions of people to achieve security andprosperity for future generations.It may be appropriate to stop here and wonder whetherthe United Nations has done all it should to address theproblems that have surfaced due to this major transformationin world order? Has the machinery which we and manyothers have called for been made available to the worldOrganization to enable it to fulfil its role in a manner that iscompatible with the developments of our time? Even if theUnited Nations has moved as we had hoped  have theMember States made available to it the material and moralresources to enable it to take effective action to address allof the world problems  wherever they may appear?We do not believe anyone in today’s world searches forthe Utopia described in Plato’s Republic or Farabi’s IdealCity. Yet everyone would like to see the United Nationsmade able to achieve practical solutions for world problems.Forty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 9For it is our conviction that any blood shed by a handprompted by an ethnic bigotry or racial hatred would be aclear indication of our failure to respond to the aspirationsof all our peoples.It is in this context that we call for resorting to reasonin trying to understand the new phenomena and to deal withpolitical  economic and social problems in a rational anddispassionate manner. The time has come for issues relatingto international and regional security and development to beput in their proper realistic perspectives  without anyidealistic flights of fancy. Such problems should be dealtwith in the light of the objective realities of the world welive in with all its successive developments  so that thesolutions devised for them may be applicable in the currentatmosphere of inter-State rivalries. We are confident that with political will  material support and moralencouragement  it will be possible for the United Nations toperform its role in steering the ship of hope towards theshores of security and peace we all seek."
"18",757,"BHS",48,1993,"Twenty years ago theBahamas took its seat as the 138th Member in this Assemblyof the United Nations  and we proudly assumed the solemnobligations and responsibilities conferred by the Charter.This session marks our twentieth anniversary  which wecelebrate with our friends of the now reunited Germany withwhom we were admitted.As we reflect on the global events of those twodecades  we see a world significantly transformed. Wherethere was a single Soviet Union and a single YugoslavRepublic  we now have the Commonwealth of IndependentStates and the Baltic States. In addition  the admission ofmany new States to this great Organization has resulted inan almost complete universality of membership. It istherefore with much joy that we warmly welcome all newMembers and extend to each the fraternal hand of friendshipand partnership in the continued struggle for human dignityand development.The Bahamas has also witnessed significant nationaldevelopment since its membership. Today we are one of themost stable and democratic societies. We are proud of thisachievement  and we encourage all those who would to6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionfollow our example of freedom  justice and peace  buttressedby sound principles of human and national development.We have yet another reason for celebration. Yourunanimous election to the presidency of this forty-eighthsession of the General Assembly  Sir  is an historic occasionnot only for you personally and for your great country butalso for every Caribbean Government and person.Bahamians  together with all Caribbean peoples  thereforepay high tribute to you and to your country. We are fullyconscious of your impeccable and enviable credentials as adiplomat  and we are satisfied that those same skills willserve to guide us through this session  despite its challenges to successful and lasting results.Permit me also to pay high tribute to your predecessor Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria  for his outstandingcontributions to the forty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly. His presidency witnessed significantachievements and today we are the beneficiaries of hisvisionary leadership.While we who are privileged to represent ourGovernments have the luxury of pronouncing internationalpolicies  the Secretary-General enjoys no such luxury. Hisis the responsibility of going beyond the rhetoric to thesubstance of the many resolutions and decisions which weadopt in this Assembly each year. His task is thereforedauntingly complex. Nevertheless  he has borne hisenormous responsibilities with great dignity and highdistinction.In this connection  we cannot help but recall the biblicalinjunction: ""Out of Egypt have I called my Son"". (TheHoly Bible  Matthew 2:15) Like his predecessor  he hasperformed beyond our expectations  and is deserving of ourpraise for his proficiency in assisting this Organization inshaping contemporary history so dramatically.At this juncture I wish to take this opportunity toextend the deepest sympathy of the Government and thepeople of the Bahamas to the people and the Government ofIndia  who suffered such tragic loss of life and propertyduring the recent devastating earthquake  and to reaffirm oursolidarity with them during this time of national disaster.It would be very easy for me on behalf of myGovernment and country to rehearse the developments of thepast year and offer the members of the Assembly someobservations. However  we believe that a focus on thefuture is more timely.As we near the fiftieth anniversary of the Organization it is the view of the Bahamas that that significant turning-point should be seized as an opportunity to assess where weare and what is required to move further ahead in thefulfilment of the principles of the Charter  so that theforthcoming anniversary will indeed be cause for celebration.In reflecting on what is required to move ahead  weinvite all Member States to focus with us on how each oneof us  given our varied capacities  can assist the Organizationin moving closer to the full achievement of the principlesenshrined in the Charter.There is no question that the United Nations  in itsoften unappreciated role in the promotion of such objectivesas international cooperation and respect for human rights has been vindicated in this approach by successes far beyondexpectations.In the political sphere  such successes include thefostering of a shift to democracy in Eastern Europe; thedramatic reduction  through voluntary destruction  of nuclearweapons; the Mission of the Organization of AmericanStates (OAS) and United Nations in Haiti; the establishmentof the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of PersonsResponsible for Serious Violations of InternationalHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the FormerYugoslavia since 1991; the establishment of the TransitionalExecutive Council in South Africa; the very recent signingof the historic peace accord between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO)  as well as the Declaration ofPrinciples between Israel and Jordan; and the repelling ofaggression and the restoration of sovereignty in Kuwait. Inthis context  the Security Council resolution that determinesthe Kuwaiti boundary must be respected.In addressing the hurdles which must be overcomebefore lasting solutions are achieved  we believe that moreemphasis should also be placed on the expanded economic social and military role of the United Nations. That role isdemonstrated by the peace-keeping forces dispatchedglobally and by the recent successful Conferences onEnvironment and Development and Human Rights  as wellas by the forthcoming conferences on women  populationand development  the Summit for Social Development and most importantly for the Bahamas  the forthcomingConference on Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States  scheduled to be held at Barbados in 1994.The Bahamas places particular emphasis on the role ofthe United Nations in the economic and social fields andfully expects that the revitalized United Nations will providean enhanced capacity for the Organization to perform thatForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 7important role. It is in this context  therefore  that wesupport the efforts of the Secretary-General to restructure theOrganization in the economic and social fields.As members are aware  success invariably bringsgreater responsibilities and challenges. Indeed  these greaterresponsibilities  challenges  and even attendant impediments have regrettably already begun to sour the excitement of themany achievements attained. But we must not let thisreverse side of success debilitate us. We must remainfocused so that narrower vested interests do not hinder theachievement of goals set in the wider interest. We mustpermit no circumstance to impede the earliest cessation ofthe atrocities of war for a return to peaceful settlement ofdisputes. We must be sensitive to and respond practically in the spirit of the Charter  to national needs  pressures andcivil unrest. The call for regional action in the settlement ofdisputes and peace-keeping will also need to be furtheremphasized as we seek to maintain the integrity of theOrganization.In this connection  we particularly underscore the needfor the fullest support of the implementation of theGovernors Island Accord on the restoration of democracy inHaiti  not only on the basis of unrelenting moral pressurebut  equally  through material and technical assistancetowards fostering the economic revitalization and enduringhealth of that country’s democratic institutions.While the unpleasant spectacle of politics throughconflict has reasserted itself at the centre of the world stage regrettably  politics has two companions  which ofteninfluence it  though rarely gaining the same degree andmagnitude of attention given to politics. These twocompanions are economic and social tensions. We mustever be vigilant of these two  often unruly companions.Again  we must find our focus in the purposes and principlesof the Charter.Against that background  there are several questions Ifeel must be put as part of the deliberations we willundertake during this session.First  is the peace dividend releasing adequate resourcesand civilian expertise to impact developmental needs?Secondly  should life after self-determination for thenewer members of the international community provokestagnant growth in those less-recently sovereign?Thirdly  is there sufficient retraining and assistance toensure that the trade liberalization facilitated by megablocspromotes fair  democratic and transparent institutionalstrengthening and the widest empowerment?And  lastly  how do we ensure that environmentalawareness  as a catalyst for a better quality of life globally does not become yet another trade conditionality?These questions are being posed because  if they areneglected or inadequately addressed  the new world orderwill be but a shifting of power centres and a spawning ofnew seeds of international economic  social and politicalinstability.In many countries  including the Bahamas  socialtensions are reordering national priorities. We must returnto basics in dealing with problems of a pandemic nature such as poverty  illicit drugs  crime  violence  internationalterrorism  human rights violations and disease  especially theurgent necessity for dealing with the devastations caused byacquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).Throughout this global village our Member States arefacing the disintegration of the traditional family values coupled with rampant unemployment. We mustre-emphasize those spiritual values which respect life  thedignity and worth of the human person and his or herimportance to national life and development. In order thatour peoples will avoid hopelessness and survive the adverseeffects of economic decline  we must share more directly theburden of action for solutions with those communityinstitutions and social partners which are the teachers andthe examples of positive spiritual and moral values.Fundamentally  the Bahamas remains morally persuadedof  and financially committed to  the goals and worth of theUnited Nations. To underscore this commitment  TheBahamas has recently deposited instruments of accession tointernational agreements in some of the priority areas on theUnited Nations agenda  including the International Covenanton Civil and Political Rights  The International Covenant onEconomic  Social and Cultural Rights  the Convention on theElimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Womenand the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees  andwe shall shortly sign the chemical weapons Convention. Inreality  the approaches and solutions found in theseConventions have long been traditional Bahamian policy andpractice.Despite a 100 per cent increase in the regular budgetassessment for the Bahamas over the past five years  weremain unwavering in our acceptance of the necessarysharing of the financial burden in order that thisOrganization may achieve its objectives. On the other hand 8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionthe Bahamas wishes to have consideration given to the levelof its assessment  and in that process we shall be submittingevidence that our reputed comparatively high per capitaincome not only masks the true indigenous per capitaincome situation  but also belies the increasing demandsarising from the development needs of our widely scatteredarchipelago. We submit that  given these circumstances there ought to be some mitigation available to the Bahamas given these circumstances.The Bahamas is very cognizant that we remain one ofthe few cases of comparative political tranquillity andunassailed natural beauty. Our commitment to themaintenance of national unity and the preservation of theenvironment is unwavering. We therefore believe that theBahamas is ideally suited as a propitious setting for difficultnegotiations  and we offer the Organization our facilities which  we are convinced  will enhance the conduct of suchaffairs. We further pledge our commitment to contribute  tothe extent possible  to making operational theSecretary-General’s ""Agenda for Peace"" and Papua NewGuinea’s proposed agenda for development. We see theseagenda items as practical approaches to dealing withproblem-solving for conflict resolution  peace-keeping andpost-conflict peace-building  and poverty alleviation.As we approach the fiftieth year of our Organization’sexistence  to ensure even better years ahead our watchwordsshould be ""perspective"" and ""purpose"": perspective in notlosing sight of the goals of our founding fathers  whoemphasized the primacy of people in the preamble to ourCharter; and purpose in recognizing and accepting that themeans for  and the road to  the end of international disorderand insecurity must begin with the individual. Our initiallyseparate personal attitudes  motives and actions ultimatelydetermine whether there will be an international climate forpeace or one for disorder. The success of our Organizationis therefore dependent  at one and the same time  on ourinternational  collective and personal actions.In our Caribbean corner of this global village  theBahamas continues its efforts in the struggle to bring aboutpeace and democracy in neighbouring Haiti. The success ofthis process will permit our own social and economiclandscape to be relieved of the extra burden of caring for thethousands of illegal immigrants from that country who defythe sometimes harsh elements of nature in search of a safehaven in our relative paradise.We trust that the world - andespecially the Member States of this Organization - hastaken due note of the enormous weight imposed upon oursmall country by this undertaking. The Bahamas has welldemonstrated its concern and care for its neighbours of theRepublic of Haiti. I call to mind the famous statement byone of the young residents of Father Flanagan’s Boys’ TownUnited States of America . When asked about the concernand care he demonstrated for his brother he replied  ""Heain’t heavy  Father; he’s my brother"". The fact is  ourbrother is heavy  but we bear him gladly  in Christiancharity  and in full and great expectation of imminent peacein Haiti.Our Bahamas remains proudly and immovably inleague with this great Organization."
"19",782,"BIH",48,1993,"Let me begin byextending  on behalf of the people and Government of theRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  our most heartfeltcondolences to the peoples and Governments of bothVenezuela and India  which have recently been hit severelyby the tragedy of disaster. It is our hope that both countries through the will and spirit of their peoples  will recoverquickly.May we also extend our sympathies to those countriesand families that have lost loved ones under the UnitedNations flag in Bosnia and Herzegovina in attempting tocarry out their mission of peace and humanity. Indeed  oursympathies go out to all families of United Nationspersonnel in all peace-keeping missions throughout the globewho have made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of theUnited Nations Charter.We should also like to congratulate the Palestinian andIsraeli people on their recent efforts towards peace. We arelikewise happy to see the great strides towards democracybeing made in South Africa.Mr. President  it is my pleasure and privilege to extendto you our sincerest congratulations on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighthsession. Your election to this high office reaffirms theimportance of the role that small States play in the family ofnations.We should also like to extend our appreciation to yourdistinguished predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Stojan Ganev our Balkan colleague  for conducting the deliberations of thisbody with great expertise and commitment.The Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is pleased towelcome the Organization’s newest Members: Andorra  theCzech Republic  Eritrea  Monaco  the Republic ofMacedonia and the Slovak Republic. We are confident thatthese Members will uphold the principles of the UnitedNations Charter.The international community has neither a definitepolicy nor a clear plan of political action that wouldfacilitate a transition from the Communist structures thathave been in power for 50 years to concepts based onfreedom and democracy. We believe that it is impossible tofind solutions for either global or local conflicts unless aclear stand is taken on the overall question of what thepost-Communist heritage is to be.The negative aspects of this problem have been fullyillustrated in the case of my country. It is obvious that theremaining forces of the Communist potential for aggressionhave been exercised against us and that an extirpation ofchances for democratic development has been perpetratedbefore the eyes of Europe  America and the whole world.This act is being carried out entirely by force  in formsranging from aggression and mass murder of civilians todestruction of all traces of civilization and culture and theextermination of whole nations by the barbaric tactics ofburned and destroyed land.Simultaneously with this unprecedented violence  anexperiment in political vivisection is being carried outagainst our country. It is being carried out by aninternational community that  in the case of Bosnia andHerzegovina  has obviously been testing various models forthe post-Communist State. The experiment  unfortunately is being performed in vivo by testing various hypotheses onour living national and governmental organism. In thisexperiment  our people are dying  and so is our country andour State.The first experiment was performed by the LondonConference. This concept  which sought to stop theaggression  was abandoned without a single attempt toimplement it; and this only intensified the war on our soil.This was followed by an attempt to find a solution by meansof constitutional  legal and political reform to a crisis thatwas becoming ever deeper. This project  known as theVance-Owen plan  no one even attempted to implement. Itwas abandoned only to be replaced by a new one  which isbased on the false thesis that what we have in Bosnia andHerzegovina is a civil war between the three peoples andthat territorial partition is therefore the only solution.But this plan is being fulfilled neither with respect tothe idea that the partition of the land should be carried outin accordance with the criterion of ethnic majority  nor withrespect to the basic intention of bringing about peace. As aresult  the uncontrollable unfolding of events will continue and will cause nothing but new suffering for our people.Now the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina are beingasked to choose between a just  defensive war and an unjustpeace. The war  if continued  is likely to cause furthersuffering for our people and the further destruction of ournation. It could mean the death of thousands more.The unjust peace plan is flawed because it is basedupon the repugnant and historically failed concept of ethnicpartition and apartheid. The flaw is compounded by the factthat even the partition is unfair  since it seeks to satisfy theaggressor’s appetite for an inequitably large share at theexpense of the victim.However  the flaws in the so-called peace plan beingforced upon us are not merely philosophical. First  any planthat legitimizes genocide and promotes ethnic partition willmost likely sow the seeds for new aggression and fuel thefires of retribution. Secondly  any peace that does notaddress the true causes of war will  at best  offer onlytemporary  remedial relief rather than promoting the healingthat is essential. Finally  any peace plan that makes noprovision for a viable Bosnian State  that does not addresseven the most basic needs of the victim and that does notprovide the necessary measures for real implementation anddurability is  in the end  not a plan for real peace.Last week’s provisional acceptance by the BosnianParliament of the peace proposals is dependent on the sameminimal adjustments that we have consistently held to benecessary for a durable peace. These adjustments are thefollowing:First  the Bosnian Republic within the proposed Unionof the Republics of Bosnia and Herzegovina must be viablegeographically  economically  politically and defensively.Secondly  the aggressor forces must surrender controlof the territories where they have slaughtered and expelledcivilian populations so that the Bosnians can return to theirhomes. Well over half a million refugees would find itimpossible to return to villages  towns and cities from whichthey were expelled if Serbian forces that committed murder rape and torture were to continue to control those territories.There is the option that some of those territories could betemporarily administered by international peace-keepingforces.Thirdly  the final agreement must containcomprehensive and specific guarantees concerning itsimplementation from those nations and regionalorganizations that will actually be enforcing the peace. Suchguarantees must be an integral part of the peace accords andcannot be delayed until a later date. Otherwise  we riskadopting another agreement or commitment that will  like somany others previously  become worthless for peace and ofvalue only to further legitimize the aggressor.Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 3Fourthly  in the event that the international communityis not successful in implementing the peace plan  then wemust be allowed to arm and defend ourselves.Consistent with its authority and unavoidableresponsibility  the Security Council should evaluate the planprepared by Lord Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg to determine itsconsistency or inconsistency with the United Nations Charterand numerous resolutions previously adopted by the Council.The Council cannot escape its responsibilities and theinherent inconsistencies by hiding behind the frequentlyrepeated excuse that it will accept whatever all the partiesagree to  when one party  the victim  is under the pressureof the very real threat of genocide.As further negotiations on these matters continue  themediation team should be enlarged to include arepresentative of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO)  which will most likely be the agent ofenforcement. This would add a degree of clarity  directionand credibility to the talks that has been lacking so far.Now  let me bring to the Assembly’s attention theimpending humanitarian tragedy unfolding in my country.On behalf of all Bosnians  I must first thank the UnitedNations and all the friendly Governments  private institutionsand heroic individuals that have helped provide humanitarianassistance in Bosnia. We profoundly appreciate the effortsthat have so far saved many lives. But with the coming ofwinter  more help will be needed if our wounded andmalnourished population is to avoid finally succumbing tostarvation  disease and exposure. In this effort it is essentialthat the international community and its most capablemembers and relevant regional organizations do thefollowing: first  take steps to encourage and enforce themaintenance of the cease-fires recently agreed to by all therelevant forces; secondly  take steps  as envisioned in severalSecurity Council resolutions  to stop the blockage ofhumanitarian relief and other essential supplies such aswater  electricity and gas; thirdly  reopen Tuzla Airport making possible the delivery of humanitarian relief to overa million people; and  fourthly  establish clear demands forthe lifting of the siege of Sarajevo as a first step towards thelifting of all sieges of Bosnian towns  including the safeareas designated by Security Council resolutions 824 (1993)and 836 (1993).Our Bosnian minority in Serbia  the Muslims ofSandzak  have been deprived of their rights. Many peoplewho have defended the rights of their countrymen have beenimprisoned or expelled. While the Serbian regime hasostensibly been protecting the rights of ethnic Serbs inCroatia  it has not been willing to recognize those samerights for minorities in Serbia. We demand the same rightsfor the Muslims of Sandzak as those that Serbs aredemanding for themselves in Croatia. Future negotiationscannot neglect this very important political and human-rightsissue.As United States President Clinton recently statedbefore this body  the United Nations cannot become involvedin every world conflict. United Nations involvement shouldonly be undertaken with a clear political and militarystrategy in place. Tragically  United Nations involvement inBosnia and Herzegovina has so far shown the very antithesisof any clarity of objective and firmness of resolve. Themoral void created by this confusion has naturally beenfilled with a determination to defer to the aggressor’s wishesat the expense of the victim. The United Nationsintervention  in its half-heartedness and equivocation combined with its proud insistence that it is getting the jobdone and that therefore we cannot be allowed to armourselves  may well go down in history as the principalinstrument of my country’s destruction.In this regard  a few unavoidable questions arise. Whyhas there been no implementation of Security Councilresolutions 824 (1993) and 836 (1993) calling for the liftingof the siege of our cities? What has happened to theSecurity Council’s demands in resolution 752 (1992) for thewithdrawal of all Serbian military and paramilitary unitsfrom our country along with their heavy weapons? Why hasthere been no implementation of Security Council resolutions787 (1992) and 838 (1993)  which were to monitor theborder between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina andprevent the continuing massive flow of arms and materialgoing to the aggressors in Bosnia?It is no longer possible to speak of non-intervention.The international community’s involvement in Bosnia beganwith the imposition of the arms embargo and has continuedthrough this whole series of unfulfilled commitments. TheUnited Nations must either follow4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionthrough with its intervention or decide to rescind thatintervention. One way or another  it cannot continue withthe present policy  which makes it an accomplice in thedestruction of the Bosnian people.My Government remains committed to peace and to theideals of a pluralistic  democratic and multi-religious society.Unfortunately  some of the very nations that espouse theseideals world wide have betrayed them by inaction  and intheir own backyards. We cannot indefinitely continue astruggle on principle without adequate help from outside orwithout at least being afforded the full opportunity to defendourselves.The action of our Parliament is clear in its commitmentto peace  its demands for a viable State and a durable peace.Principles have been shamelessly abandoned by those whohad the greatest duty and reason to uphold them in ourcountry. We cannot and will not accommodate the anxietiesof those same Governments and allow them to pressure usto abandon our last hope for self-preservation and a real anddurable peace.Although there has been a process through which manywitnesses to this crime have become anaesthetized to itshorror  the horror itself will never go away  and futuregenerations of the righteous and the just in every nation willneither forgive nor trust the countries which allowed it tohappen. At least a billion people are waiting for this bodyto act. Are Members really ready to surrender Bosnia andits people to annihilation? Those billion people I havementioned  and not only they  will never forgive you."
"20",829,"BLR",48,1993,"I wish sincerely to congratulate the representativeof Guyana on his unanimous election to the distinguishedpost of President of the General Assembly at its forty-eighthsession. This is an expression of great respect for him andhis country. I cannot fail to note the enormous amount ofhard and complicated work  deserving of the highestappreciation  that Mr. Stoyan Ganev  a representative of thefriendly  fraternal Bulgarian people  carried out in that post.We welcome and congratulate the Czech Republic Slovakia  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Monaco  Andorra and Eritrea  which have this year becomeMembers of the United Nations.The end of the twentieth century will undoubtedly godown in history as a time of tectonic shifts in internationalrelations. With our own eyes we have seen the hugetectonic plate of the cold war  with its intense confrontationbetween two super-Powers and two ideologies  sink into thepast. Living space for a new world order has been openedup. What will it look like?The end of the last century was filled with direforebodings reflected in a surrealistic quest  and thoseforebodings have  unfortunately  been borne out. Thedifficult twentieth century has become the century ofconfusion for the human soul and human society  and of theextreme tension of antagonisms that have many timesbrought civilization to the brink of destruction.Today feelings and expectations are different. At theend of the century  it would seem  the foundation is beinglaid for harmonizing new ways of life in the internationalcommunity.But the establishment of a new world order is not aspainless as one might imagine. Changes in the balance ofpower and the dynamism of international relations oftenmutate unforeseeably into chaotic scenes of tensecontradiction and conflict. World Powers  alliances of Statesand newly emerged countries are searching for their identityand rethinking their role in an entirely new world.Not always can an organizing vector or a system ofvalues  guidelines and ideas inspiring all of us be felt in thisworld.In this situation  there is a new perception of thepotential role of the United Nations. I believe that thisorganizing role of the United Nations is more lofty  moresignificant and more realistic than the one formerly assignedto it in the post-war decades  which in fact was unfeasible inthe context of confrontation between the super-Powers. It isprecisely this role for the United Nations in a new world thatthe Republic of Belarus advocates most actively.It is at this precise moment that the potential of boththe United Nations Charter and the Organization itself as acentre for harmonizing and coordinating the action of nationsis being realized. The United Nations  as the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  has emphasized is trulybecoming irreplaceable.Undoubtedly  the new role of the United Nationsrequires a new level of efficiency in the Organization particularly in its main bodies - the Security Council and theGeneral Assembly. The Republic of Belarus supports thereforms aimed at helping the Organization adapt to thefundamentally new realities and making the procedures of itsmain bodies more democratic. But in surging forward  oneshould not lose contact with the ground under one’s feet.Reforms  responsibilities and the future are those referencepoints on which we believe we should constantly focus ourattention.26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionAt this decisive moment  the Security Council isbecoming the centre of attention  like a magic crystal ball inwhich one can discern the future. Naturally  reforming theCouncil  including expanding its membership  requires anespecially responsible approach. Mindful that in these newconditions  this most important United Nations body cannotremain the same as it was designed and created almost halfa century ago  we support a careful search for consensus onall issues related to its reform. Changes in the SecurityCouncil - especially today  when its work has become muchmore intensive - should not hamper the productiveness of itsefforts. To a large extent these efforts depend  in our view on well-coordinated activities among all of the Council’s 15members  on their adherence to the purposes and principlesof the Charter of the Organization and on their highlyconscientious  responsible attitude  proved  through realdeeds  to the entire international community.The Republic of Belarus  as representatives know  isone of the candidates for a non-permanent seat on theSecurity Council for 1994 to 1995. Today  on the eve of thegolden jubilee of the United Nations  the fiftieth anniversaryof its creation  it is appropriate to recall that at the time ofthe inception of the World Parliament back in 1945  Belaruswas a founding member of the United Nations  having beenamong the first to sign its Charter.It is appropriate to recall here that we have gained acertain amount of experience through working in theSecurity Council from 1974 to 1975. It is also true that wehave been represented in that important body the fewestnumber of times compared to our friends and colleagues inthe regional group  but we hope that this injustice will beredressed at the forthcoming elections.The new historical conditions which led to the creationof the Commonwealth of Independent States  with Minsk asthe host city for its coordinating organs  have made us takea fresh look at our role and at our possibilities ofparticipating in the life of the international community. Thisis also attested to by the joint support of the Commonwealthand of a number of friendly States for Belarus’s candidaturefor non-permanent membership in the Security Council. Forus  the submission of the candidature of the Republic ofBelarus for membership in the Security Council does notrepresent merely a spontaneous political gesture nor ahankering for pro-forma prestige. Historical circumstancesare such that the experience and the potential of Belarus  atthis very difficult moment in the formation of a new worldorder  can be of great importance to the internationalcommunity.Let us take a look at this experience and potential inthose areas which have become very important forpreserving global peace and security  as is widely recognizedand attested to even by this current debate.I deal first with the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. As representatives are aware  Belarus is one ofthe four States that inherited strategic nuclear potential fromthe former Soviet Union. In our case  this is an importantmodern arsenal located in the heart of the Europeancontinent on mobile strategic missiles. It directly affectsglobal security  the nuclear balance and nuclear non-proliferation. Belarus  however  renounces the prestige of anuclear State  the sword of Damocles referred to here byPresident Clinton  and has chosen non-nuclear status.Having made the appropriate commitments  we arefulfilling them in practice. In 1992 we were the first toremove tactical nuclear weapons from our territory; in fact that was done ahead of schedule. Last February  theParliament of Belarus virtually unanimously ratified theStrategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) and the LisbonProtocol to that Treaty  and also took the decision to accede as a non-nuclear State  to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons. In July of this year the instruments ofaccession were deposited in Washington  Moscow andLondon.I wish to emphasize that since May 1992 - that is  sincethe signing of the Lisbon Protocol - we have never givenany grounds for anyone to doubt the honesty  logic andconsistency of our actions. Of all the States which are thenuclear heirs to the Soviet Union  Belarus was the first  andstill the only one  to have rejected nuclear weapons inpractice. Moreover  it did so without any preconditions orreservations. Thus  for the first time in the history of theinternational community  a sovereign State has voluntarilyrenounced a real opportunity to possess and develop nuclearpotential. This is truly a large-scale contribution by Belarusto global security and the non-proliferation of nuclearweapons. I wish to emphasize once again that our wordsand deeds are not at variance.Having put forward from this lofty rostrum in 1990 theidea of creating a non-nuclear belt from the Baltic to theBlack Sea  we have  to the best of our abilities  beentransforming our territory into part of such a belt. We hopethat in due course our idea will be supported and developedby our neighbours.Of great concern to the international community is thethreat of illegal exports from the territory of the formerForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 27Soviet Union of nuclear materials  technology andequipment  which can fall into irresponsible hands.Responding to this danger  Belarus was the first State of theregion to enter into a large-scale agreement with the UnitedStates to set up a stringent system for export control. Workon implementing this agreement is already under way.Other initiatives put forward by my country are no lessfamiliar to the United Nations. After many years of effortby Belarus  there has been agreement on internationalmachinery that has the potential to prevent States fromreplenishing their arsenals with new types of weapons ofmass destruction. During this session we intend to continueour active work in this area.Taking an authoritative position on these issues Belarus  on behalf of and on the instructions of the States ofthe Commonwealth of Independent States  intends duringthis session to present a joint declaration by theCommonwealth of Independent States on issues of thenon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and theirdelivery systems.I turn now to reductions in conventional weapons. Ourcountry does not manufacture battle tanks  and never has.Yet we now have more tanks per capita than any otherEuropean State - another part of the difficult heritage of theformer Soviet Union. When we decided to accede to theTreaty on Conventional Forces in Europe  we knew full wellthat Belarus would have to eliminate 1.7 times more tanksthan the United States  10 times more than the UnitedKingdom and 50 times more than France. Thatdisproportionate burden is not taken into consideration in theTreaty  since the Republics of the former Soviet Union hadno opportunity to participate in its preparation.At stake  however  was the fate of a highly importantinternational agreement on which many European countrieshad been working for more than 20 years  and so as not totorpedo all that work and set Europe back many years weundertook that excessive burden  at great cost to ourselves.Now  Belarus is making an enormous contribution tostrengthening regional and international security bydestroying the weapons of what was the most powerfulmilitary tank district in the former Soviet Union. We aredoing this with extreme difficulty  because of the problemsof the present transitional period. I would note that thisoften results in a lack of understanding among our ownpeople: during an energy crisis  we are destroying tankswhile we lack the energy resources to carry out our crop-sowing campaign.Weapons are immoral  just as the Moloch of war isimmoral. But the process of disarmament has turned out tobe far from idyllic: a catch-phrase of our century - ""Gunsbefore butter"" - has been fulfilled in a most unexpected way for the destruction of the guns has done nothing to increasethe supply of butter.In reducing its conventional weapons  Belarus is guidedby the interests of all  and is entitled to expect reciprocityfrom other States in overcoming its difficulties.On the whole  the heritage of the former Soviet Unionhas been a difficult one: an economy among the mosthighly militarized  and large military contingents. Suffice itto say that at the start of 1992 there were three times asmany soldiers and officers per thousand civilians on ourterritory as there were on average in the USSR.Working sincerely to keep Belarus neutral  ourParliament and our Government have adopted a policyintended to demilitarize the national economy  including a50 per cent reduction in our army over five years and thedevelopment and adoption of a defensive military doctrine.Having lived over the centuries through the horror ofnumerous wars  and having lost in their flames millions uponmillions of its citizens  the Republic of Belarus will do itsutmost to ensure that the firestorm of military confrontationwill never again consume its territory.I shall deal now with ethnic conflicts.Acute and bloody ethnic  religious and intercommunalclashes have become a dangerous feature of the new world.The deep  often irrational  roots of these conflicts pose anespecially difficult challenge to the entire internationalcommunity  for they do not respond to simple prescriptionsfor settlement. In Belarus  profound social transformationsare taking place against a background of unique mutualtolerance among varied ethnic  cultural and religious groupswithin our society. Not a single drop of blood has stainedthe soil of Belarus during this difficult time of transition.We shall continue to do our best so that Belarus  nestled inthe very heart of the European continent  can continue to setan example of political  ethnic and religious balance.Belarus is unique in its humanistic spirit  which canguarantee stability and irreversible democratic reform  and28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionwe sincerely offer to the Security Council our experience ofcoexistence among different ethnic groups and the centuries-old tradition of national  cultural and religious tolerance thatis a feature of our country.I am sure that tolerance can be an important key to theresolution of any conflict. With international effort  we cansucceed. It was tolerance in the highest sense of the wordthat made possible a recent handshake  which finally openedthe way to what had seemed the impossible: a Middle Eastsettlement. It is tolerance that will determine the success ofthe process under way in South Africa  and it is a lack oftolerance that is delaying the settlement of the crisis inBosnia.Instability; ethnic and religious clashes; ethnic andregional separatism; internal political strife: they have allreached tragic levels in the post-Soviet areas. In a numberof cases  they have grown into local military conflicts  andeven wars. The internal stability of Belarus and its positionat the centre - serving as host to the coordinating bodies ofthe Commonwealth of Independent States - give Belarus thepotential to be a peacemaking mediator in such conflicts.For example  we sincerely wish to help settle theproblem of Nagorny-Karabakh. Belarus remains ready toassist in convening the international conference on Nagorny-Karabakh  under the auspices of the Conference on Securityand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  to be held in ourcapital  Minsk  on a date to be determined by theparticipants.We believe that the neutrality proclaimed by Belarus isan international asset. This constitutional objective enablesus to adopt a wider  unbiased approach to determining ourpositions on various issues. We do this taking due accountof the realities of today’s world and of our place in thatworld. We strive to pursue our policies in such a way as tolay the foundation for a prosperous and neutral Belarus.Specifically  we are moving towards the development andimplementation of the principles of democracy.The Belarus Parliament is in the final stages ofconsidering our new Constitution  which will consolidate theirreversibility of the democratization of our State. We arebuilding a new political structure: new political parties national  social and political movements  and hundreds ofcivic organizations have been officially registered and havebegun their political activities.Among these organizations is the League for theProtection of Human Rights. The evolving human-rightsstatus of Belarus is up to international standards. As earlyas 1991 we ratified the Optional Protocol to the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights and recognized thecompetence of the Human Rights Committee  in keepingwith article 41 of the Covenant.Belarus commends the results of the second WorldConference on Human Rights  held this year in Vienna. TheConference in particular reiterated the obligations of Statesto ensure completely and effectively all human rights andfundamental freedoms without any discrimination whateveragainst persons belonging to national minorities. We attachgreat importance to this provision.Belarus has created and is still creating all thenecessary conditions for national minorities that live in itsterritory so that they can fully enjoy human rights. But atthe same time we are far from being indifferent to thetreatment of Belarusians who live beyond our nationalterritory and will continue in future to follow closely thesituation of more than 2 million ethnic Belarusians who livein different countries of the world.Economic reforms are gaining ground in the Republic.A gradual movement towards a market economy hasincreased the level of openness of the economy and haslimited the State’s monopoly in a number of areas of life.Concrete steps towards creating a private sector have beentaken. The law on private landed property  which is offundamental importance in this respect  has been in forcesince 1 September. The adoption of these legislative acts like the laws on property  entrepreneurship  and foreigninvestment  has created the basis for the further developmentof market relations. Right now Belarus is on the thresholdof a wider stage of its privatization.The Republic of Belarus  like other States of thisregion  is vitally concerned about developing andstrengthening multilateral cooperation in the economic field.We believe that there are forms of discrimination andlimitation with respect to the States of Central and EasternEurope which should  along with the cold war  become athing of the past. Any delay here will be at variance withthe political and economic realities of the world.Belarus is striving to lift barriers and limitations in thefield of trade and has taken a decision to start negotiationson its accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT). We also hope that very soon the UruguayRound will be successfully completed.Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 29Integration on a new level of economic activity withinthe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is especiallyurgent for us. Belarus was one of the main initiators forsetting up an economic union within the framework of theCIS and of concluding an appropriate agreement to thateffect. It is with great pleasure that I state that an agreementon setting up such an economic union was signed recently under the chairmanship of Mr. Shushkevich  in Moscow atthe meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the CIS.This opens up favourable prospects for the economicstabilization of the Commonwealth of Independent States andfor the gradual overcoming of the most acute problems ofthis transitional stage. I am convinced that the agreementsreached in Moscow will mark a transition towards radicallynew relations  that is  market relations  and will inevitablylead to the formation on that basis of the eastern Europeancommonwealth  a geopolitical and economic group of amarket type that will gradually  but at the same timeconsistently and unswervingly  become integrated intoEuropean and world economic structures.These new prospects encourage us also because theywill help Belarus  I hope  in the near future to strengthen itsreal capacity to pay and settle to a large extent the problemof our financial obligations to the United Nations.We are well aware of the acuteness of the financialsituation of the Organization. That is why  despite our ownextremely difficult economic and financial situation  theGovernment of Belarus recently made a contributionamounting to $3.5 million to the budget of the Organizationand  in effect  has fully settled its arrears. I wish to assureMembers of the United Nations that we willcontinue to do what we can within our very limitedresources. But the United Nations itself through its mainorgan the General Assembly must take steps to have thefinancial obligations of Belarus strictly match our realcapacity to pay. In particular the new realities warrant adecision without further delay on the relocation of ourcountry from Group B to Group C in the scheme of theapportionment of expenses for United Nations peace-keepingoperations.At the beginning of my statement I mentioned the greathopes for the future which Belarus places on United Nationsactivities. However  there is one very special area for us inwhich United Nations assistance is vitally important  and thatis the environment and our ""eternal wound that does notheal"" - Chernobyl - the most terrible nuclear disaster.Along with the growth of cancer  especially amongchildren  of great concern to us recently has been the socialand psychological stress among our people. The birth ratehas fallen dramatically and the number of psychogenicdiseases has been growing rapidly. People are overwhelmedby a concern about their health and the health of theirchildren. This has also affected the pace of the Republic’stransition to new social and economic realities. We callupon the United Nations  in close cooperation with theCommission of the European Communities  to continue theirefforts to further study and overcome the consequences ofthe Chernobyl disaster. We hope that in the process ofreforming the United Nations system and its Secretariat thenecessary institutional and programme mechanisms will beworked out to further carry out Chernobyl-related activitiesin the interests of the entire international community  takinginto consideration the great significance and uniqueness ofthe lessons of the Chernobyl tragedy.The activities carried out by the new United NationsCoordinator on Chernobyl  Mr. Jan Eliasson  the beginningof whose work is greatly appreciated by us  gives us hopethat the United Nations potential will be used activelyenough to yield tangible practical results.In the post-Chernobyl era we need moral andpsychological support  sometimes simply compassion. Inthis connection I should like to recall the words of a greatRussian writer  Fyodor Dostoyevsky  who is connected toBelarus by birth. He once declared that beauty and thenobility of human relations would save the world. To thatI would add compassion because they in effect areinseparable since beauty is always noble while compassionand nobility are always beautiful.Belarus  living through the post-Chernobyl nightmare having over centuries survived the nightmare of many raids invasions and wars  poverty and hardship  understands thepain  the suffering  of the peoples of the developingcountries as no other country does. Poverty  diseases  childmortality  in many parts of the world cannot leave people ofgood will indifferent. Indeed it is immoral to fail to takenote of this. I am convinced that the new world order willentail a fairer distribution of the world’s wealth and it willbe marked by assistance to those who for decades have beenunjustifiably doomed to poverty  stagnation and predictablebackwardness and have had to be content with the remainingcrumbs of the wealth produced by them but thenredistributed and not in their favour.As one of the original members of the Commission onSustainable Development  our country is striving to30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioncontribute to its work in a way that reflects the ecologicaland economic interests of all groups of States in a balancedmanner. We support efforts to elaborate an internationalconvention on desertification; the search for a solution to theproblems of the small developing island States; and thesearch for new and additional resources for developingcountries.Aware  under the conditions of post-Chernobyl realities of the significance of ecological problems in finding asolution  Belarus has been actively supporting theimplementation of the decisions and recommendations of thefirst-ever summit in history held in the interests of the Earth.The Parliament of the Republic of Belarus has alreadyratified the Convention on Biological Diversity and is nowexamining the issue of acceding to the Convention onClimate Change. We support priority consideration ofecological problems within the context of internationalcooperation  and the Republic of Belarus supports the ideaof transforming  in the near future  the Commission onSustainable Development into the United Nations council onecological security. We are ready to contribute to theelaboration of its structure and mandate.The United Nations is moving from the old epoch tothe new one with an imposing baggage. Certain parts of ithave already become obsolete and will be of interest only tohistorical researchers; others contain the grains of that newfuture role to be played by the United Nations in this quicklyevolving world which I have already spoken about - forexample  a positive and future-oriented experience of large-scale peace-keeping operations in Namibia and Cambodia.Standing on the threshold of the third millennium  one canhardly envisage all of the details of the general picture of thefuture world. However  the prospects that lie ahead are whatmatters most  and they are clearly visible. From the role ofcease-fire organizer to the role of peace guarantor  from therole of peace guarantor to the role of co-organizer of life inthe international community  a wise and authoritativearbitrator whose political will is without doubt recognized byall: that is the way we see the role of the United Nations inthe next century. Meeting the challenges of the time Belarus is ready to work together with other friendly States including  if this is the will of the General Assembly  withinthe Security Council of the United Nations."
"21",864,"BLZ",48,1993,"The delegation of Belize takesimmense pride  Sir  in your election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. This is thefirst time in the history of the Organization that aCommonwealth Caribbean national has been chosen tosuperintend the deliberations of the General Assembly. Yourelection is  thus  not only the highest tribute that could havebeen paid you  but is also the accomplishment of yourcountry  Guyana  and of the wider CommonwealthCaribbean. As a part of the latter  Belize may be forgivenfor any note of self-congratulation that creeps into theencomiums we heap upon you today.In that regard - and we say this only slightly withtongue in cheek - we note that almost your first act ofwisdom upon assuming office was the selection of a veryexcellent Belizean as presidential spokesperson.Let me at this time also record my delegation’sappreciation of the most able manner in which the outgoingPresident  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  conducted the work of theGeneral Assembly at its forty-seventh session.14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionIn addition  may I take the opportunity to welcomeformally to the United Nations family the six countries - theCzech Republic  Eritrea  Monaco  the Slovak Republic  TheFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  and Andorra -which have joined the Organization this year.Allow me also to offer  on behalf of the people and theGovernment of Belize  our deep sympathy to the people andthe Government of India for the heavy death toll andconsiderable material loss caused by the devastatingearthquake on 30 September.Over the five years since I last appeared in this Hall many things have changed in the world. In Belize we  too have experienced change. On 30 June 1993 the people ofBelize voted  through peaceful elections  for a newgovernment. Once more we have demonstrated the stabilityof our democratic institutions and the maturity of our polity.In an age when the so-called global trend towardsdemocratization seems at times to be a process that movesone step forward and two steps back  we in Belize are justlyproud of our record.In these five years  some of the changes occurring inthe global prospect have been favourable  and many of theseare attributable to this Organization  which  under itsdistinguished Secretary-General  has been striving to fulfilthe mandate of its Charter and find ways and means to copewith problems not necessarily envisaged by the framers ofthat Charter.In the brief tour d’horizon of the international scenewhich I shall undertake today  the first matter I wish toaddress is peace and security. We are very gratified by thepositive developments that have occurred in several places.Uppermost in our minds is our own subregion of CentralAmerica. There we have been heartened by the movementof several of our neighbours towards reconciliation andsocial justice.In particular  we note with satisfaction that the briefhiccup of the events in the Republic of Guatemala in Mayand June does not appear to have seriously flawed thatcountry’s efforts at permanent redemocratization. We arehappy that the new government there has publicly confirmedGuatemala’s recognition of sovereign and independentBelize. Diplomatic relations between our two countries canonce again proceed apace; and we shall continue the workfor the preservation of bilateral and regional security and thesearch for a lasting solution to the issues that still bedevil us.In accordance with the principles enunciated by thisOrganization  such a solution must be on the basis of mutualrespect for peace  for the rights of both countries toself-determination and for the integrity of each other’s landand sea territory.In the Caribbean we have hopes that the long-sufferingpeople of Haiti will be rewarded by the return of itslegitimate government.Recent developments in South Africa are clearly veryencouraging  and we are confident of the success of thetransition to majority rule  which will be heralded by thenon-racial elections scheduled for April 1994.Then  in the midst of continued strife in the MiddleEast  we believe we see positive signs of the way forwardwith the dramatic opening between the people of Palestineand the State of Israel. At long last there seems a realpossibility of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination coexisting with the State of Israel’s right tosafe and secure borders.We welcome the finalization of the demarcation of theboundary between Kuwait and Iraq  which was accomplishedby the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission on20 May 1993. We also welcome the adoption by theSecurity Council of resolution 833 (1993)  in which itguaranteed the inviolability of the boundary between the twoStates.Encouraging  too  has been the consolidation of thebroad consultative mechanisms for confidence-building security  human rights and cooperation originally establishedfor Europe in the Helsinki Conference and now substantiallyexpanded. Such structures have considerable value  and weunderstand that our colleagues in the countries members ofthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) arein the process of developing a similar mechanism with adistinct ASEAN character. Above all  we commend theSecretary-General for his vision in ""An Agenda for Peace"".Despite all these promising developments  however  theoverall outlook for world security remains bleak. In far toomany places the peace is disrupted by fratricidal struggle.Everywhere the crushing burden of armaments - to employa famous expression used by President Roosevelt andWinston Churchill in 1941 - bids to drive our planet off itsestablished course. The Second World War was partlyfought  and this great Organization was largely established to eradicate programmes of ethnic genocide. Now  nearly50 years after the birth of the United Nations  we areexperiencing several such programmes on a massive scale.Forty-eighth session - 13 October l993 15I urge that during this session we take the first majorstep to right these imbalances  which affect global peace andsecurity. Just as the Helsinki model is one way forward  wehope that another is the International Tribunal on warcrimes  the judges of which this Assembly recently elected.Among other steps which might be taken are thefollowing: Governments must forswear profiteering fromthe sale or sponsorship of the sale of armaments. Theremust be an expansion of regional and subregional systems ofcooperation and coordination in the cognate areas ofsecurity  narcotics interdiction and counter-terrorism. Thisbody must make firm recommendations for the developmentand rigid enforcement of domestic neutrality lawseverywhere. Likewise  the international law relating toneutrality must be thoroughly modernized to proscribe andseverely punish trafficking in arms. This must be not onlyin situations of belligerency  but also in cases of insurgency rebellion and other armed conflict  both internal andinternational. The recent salutary reinvigoration of thisOrganization’s peace-keeping mechanisms must be furthered.This is a time when the United Nations is increasinglybeing called upon to act as a peacemaker in troubled andturbulent regions of the world. It is to the Organization’scredit that it has risen to the occasion by undertakingcomplex and challenqinq assignments around the globe.There was a time when United Nations peace-keepingforces could successfully be composed of contingents fromthe so-called third world countries. But recent experiencehas now shown that large and difficult operations of theBosnia and Somalia type stand little chance of successwithout the active participation of major Powers. In thiscontext  we welcome President Clinton’s speech in thissession of the Assembly  offering to commit United Statestroops to the United Nations Bosnia operation under certainconditions.Yet there is still a role for small States. And we inBelize would be prepared to offer training facilities to theOrganization as a contribution to increasing the efficiency ofpeace-keeping forces. This would be in accordance withArticle 43 of the Charter  which calls for memberGovernments to make available to the Security Council""assistance and facilities ... necessary for the purpose ofmaintaining international peace and security"". Needless tosay  we would be happy to make our contribution in concertwith other countries in our area. Either pre-existing regionalsecurity mechanisms and/or new bilateral and multilateralarrangements might serve as the vehicle for small countryefforts at cooperation.As a backdrop to all this  the provisions of the Charterrelative to peacemaking must be strengthened. In particular a standing United Nations force under unified UnitedNations command should be considered and the MilitaryStaff Committee must be made fully operational. In keepingwith the Secretary-General’s quest to improve efficiencies strict military discipline of United Nations forces must beestablished and there must be improved coordination atHeadquarters and in the field.The most important of the steps which my Governmentbelieves should be taken is reform of the Security Council.It is self-evident that in these times of turmoil and increasedUnited Nations activity the agenda item of equitablerepresentation on  and increase in membership of  theCouncil looms large. Belize has recently submitted a paperto the Secretary-General  detailing our ideas on thisall-important topic.I wish to turn next to international cooperation. Ibelieve that there exists an international legal obligation tocooperate in good faith. It is anticipated in the Articles onprinciples and purposes and other provisions of the UnitedNations Charter  and is reiterated in such Declarations as thefriendly relations Declaration of 1970 and the 1974 Charterof Economic Rights and Duties of States. I will address thequestion of economic cooperation at a later stage in myremarks. At this point  I wish to train the spotlight oncooperation in the area of ecospheric concerns.As regards the ecosphere  Belize considers that theearly and universal ratification of the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea is of paramountimportance. It will be recalled that the Convention imposesmyriad duties of cooperation. In that way  the weak  and notonly the strong and mighty  will inherit the Earth and itswaters.We have seen two recent examples of successful effortsat cooperation in the ecosphere. The first involves the ozonelayer. In that connection  intensive cooperation byGovernments and by private industry  pursuant to theMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the OzoneLayer  as amended  has led to a significant decline in therate of expansion of the hole in the ozone layer.My other example is the cooperation of foreign anddomestic agencies with the Governments of my country Belize and Costa Rica  which has contributed to substantial16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionsuccess in our conservation efforts. Cognizant of thesesuccesses  we appeal for intensive cooperation in all aspectsof the ecosphere  including the termination of ocean andterrestrial dumping  the halt of desertification and thereduction of the causes of global warming. We also hope fora concrete programme of action at next April’s GlobalConference on the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States to be held in Barbados.One area in which we must redouble our efforts atcooperation is the moral environment. In numerous Membercountries the people have clamoured for cessation of corruptpractices in government and business  both national andinternational. Now  we are extremely happy to observe thatthe Secretary-General has established the new post ofAssistant Secretary-General for Inspections andInvestigations. In so doing  he has made it clear that themoral environment of our organization must be sanitized.We must support him in this endeavour. At the same time we lend our voice to those who call for the accountability ofall inter-governmental organizations to independent auditorsand inspectors.My Government attaches the greatest importance tointegrity and decency in public life. We applaud suchinternational efforts as the forthcoming anti-corruptionconference to be held in Mexico later this year to plannational strategies for fighting corruption. And we in Belizehave recently taken our own action to strengthen the legalinfrastructure necessary to banish the scourge of politicalcorruption. In just three months since taking office  we haveintroduced four major pieces of legislation in our Parliament.They are the Prevention of Corruption in Public Life Bill the Ombudsman Bill  the Contractor General Bill and theFreedom of Information Bill. This last  as far as we candetermine  is the only one of its kind in the entireCommonwealth Carribean. These measures bear testimonyto my Government’s determination to wage a total war oncorruption and to make Belize the model of a just  honestand democratic society.I turn next to issues relating to internationaldevelopment and economic relations. For over 30 years  theOrganization has painstakingly sought to spell out that theright to development and the duty of the privileged to assistthe underprivileged are firmly based in international law andpublic policies. This right and duty were part of the""freedom from want"" principle  one of the foundingprinciples of the 1942 wartime coalition that was the first tobe called the ""United Nations"". Freedom from want hadnothing to do with ideology and great-Power rivalry.Nevertheless  there have been dramatic ideological geopolitical and economic changes during the late 1980s. Asthese changes have occurred  needs have increased butresources have not. Yet we have heard rumours that variousinitiatives to bring economic justice to this planet are nolonger necessary.I respectfully suggest that nothing could be further fromthe truth. In fact  such controversial movements as the oneto establish a new international economic order were merely as we have intimated  the reiteration of an establishedprinciple. That is  those initiatives were the renewal of anorder  not a new order. Furthermore  in the original Somaliaintervention  we see strong confirmation of the continuingvitality of the principle of ""freedom from want"" - for all ofus will remember that the avowed objective of the currentexercises in that beleaguered country was to bring food comfort and succour to its suffering people.Thus  I believe  we are seeing the reaffirmation offreedom from want as a human right. At the same time  Iwould urge the Assembly to take firm steps to ensure thatfood no longer be used as a weapon by parties to civil andinternational conflicts.In all this we are acutely aware of the shift in worldtrading patterns brought on by the formation of new tradingblocs. The most recent and prominent of these are of coursethe North American Free Trade Agreement among Mexico the United States of America and Canada  and the SingleEuropean Market. And so  in some areas at least  the marchtowards wider trade liberalization and true market economymoves inexorably forward. But we in the South also see thatour economies and life as we know them are threatened bythese developments; our preferential access to marketssteadily erodes and our terms of trade consistently worsen.What we are in fact concerned about here is thepressure to open up our borders prematurely to the free flowof agricultural and other products from the more developedcountries. It is a bitter pill to swallow  even as we watchthe protectionist squabbling among developed countries thathas prevented the successful conclusion of the UruguayRound of Multilateral trade negotiations under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Of course  itwould also result in massive economic dislocation followedinevitably by social and political unrest in our countries.Nevertheless  we acknowledge that we must in the longrun identify alternative commodities that we can produceefficiently and with comparative advantage. I must stress however  that we are hard pressed to find the resourcesrequired for comprehensive research  development andForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 17promotion programmes for new products. We must beafforded an adequate transition period to adjust oureconomic and production activities. I would wish  therefore to take this opportunity to call on the countries members ofthe Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment to identify and dedicate significant financialand technical resources to assist small countries indeveloping alternative products. Of course  current trends inofficial and private financial flows to the developing worldsuggest that this is a cry that will fall largely on deaf ears.On a more positive note  permit me at this juncture toapplaud the apparent resolve of the United Nations organsfor development assistance to improve their efforts atcoordination. In this connection  I single out for specialmention the Secretary- General’s ongoing formulation of anagenda for development and the determined spirit of theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) tostrengthen its mission and revamp its machinery. This however  is but a beginning of what must be a crusade fordevelopment.The last set of issues I shall address are social  political cultural and humanitarian. First  we must do much more toensure that women are accorded their proper rights in thedomestic and international orders. No longer should wemerely echo the litany that women’s development isindispensable for economic development. We must ensurethat women are accorded equal rights in all spheres.Furthermore  they must urgently be given equalrepresentation in our political  social  cultural and otherinstitutions. Again  I take note of the recent efforts of thisOrganization to improve the position of women in the upperechelons of the United Nations Secretariat.As regards refugees  it would be disingenuous to callfor their enhanced protection without acknowledging thesevere problems which host countries increasingly face. Forinstance  we in Belize do the best we can  but overcrowdinga slender raft - even in a relative haven of calm - can bringdire consequences to all its occupants.Nevertheless  I am happy to report to this Assemblythat Belize’s record of human rights is good and worthy ofemulation. Our Constitution is founded on the principles ofjustice and respect for the fundamental freedoms of all ourpeople  and our laws and practices fully conform to themandate of our Constitution.The international scourge of narcotics continuesunabated. Again  we add our voices to those who urge thatat least the same degree of attention be given to curbingdemand and improving public health  as to addressingsupply. Narcotics  terrorism and urban violence are all grossmanifestations of an awful cancer seeking to engulf ourplanet. One clear contributor to this is the mass anduniversal culture  or what passes for culture  purveyed by themoguls of television. While we welcome the utility of thenew global news channels  we lament the other  baneful influences to which our people are subjected by someaspects of worldwide programming. It is high time that thisOrganization tackle this problem.Finally  as regards human riqhts and humanitarian law even over the brief period of five years since I last addressedthis body  we have witnessed significant expansion in theactivities of the Commission on Human Rights and thebodies established under the various United Nationsinstruments for the protection of fundamental rights andfreedoms. We have seen this Organization  on invitation participate in monitoring and conducting elections and  in theunprecedented case of Cambodia  actually administer acountry prior to the holding of democratic elections. Yet thebasic rights of human beings in numerous places are stillseriously impaired. Many of those who should protect  infact violate. And conferences  tribunals and conventionsbring scarce relief.In the realm of humanitarian law  we are hopeful thatthe International Tribunal on war crimes will set a healthyprecedent. Nevertheless  we view with increasing concernthe flouting of the Geneva regime  especially the 1977Protocols applicable to various forms of civil strife. Thatregime is the other side of the coin of human rights.Whichever side comes up when that coin is tossed  it comesup tarnished.Clearly  despite a somewhat mixed record  the UnitedNations is no moribund organization. Nevertheless  as itnears its golden jubilee  it does require additional impetus a more focused consensus for reform and revitalization. Letall of us  then  as we go about the business of this forty-eighth session  bear well in mind the words of the Preambleto the Charter and accordingly pledge our rededication to thetask of saving succeeding generations from the scourge ofwar  reaffirming faith in fundamental human rights andequality  and creating the moral climate in which justice andinternational law will finally prevail."
"22",911,"BOL",48,1993,"I should like to extend greetings to the Presidentof the General Assembly  Ambassador Samuel Insanely ofGuyana  to the former President  Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria and to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Icongratulate them on their active commitment to theprinciples of peace  justice  human development andinternational law.I should also like to greet the Heads of State andrepresentatives of Member States who are gathered here inthis historic Hall.Despite having the seventh highest rate ofhyperinflation in the history of mankind  Bolivia has been apioneer in the structural reforms that began in 1985 with theadvent of democracy and freedom - reforms that werecarried out without limiting human rights but by makingmajor sacrifices. I should like to take this opportunity topay a tribute to the President of our country during thatperiod  Dr. Victor Paz Estenssoro and  on behalf of allBolivians  to pay a special tribute to his statesmanlikeleadership.In retrospect  this may not seem so great a task:Reining in the economic crisis and bringing about peacefulchange in conditions of freedom and liberty are activitiesthat are being accomplished in many countries in LatinAmerica and elsewhere in the world. The situation inRussia  for example  reminds us of the difficulty ofachieving consensus and legitimacy in governing a societyin crisis  a society in which change is necessary.Bolivia’s course has required daring and imagination.We have not shrunk from calling upon our people to makesacrifices and shoulder additional burdens. But we areprofoundly alarmed  however  when we see so manycountries embarking on the road to democracy and changeand attempting to achieve stable growth and developmentwith social justice and when we then note that nocorresponding efforts are being made in the developedworld.The end of the cold war lit a beacon of hope  but weare surprised that it has not engendered an increase ininternational cooperation and solidarity. There was greatercooperation during the era of confrontation because of thedesire to defend third-world countries against the communistthreat and to replace the cold war with relations built onsolidarity and development. Today  on the contrary  poorcountries are faced with cuts in assistance  the prices of ourraw materials continue to plummet  and protectionism is onthe rise. Indeed  in real terms the current prices of tin tungsten  antimony  coffee  rubber and petroleum are evenlower than they were in 1930  during the great depression.It is difficult to see on this bleak horizon how we aregoing to solve our problems: the migration from rural tourban areas  and from cities to the developed world; theincrease in drug trafficking and the phenomenon of poorpeople being virtually forced to destroy nature in order tosurvive. That creates a vicious circle  with ever-deepeningpoverty.The paradox of our times is that  in a world that isgrowing ever richer in overall terms  poverty is on theincrease. There is a wider disparity between the ""haves"" andthe ""have nots"". The precarious stability born of internalsocial and economic deficiencies must be tackled by all ofus. There is also an urgent need for basic changes in howwe face the problem of solidarity and the development of thecommunity of nations and human societies.Developed countries must realize that sooner or laterthe present situation rewards no one and injures everyone.I truly believe that we must have a clear awareness of thefact that population growth  the doubling of the population the destruction of the environment  the production of illegaldrugs and the trafficking in them  the migration from poorcountries to rich countries are problems that will affect notonly those countries but the world at large.The solution is greater development. We know thatwhen people’s incomes rise  when women are educated andwhen there is social justice  population growth rates alsochange.We know that in order to restore balance between theenvironment and society we need educated people who canput to use their special heritage and knowledge of living inharmony with nature - as is the case in our country.Just as we had to learn that nature can punish us whenwe harm it  the time has come for all of us  developed andundeveloped  to become aware that it is unacceptable thatthe rich of the world should become ever more wealthywhile the poor are becoming poorer.As we know  the solution is not just to hand out moneyor aid. But there is no other way to achieve our goal if wedo not change old ideas. The motto should be ""Trade  notaid"". Yet it would seem that the fate of the underdevelopedworld is ""no trade and no aid""  which is absolutelyunacceptable to us all if we wish to create a new  more justand peaceful society.With the passing of time solutions will be even morecostly and more difficult in human terms and in social andeconomic terms. What we need  I believe  is greaterforesight on the part of those who are guiding the world’sdestiny. They must find solutions that are truly effective.I am not saying that we should repeat the past. But inthe past there were plans such as the Marshall Plan thathelped donors and recipients alike. We need similarapproaches. We look forward with great expectation to thefree trade agreement among Canada  the United States andMexico. We congratulate President Clinton on hiscommitment to struggling against the forces of protectionismin his country and elsewhere in North America to trying toforge ahead.As a small developing country  Bolivia views all thiswith hope  and as a commitment that we will be able to sellour products to the developing countries rather than onlysending them people.We look forward to a speedy and successful conclusionof the Uruguay Round  as we believe that the freedom ofForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 3opportunity to produce is the only hope for our societies.The children of the world ask only that their parents be ableto work and bring home their daily bread. But that happensonly when a country - a society  a world - stands togetherand gives everyone equal access and opportunity.We are not asking for special treatment; we are notasking just for help. We are asking to be allowed to workand to export  and not to be obliged just to export the mosttalented and vigorous people of our societies to thedeveloped world.In Bolivia we are trying to forge ahead with projectsusing foreign capital and the participation of our people. Weare a very poor people. Our country knows that it needstechnology and capital  and during the coming years wehope to embark on an ambitious but feasible plan.This plan has three pillars: capitalization democratization and popular participation.First  we wish to invite foreign capital to come todevelop technology and use fresh resources in order toenrich the heritage of our State enterprises. We do not wantto sell our heritage  and we do not want only theparticipation of States.Secondly  50 per cent of those enterprises and50 per cent of the stock must be owned by all Bolivians sothat these Bolivians can participate in the enterprises andfeel included in the process of economic development.Thirdly  many people ask ""How can we give free goodsto uneducated people who do not know how to read or write who have different ethnic and cultural backgrounds?"" Thetruth is that in Bolivia many people do not know how toread but do know how to count. They know what it meansto participate. They know what it means to feel they aretaking part in the fortunes of the country. With theirparticipation we wish to bring to poor neighbourhoods andcommunities the health and education the people there needso that they can share in management.The coming millennium will no longer find thatrepresentative democracy is enough. It must be participatorydemocracy. People want to participate and they will do sovery well when it comes to matters that directly affect theirlives and futures.We believe that with participation of this kind oursocieties’ meagre resources will yield greater productivity.Demand will grow  which will make it possible for oursocieties to forge ahead.But in Bolivia participation is not a mere word. For thefirst time in 500 years  a man has emerged from anindigenous ethnic group to become Acting President of ourcountry. To the Bolivian people Victor Hugo Cárdenas isnot only an Aimara Indian  a person from the countryside but a great professional and outstanding intellectual. Hetypifies our desire that all of our citizens take part in oursociety. We want to do away with age-old injustices. Wewant to bring about change - to bring people in  not keepthem out. We want to create unity while respecting thediversity of opinion not only on ecology and theenvironment but also on cultural  geographical and racialproblems.We believe that this determination to include - notexclude -people is helping build a society in which there ischange with order  and order with change. And although weare among the poorest countries in Latin America - indeed in the world - we believe that we stand as an example of thefact that it is possible to live with social peace and to regainstability  growth and social justice within the generalframework of a democratic society. In Bolivia  democracyworks because people seek consensus; they seek respect;and they are accepting of diversity.This process should allow us to arrive at a situationconducive to dealing with employment  education and healthcare  and  most importantly  the rural sector  where thegreatest degree of poverty prevails and where the people areamong the poorest in the world.Dynamic growth would  of course  reduce the need tocultivate coca leaves. We in Bolivia have succeeded inreducing by 50 percent the amount of land used for thecultivation of these leaves. We accomplished this withoutthe guerrilla violence that accompanies narcotrafficking  andwithout the cartels that are in place in the country. Whilewe are undoubtedly making progress in this area  we arewell aware of the fact that the only alternative developmentactivity to this is light industry for export purposes. Thereis no use telling the Bolivian peasant  as I said earlier  tostop producing drugs and instead plant coffee when the priceof coffee has dropped to half its former price  or to producecacao when no one wants cacao - or rubber. Experience ofalternative crops emphasizes the vital importance of enablingcountries such as Bolivia - especially Bolivia - to exporttheir products to the developed countries in the form ofmanufactured goods  rather than having them export thescourge of harmful drugs to the rest of humankind. We will4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioncontinue  nevertheless  to fight against drug traffickingbecause we have made a commitment not only to our peoplebut also to humankind. Though we are poor  we are veryhappy to see that new efforts are being made to reducedemand. What we want to do is reduce supply. We wishto eliminate this business  with all its attendant dangers -social  moral  legal and institutional. Indeed  we havechosen the zero-option. We expect to be successful  with orwithout help. But we are more likely to be successful if weenjoy the support  cooperation and understanding of the restof the world  which is  after all  affected by this terriblescourge.Ours is an ambitious project  to be sure  but it isfeasible. We recognize that the principal responsibility forthis plan rests with Bolivians. We are not just waiting forsomeone to help us. No  we know what all the peoples ofthe world know  that hunger cannot wait  that solutions haveto be found by oneself. But  in all sincerity  I think it willbe very difficult to overcome these problems withoutinternational cooperation. There must be some signal fromthe outside that assistance will not come to an end asbarriers to trade mount.Bolivia has made a great commitment to theenvironment. We have done so because our poverty stemspartly from our neglect of this problem. We have allowedpoverty increasingly to justify destruction of our naturalresources in our daily activities. We do have a great plan -a plan of international significance  not just to resolve ourbalance-of-payments problems  not just to create anindustrial centre that could be the basis of the energy that weneed  but to see to it that environmental pollution is reduced.That plan calls for construction  with Brazil  of a pipelinethat would bring Bolivian gas to the San Pablo market.With cheap  non-polluting energy  used in industry and incars  we can contribute to fundamentally reducing pollutionin Latin America at its source  for the benefit anddevelopment of Bolivia  Brazil and the entire world.Human rights must be the emblem of the new worldcommunity  and we must see to it that the right todevelopment within social justice is achievable. It is not justa gift that we are asking for. We are asking for anopportunity. The United Nations is changing. It has tochange; the world has changed. After the greatconfrontation of the cold-war period  we must deal with allthe harm this war caused  especially in the Third World.We have to reorient global solidarity  not just in terms ofassistance  but we must accept a concept that is truly verysimple and logical. Some countries become rich when theydo business  when they engage in trade with other richcountries. To believe that a man is rich because everybodyelse is poor is a holdover from the past. The great lesson ofour time is that the only way to generate wealth is to helppeople break the shackles of poverty.We welcome the agreement between Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization. It marks the beginning ofa new era of peace and of a new spirit of global justice anddialogue between nations facing historic circumstances. Themutual recognition of the inadmissibility of acquiringterritory through war is a great stride forward  as is the greatand historic lesson that  even in regions where territorialdisputes so stubbornly persist  civilized dialogue  commonsense and humanity can yield results and can bring peopletogether rather than keeping them apart.Recently  in the heart of Latin America  we reunitedtwo countries - Paraguay and Bolivia - that 61 years agowere split apart by war and have now decided to forge acommon destiny. This has had a great impact on us because  since the handshake - since the agreement betweenthe two countries - in our country the veterans of the Chacowar have marched carrying the flag of Paraguay. If thosewho fought  whose comrades died  are prepared to forget how could we not do likewise?These enlightening examples of how the most bitterconflicts can be resolved evoke in us a sincere desire thatthe same spirit should guide the search for a final solutionto Bolivia’s land-locked status  which has lasted 114 longyears. Many people say: ""How can you be claimingsomething that you lost 114 years ago?"" I reply that wehave a great deal of patience; our people waited 500 yearsfor their lands to be given back to them  for them to winback their country and their right to participate in society.I believe that injustice is not prescribed for us; we shallcontinue to make our claim  through the use of reason andnever by force. We shall continue to claim our right ofaccess to the sea until it is granted  until the sea runs dry.When it does  there will be no further problem and weshall make no further claims  but I believe that it reallywould be an affront to go on blocking this historic comingtogether - which two fraternal peoples are demanding - if atthe Government level  at the level of leadership  we continueto discuss something to which both countries already wantto find a solution. Solutions are possible; miracles dohappen  but we have seen that miracles are the result ofwork and imagination  and in this we are committed  withoutaggressiveness  coolly and calmly  to doing whatever wecan  as creatively as we can manage  to find solutions thatwill meet the challenge and the expectations of this newForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 5world in which we are living  and to bring about the changethat we require.In these times of change  we must rely on our owncreativity. We know the importance of one’s own efforts.But at the same time we want others in this world to standby us in solidarity  and at least give us the opportunity toshow what we can do.And we must move ahead in security along the newpaths required by history  and we ask  and shall try toensure  always and with renewed vigour  that the pathchosen is the path of solidarity  well-being  and fraternalrelations between peoples and countries."
"23",958,"BRA",48,1993,"It is with great pleasurethat I congratulate you  Sir  and the Republic of Guyana  onyour election as President of the General Assembly at itsforty-eighth session. In so doing  I wish to reaffirm thetraditional ties of friendship between Brazil and Guyana. Iam certain that you will contribute to making this session ofthe General Assembly a landmark in the path towardsprogress and democracy among nations.I would also like to express to Mr. Stoyan Ganev respected jurist from the Republic of Bulgaria and Presidentof the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session  ourrecognition for the work he accomplished.The strong and innovative leadership provided bySecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali will continue to bea factor in furthering the work of our Organization.At the opening of the debate at this forty-eighth sessionof the General Assembly  we are  once again  being sweptby the winds of change. A fresh breeze  bringing us themessage that understanding and peace may finally prevailover selfish interest  is blowing from the Near East  cradleof some of the most valuable moral lessons on which ourplanetary civilization is built.Man’s adventure on Earth  driven by reason and bydreams  has unfolded within the tension between self-interestand solidarity. In the dialectic interaction between solidarityand self-interest which has shaped and continues to shapethe destinies of mankind  solidarity has just attained a greatvictory  allowing us greater optimism about the future andabout the possibility of the materialization of the perpetualpeace of which Immanuel Kant spoke. Indeed  following thehigh hopes ushered in by the end of the cold war  we wereforced to postpone any exclamations of joy as we witnessedthe much-heralded new order transform itself into growingdisorder  marked by the re-emergence of conflicts rooted inparticularisms  which were supposed to be among the closedchapters of history.We have noticed that the inherent preoccupations of thecold war have shifted from an East-West axis to a North-South orientation. New concepts have been used to justifydiscriminatory acts with repercussions for the countries ofthe South. Some of these concepts were presented under thecloak of humanitarian or moral values  such as the so-called""right of intervention"" and ""good governance""; others arerenewed versions of old practices  such as eco-protectionism.At the same time  the countries of the North tightened theircontrols on the entry of dispossessed people from the South many of whom came from former colonies. Thus  peace ofmind was to be preserved along with the exclusive privilegesof post-industrial society. At the same time  just when theywere enjoying new heights of freedom  some of the peoplesformerly subjected to authoritarian rule were carried away innationalistic exaltation  the consequences of which continueto parade before spectators who are as shocked as they arepowerless.It was as ""glad tidings""  in an almost Biblical sense that the world welcomed the news that peace andunderstanding were possible in a region marked up to nowby pain and conflict. The handshake between Mr. YitzhakRabin and Mr. Yasser Arafat is emblematic of the close ofthis century  a symbol indicating that history is not over  assome have suggested  but rather that it is just beginning after a long  dark and turbulent pre-history  in which themark of Cain has always prevailed over the profound desirefor lasting peace felt by all peoples.In this same spirit  I reiterate the solidarity of Brazilwith the Russian people  who continue to face the challengesof the process of democratic transition  which we areconfident will succeed in their country.It is therefore with renewed faith in the ability ofmankind to find solutions to the problems it continuouslycreates for itself that we begin our work at this forty-eighthsession of the General Assembly.Exactly thirty years ago  another Minister of ExternalRelations of Brazil  a career diplomat like myself Ambassador João Augusto de Araujo Castro  pointed out thatthe task of the United Nations could be summed up in whathe called the ""3 D’s"": Disarmament  Development Decolonization. Today  with the virtual elimination of thelast remnants of colonialism  I could paraphrase him bystating that the international agenda is once again structuredaround three ""D’s"": Democracy  Development  Disarmament with their ramifications in the areas of human rights  theenvironment and international security.The changes we have witnessed have not been limitedto the international sphere. Ethical advancements have alsobeen made in the domestic sphere of countries  where ethicshave prevailed over the petty interplay of interests whichusually makes up day-to-day politics and which leads somany young people to disbelief and to turn away from theideal of citizenship  without which man cannot fully realizehis calling as a social being. I believe that I can proudlyassert that my country  Brazil  despite the inherent problemsof underdevelopment  has placed itself at the forefront of this""ethicalization"" of political relations  which goes far beyondthe almost bureaucratic concept of ""good governance"".We can still hear the echoes - and the world’s mostimportant opinion makers did not fail to register them - ofthe resounding popular campaign which  in perfect harmonywith the legislative and judiciary branches of the BrazilianGovernment  led to the impeachment of a president.Through an exclusively internal process  which emerged anddeveloped within the Brazilian people and their legitimaterepresentatives  a rarely seen lesson in citizenship was given by the use of a legal instrument which  though present inother countries  had never been implemented to its ultimateconsequences as it was in Brazil. In this process theBrazilian people counted on the support of a press which with courage and boldness  put to good use the freedom itwas once again enjoying after two decades of authoritarianrule.It is with justifiable pride that I am able to state  beforethis world assembly  that Brazil has etched a mark - and nota minor one - in the evolution of political institutions. I amcertain that the peaceful and strictly legal and constitutionalmanner in which this transition took place in Brazil will bea necessary reference in books that may come to be writtenabout the history of democracy in our time. I would like tostress that the process which led to this feat - and a featindeed it was - was set in motion and ran its course neitheras the product of any form of external pressure  nor inresponse to any action inspired by standards of governanceimposed from outside  but solely and exclusively as theresult of the deepest sense of citizenship shared byBrazilians of every social class.Since taking office  President Itamar Franco hasimposed upon himself and upon the Government he leadsabsolute respect for the Constitution and for the laws of theForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 3country and  above all  for the unchanging principles of lawand ethics. Among the constitutional rights of the humanbeing and of the citizen are those laid down in the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  which our Constitutionincorporates and expands upon. Ensuring respect for thoserights - in protecting indigenous populations  in safeguardingchildren and families  in guaranteeing political freedom andaccess to justice - has been the determined policy of thecurrent Government  and is the challenge we face after along period in which economic growth and socialdevelopment did not tread convergent paths.Within an atmosphere of freedom in which the projectof building an open democratic and pluralistic society ismoving forward  we are seeking to solve our macroeconomicproblems while steering clear of the authoritarian temptationof recourse to technocratic formulas based on closeddecision-making structures. Although it may seem  onoccasion  more efficient  technocracy tends too frequently toimpose excessive sacrifices on the poorest and mostvulnerable sectors of the population. The road we are following -that the Government of President Itamar Franco is following- is another  perhaps more complex and arduous one  butcertainly one that is more democratic and more capable ofleading to consensual and sustainable results.The Brazilian Government and society are both awarethat the difficult issues we are confronted with in the area ofhuman rights are deeply intertwined with the socialimbalances inherited from decades of insensitivity rooted inauthoritarian rule. Democracy  human rights anddevelopment make up another indissoluble triad. None ofthose terms can be brought to complete fruition in theabsence of the other two; that is why the BrazilianGovernment attaches such importance to the resumption ofgrowth and the expansion of employment along with a fairerdistribution of income  the only solid and sustainable basiswith which to ensure social development and the fullrealization of human rights. That is also the reason for theimportance attached to programmes  such as the programmeto combat hunger  which have emerged in our society andwhich can count on the full and resolute support of theGovernment.We know only too well  however  that problems in thearea of human rights - to which recent incidents that shockedBrazilian society and the world bear witness - cannot waitfor development to be consolidated and for welfare to reachall of society. At the same time as we seek to solve themradically - that is  by attacking their social and economic roots -we must also attend to the more immediate aspects. To thisend  the Government is determined to act  at different levels under the inspiration and the guidance of the President  whois personally committed to this task.Transparency in the decisions and actions of theGovernment constitutes an important aspect of Brazilianpolitics. Such transparency manifests itself in  among otheractions  the fluid and cooperative dialogue maintained withsegments and organizations of society dedicated to thestruggle for the observance of human rights in the country.This open and constructive spirit is not restricted  by theway  within our own borders: we seek and maintaincooperation on issues related to human rights with othercountries  intergovernmental and non-governmentalorganizations  with which we are devising new methods ofaction for safeguarding the rule of law and in favour of theadequate protection of human rights on the basis of mutualrespect.We do not disregard the fact that impunity may turn outto be the Achilles’ heel of any policy aimed at the fullimplementation of human rights and the elimination ofviolence. For this reason  the President has personallydetermined measures - whose implementation he has beenfollowing - for every case in which the human rights ofchildren  of indigenous populations  of women or of anycitizen have been violated. ln this endeavour  he has thesupport of Brazilian society  which will not tolerate impunityas it did not tolerate corruption and the breach of ethicalstandards in politics.With specific reference to indigenous populations  weare currently proceeding with the necessary strengthening ofthe Government’s presence in the Amazon region in order toprotect simultaneously the population and the environment both of which are frequently exposed to predatory activities;these result from an encounter of civilizations that beganfive centuries ago and extends up to today.Here again  the dialectics of solidarity and self-interestare at work; the increased effectiveness of actionsundertaken by the Brazilian Government in the Amazonregion  in conformity with the full and irrevocable exerciseof our sovereignty  is fundamental if we are to ensure theprotection and defence of all the region’s inhabitants and  inparticular  those of the Brazilian indigenous protected areas which amount to the impressive total of over 800 000 squarekilometres.The special importance we attach to human rights in thedomestic sphere is also reflected in our diplomatic action  aswas evidenced at the World Conference held in Vienna lastJune. The nomination of Brazil to chair the draftingcommittee of the Conference was both an honour and achallenge; we offered our collaboration with satisfaction witha view to the Vienna consensus being expressed at thehighest and most democratic level. The Vienna Declarationand Programme of Action constitute a significant advance inthe promotion and protection of human rights  including byrefining concepts now unquestionably acknowledged asuniversal. By reaffirming the interdependence of all humanrights  all of which require equal protection  the Declarationrecognizes that individual rights become little more thanlegal fiction if the bearers of such rights and the Stateswhich must guarantee them lack the material resources withwhich to ensure them.The promotion and the defence of the democraticregime inside each country are not sufficient: a vigorouseffort of democratization of international relations isessential  in conformity with two notable phenomena ofcurrent times: the wide consensus on the advantages ofrepresentative democracy and the growing linkage betweenthe domestic and the international spheres. This twofoldperception leads us of necessity to the recognition that thedemocratic ideal is applicable with equal validity to relationsbetween nations.We note with satisfaction the establishment of a virtualconsensus on the need to update the composition of theSecurity Council. It is our understanding that the growingrole of the Council in matters which affect the fundamentalinterests of Member States corresponds to the need to ensurea more representative composition  and so enhance theCouncil’s legitimacy and its efficiency. The reform of theCouncil must be achieved in such a way as not to aggravatefurther the imbalance between developed and developingcountries in the decision-making process of the UnitedNations. The General Assembly  as the definitivedemocratic organ within the United Nations system  mustplay a decisive role in shaping that process.The democratization of relations between nationsdemands that the international order protect them andguarantee their rights against illicit acts and abuses of power.There can be no democratic society if the rule of law is notstrictly observed and if the less powerful are not shelteredfrom arbitrary acts by those who wield force and power. Intoday’s world  it is no longer admissible to say  in the wordsof Pascal’s well-known aphorism  that ""as it was notpossible to make the righteous mighty  the mighty weremade righteous"".The material progress of peoples is to a large extent theproduct of their own  irreplaceable efforts. It is beyonddoubt  however  that such progress is contingent upon theprevalence of a favourable external environment. It istherefore imperative that international society  acting insolidarity  encourage the creation of conditions for progress not for the preservation of privilege.Apart from its intrinsic importance  the development ofall nations is the only factor that can genuinely reduce theimbalances that are so patently expressed  for instance  in thegrowing flow of migrants and refugees. In a global society social justice becomes an indispensable condition forpreventing crises  for alleviating tension  for consolidatingdemocracy and for promoting human rights.If we are to undertake a wide-ranging exercise ofpreventive diplomacy we must realize that only socially andenvironmentally sustainable economic development providesan effective means to accomplish our goals.In the pursuit of development the United Nations has afundamental role to play. We must make sure that theOrganization will act urgently to impart renewed life to itscommitment to development and  therefore  also itscapacities in the economic and social field. Imbued withthis hope  Brazil has supported and continues to supportvigorously the initiative of an agenda for development. Weare confident that the Secretary-General will present us witha proposal that will be no less innovative  bold and rich inideas than was ""An Agenda for Peace"".Similarly  great store is set by the work of theCommission on Sustainable Development. Brazil expectsthe Commission to be an effective tool for putting into effectthe commitments undertaken in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.In the same vein we give our wholehearted support tothe holding of the World Summit for Social Development a most timely initiative of the Government of Chile  acountry to which we are linked by close ties of SouthAmerican brotherhood and partnership in the Rio Group.We should not however be misguided by illusions.Only a dynamic insertion in the cross-currents of trade andtechnology will allow developing countries to reap their fairshare of the fruits of progress. To that end we advocate astrengthened multilateral trading system that can guaranteeboth an adequate reward for our effort at trade liberalizationand a normative framework to discourage protectionism andunilateral measures. Today that entails the need for aprompt and balanced conclusion of the Uruguay Round without discrimination or impositions. The significance ofthe Uruguay Round projects far beyond its strictlycommercial aspects. Its successful outcome will beinstrumental in framing an international order that is openand propitious for cooperation  thus preventing a splinteringof economic relations into self-contained blocs.The vigorous involvement of the community of nationsin the pursuit of development must be consonant with theprinciple of State sovereignty. Brazil views the sovereignnation-State as the basis for the legal and politicalinternational order. It must not be weakened lest weundermine the very basis of international representation andof the multilateral system. Attempts to play down theprinciple of national sovereignty - which incidentally arehardly ever targeted at the more powerful States - would bea step backwards in the effort towards more democraticinternational relations. At a moment when we are buildingthe future multilateral system we should not allowdifferences in power among nations to replace the sovereignequality of States. The warning sounded by Ruy Barbosa the distinguished Brazilian jurist and statesman  at theSecond Peace Conference of the Hague in 1907  remainsfully valid. In discussing the composition of the PermanentCourt of Arbitration he stressed that if certain proposalswere to prevail  then:""The great Powers would no longer be more formidableonly as a result of the strength of their armies or oftheir fleets. They would also enjoy a superior legalstatus in the international judicial forum  thus claiminga privileged situation in the very institution to whichthe administration of justice among nations is to beentrusted.""The international order we seek to build rests also ona third pillar  that of disarmament. Brazil  along with itsneighbours and partners in Latin America  particularlyArgentina  has been making an important contribution toadvancing disarmament and international security.The revision of the Treaty of Tlatelolco  theestablishment and work of the Brazil-Argentina Agency forAccounting and Control of Nuclear Material (ABACC) andthe Quadripartite Agreement on International Atomic EnergyAgency (IAEA) Safeguards  which have just been approvedby the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies  thus meeting animportant requirement for ratification  provide theinternational community with the guarantees of ourcommitment to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.We reaffirm our support for the non-proliferation  in allits forms  of weapons of mass destruction. In relation tochemical weapons  we  with Chile and Argentina  havealready signed the Mendoza Declaration in which wesolemnly renounced the possession and production of suchweapons. We were equally active participants in the processthat led to the adoption of the Convention on the Prohibitionof the Development  Production  Stockpiling and Use ofChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction  signed in Parisearly this year.We are gratified by the current observance  although ona somewhat fragile basis  of a moratorium on nuclear tests.We hope that the climate resulting from this moratorium willbring forth the early conclusion  through multilateralnegotiations  of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.Brazil  as is well known  has been participating in aclearly positive and transparent way in the process ofestablishing the United Nations Register of ConventionalArms.Brazil’s experience in the field of peace-building andconfidence-building is noteworthy. Brazil shares almost17 000 kilometres of land borders with 10 differentneighbouring countries. No other nation has haduninterrupted relations of peace and cooperation for so longand with so many neighbouring States. Very few countriesspend as little on arms - as a percentage of national product -as Brazil.At the same time Brazil does not renounce its right tomaintain  in good harmony with its neighbours and partners an adequate and legitimate defence capacity. Nor does itrenounce its right to have access to technology necessary forthe well-being of the Brazilian people.By undertaking firm and unambiguous commitments inthe field of non-proliferation and disarmament  Brazilbelieves it is entitled to expect from its more developedpartners unimpeded access to high technology  if necessaryon a commercial basis.Recent history gives proof that  despite persistent andserious shortcomings  United Nations peace-keepingoperations are important for overcoming situations ofconflict  some of which are quite old  complex and delicate.The need for an improved conceptual framework for peace-keeping operations must be kept under constant review bythe General Assembly. It is expected that the UnitedNations will contribute with sober effectiveness tomaintaining peace and security wherever they may bethreatened. Brazil currently participates with a significantcontingent of military observers in United Nations peace-keeping efforts. We intend to expand our presence in thisfield and we are actively examining ways and means to dothis.Within that context it is essential to rectify the seriouspolitical and strategic mistake of envisaging the South as anarea of international instability. Quite the contrary  variousregions such as Latin America provide examples of stablerelations of cooperation based on mutual trust  as illustratedby the vigorous processes of Latin American integrationwhich  far beyond their mercantile aspects  are the materialexpression of a political project aimed at internationalcooperation and solidarity. Such processes  including that ofthe Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR)  are instark contrast with the trends of fragmentation seen in otherparts of the world.Yet another clear demonstration of the potential forcooperation is taking shape in the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries. Far more than a means of expression ""lusiphonia"" is the hallmark of a frame of mind  a form ofbeing  a way of life predicated on tolerance and openrelations among different peoples.The Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the SouthAtlantic reinforces our links to sister nations in Africa. Theenhancement of political and economic relations within theZone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic is agoal towards which we are determined to work  havingregard  among other issues  to the constitution of a vast areafree of the nuclear threat. We furthermore expect to havethe pleasure of celebrating the full admission to the SouthAtlantic community of a democratic and united South Africa free forever from the scourge of racism.The historic speech delivered by Mr. Nelson Mandelajust a few days ago from this same rostrum warrants theexpectation and confirms the idea that in spite of remainingobstacles the process of democratization in South Africa isnow irreversible.We are forced to admit that serious areas of tensioncontinue to exist in the world. By virtue of our historicalties of friendship  cooperation and cultural kinship withAngola  the situation in that country is of particular concernto us. The international community  through the UnitedNations  has a fundamental role to play in the defence ofdemocracy in Angola and in the utter rejection of the use offorce as a means of achieving political gains. Peace mustprevail in Angola in full compliance with the BicesseAccords and all the relevant resolutions of the SecurityCouncil.We remain gravely concerned about the situation ofhuman rights and democracy in Haiti. The prospect for aprompt solution to the crisis in that country is high on ouragenda. We look forward to the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on 30 October.The restoration of peace in the former Yugoslavia is apriority for the international community in order to bring toan end the suffering of the populations involved in thatconflict. A willingness to achieve agreements acceptable toall parties must prevail in Geneva  as in the capitals of theformer federation. That willingness alone can enable theUnited Nations to play its irreplaceable role in bringingpeace to that region.Our example  and our response to these challenges  willframe the future order to which we all aspire: an order thatis democratic  stable  disarmed and committed to thematerial and spiritual development of all nations.The humanistic vision that inspires us was forcefullyexpressed by a Brazilian poet and diplomat João Cabral de Melo Neto  in these words:""Learn this: that man is the best measure always And more: that life  not death  is the measure of man."""
"24",1002,"BRB",48,1993,"Permit me  Sir  on behalf ofthe Government and people of Barbados  to express ourprofound appreciation of the high honour which theinternational community has done to our region by yourunanimous election to the presidency of the forty-eighthsession of the General Assembly. As I join all those whohave offered you congratulations from this rostrum  I feelbound to note with pride the considerable diplomatic skill experience and commitment which you bring to the Chairand which allow my delegation the confidence to anticipatea most successful and satisfactory session.May I also commend your predecessor  Mr. StoyanGanev  for having safely guided us through the demandingdeliberations of the forty-seventh session.We particularly thank the Secretary-General for hisvaliant efforts to secure international peace and security.Barbados welcomes Andorra  Eritrea  the CzechRepublic  Monaco  Macedonia and Slovakia to membershipof this great Organization  which we are sure will benefitfrom their participation.It augurs well for the outcome of this session of theGeneral Assembly that it has started against a backdrop ofsome success - however tenuous - in Haiti  in South Africaand in the Middle East. The cases of the Middle East andSouth Africa  especially  represent triumphs of diplomacyand patient negotiation. In this regard  no praise is too highfor Norway’s outstanding contribution in guiding seeminglyintractable enemies along the difficult and daring pathtowards peace. As we in Barbados laud such a remarkableachievement  we hope fervently that it will lead soon to thelong-sought goals of an Israel within secure boundaries anda homeland for the Palestinian people  goals envisaged inSecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We dare tohope  too  that that reality  once achieved  will lead to alasting peace in the region.In South Africa  despite the carefully orchestratedcampaign of violence and terrorism aimed at subvertingevery effort to create a non-racial  democratic South Africa President de Klerk African National Congress President 10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionNelson Mandela have  with truly remarkable courage andforesight  brought their country to the point where thetransition to democracy has now been enshrined in the lawsof South Africa. Barbados rejoices that a date has beenfixed for the holding of universal elections  and we welcomethe establishment of the Transitional Executive Council toprepare for those elections.In praising those two leaders  we must not overlook thesignificant contributions of the President of the Pan-Africanist Congress  Mr. Clarence Makwetu  and the manypatriots on all sides  present and past  who have made andcontinue to make their various contributions  sometimes evento the extent of the supreme sacrifice. The encouragingprogress in South Africa demands and deserves  no less thanthe process in the Middle East  the wholehearted support ofthe international community.The issue of Haiti is a matter of extreme importance tothe peace and security of the people of the Caribbean. Youare well aware  Sir  that the Heads of Government of theCaribbean Community were long convinced that theunfortunate and unacceptable state of affairs resulting fromthe overthrow of the elected President of Haiti could beresolved only through the intervention of the SecurityCouncil  the valiant efforts of the Organization of AmericanStates notwithstanding.The fact that the Governors Island Agreement wassigned so soon after the adoption of Security Councilresolution 841 (1993) would seem to justify our consistentposition. Today we continue to be apprehensive over thelevel and nature of the widespread turmoil in Port-au-Prince turmoil which seems designed to delay  if not derail  thereturn of President Aristide to his rightful place. Theinternational community in general  and the Security Councilin particular  must not sit idly by  merely expressing regretat the sorry state of affairs in that unhappy country. TheSecurity Council - indeed  all of our countries - must beprepared to take whatever action is necessary to ensure thatthe murders and assassinations cease. All parties must bemade to honour the Governors Island Agreement and theresults of the 1991 elections.There is another issue which the people of theCaribbean have contemplated with more or less trepidationduring the past 34 years. And although none of them mighthave an immediate solution to offer  many believe thatnothing would bring more joy to the people of the regionthan the announcement of an impending rapprochementbetween the Republic of Cuba and our great neighbour to thenorth. In the light of recent international events  Barbadosrefuses to believe that only between these two countries canno path to a peaceful resolution of their conflict be found.Four years ago in Barbados we celebrated the 350thanniversary of parliamentary practice. And it is in thatcontext that we applaud the United Nations for its role in theconduct of successful elections in Angola and Cambodia.While we are pleased at the post-election progress beingmade in Cambodia  we are concerned about the deteriorationin Angola. We urge the international community to be morevigilant in monitoring events in Angola. The comity ofnations has a duty to ensure that the results of free and fairelections are accepted and respected by all parties - in Haiti in Angola  in Cambodia or wherever else there isinvolvement by the United Nations in any such process. Noparty anywhere should ever be allowed even to think that theinternational community would tolerate the frustration ofproperly conducted election exercises.Barbados remains convinced that the internationalcommunity must adopt an integrated approach to peace  anapproach which concentrates on building and preservingpeace rather than on mere peace-keeping. Barbadostherefore appreciates the attention currently being paid bythis Organization to international security and peace-keeping.Indeed  we welcome the recent adoption of GeneralAssembly resolution 47/120  endorsing the Secretary-General’s ""Agenda for Peace"". We recognize that  in thesearch for consensus  the interests of all parties have notbeen fully addressed  but we consider that the reformsrecommended represent a useful first step towards theenhanced role the United Nations is called upon to play inthe promotion of international peace and security.International peace and security can hardly be attainedif the global environment continues to be sullied by rampanthuman rights abuses. Barbados welcomes the advancescontained in the Vienna Declaration and Programme ofAction of the World Conference on Human Rights particularly the re-emphasis of the universality of humanrights and the right to development as a human right.However  we must here reiterate that the widespreadresurgence of racism  xenophobia  religious intolerance ethnic conflicts and various other forms of human rightsabuses pose a most serious threat to the peace and securityof all of us.The proposal to create a post of high commissioner forhuman rights was such a contentious issue at the WorldConference for Human Rights that it has been referred tothis session for action. Barbados considers that before sucha post is established the following considerations should betaken into account. First  the mandate of the highForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 11commissioner should be satisfactorily defined. Secondly there should be adequate safeguards to ensure thecommissioner’s independence and neutrality. Thirdly  theoffice of the high commissioner should not be manipulatedto achieve the political ends of any State. Fourthly  the highcommissioner should be empowered to investigate allegedhuman rights abuses across all borders  and not on aselective basis.Barbados believes that preventive measures taken toguarantee international peace and security must also includeefforts to safeguard basic social and economic rights.However  we are equally convinced that not enough is beingdone to address development problems. We concur in theSecretary-General’s view that respect for human rights  therule of law and democracy cannot survive outside aframework of adequate development. Where access to food clothing  shelter  education  health and the opportunity forgainful employment is denied  democracy cannot flourish.In spite of 50 years of unprecedented technologicalprogress  in many parts of the world abject poverty stillpersists. An estimated 1.1 billion persons  or one-fifth ofhumankind  are unable to afford even minimally acceptablelevels of food and shelter. This problem  thoughconcentrated largely within the developing world  hastranscended national boundaries and now affects persons inthe developing and developed countries alike. Lowcommodity prices  lack of investment capital  the inability tosecure access to world markets  and high unemployment andlow productivity have contributed to the marginalization ofmillions of unfortunate persons.Particularly hard hit are our young people  amongwhom disillusionment and despair have already begun totake their toll  driving a growing number of them to resortto various forms of anti-social behaviour  including drugtrafficking and drug abuse. This desperate situation will notdisappear because of speeches denouncing poverty  or theadoption of resolutions calling for its elimination. Rather we must urgently adopt radical measures designed to attackand eliminate the conditions which fuel the growing andunacceptable levels of poverty in our societies.Barbados considers that social development will beamong the greatest challenges facing the United Nations inthe twenty-first century. We therefore regard theconvocation of the World Summit on Social Development scheduled for Copenhagen in 1995  as a clear signal thatsocial development has become a priority issue on the worldagenda. Barbados believes that that Summit will provide theinternational community with an opportunity to directattention to the acute problems relating to development. Ourconviction is that the focus of the development debate mustbe shifted to human development and that bold initiativesmust be taken to combat poverty and to lighten the burdenwhich structural adjustment places on the most vulnerable inour societies - our women and our children.Barbados is heartened by the Secretary-General’s""agenda for development"" proposal and looks forward withinterest to reviewing the report requested in GeneralAssembly resolution 47/181. We also welcome the timelyinitiative taken by the Government of Papua New Guinea  aninitiative in which I understand you yourself  Mr. President have no small interest. My delegation hopes that this matterwill be given the serious and urgent consideration it merits.Among the deterrents to development  drug traffickingremains one source of grave concern to the Governments ofthe Caribbean. Apart from the tragic consequences that drugaddiction has for the health of our people  illegal drugsconstitute the single most pervasive ingredient of increasedcrime in our societies. In Barbados  for example  themajority of criminal cases brought before the courts involvedirectly or indirectly some linkage to drugs. Penal andhealth systems are being stretched to their limits  while thefinancial implications of enforcement and rehabilitation arestaggering. Not even developed countries have yet been ableto eradicate from their societies drug abuse and itsmirror-image  drug trafficking. Developing countries arestill further disadvantaged by their chronic inability to takeon the powerful drug cartels and the narco-terrorists withany hope of real success. The problem is transnational inscope.It is therefore imperative that the Global Programme ofAction adopted at the 1990 special session on drugs beimplemented as soon as possible and that cooperation at thebilateral  regional and multilateral levels be enhanced. Therole of the United Nations Drug Control Programme is vitalto this process. Barbados looks forward to the fourhigh-level special plenary meetings scheduled to take placeduring this session. We expect that further measures tocombat the universal scourge of drug abuse will emerge along with the provision of the adequate funding necessaryto achieve these ends.It has been a year now since the United NationsConference on Environment and Development was convenedin Rio de Janeiro. Since that time  other matters - primarilymatters of peace and security - have helped to pushenvironment and development issues out of the limelight.The meeting of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment  charged with the responsibility of monitoringthe implementation of Agenda 21  served to remind us that12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionsustainable development must continue to receive seriousattention from the international community. TheCommission succeeded in generating the necessary politicalwill to impart a powerful impetus to national action for theimplementation of Agenda 21. We can ill afford any loss inmomentum.This brings me to the Global Conference on theSustainable Development of Small Island Developing States which the Government of Barbados has offered to host. TheConference will take place in Barbados from 25 April to 6May 1994. The Government and people of Barbados arehonoured that the international community has  in acceptingour offer  placed its confidence in our capacity to hostsuccessfully a conference of this size and importance. TheConference will be the first of the follow-up activities of theUnited Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment (UNCED) to be completed. It presents anearly opportunity for the implementation of the commitmentsreached at the Rio Earth Summit. As such  the Conferencealso represents a test of the political will of the internationalcommunity to match the solemn commitments of Agenda 21with real action towards more sustainable development.My colleague the Minister of the Environment  Housingand Lands of Barbados recently briefed the PreparatoryCommittee of the Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States on theprogress of preparations for the Conference. My delegationwill submit details on further progress when the item comesup for discussion in the substantive Committee. However let me at this stage put on record my Government’sappreciation of the spirit and atmosphere which prevailed inthe Preparatory Committee. Unfortunately  the meeting ofthe Preparatory Committee fell victim to the emergencyconference-servicing measures announced by theSecretary-General on 26 August 1993 and for that and otherreasons the preparatory process did not go as far as it mighthave. Barbados shares the view  expressed by manydelegations attending the meeting of the PreparatoryCommittee  that it would be dangerous to leave finalizationof the preparatory process until April 1994 in Barbados.Given the number and complexity of the issues leftoutstanding from the Preparatory Committee  Barbados isconvinced that some arrangements must be put in place tocontinue the preparatory process. We therefore look forwardto working with interested delegations towards reachingagreement on an appropriate mechanism for continuing thepreparatory process prior to the commencement of theConference.The Barbados Conference will provide the basis for thebuilding of a partnership for the implementation of thedecisions taken at Rio. The international community will beafforded the opportunity to signal its commitment to moveforward towards more sustainable patterns of developmentin a pragmatic  realistic manner  based on practical achievable goals. The people of Barbados look forwardeagerly to welcoming representatives of each and everyMember State in April 1994.The threat of natural disasters to the sustaineddevelopment of small developing countries must not beunderestimated. Barbados applauds the efforts of all thoseassociated with the International Decade for Natural DisasterReduction  to lessen the vulnerability of those communitiesmost susceptible to such disasters. We consider it essentialthat response capabilities in this area be improved with alldeliberate speed.Barbados is collaborating closely with the CaribbeanDisaster Preparedness Agency  the Caribbean RegionalSystem  and with the Pan American HealthOrganization/World Health Organization to continue toimprove its capacity to bounce back from the effects of agrade five-hurricane or to be able to come to the aid of anyof our Caribbean neighbours who may fall victim to anynatural disasters. I am happy to be able to report that acrossour region we have succeeded to some degree  at greatexpenditure of effort and resources  in improving ourcapability to mitigate the effects of natural disasters.Barbados supports wholeheartedly the current initiativeof the United Nations to fashion a safer environment for all.The Organization is now called upon to expand its activitiesover wide areas of the globe. The new freedom of actionreflects the current geopolitical reality. A new configurationof power is taking shape. While it is too early to determinethe outcome we must seek to mould this new phenomenoninto an instrument for the preservation of peace and securityand for the alleviation of human suffering everywhere.The Secretary-General has not missed an opportunity inrecent times to highlight the dichotomy with which he isfaced. He continues to point out that additional mandatesare being heaped upon the Organization as a result of thenew climate without a corresponding willingness to provideadequate resources for their execution. Barbados stronglysupports the expressions of concern by the Secretary-General. We urge all Member States to do the best they canto correct this unsatisfactory situation. It is clear that thereare some States whose capacity to pay may temporarilyoutstrip their actual ability to pay  but it is unconscionablefor those who can pay not to do so. I trust  Mr. President that under your expert guidance the General Assembly willfinally be able to take appropriate measures to address theForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 13financial crisis threatening the very existence of theOrganization.Barbados accepts that the Security Council must alwaysbe allowed to function without unnecessary hindrance. Werecognize equally clearly the principle of accountability.The Council has served its purpose well in the past  butchanging times and circumstances dictate the need for anenhanced participation.Twenty-seven years ago as a member of my country’sfirst delegation  I sat in this Hall and listened to the thenPrime Minister  the Right Honourable Errol Barrow  deliverhis inaugural address to the Assembly at its twenty-firstsession.In the intervening years though much has changedmuch has remained the same. Small countries like mine stillbelong to the submerged two thirds of the world’spopulation  and where we manage by our own painful effortsto raise our living standards we are faced with the prospectof graduation. To be faced with graduation on the one handand structural adjustment on the other is to be caughtbetween Scylla and Charybdis. Once again Barbados wouldurge with all the power at its command that the constantthreat of graduation be lifted from the vulnerable economiesof small  developing countries.In looking back over those 27 years with their ups anddowns  their triumphs and disappointments  throughprosperity and adversity  graduation and structuraladjustment  as Mr. Barrow was on that day  I too amreminded of John Bunyan’s Mr. Valiant For Truth when hesaid:""Tho with great difficulty I am got hither Yet now I do not repent me of all the trouble I havebeen at to arrive where I am."""
"25",1034,"BRN",48,1993,"Before making my statement I should like to take thisopportunity to express my country’s deepest sympathy withthe Government and people of India as they mourn thethousands of lives lost during last week’s earthquake.I wish to congratulate you on your election Mr. President; to thank the outgoing President for hiscontribution to the work of the United Nations; and towelcome all the new Members of our Organization.Much has been expected of the United Nations in thepast year. Its priority has been to ensure that the profoundpolitical and economic change does not result in globalconflict. This has sometimes meant coordinatinginternational efforts. On other occasions the United Nationshas had to take the lead in these operations. At the sametime  it has continued to take up the challenges presented bythe many far-reaching social  humanitarian andForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 7environmental problems of our day. These have provedmore and more difficult to contain within national or evenregional boundaries.The United Nations responsibilities have often beenundertaken under most unfavourable conditions. I amtherefore pleased that our Secretary-General and thecountries representing the United Nations have alwaysresponded positively to the situations they have faced. Ihope that they will continue to do this  even after suchdistressing events as those which have occurred in Somaliathis week.I say this because the past year has seen so manyvaluable achievements. The success of the United NationsTransitional Authority in Cambodia has shown what can bedone through responsible regional efforts and patientmultilateral action. In South Africa  national  regional andinternational efforts in support of United Nations resolutionshave brought new hope. In the Middle East  the UnitedNations has been a positive influence in reducing tensionafter the Gulf War.We also welcome the agreement between the PalestineLiberation Organization and Israel. This is the first steptowards a peaceful settlement of the Palestinian question.There have also been several initiatives aimed atimproving the world economy and developing better tradingarrangements in regions. At the same time  the UnitedNations has continued to give essential assistance to peoplein developing countries. It has also maintained its peace-keeping operations in a number of problem areas. TheUnited Nations has also organized important internationalconferences where nations have been able to exchange viewson many matters of international concern. This representsa considerable contribution to preventive diplomacy andpeace-building. In each case  I hope these achievements willbe consolidated by national and regional authorities.In Cambodia  we wish the new Government everysuccess as they go about the task of bringing lasting stabilityto their nation. Like all the countries in our region  we lookforward to seeing the Cambodian people enjoying peace andprosperity again.In South Africa  I believe conditions now exist fornational leaders to encourage restraint and seek consensus.The countries in the Gulf region are also in a positionto work towards peaceful solutions to the remaining areas ofdifficulty.In the Middle East  current developments should starta process that will restore all legitimate Palestinian rightsand should lead to a comprehensive settlement in the region.In terms of the world economy  objectives have beenset. What we hope to see now is equally clear progress instrengthening linkages between the North and the South andin creating conditions that promote cooperation andsustainable growth. To do this  we need to improve theexisting mechanisms for preventing economic disagreementsfrom turning into open conflict. Each nation has aresponsibility to promote fair trading arrangementsthroughout the world.Today’s overall situation presents many challenges. Ifeel that we can continue to turn them into positivedevelopments if we note carefully the circumstances underwhich the United Nations appears to achieve its greatestsuccesses. These occur when the special responsibilities ofnational Governments  non-governmental organizations andregional associations are recognized and agreed upon beforethe world body is asked to act.Where those responsibilities have been in confrontationwith each other  the effectiveness of United Nationsoperations has been hindered. This is clearly illustrated inSomalia and in Bosnia. In those countries  the UnitedNations initially acted in order to guarantee safe andeffective humanitarian assistance. There have beenconsiderable successes in these operations  and I thank thosewho have achieved them for their humanitarian work.However  these efforts and the fact that conflict has notbeen allowed to spread outside the regions concerned shouldnot divert our attention from the deep matters of principleinvolved.That is why we wish to express our strong support forthe Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We believethat the United Nations Charter would be severelycompromised if the Organization became a party to anyarrangement which forces a sovereign nation and fellowMember of the United Nations to submit to aggression. Notonly would this condone terrorism - it would reward it.In seeking to ensure that the United Nations does notbecome merely another factor in a local political equation there are a number of proposals for reform. These areintended to give confidence to Members that United Nationsdecisions reflect the widest possible spectrum of worldopinion. If they also assist in solving the world body’s deep8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionfinancial problems  I see merit in considering themfavourably.We all have our different views on how the UnitedNations should best operate. Whatever they are  I hope wewill make every effort to encourage our regional andsubregional associations to play a crucial supporting role.Ideally  each region will be working on its own agenda forpeace and development which will complement the work ofthe world body. The more this is done  the more the UnitedNations will be able to act in the way in which it is mosteffective - as the authority of last resort. In this way  Ibelieve we can make considerable progress towardsestablishing what the Secretary-General has described as aworkable international system."
"26",1076,"BTN",48,1993,"I have the honour to conveyto all members of the Assembly the warm greetings andgood wishes of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck  Kingof Bhutan  for the success of the forty-eighth session of theUnited Nations General Assembly.I begin by congratulating you  Mr. President  on yourunanimous election. We are confident that with your wideknowledge and experience you will provide proper directionto our discussions. We would also like to pay a tribute toour outgoing President  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  for the exemplarymanner in which he led the Assembly at the last session.We extend a warm welcome to the peoples andGovernments of Andorra  the Czech Republic  Eritrea  TheFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  Monaco and theRepublic of Slovakia on their joining the family of nations.We are confident that their membership will add to thestrength and vitality of the Organization.We would like to pay a special tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his dynamicleadership. His initiatives have already started to steer thecourse of the United Nations into new and bold directions.His report to the Assembly is clear and concise and providesa good basis for the work of this session.Forty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 19The momentous events taking place around us in thisnew decade continue to pose challenges and offeropportunities of an unprecedented scale. The handshake onthe White House lawn between Prime Minister Rabin andChairman Arafat opened a window for peace and tolerancein the Middle East after a century of hatred and suspicion.When President Clinton called the agreement the ""peace ofthe brave""  he paid just tribute to their courage. Deep-seatedemotions will continue to blur reason and not all groups willtake to the road of healing at the same pace. We join thosecalling on extremist factions on both sides to desist from theuse of force. My delegation hopes that the agreement willlead to a comprehensive and durable peace on the basis ofrelevant Security Council resolutions. We appeal to theinternational community to give even stronger support to theimplementation of the agreement in all its aspects.With regard to the situation in the Persian Gulf  weurge all parties to abide by Security Council resolution 833(1993). It is our view that for the full recognition ofKuwait’s sovereignty  the boundary as demarcated by theUnited Nations must be internationally respected.My delegation is happy with the progressivedismantling of apartheid and the process towards universalfranchise in South Africa. We have recently heard in thisforum Mr. Mandela’s historic call to end all sanctionsagainst South Africa  a call which must be speedilyhonoured.We applaud the positive results of United Nationsinvolvement in Cambodia  El Salvador and Haiti. Thesesuccesses  however  have not yet been replicated in Somaliaand Bosnia. My delegation strongly condemns violenceagainst United Nations peace-keeping and humanitarianworkers. As the need for peace-keeping in other parts of theworld grows  it is clear that in future the terms of everyintervention must be carefully defined.My delegation welcomes the reduction in theinternational arsenal of nuclear and other weapons and wesupport the continuation of the Non-Proliferation Treatybeyond 1995.With regard to the nuclear situation on the Koreanpeninsula  we urge the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea to comply fully with the International Atomic EnergyAgency (IAEA) Safeguards Agreement in order to avoid anysuspicion and speculation.In an age focused on reducing the world’s nucleararsenal  further testing is unnecessary and inconsistent. Weurge all nuclear States not to carry out further tests and tocontinue negotiations towards a comprehensive test ban.While the world’s nuclear arms and other weapons ofmass destruction are being dismantled  we are aware thatconventional weapons are used in all present-day conflicts.No country which supplies arms can dissociate itself fromthe moral responsibility for the use of such arms. We fullysupport the United Nations Register on Conventional Armsand urge the reduction of the international arms trade.Over the past two years  considerable emphasis hasbeen put on streamlining the United Nations Secretariat andmaking it more efficient. At the last two sessions theGeneral Assembly has directed its attention not only towardsreforming and revitalizing the United Nations but alsotowards making the General Assembly a more effective andresponsive forum. While some progress has been made  thediscussion on reforming and restructuring the United Nationscontinues. We cannot expect the United Nations  formednearly five decades ago with just 50 members  to remainunchanged and yet be able to fulfil the hopes andexpectations of the current 184 Members in a vastly differentworld. Clearly  the reforms and revitalization cannot belimited to managerial and organizational changes: the rolesand responsibilities of all the principal organs of the UnitedNations must be taken into account.My delegation believes that during our discussion onreforming the United Nations  the time is opportune toenlarge the Security Council. The expansion of itsmembership must be taken up together with the issue ofaccountability. While it is necessary to preserve the SecurityCouncil’s new-found effectiveness  it must always be madeaccountable for its actions to the General Assembly.The need for reform and restructuring seems in recentmonths to have been somewhat overshadowed by theOrganization’s financial difficulties and questions ofeffective operations and proper accountability. We fullyagree that it is necessary to minimize waste and streamlineoperations. These issues  however  must be pursuedindependently of the concerns over the financial health of theUnited Nations. We urge all Members to pay their assessedcontributions promptly. We are of the view that the currentlevel of assessment has fully taken into account both thefinancial capacity of Member States to contribute and therole they have assumed in the Organization. There is asaying in my country that one must load the pony accordingto its ability to carry the burden. Although the UnitedNations has travelled far in the last three years  it is clear20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionnow that we cannot keep overloading it without putting thenecessary means and resources at its disposal.The Second World Conference on Human Rights  heldin Vienna this year  clearly recognized that social progressand political stability cannot be ensured without respect forhuman rights. The Conference also recognized that humanrights and social progress can be promoted and preservedonly in a healthy economic and natural environment. Forour part  we are fully committed to advancing the humanrights of all our people.This year  as agreed to in Agenda 21 of the EarthSummit  the Commission on Sustainable Development hasbeen established. The work of this Commission will providea new direction for the preservation of the environment andgive added impetus to developmental activities. Werecognize that while all development must take place at localand national levels  there are clearly regional andinternational dimensions for which solutions must be foundat the global level. Bhutan looks forward to participating inthe upcoming global conferences on population anddevelopment  the World Summit for Social Development andthe Fourth World Conference on Women.The recession that has afflicted much of the worldeconomy in the past year has not shown any signs ofimprovement. In such conditions  it is hardly surprising thatthe economic performances of most of the world’s leastdeveloped countries have continued to be dismal. Per capitaincome for the one tenth of the world’s population whichlives in these countries has fallen in the past three yearsdespite the adoption of the United Nations Programme ofAction in 1990. While the least developed countries havebegun to initiate bold and painful structural reforms in theireconomies  budget constraints on donor nations andcompeting claims on aid resources have continued to slowdown the flow of official development assistance to the leastdeveloped countries. While expressing our gratitude todonors who have met and even exceeded officialdevelopment assistance targets  my delegation would like toappeal to the others to follow suit so that the reforms can besustained and promoted.The sluggish international economic climate in the lasttwo years has been further compounded by a spate ofunusually harsh natural disasters that have affected manyparts of the world. We would like to express our heartfeltsympathies to all those in the United States of America Japan  Nepal  and India who have suffered heavy loss of lifeand property because of recent natural calamities. Thecapacity to respond to such disasters should be placed highon the international agenda. This includes long-terminvestment in environmental conservation and othermeasures  including early warning facilities  to protectagainst natural disasters.Bhutan continues to make considerable progress in thefield of social and economic development. We are currentlyin the process of decentralizing the administration in termsof decision-making and implementation of developmentprojects. We are also giving priority to the development ofhuman resources. In all our nation-building activities  wehave sought to protect our rich natural environment anddistinctive national identity. In our efforts  we havecontinued to receive generous support from India  Japan Switzerland  Denmark  the Netherlands  Kuwait  Austria Norway  Germany  the United Kingdom and Australia  andfrom various specialized agencies and bodies of the UnitedNations  particularly the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP)  the United Nations Children’s Fund(UNICEF)  the United Nations Fund for Activites (UNFPA) the United Nations Capital Development Fund  (UNCDF) the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) the World Food Programme (WFP)  the United NationsVolunteers (UNV)  the Food and Agriculture Organizationof the United Nations (FAO)  the World Health Organization(WHO)  the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD)  and the United NationsEducational  Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO). I take this opportunity to express the sinceregratitude of the people and Government of Bhutan to ourdevelopment partners.This is an age of multilateralism  and the UnitedNations is the centre around which this new age willrevolve. The United Nations is no longer just theForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 21preserver of world order but an active promoter of peace andhuman advancement. Increasing cooperation among itsMembers since the end of the cold war has made it possiblefor the Organization to become more effective in pursuingthese objectives. The long-term success of the UnitedNations  in our view  will depend on how democratic itbecomes in its functioning and to what extent it will involveall its Members  large and small  in the decision-makingprocess. We hope that the United Nations will become thecenterpiece of a more just and equitable world order and willspeak for the whole of humanity rather than just for aprivileged few."
"27",1117,"BWA",48,1993,"Botswana and Guyanahave  since their attainment of independence  both in 1966 been the closest of friends. That is why we have welcomedthe election of Ambassador Insanally of Guyana to thepresidency of the forty-eighth session with so much warmthand anticipation. I say ""anticipation"" because we areconfident that he has the requisite experience  expertise anddiplomatic finesse to make a good and productive Presidentfor this most hopeful session of the Organization.Our gratitude goes to the outgoing President of theforty-seventh session  the Foreign Minister of Bulgaria  whogave the best account of his skills in the service of theAssembly last year.14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe new Members who have just joined the UnitedNations are most welcome in our midst. We assure them ofour fellowship and readiness to cooperate with them in theservice of peace here at the United Nations.We also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  on the creative dynamism he hasinjected into the work of the United Nations. We know hiswork has not been easy. But under his able leadership theUnited Nations has indeed demonstrated its capacity to serveas a reliable instrument of impartial management ofinternational conflicts. Increasingly  we are seeing thefulfilment of the ideas contained in what I think was themost forward-looking report ever produced by a Secretary-General of this Organization  ""An Agenda for Peace"".Mr. Ansari (India)  Vice-President  took the Chair.We commend the efforts the Secretary-General hasundertaken so far to enhance the Organization’seffectiveness. Botswana understands the concerns raised bythe Secretary-General when he addressed the FifthCommittee in August. Many demands and problems foistedon the United Nations have put a lot of strain on its coffers.Resources made available by Member States are far fromenough to meet these demands. Thus  the Organization isfacing a financial crisis of unprecedented magnitude. Thebiggest problem  as explained by the Secretary-General  isthe failure of some Member States to fulfil their financialobligations by paying the assessed contribution for both theregular budget and peace-keeping missions. Member Statesmust heed the Secretary-General’s call and fulfil theirCharter obligations by paying their contributions in full andon time.At the same time  it would be remiss of me not toemphasize the need and importance of transparency andaccountability in the use of United Nations funds. Of late we have heard of many irregularities in the administration ofthis Organization’s funds  in particular funds for peace-keeping missions. A number of proposals have been putforward by the various Member States for a review of therules and regulations governing United Nations finances.The time has come to set up a respectable mechanism toundertake this urgent task.Although the cold war is no more and old ideologicalempires have unravelled  the euphoria of triumphalism hasbeen short-lived. There is turmoil almost everywhere asage-old nationalisms that have for so long been suppressedexplode with a vengeance that knows no limit. True tocharacter  the twentieth century will not  so it seems  fadeaway peacefully.The post-cold-war era and the celebrated onset of a newworld order have thus not brought peace to our world  butmore bloodshed  instability and insecurity in many places.Consequently  there has been a rapid expansion of UnitedNations peace-keeping operations - far beyond the capacityof the Organization’s resources to manage. There is neitherthe manpower nor the financial wherewithal for the UnitedNations to be everywhere in the magnitude of presence thatis so often requested.There is  nevertheless  every reason for us to besatisfied with the valiant efforts which the Secretary-Generaland his staff have exerted to ensure that the many fires ofcivil war that have become such dominant features of theso-called new world order do not engulf us all. The UnitedNations has shown that  given the wherewithal  it can live upto what we expect of it in the realm of peacemaking andpeace-keeping. Cambodia has just been saved fromself-destruction. Imagine what Somalia could have becomehad the United States and the United Nations not intervenedto safeguard the delivery of the massive humanitarianassistance which the international community has poured intothe famished country. Even in the Balkans  where the mostbrutal and senseless civil war imaginable is in progress particularly in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina - acivil war that for a year and a half has been defying everysolution attempted - the United Nations has played amitigating humanitarian role under the most difficult ofoperational circumstances.On Somalia  Botswana stands firm in its support for theUnited Nations mission of mercy in that devastated country.We condemn in the strongest terms the continued attack onUnited Nations peace-keeping forces even as we deeplyregret the loss of innocent Somali lives. We cannot condonethe massive loss of civilian lives in Mogadishu  though atthe same time we need to be extremely circumspect inapportioning blame to one side of the conflict or the other.An international effort to save a people is in seriousjeopardy. An attack on United Nations peace-keeping forcesmust never be taken lightly  for it is fraught with veryserious implications. The horrendous spectacle of the corpseof a United Nations peace-keeper being dragged like agarbage bag on the streets of Mogadishu deserves all theopprobrium civilized humanity can heap on such a callousact of inhumanity. The international community must notflinch in the face of the acts of those in Mogadishu who arebent on thwarting the process of reconstruction andrehabilitation in Somalia.In many ways  the United Nations Operation in Somalia(UNOSOM) has been a success. Botswana is proud to havemade a contribution to UNOSOM  however modest.Forty-eighth session - 11 October l993 15The terrible civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is amonumental outrage that must shame us all as humanbeings. A world that is able to tolerate scenes of tinyinnocent children being torn to pieces or maimed byshrapnel and bullets - innocent and helpless victims of a warthat makes sense only to its perpetrators - is a world withouta conscience. The international community must devisemore creative ways and means of dealing effectively withthat savage conflict.To turn to our own continent  in Mozambique there isan encouraging movement towards peace and tranquility.The situation there has stabilized enough to give us morehope than ever before that the war-ravaged sister countrywill soon enjoy the beginnings of economic recovery andnational reconciliation and healing. Humanitarian relief isnow able to reach the famine-stricken. The United Nationspeace-keeping force  among which is our own contingent  isprogressively moving towards full deployment and theaccomplishment of its mandate. It is hoped that the manycease-fire violations thus far recorded will not sabotage thepeace process.The survival of the State and nation of Angola is invery serious jeopardy as the senseless civil war that has beenraging there since the mid-1970s has worsened and assumedthe dimensions of an unstoppable conflagration. All theefforts of the Security Council to find a lasting solution tothe civil war have come to naught as a result of Mr.Savimbi’s stubborn refusal to negotiate a peaceful end to theconflict. Unfortunately  in the face of this stubbornness onthe part of Mr. Savimbi  the world seems utterly incapableof doing anything more than calling continuously forpeaceful negotiations - a call that is continuously scorned.The international community must do more to saveAngola. A terrible crime against humanity is beingperpetrated against the Angolan people. We take note of therecent announcement by UNITA that it is ready to accept theBicesse Accords and the results of the 1992 elections. TheGovernment has in principle agreed to the resumption ofpeace talks. We hope that this time the peace talks  if theytake place  will produce the solution we have beendesperately waiting for.In South Africa  the horizon of change is morepromising than ever before. Negotiations for a new SouthAfrica have been torturously slow and painful  but theyhave  in a stunning reversal of fortune  produced the firsttangible evidence of the onset of real and meaningfulchange. The legislative structures that are to underpin thetransition to the establishment of a democratic Governmentin the first half of next year are in place. Four bills -namely  those regarding the Independent ElectionCommission  the Independent Media Commission  theIndependent Broadcasting Authority and the TransitionalExecutive Council - have been adopted by the NegotiatingCouncil and will soon be enacted into law  having beenpassed by the South African Parliament.Once the transitional legislative package has beencompleted with the adoption of the interim constitution andthe constitutional principles and fundamental rights at presentunder negotiation  the transition will officially begin with theinstallation of the Transitional Executive Council. To showthe great promise that the situation in South Africa holdstoday  I can do no better than quote Mr. Nelson Mandela’smomentous speech of 24 September to the United NationsSpecial Committee against Apartheid. He said ""The countdown to democracy has begun. Thedate for the demise of the white minority regime hasbeen determined  agreed and set"".In its statement of 29 September 1993 the Ad HocCommittee of the Organization of African Unity on SouthernAfrica concurred that enough progress had been made in thepeace process in South Africa to warrant the lifting ofeconomic sanctions. This was a momentous decision takenby Africa in the ardent belief and hope that we are trulyapproaching a historic watershed in the blood-stained historyof southern Africa: the end at last of the long nightmare ofapartheid. However  as Mr. Mandela and the SecretaryGeneral of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania  Mr.Benny Alexander  have conceded  freedom is not yet there.With all the horrific violence now ravaging the KwaZulucountryside and the East Rand townships  in the back yardof the World Trade Centre in Johannesburg  where thenegotiations are taking place  the process does not lackenemies or detractors. There is also the unfortunate boycottof the negotiation process by some parties  whoseimplications it is impossible to ascertain. Nevertheless  thepeople of South Africa  more than ever before  will needand  indeed  deserve our determined companionship as theywalk the last and  possibly  the most difficult mile in theirjourney to the new South Africa.Regrettably  progress  if any  has been very slow in theimplementation of the United Nations plan on WesternSahara. We urge the Secretary-General to continue to spareno effort to ensure that the referendum is held so that thepeople of Western Sahara can at long last decide their future.Botswana is encouraged by the readiness of all partiesto the Liberian conflict to honour their commitments to theYamoussoukro Accords and other subsequent peace plans.16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionWe are anxious to see the Accords implemented peacefullyand in full. The Secretary- General  in his last report on thesubject (S/26422)  notes that a successful implementation ofthe Accords would require sufficient resources. We appealto all Member States to be generous in their contributions tothe trust fund set up for this purpose.It is with a sigh of relief that we welcome the adoptionof Security Council resolution 872 (1993) on Rwanda. Weappeal to all the parties to the conflict in Rwanda tocooperate fully with the United Nations Assistance Missionfor Rwanda (UNAMIR) in ensuring that that war-torn EastAfrican sister country does not revert to the carnage that hasoften threatened its very existence.We celebrate the triumph of the democratic process inthe south-eastern Asian nation of Cambodia. The shroud ofmisery and death that for many years eclipsed Cambodiahas  hopefully  now been lifted  and lifted forever. Wecongratulate the United Nations and the Cambodians on ajob well done. 89.56 per cent of Cambodian voters undaunted by violence and threats of violence  have spokenloud and clear that they want peace and reconciliation.In the Middle East  the homeland of the Bible and itsmiracles  we have recently witnessed a miraculousrapprochement between the Jewish people of Israel and thePalestinian people. The foundations of peace in the areahave been laid  and no effort should be spared to build onthem. No effort should be spared in making the peaceprocess only just begun a just  comprehensive and lastingone. Given the desperate conditions in the occupiedterritories  we  the international community  have a duty tosupport and nurture the peace process by contributinggenerously to the economic reconstruction of the area toenable the Palestinians to taste the fruits of peace.We cherish the hope that the sudden improvement ofprospects for peace in the Middle East will have a catalyticand propelling effect on the quest for a workable formula forthe reunification of the island Republic of Cyprus. So longas the island remains divided  it will remain a source ofconflict and instability in the area.So it is with Korea. Botswana hopes the dividedpeninsula will soon realize that it has become fashionable inthis post-cold-war era for age-old problems suddenly tobecome amenable to solution. Change - peaceful change -through negotiation is the imperative of our time.In Central America  after many years of conflict  ElSalvador is finally at peace. We hope that the provencapacity and efficacy of the United Nations in the field ofelection-monitoring and supervision will again be put togood use in El Salvador’s March 1994 election.In Haiti  we look forward to the imminent restorationof the presidency of Father Aristide. The success of theUnited Nations and the Organization of American States inshaping the agreement deserves our commendation.Botswana  a country whose respect for human rights issecond to none  supports fully the creation of a post ofcommissioner of human rights. We have no human rightsabuses to hide  nor do we fear criticism - constructivecriticism  that is - should the international community findsome aspect of our domestic policy or policies to beincompatible with the enjoyment of human rights by ourcitizens. This is not an invitation to interference in ourinternal affairs. We have always maintained that no nationhas the right to violate the basic human rights of its citizenswhile using Article 2 (7) of the Charter as an argumentagainst intervention by the international community.Recent reports have revealed that the United Nations isspending roughly three times as much on peace-keeping andpeacemaking as on development assistance. Problems ofdevelopment  as should be clear to everybody  constitute theunderlying cause of world conflicts  and for the UnitedNations to be effective in the maintenance of internationalpeace  more energy and resources have to be expended ondevelopment activities.Of particular concern are the downward trend inAfrica’s commodity prices  the debt burden and theshrinking aid flow. In addition  many African countries including my own  have had to cope with the serious effectsof drought and famine. The civil strife which many Africancountries have had to cope with have also had a cripplingeffect on economic activity through damage to infrastructure.In order for an effective process of development to getunder way in Africa the international community needs toestablish a more open trading system giving access to  andadequate compensation for  commodities produced in Africa.For the past several years the market share for African goodshas experienced a dramatic decline. Botswana appeals fora speedy conclusion of the current Uruguay Round ofmultilateral trade negotiations  which we believe willstrengthen Africa’s trading capacity and allow unrestrictedaccess of our commodities to the world markets.The debt burden continues to be a major obstacle toAfrican economic growth and development. Clearly necessary measures have not been taken to attend to thiscompounding problem. The time has come for the donorForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 17community and the multilateral financial institutions to heedAfrica’s call to reduce or totally cancel the debt stock.We live in exciting times  exciting in both positive andnegative ways. We have been fortunate to wake up from thelong nightmare of the cold war and bear witness to the birthof a new world  however imperfect. The birth of any newepoch has never been easy or free of pain. The membershipof the Organization has multiplied with the rapid emergenceof new nations  whose aspirations for self-determination hadfor so long been frustrated.The import of this most welcome development is  ofcourse  not simply that we are close to universality but  also that the problems facing the Organization have multiplied.Thankfully  our rejuvenated United Nations seems to haveborne this increased load of responsibilities with a great dealof enthusiasm. Botswana renews its faith in this rejuvenatedUnited Nations and in its time-tested Charter."
"28",1160,"CAF",48,1993,"The direction that international relations havetaken today  although to some extent decided upon by States reflects  none the less  the limited ability of States to bringthe condition of the world into line with the newinternational social realities. If the problems that face theinternational community because of this international socialdynamic are to be resolved they must be tackled throughcollective  concerted and appropriate action that goes beyondthe national framework. My country is happy that there isamong States a growing awareness of these needs. Wewelcome this new direction as the forty-eighth session of theGeneral Assembly begins.But before stating my delegation’s views about how toencourage States to share this new approach - and as wework in this direction we shall be calling on you  Sir  todemonstrate your great qualities - we should like to extendto you the warm congratulations of the Central AfricanRepublic on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly. We pledge to you our full cooperation  andexpress the hope that your work will be crowned withsuccess.The wisdom and spirit of compromise with which yourpredecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  conducted the proceedingsat the last session earned the full appreciation of mydelegation.The renewed authority of our Organization is due  ofcourse  to the determination of Member States but also to theconviction and methodical  rational and pragmatic action ofthe Secretary-General  who has always  and in allcircumstances  endeavoured to work for the purposes andprinciples of the Organization. ToMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali we pledge the renewed supportof the Central African Republic.My delegation also welcomes the admission to ourOrganization of the Czech Republic  the Slovak Republic Eritrea  the Principality of Monaco  the Principality ofAndorra and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.Their admission fulfils the oft-expressed desire of theinternational community to see all the countries of the worldas Members of our Organization and thus strengthen itsuniversal character. All States  individually and collectively must come together to defend the purposes and principles ofthe United Nations. It is unacceptable for some States stillto be excluded.For this reason  in the view of the delegation of theCentral African Republic  today it is important that the placeof the Republic of China in our Organization bereconsidered. The immense progress made by the Republicof China in Taiwan in the political  economic and socialspheres has now earned it the right to resume its place hereso that it can contribute  better than it did in the past  to theflourishing of international cooperation through its activeparticipation in the United Nations system.The developments in the international arena we arewitnessing today arise from the process of transformationthat the world has undergone  especially in the last fewyears. These transformations affect all areas of internationallife  and  fortunately  States are taking them into account asthey manage their international relations  which  to a largeextent  determine the direction our world takes. There isalso an emerging tendency for problems to have world-wideeffects  prompting States to become the guardians of worldinterests. This phenomenon is clearly illustrated incooperation and concerted action among States in the spiritsuggested by our Secretary-General in ""An Agenda forPeace"" in efforts to contribute to laying the foundation forreal peace in the world. Indeed  notwithstanding certainreflexive and automatic responses the relics of the cold-warconditions  States today are increasingly determined to dowhat they can  on the foundation of the principles of theUnited Nations and in cooperation with the United Nations in order  if not to eliminate  at least try  to reduce prevailingtensions in other areas of the world.My delegation is happy that this approach has nowmade it possible for the situation to evolve as it has inCambodia  South Africa - where the Central AfricanRepublic supports the appeal by the President of the AfricanNational Congress (ANC)  Mr. Nelson Mandela  to liftsanctions against South Africa - and  finally  in the MiddleEast  in respect of which my country pays a hearty tribute toMr. Yasser Arafat and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin for their courage vision and lucidity in signing recently the historic accord onmutual recognition. This same desire for cooperation isneeded in order to bring about a positive and speedysettlement of the problems of the former Yugoslavia Western Sahara  Angola and Somalia.The international gatherings recently held in Vienna andGeneva  while making it possible to take the measure of thesad reality of human-rights violations throughout the world provided at the same time an opportunity for States toreaffirm the need for concerted international action with aview to guaranteeing more securely these values. Inaddition  since the Rio Conference  States have showngreater interest in the question of the environment  and theyhave now made Agenda 21 a real platform for cooperationin this area  which will make it easier to ensure better16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionprotection of the common heritage of mankind whilemaintaining conditions for sustainable development.This tendency for problems to have world-wide effects if systematically managed  would usher in a new era  that ofthe triumph of multilateralism  an era in which the UnitedNations would bring its authority to bear - as it is trying with varying degrees of success  to do today in certainpeace-keeping operations - in other areas of cooperation such as cooperation for development. Inadequacies in thearea of cooperation are in sharp contrast to the declareddetermination of States to contribute to maintaining balancein the world in the post-cold-war period. It is  then desirable that real solidarity be cultivated among MemberStates  which might induce developed countries to supportefforts for development in developing countries  in particularin Africa.The economic condition of these countries is constantlydeteriorating from year to year  and they have often comebefore this and other bodies to bring their problems to theattention of the international community  whose responsehas  unfortunately  not removed any of the obstacles to thosecountries’ development. Those obstacles are  in short  thecontinuing decline of prices of commodities  the heavy debtburden and debt-servicing  negative net financial flows andstrengthened protectionism. If these factors persist  there isno doubt that the African countries will have increasingdifficulty in overcoming their situation. But these countriesmust not be excluded from development  and everythingmust be done to encourage their efforts at development.The duty of solidarity calls for dialogue and cooperationbetween the developed countries and the developingcountries in order to ensure fairer remuneration forcommodities and an easing of the debt burden and debt-servicing. Coordinating efforts at the level of the UnitedNations system  among international economic and financialinstitutions and organizations and amongnon-governmental organizations is required to improve thesituation of the developing countries.Such activity would be in keeping with the new spiritthat characterizes international relations today and that hasmade it possible for some developed countries to support thedemocratization process that has begun in some of ourcountries  including my own. I should like  in this regard to express our deep gratitude to all the countries andinstitutions that have so kindly provided us with material andfinancial support and sent international observers to help thecause of democracy in the Central African Republic. Wehope we shall continue to enjoy their concerned assistancein our endeavour to lay the foundation of our youngdemocracy  and  from this rostrum  I wish to appeal forunderstanding.My delegation believes that the time has come to bringabout genuine democratization in the decision-making bodiesof the United Nations  the Security Council in particular  themembership of which must be adapted to the new realitiesof the world.The great developments in science and technology havetoday reduced our world to a global village where each andevery one of us must feel directly affected by all theproblems that exist on the various levels of international life.The trend towards the globalization of problems that hasbecome evident as a result of this ought to be maintained sothat States can take up the challenge of defending peace bypromoting the development of human rights.Forty-eighth session - 8 October l993 17For the Central African Republic  this challenge can besuccessfully taken up if we fully respect the principles of theUnited Nations."
"29",1206,"CAN",48,1993,"It has been anextraordinary year since the General Assembly met last year.We have seen breakthroughs in two areas - South Africa andthe Middle East - which have bedevilled the internationalcommunity for decades. Bringing both to a successfulconclusion will be hard  but we have good reasons foroptimism. Canada applauds the courage and foresight of theparties involved  and pledges that it will continue to do itspart in promoting further advances.But  at the same time  we have also seen tragedies - inSomalia  Bosnia  Angola and elsewhere - which have  thusfar  defied our best efforts to bring peace.It is against this background  of hope renewed andhopes dashed  that I wish to speak about the United Nationscentral vocation: the defence and promotion of peace andsecurity and the conditions in which they can thrive. It is aCanadian vocation as well.Since United Nations peace-keeping was invented in1956 by Lester Pearson  we have been there; sweating it outin the field  taking casualties  doing the tough work forpeace  in partnership with a growing number of otherMember States. Since 1956  Canada has fielded almost100 000 men and women in United Nations operations inevery corner of the world. That contribution has been acostly one for us  not least in lives lost. None the less  it isa contribution which has been a symbol of pride to mostCanadians  a tangible expression of our national quest for abetter world.Canadians speak from experience born of commitment.We see the changes which must be made and the principleswhich must remain immutable. The world is hungry formultilateral solutions to conflict and war. This is our time the United Nations moment. We are living through decisivepolitical change. Cold war certainties have given way  butin their place we have unpredictability and instability - apolitical unease about our future  uncertainty about wherecollective endeavours can take us. Most countries feel moresecure militarily  but our citizens  in their personal lives often feel less secure about their well-being  for themselvesand for generations to come.But this broader perspective must not obscure the veryreal military dangers which remain: excessive accumulationsof conventional arms; the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction - chemical  biological and nuclear; and conflictand human misery created by the breakdown of civil andpolitical society within States and across fragile and oftennew borders.The world has learned some hard lessons in recentyears. First  we have learned that our security isinterdependent. Within each specific area of concern -whether military  economic  environment or health - nonation can stand alone. We are all affected  positively andnegatively  by developments beyond our borders. And ourown actions  within our own countries  inevitably resonatethroughout the wider community of nations.6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionSecondly  we have learned that our security isindivisible. We cannot escape the connections linkingissues; between  for example  economic growth environmental safety and population flows. Deterioration inany one area can destabilize the whole. We must thinkabout security more broadly  in terms which addressfundamental sources of insecurity: questions of economicdevelopment and prosperity; environmental integrity;freedom from crime and physical threat; health; membershipin communities which reflect our values  traditions andaspirations.Thirdly  we have learned that genuine security is notabout control and repression. It is about striking the rightbalance of interests  within countries and across borders.Fourthly  we have learned that we have to find morecooperative ways of addressing security issues  ways whichmaximize the relative strengths of many existing institutions.We foresee a network of collaborative arrangements - local regional and global - forming the building-blocks of a newsystem of collective security  all hinged on the focal point ofthe United Nations.The Charter of the United Nations itself provides usefulguidance  describing possible relationships between theUnited Nations and regional bodies in the pacific settlementof local disputes. Cooperation between the United Nations the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization and the EuropeanCommunity in Europe; between the United Nations  theCommonwealth and the Organization of African Unity inAfrica; and between the United Nations and the Organizationof American States in Central America and Haiti has movedus considerably along the path anticipated by the drafters ofthe Charter. Moreover  regional organizations are often thebest equipped to deal with local sources of instability andpotential conflict  such as water disputes  demographic shiftsor human rights concerns.For decades  the cold war hemmed us in. That time isover. We have it within our grasp to fulfil the promise ofour Charter  to build a global cooperative security systemcentred on the United Nations. For it is the United Nationsalone which can provide a universal forum for elaboratingnew principles and negotiating new rules and standards.And it is the United Nations alone which  as a universalbody  can bring the full weight of the internationalcommunity to bear on specific critical issues.In the last five years alone  the involvement of theUnited Nations in various multilateral military efforts hasgrown exponentially. Five years ago there were seven suchoperations; today there are 16. Five years ago there were9 000 military personnel deployed with the United Nations;today there are nearly 80 000  more than Canada has in allof its regular armed forces. And as we look around theworld today  the prospect of even more operations has to beseen as inevitable.The transformation in United Nations operations has notbeen simply quantitative of late. The fact is that the UnitedNations is now engaged in a range of activities which goeswell beyond the traditional concepts of peace-keeping wehave been accustomed to in the past. Much of theSecretary-General’s ground-breaking ""An Agenda for Peace""has moved from prescription to reality  and rightly so. It isquite right to ask whether and under what conditions theUnited Nations should commit its resources to the resolutionof international crises. It is equally right to ask whether theUnited Nations has the right tools to do what is asked of it.(spoke in French)The rapid expansion of United Nations operations in thepast several years has been both unprecedented andinstructive. In the process we have all learned certainlessons  some in a very wrenching fashion. We would all dowell to take stock of our recent experience and determinehow we can together improve our capacity to act moreeffectively.Having been an active participant in virtually everyUnited Nations military operation  Canada has made its owndiagnosis and come to its own conclusions as to someremedies that should be pursued.(spoke in English)To begin with  we must improve our collective capacityto judge  to determine accurately and dispassionately thenature of impending threats and the facts of specific cases.We must also improve our capacity to act  to respond firmlyand effectively to events before they deteriorate into crises.There are steps we can take now to improve ourcollective capacity in the field of preventive diplomacy.Recent initiatives to strengthen our early-warning systemshould be implemented. To do that  the Secretary-Generalshould be given the resources necessary for independentpolitical analysis  analysis that he could draw on beforearmed conflict is unleashed and when non-militaryintervention can still be effective. Not only must warningsbe timely; they must also have an impact on decisions. TheForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 7Secretary-General must make full use of the provisions ofArticle 99 of the Charter to bring to the attention of theSecurity Council situations which may threaten peace. Thiswould itself provide a powerful stimulus to global attentionand necessary preventive action.The United Nations ability to conduct preventivediplomacy through the good offices of the Secretary-Generalmust be strengthened. The Secretary-General’s efforts toaddress dozens of conflicts and potential conflicts requiretangible support. The preventive deployment of peace-keepers to forestall conflict  as we have recently done in theFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  can prove veryuseful and in the long run avoid a much larger commitmentof scarce resources.Experience with the assignment of United Nationsmilitary forces around the world has  in our view demonstrated a number of shortcomings. It is incumbent onus all to move quickly to respond to them by changing theway that business is conducted. First  major operations canno longer be run on an ad hoc basis. The management planning and operational capacity of the United Nations hasto be reinforced. A permanent strategic headquarters staffcapable of controlling two or more large-scale multidimensional operations has to be put in place. To beeffective  this headquarters would need a comprehensiveinformation processing and planning capacity.Secondly  the United Nations ability to bring matérieland personnel speedily to a theatre of operations and toensure coordination between sources of equipment andpersonnel has to be strengthened. Too often in the past  theSecretary-General has had to delay UnitedNations-sanctioned operations for want of adequate personnelor matériel.The ability to deploy United Nations troops rapidly toemerging flashpoints has to be upgraded substantially. At aminimum  Member States should enter into formalcommitments with the Secretary-General to provide troopson a stand-by basis and tied to readiness standards  asCanada has done in the past year.Thirdly  United Nations Members have to build anddevelop the large cadre of peace-keepers necessary for theUnited Nations missions of the future. Peace-keepingdemands cultural sensitivity  the ability to mediate and a hostof other skills. Training will be required  particularly of acorps of senior officers who will have to exercise leadershipin complex  difficult and dangerous situations. Trainingholds the key to successfully integrating different nationalcontingents into one operation.Fourthly  we need to ensure that field operations meethigh performance standards. Work on the development ofa common code of conduct and operating procedures for allpersonnel serving under the United Nations flag should bebrought to an early conclusion.Fifthly  we must also come to grips with theincreasingly serious dangers facing our peace-keepers. Weand others are working to clarify and codify principles andmeasures for the protection of United Nations personnel particularly those involved in peace-keeping operations.Canada will be proposing specific provisions for such aconvention to be discussed during the coming GeneralAssembly session.In the last several years  a range of innovative proposalshas been put forward with a view to enhancing the capacityof the United Nations to mount effective multilateral militaryoperations. Many of these suggestions have been the subjectof extensive debate in Canada  as they have in many othercountries. We have  in fact  been proponents of some ofthese suggestions. We fully recognize  of course  that oursis but one perspective. Actually realizing these necessitatesa much broader level of support by United Nations MemberStates.Accordingly  in the best interests of future UnitedNations efforts  it is time that a panel of civilian and militaryexperts with experience in United Nations operations becharged with assessing these and other proposals whichcould further enhance the operational capacity of the UnitedNations. Such a report should be finalized and submitted tothe Secretary-General next summer. It should include clearrecommendations on both the merits of the proposals and  asimportantly  how they could be implemented and financed.The report would in turn would provide us with the basis forcoming to collective decisions on whether or not to proceedwith any of these. Only in this way can we moredefinitively determine not only the potential need but therequisite support for these proposals.The agenda for such a review would include: theestablishment of a permanent United Nations staff collegefor the training of military officers; the creation of moretraining facilities for United Nations troops; the developmentof a network of United Nations material supply depotsstockpiled with equipment for rapid dispatch to new UnitedNations operations; the question whether United NationsMember States would provide at nominal  if any  cost8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionequipment and matériel which would be made available toUnited Nations contingents not having such resources intheir own military establishments; and the creation of apermanent rapid deployment force under United Nationscommand  based possibly on a new United Nations volunteerforce.There may well be other issues that should be on thatagenda. The key  however  is to have that assessment made.My own Government is committed to reviewing these andother related questions in the context of a reappraisal of ourown military capacity  including our participation in UnitedNations operations.Security is more than simply a matter of being able todeploy adequate numbers of troops on a timely basis.Modern United Nations missions are drawing on expertisefar beyond that of traditional military peace-keepers. Thereis a demand for civilian police  for election workers  forhuman rights monitors  for engineers  administrators andother specialists to rebuild infrastructure. It is not enough tostop hostilities; the United Nations is now expected to buildthe peace as well.We are moving from a tradition of interposing peace-keepers between hostile forces to new forms of engagement.Rebuilding societies to stand on their own will be a complexand lengthy process. Diplomatic peacemaking  military andcivilian peace-keeping and peace-building pose new sorts ofchallenges. It has become obvious  in our view  that a moreintegrated and coordinated approach by the United Nationsis now mandatory if we are to cope successfully with manyof the crises which draw United Nations military forces. Wehave had a measure of success in this regard in Cambodia but far less in other situations  such as Somalia. UnitedNations military operations cannot in and of themselvesaddress or resolve the root causes of conflict. That issomething that can be achieved only through a much morebroadly based effort  be it political  economic or social. Ineffect  we need a capacity to rebuild  over time  countries orsocieties which have suffered structural collapse.An effective system of cooperative security  led by areinvigorated United Nations  will cost money; but then genuine security always carries a price which is worthpaying. Resources are limited  and we must all share theburden. This means paying United Nations bills in full andon time. That is what Canada does  and we expect others todo the same. It is difficult to overstate the damage thatnon-payment and the build-up of arrears does to the UnitedNations system  and to our collective capacity for effectiveaction.Burden-sharing means taking part in the activities of theUnited Nations  from contributing troops for peace-keepingmissions to providing observers for election monitoring.Today  Canada is providing just under 4 per cent of allUnited Nations forces. Little less than one year ago Canadian troops accounted for 10 per cent of all UnitedNations forces. Those are rather remarkable figures whenwe consider that Canada accounts for less than one half of1 per cent of the world’s population  and that our militaryestablishment represents less than 1 per cent of globalmilitary expenditures. This is not to suggest that we areseeking a diminished role  one more commensurate with ourrelative status in the world. It is  instead  to questionwhether others are doing their fair share.Burden-sharing also means sharing politicalresponsibility for shaping and taking decisions  and forensuring that decisions and commitments are fulfilled. Thatis why we welcome the Security Council’s increasingattention to drafting clear mandates  sharply definingobjectives and setting deadlines. Clear and realisticmandates are necessary if the United Nations is to remainboth credible and effective.In Canada as in a number of other countries governments are facing difficult fiscal circumstances andpublics that are demanding more effective  efficient andeconomical service from government. The need forrationalization of government  for streamlining  and for anend to overlap  duplication and waste is one that my ownGovernment has addressed in the last several months. Ourefforts in that respect will continue. We have aresponsibility to our own taxpayers to ensure that the samestandards and objectives are applied to the internationalinstitutions of which we are members.Institutions of the United Nations cannot remainimmune to the challenges  financial as well as political  ofthe late twentieth century. They too must help shoulder theburden by becoming leaner  more efficient  better focused more responsible and more responsive. They must adapt just as Member States are doing  to new technologies  tocontinuing fiscal restraint  to the challenge to do better withless. The structures here are not sacrosanct. No position expenditure or institution should be free of the scrutinyunder which we in Canada  and others elsewhere  haveplaced our own State structures.We applaud the reforms initiated by the Secretary-General and we pledge our support for further action. Weurge him to press on  and we urge all Member States toForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 9support his efforts. Our security  the security of generationsto come  is in the balance.We have a great deal to do. All of our efforts toreform the peacemaking and peace-keeping function of theUnited Nations will be in vain if we are not able to come toterms collectively with what must be regarded as the mostdangerous current threat to international security: theubiquitous spread of weapons of mass destruction. In toomany areas of the world  the prospect of conflict involvingnuclear weapons risks destabilizing already tense situations and could lead to human disasters of unimaginableproportions. We must muster the collective resolve to putteeth into the Non-Proliferation Treaty  disciplining harshlythose who violate its provisions and giving confidence tothose who abide by its undertakings. We wholeheartedlywelcome the priority attached to this issue by PresidentClinton  and the practical measures he proposed.Our own priorities are clear: further progress in nucleararms reduction; indefinite extension and universal adherenceto the Non-Proliferation Treaty; negotiation of acomprehensive test-ban treaty; early progress to bring thechemical weapons Convention into force; and strengtheningof the United Nations Conventional Arms Register. Thesedirect investments in peace and security must beaccompanied by collective action on the root causes ofinsecurity.We must develop and consolidate democraticinstitutions and the rule of law. Modern history teaches usthat democracies are the least likely States to wage war  thebest guarantors of peace. The impartial rule of lawdomestically is the surest way of keeping democraciesdemocratic; internationally  it is the best way to resolvedisputes before they become crises.We must protect and promote human rights. Securitybegins at the level of the individual  and there can be neitherpeace nor security while people  singly or collectively minorities or majorities  are unable to uphold their dignityand exercise their inherent rights. The General Assemblymust build on the progress achieved at the ViennaConference earlier this year and agree to establish by the endof this year the post of United Nations high commissionerfor Human Rights.We must attack the poverty  deprivation and economicunderdevelopment which so often lie at the heart ofinstability and insecurity. The Secretary-General shoulddraw up an agenda for development. It should incorporatea bold rethinking of how the United Nations can best play itsimportant role in the economic and social spheres  whileavoiding the duplication of activities best carried forwardelsewhere. The Agenda could help redefine the role of theUnited Nations in promoting sustainable development inclose cooperation with other international economic andfinancial institutions. We owe no less to the children of theworld as we celebrate the third anniversary of the Summitfor Children.(spoke in French)To be lasting  economic growth has to respect theenvironment. Hence  we have to follow through on ourcollective commitments at last year’s Rio Summit to protectthe environment. The social and economic costs of notdoing so are simply unacceptable  a fact that is all too realfor the thousands of Canadians dependent on the Atlanticfishery.(spoke in English)The brutal collapse of the fishery in the North-West Atlanticand elsewhere is compelling evidence of the need to addressthat crisis urgently. The United Nations must urgently adopta legally binding international regime to conserve andmanage high-seas fish stocks.It is clear  however  that no amount of developmentassistance can match the economic growth that could beachieved through a freer flow of goods  services  capital andideas among our Member States. Indeed  the single mostimportant step we can take collectively towards improvingthe prosperity of developing and developed economies alikewould be to reach  without any further delay  a substantialoutcome to the Uruguay Round of multilateral tradenegotiations. These discussions have reached a pivotalstage; we must not lose this precious opportunity. MyGovernment remains committed to doing its part to reachthat goal and to pursuing other opportunities for tradeliberalization  such as through the North American FreeTrade Agreement. We are convinced that the Agreementwill make the North American economies both morecompetitive and more open and will provide a much neededstimulus to global trade and investment.Our peace and security are not there for the taking. Wemust work for them  and work hard - in our own countries in our regions  and globally. We must renew and revitalizeexisting structures and  where necessary  build anew. Wehave a historic opportunity to make good on the language ofthe United Nations Charter  on the thwarted promise of thoseearly days  to build in our own time a cooperative system of10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionpeace and security which respects difference but holds fastto universal principles of human dignity and freedom. Letus move forward  together  now."
"30",1267,"CHL",48,1993,"I am particularly pleased to congratulateAmbassador Insanally on his election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly  which does honour to the Group ofLatin American and Caribbean States. We know that he haslong-standing close personal ties to Chile.It has been our lot to witness and to be a part of eventsof far-reaching significance in the history of mankind. Thepolitical  technological  economic and social changes thathave shaken the world over the past 10 years are beginningto take root  and as they do so the enormous influence theyhave had on the establishment of new forms of behaviour new values and new institutional schemes is becomingapparent.The maintenance of democracy as the single paradigmhas brought with it beneficial influences  although for somethe establishment of this system of coexistence has givenrise to upheavals which are not yet over. But we can afforda measure of realistic optimism if we fix our attention onother developments. The beginnings of an agreementbetween Palestinians and Israelis are a tangible example ofthis. Another is the awakening of South Africa to truedemocracy. The spirit of consensus that is beginning tospread throughout the world is a consequence of thedemocratic paradigm. Against this new backdrop  theUnited Nations has a vital role to play.At this juncture  then  there are grounds for optimism and we have a duty to be optimistic. For only in beingoptimistic will we be able to overcome the reluctance ofsome and the temptation of others to take refuge infundamentalism. It is also imperative for us to take a firmstand against a kind of rigidity of approach which is gainingground in the world. This is the tendency to treat systemsas if they were incontrovertible truths. It is the transfer ofdogma to sciences that are not at all exact. And this ishappening at a time when advances in human knowledge aredemonstrating precisely that what is vital today is to openour minds to reason and to distance ourselves as far aspossible from dogmatism.We are living in a world which has ceased to beforeign. No human reality is alien to us. No suffering isremote. No triumph of intelligence is a private matter. Butglobalization does not mean uniformity. What is more without respect for differences  it would cease to have thevigour it exhibits today. Its competitiveness would be lost and the concept of one world would inevitably find itself onits deathbed.This is the world in which we have to live and move a world plagued by disturbing yet  paradoxically  stimulatingcontradictions. It is in such a world that we must strive toseize the opportunity to take positive initiatives  withoutprejudices  and come closer to the innermost reality of man.This is why we are now striving to make progress in thedefence of universal humanitarian law. This concept isinherent in the new vision of the world  and Chile comesforward as its most resolute proponent. It is this conceptwhich has led the ""Blue Helmets"" in the past three years totake on as many missions as they conducted between the endof the Second World War and the beginning of the 1990s.The United Nations troops serve the invaluable objective ofpeacemaking and rebuilding coexistence  a task which wemust perform if we are to meet adequately the need to strikethe proper balance between local sensitivity and globalsensitivity.The number of problems that are worldwide in scopehas greatly increased. Whether through rigidity in theapplication of the system or through shortcomings in thesystem itself  we are witnessing some tragic consequences.Millions of human beings are suffering from poverty. Noris the tragedy confined to the poor nations. We arewitnessing a worldwide social crisis. It has left its mark onthe developed countries as well. Social marginalization is areality which has taken on truly disturbing dimensionshitherto unknown in those latitudes.Chile’s present Government has always viewedeconomic development as inseparable from socialdevelopment. We see the economy not as an end in itself but as a means by which humanity can attain happiness.This is our objective  and this is what has led PresidentPatricio Aylwin to assign the priority to dealing with whatwe have termed the social debt. This term encompasses therecognition that society as a whole must accord to the poor.This idea has gained ground. As a result  the Chileaninitiative regarding the convening of a world summit forsocial development has been positively received. Themeeting  to be held at Copenhagen in 1995  will be atangible demonstration of this concern on the part of theUnited Nations.My country is confident that we will make every effortnecessary to ensure that the Copenhagen meeting arrives atappropriate and specific solutions. The environment isfavourable  which makes us feel that we shall be able toconclude the summit with an ""agenda or programme forpeople""  one essential element of which must be broader more effective and more united international cooperation.Today’s world poses questions which must be answeredwithout delay. Poverty  hunger and other social scourges areperceived as aberrations. Their eradication is the task of the38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioninternational community as a whole. In this task  the UnitedNations will play a decisive role. It has the capacity to takethe leadership  which means channelling internationalcooperation.Furthermore  we recognize that the United Nations hasa fundamental role to play in dealing with the relevantissues.In the specific field of international peace and security my country has repeatedly stressed its support for the actiontaken by the Secretary-General  and Chile advocates thestrengthening of his role  particularly with respect topreventive diplomacy. We hail his report ""An Agenda forPeace"" as a valuable and significant aid to Governments.We look forward with interest to the forthcoming publicationof an agenda for development  which we intend to considerwith the greatest enthusiasm.In the same spirit of cooperation  we have conveyed tothe Secretary-General suggestions regarding the benefits thatmight derive from an increase in the number of members ofthe Security Council. Because of the great importance ofthat body  any change that is proposed should reflect thevery clear political will of the majority. I want to put greatemphasis on this point. We view the changes in the SecurityCouncil as part of a wide-ranging exercise aimed atstrengthening the United Nations. No reform can be viableif its sole aim is to grant some degree of politicalrecognition to certain emerging Powers. The aim of ourproposal is that appropriate account be taken of the newinternational reality. At the same time  it seeks to reflect theincrease in the membership of the Organization since the lasttime the Council was enlarged.In our suggestions to the Secretary-General  we indicatethe need for the reform to result in a limited membership.This will enable us to ensure efficiency and to achieve ourobjectives of democratization. In this context  we feel thatit is important that the various regions of the world be dulyrepresented. This will enable us to combine the idea ofdemocratization with the balance that is essential.Regarding the right of veto  we agree with manynations that this is not a democratic means ofdecision-making. For this reason we wish to make it clearthat we are opposed to its being extended to new permanentmembers of the Council. In line with these ideas  Chile hasraised the possibility of the Council’s comprising permanentmembers  permanent members without the right of veto regional members with an extended term  and non-permanentmembers.Still in the context of the protection of democracy  wecannot fail to mention that at the regional level too newcircumstances have led to changes in the instrumentsavailable to the Organization of American States (OAS).Clear evidence of this is the Santiago ""Commitment todemocracy and the renewal of the inter-American system""approved at the General Assembly of the OAS held in thecapital of Chile in 1991. This new approach has alreadyyielded results. The OAS has achieved successes that wouldpreviously have been impossible in the region - particularlyin the field of the protection of democracy and human rights.Of concern to us  together with steps in these twosensitive areas  is decisive action for the protection of nature.Currently  Chile holds the chairmanship of the environmentcommission established within the organization.In addition  my country has joined in the effort tocombat drug trafficking. Accordingly  we support variousinitiatives aimed at drafting new legal instruments to combatthis scourge effectively.Likewise - returning to the world scene - we attachspecial importance to the process of restructuring in theeconomic and social sector. This will raise the possibility ofsaving millions of human beings who are currentlymarginalized  living in minimal security conditions. In ourview  cooperation for development should become one of themost solid pillars of the international agenda for the twenty-first century. We shall continue to put forward ideas and tosupport initiatives  in the Group of 77 and any other body that will serve to advance the negotiations.President Aylwin’s Government has striven to makeinternational cooperation a reality. We have participated invarious activities within the programme of technicalcooperation between developing countries. Currently  wehave projects in 43 countries  and 70 institutions from thepublic and private sectors are participating in them.There is an active current of cooperation with ourneighbours in Central America  the Caribbean and SouthAmerica. Also under way are projects that link us withMexico. Similarly  we have programmes with the People’sRepublic of China  India  Indonesia and the Philippines.Recently  contacts have been established with Africancountries and with South Pacific island territories. All ofthis forms part of a deliberate policy aimed at strengtheninglinks with the Latin American and Caribbean nations and atestablishing close ties with all developing countries.Forty-eighth session - 27 September l993 39An outstanding feature of the major changes takingplace throughout the world is the important role beingassumed by the Pacific basin in political  economic andstrategic terms. Chile is a coastal State of that ocean  andour identification with the basin is one of the mostinnovative elements in the foreign policy being pursued byPresident Aylwin. We have made a sustained effort toassociate ourselves with the main agreements on cooperationin the Pacific region. Since 1990  Chilean business has beenparticipating actively in the Pacific Basin Economic Council and since 1991 Chile has been a full member of the PacificEconomic Cooperation Council. We hope also to join theAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council  as we view thisas an important means of promoting the liberalization ofregional and world-wide trade. In this effort we havereceived valuable support from the States members of theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations  and for this we aregrateful.In another context  I cannot fail to take this opportunityto mention an issue that is of special significance to thedeveloping world. I refer to the Uruguay Round of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Therenewal of these negotiations provides some grounds forhope. The so-called Dunkel text is very far from meetingour legitimate aspirations  although it does constitute a majoradvance in the current situation. Unfortunately  nonetheless it embodies a number of limitations on genuine freedom oftrade.The most difficult issue in the Uruguay Round has beentrade in agricultural products  which  for the nations of LatinAmerica -for developing countries in general - is of vitalimportance. Hence our lively interest in what is happeningin GATT. Insistence on intransigent positions  whichobjectively impede world trade  creates insurmountablebarriers to development - a situation to which we cannotremain indifferent.Chile has fully discharged its commitment to thecollective security system. We regard this United Nationsinitiative as highly appropriate in the current internationalsituation. My country has participated in a number ofpeace-keeping operations. It has sent military observers tothe Middle East and to the frontier between India andPakistan; police officers to El Salvador; air force personnelto Kuwait; and army personnel to Cambodia.In discussing this issue  we cannot overlook thefinancing difficulties that peace-keeping operations arefacing. We support the steps being taken by theSecretary-General of the United Nations to overcome theseproblems.Unquestionably  however  in our view  any discussionof peace is incomplete if it does not refer to the progressmade in relation to disarmament. The Convention onchemical weapons is a significant achievement. We trustthat the work initiated with a view to the signing of acomprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty will follow the samecourse.At this forty-eighth session of the General Assembly  Iwish briefly to evaluate the results Chile has achieved insome of the areas to which it attaches priority in therestoration of democracy.Let me refer first to our reintegration into theinternational community. In the multilateral sphere  we canpoint to the generous support of our peers  which hasenabled us to become members of the Economic and SocialCouncil  the Commission on Human Rights  the InternationalLaw Commission and the Executive Council of the Food andAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  andto the election of our Ambassador to the United Nations Juan Somavia  as President of the Economic and SocialCouncil and Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of theWorld Summit for Social Development.In keeping with its mandate  President Aylwin’sGovernment sees human rights as another of the objectivestowards which its actions are directed  both domestically andin foreign policy. The latter aspect reflects a traditionalposition of our country: that of encouraging respect forinternational law and promoting peace and justice. At thesame time  however  it is the least we can do by way ofreciprocating the enormous solidarity the internationalcommunity has extended to the Chilean people at the mostdifficult moment in its history.It will be the task of the General Assembly at thissession to begin the implementation of the agreementscontained in the Plan of Action adopted at the second WorldConference on Human Rights  held in Vienna at thebeginning of this year.Along with its re-emergence on the international sceneand its protection of human rights and democracy  Chile hasset itself the goal of working for effective regionalintegration.Here  too  we can point to major achievements. Ourrelations with our Latin American and Caribbean brothers40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioncould not be better. Agreements that have already beensigned and various others that are in the drafting stage -some 220 agreements and treaties in four years - bearwitness to this fact.To that same end  we have worked for thestrengthening of the Rio Group; we currently have thehonour to be coordinating its temporary secretariat. Thatinstitution is the embodiment of a modern approach tointernational relations. It embodies the will of the region inits relations with individual countries or groups of countriesoutside the region. This forum for political consensusalready has significant achievements to its credit on variouslevels. Moreover  it is a clear demonstration of what we canaspire to if we manifest imagination  political openness andrealism.Special mention needs to be made of the understandingwe have reached with our neighbours. The understanding generosity and vision of the future exhibited by the Heads ofState of Argentina  Bolivia  Peru and Chile have allowed usto settle issues which in some cases had been dragging onfor more than a century. While respecting our respectivetraditions and abiding by the inviolable principles ofinternational law  including non-intervention and the sanctityof treaties as the source of rights  we have neverthelessunderstood that  as the twenty-first century approaches  itwill be useful to exchange ideas about our nationalaspirations  inasmuch as they promote the maintenance ofpeace.It is a great honour for me to be addressing theforty-eighth session of the General Assembly. The fouryears I have represented Chile in this important forum whether accompanying President Aylwin or personally  havebeen an enriching experience.The period in which we have the good fortune to beliving demands increasingly dynamic and effectiveresponses. The world is moving towards a new structurewhich will undoubtedly afford us the possibility of movingever closer to satisfying the needs of human beings. Butwhether we can make this a reality will depend on theintelligence with which we confront the future.I have every confidence in the rich sap that nourishesthis spreading tree  which shelters us all. The UnitedNations has before it a glorious future in working for thecause of peace. But that future will be possible only if wedemonstrate the imagination to be bold  the knowledge tomove ahead  the love to understand that to strive for thecommon good is always a viable option  the solidarity to bemore human and the wisdom not to repeat the mistakes ofthe past.Members of the Assembly  my good wishes go withyou."
"31",1313,"CHN",48,1993,"At the outset I should like warmly to congratulateyou  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the currentsession of the General Assembly. I am convinced that givenyour proven talent and extensive experience  and with thecooperation of all delegations  you will steer our session tofull success. I also wish to express my sincere thanks toyour predecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  for his remarkableaccomplishments during the last session. I would like totake this opportunity to extend a warm welcome andcongratulations to the new Members which have beenadmitted to the United Nations this year.The world has moved into a transitional period towardsmultipolarity since the disintegration of the bipolar structure.It had been hoped that the end of the cold war would bringpeace and prosperity to the world. Indeed  the prospects ofavoiding another world war and ensuring a lasting peacehave improved. However  contradictions that had laindormant during the cold war have begun to emerge  andmanifestations of hegemonism and power politics ininternational relations are on the rise. Peace and development  so ardently aspired to by mankind  still face gravechallenges.The relative stability Europe once enjoyed has beenupset. Many countries are plagued by severe economicslumps or by political upheaval. Some regions are torn byethnic or religious feuds exacerbated by territorial disputes leading to intermittent conflicts and armed clashes. Aregional war is raging at the southern end of the Eurasianland mass. All this can only have a negative impact onEurope and on the world at large.In the meantime  a number of developed countries havedeveloped a ""post-cold-war syndrome"". Some have sunkinto the longest recession since the Second World War. Inthe new setting  internal contradictions have sharpened political scandals are rife  racism has reared its ugly head trade protectionism is on the rise  and xenophobic violenceis spreading. Public disaffection has been manifest  and theentrenched political establishment has been shaken. Thistrend has adversely affected the stability of the countriesconcerned and complicated international relations.The new international environment has led to an evenmore dire plight for many developing countries. Increasingforeign intervention has heightened various internal factorsof instability  thus compounding their difficulties. Theirrights to independence  subsistence and development havebeen neither duly respected nor safeguarded. Therefore interference from the outside should cease  and theinternational community should give top priority to helpingthose countries achieve political stability and overcomeeconomic difficulties. Lasting world peace and stability willremain elusive if the developing countries are still beset bypersistent political unrest and if the North-South gapcontinues to widen.There is no denying the fact that peace anddevelopment remain the overriding issues of our time. Topreserve peace and accelerate development has become thepressing demand of the people of all countries  but especiallyof those in the developing countries.The world we live in is as diversified as ever. Thereare now more than 180 independent sovereign States  whichdiffer not only in social systems but also in stages ofdevelopment. Moreover  they have widely diverseideologies  cultural traditions  ethnic identities and religiousfaiths. We should recognize and respect those differencesand diversities  and treat each other as equal members of theinternational community. We should promote interchangesin the spirit of seeking common ground while setting asidedifferences. We should oppose any attempt to impose aparticular model on large numbers of countries  as diverse asthey are.We believe that there can be genuine peace international harmony and common development amongStates only when international relations strictly conform tothe purposes and principles of the United Nations Charterand are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistenceand other accepted norms of international conduct.Increased economic and cultural interchanges between Stateshave deepened their interdependence. It is absolutelynecessary that States open up to each other; enhanceexchanges  mutual understanding and cooperation; and sharethe benefit of complementarity. But all this will be possibleonly on the basis of mutual respect  equality and mutualbenefit.In order to attain the overall objective of peace anddevelopment  the Chinese Government has on manyoccasions called for the establishment of a new internationalpolitical and economic order of peace  stability  justice andrationality based on the Five Principles of PeacefulForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 19Coexistence and on the recognition of the diversity of theworld and of the differences among States. Under the neworder  mutual respect and cooperation between States on anequal footing will replace hegemonism and power politics;peace talks  dialogue and consultations will replace the useor threat of force; and equality  mutual benefit andaccommodation of each other’s needs will replace tradeprotectionism and unequal exchanges. The ChineseGovernment is ready to cooperate extensively with all othercountries and will continue to make unremitting efforts forthe establishment of such a new order  and for peace anddevelopment of the world.The report ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)submitted by the Secretary-General contains many important thought-provokinq recommendations and ideas that deservecareful consideration. We commend the Secretary-Generalfor his efforts therein. As a permanent member of theSecurity Council  China has always supported the positiveendeavours of the United Nations in preserving world peaceand stability  promoting global development and resolvinginternational disputes. We support the further enhancementand strengthening of the United Nations constructive role inpreventive diplomacy  in peacemaking and peace-keeping onthe basis of the purposes and principles of the Charter.As the frequency and scope of United Nationspeace-keeping operations is growing  we deem it importantand relevant to stress such basic principles of the Charter asrespect for the sovereignty of  and non-interference in  theinternal affairs of Member States. Those principles must bestrictly observed at all times when undertaking preventivediplomacy  peace-keeping operations or post-conflictpeace-building. Prior consent and pledges of cooperation bythe parties must be obtained  and strict impartiality shouldprevail in all peace-keeping missions. Only in this way canUnited Nations preventive diplomacy and peace-keepingoperations fulfil the underlying purposes of the Charter andachieve the desired positive result.The peaceful settlement of international disputes is animportant principle of the Charter  one which we deem to bethe essence of preventive diplomacy. Everything should bedone to bring the opposing parties to the negotiating tablebefore the outbreak of conflicts  so that they can startconsultations to achieve a peaceful settlement. All disputesbetween States  regional conflicts or even internal conflicts however complex they may be  should be amenable to apolitical solution  and nothing should be done to aggravatethe situation.Not long ago  the Palestine Liberation Organization andthe Government of Israel signed an agreement on mutualrecognition and on the question of self-government forPalestinians. Although just a beginning  the move was amajor breakthrough in the settlement of the Middle Eastquestion  which has dragged on for nearly half a century.This agreement was the result of efforts by the internationalcommunity and by both Palestine and Israel to settle aninternational dispute by peaceful means. We sincerelywelcome and wish to express our congratulations at thisdevelopment. We can see from this that as long as aglimmer of hope remains  one must not give up the pursuitof a peaceful settlement.Needless to say  one should adopt a very seriousattitude towards  and firmly oppose  any act of aggressionthat tramples on the sovereignty of another country  such aslarger States bullying smaller ones or the strong lording itover the weak in the international arena. We disapprove ofthe indiscriminate use of sanctions or force in the name ofthe United Nations. We also believe that humanitarianmissions must not be transformed into military operationsand that a war cannot be stopped byexpanding it.It must be noted that in a world troubled by recurrentregional conflicts and interwoven contradictions  the UnitedNations alone cannot hope to resolve all internationaldisputes. It has the duty to undertake this task andmaintain international peace and security. But regionalorganizations should also be taken into account andencouraged  as provided in Chapter VIII of the Charter  toassume greater responsibility and play a more active role inthis regard. In view of the proliferation of United Nationspeace-keeping operations and the concomitant demands onthe Organization and Member States in terms of manpower finance and material resources  we deem it essential that theUnited Nations act within the limits of its means andenhance the cost-effectiveness of such operations.Peace and development are inseparable. Economicdevelopment cannot get off the ground without theprerequisites of peace and stability. On the other hand unless there is sound economic development  there canhardly be secure or enduring peace and stability. Wemaintain that the United Nations should meet the demandsof the developing countries for social and economicadvancement and should give this very high priority. Thisis the way to make the United Nations an Organization thatall the countries of the world will support and count on.This is also the way to enhance further the role and prestigeof the United Nations. Proceeding from this consideration 20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionwe in China have stepped up preparations for the fourthWorld Conference on Women in Beijing  scheduled for1995. We also give vigorous support to the convening ofthe World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagenthe same year.It must be pointed out that unless the internationalcommunity helps the developing countries break loosequickly from poverty and backwardness  there can be nosustained growth or prosperity for all. Hence  we call uponthe developed countries to do more to curb tradeprotectionism  contribute more funds for development andenvironmental protection  cut back debt burden  increaseofficial development assistance  reduce restrictions ontechnology transfer and open their markets wider so as tocreate a favourable environment for the economic recoveryand revitalization of the developing countries. This willprove a boon to the developed countries themselves. At atime when the world economy has become increasinglyinterrelated  the revitalization of the developing countrieswill be a boost to the world and will spur to the economicrecovery and growth of the developed countries.Since the founding of the United Nations  tremendouschanges have taken place in the world and in theOrganization itself. United Nations membership hasincreased from the original 51 to 184 now  the majoritybeing developing countries. The Chinese Government is ofthe view that  in keeping with developments  the UnitedNations should be restructured  and the composition of theSecurity Council could be appropriately enlarged to enablethe Organization better to respond to the changes in theworld  meet the concerns and wishes of the membership andenhance its own role in international affairs. Reform of theSecurity Council should enable it better to discharge itsmandate in accordance with the purposes and principles ofthe Charter. It is the collective will and common aspirationof the membership that in the new circumstances the UnitedNations should be better equipped to address majorinternational issues vigorously and effectively and in a fairand balanced manner. Therefore  the reform of the SecurityCouncil and other United Nations organs should take dueaccount of the principle of equitable geographicaldistribution and should accommodate the interests of thedeveloping countries which make up the overwhelmingmajority of the membership. Since any reform would affectthe interests of all Member States and involve a revision ofthe Charter  views from all quarters must be heard. Thereform plan should undergo extensive discussions andconsultations by the membership and should be generallyacceptable to all.The Chinese Government has stated on many occasionsthat China stands for the non-proliferation of all weapons ofmass destruction. At the same time we hold that theultimate objective of mankind should be the completeprohibition and thorough destruction of those weapons. Nowthat the Conventions banning biological and chemicalweapons have been concluded  we deem it high time that thecomplete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclearweapons were put on the agenda.The international community has expressed concernover the issue of a nuclear-test ban. The ChineseGovernment has always stood for a total test ban within theframework of the complete prohibition and thoroughdestruction of nuclear weapons. We support an early startto negotiations for a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treatyand will work in common with other countries towards acomprehensive nuclear-test ban at an early date.China has always exercised great restraint in nucleartesting. The number of our tests is the smallest among allnuclear Powers. While a nuclear test ban is necessary  toundertake not to use nuclear weapons at all is far morecrucial  because this will not only make their testing development  production or deployment devoid of anymeaning  but will give great impetus to nuclear disarmament which will contribute tremendously to world peace andsecurity. If  however  complete prohibition and thoroughdestruction of nuclear weapons cannot be achieved soonenough  then let the nuclear Powers reach an agreement notto be the first to use nuclear weapons and not to use themagainst non-nuclear-weapon States or nuclear-free zones.This is entirely feasible and should be done as soon aspossible. This will put nuclear Powers to the test to seewhether they are genuinely willing to treat non-nuclearweapon States as equals. China long ago unilaterally undertook not to be the first to use nuclear weapons at any timeor under any circumstances  and not to use or threaten to usethem against any nuclear-free zone or non-nuclear-weaponState. We call upon all the other nuclear Powers to makethe same pledge and conclude an international convention tothis effect as soon as possible.Now there are international arrangements andconventions that are designed to control arms transfers andban certain types of weapons of mass destruction. Suchconventions are aimed at maintaining international andregional peace  security and stability. The arrangementsdesigned to control transfers of missile technology shouldalso take into account such elements as the arbitrary use ofmissiles for attacks on other countries. Otherwise  such anarrangement will become a means by which certain PowersForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 21can maintain military superiority or play power politics. Thatis morally unjustifiable. We oppose the all-too-frequentarbitrary use of sanctions by one country to bring pressureto bear on another under the pretext of controlling armstransfers while engaging in massive arms sales of one’s ownwhich jeopardize the sovereignty and security of the countryconcerned. We also denounce the hegemonic conduct of aself-styled ""world cop"" that tramples upon international lawand norms of international relations by endangering anothercountry’s navigational safety and normal trading under thepretext of enforcing the ban on chemical weapons and indisregard of the provisions of the relevant internationalconventions.Thanks to the policy of reform and opening to theworld  China’s economy has expanded considerably over thepast 15 years and is now in high gear. Our gross nationalproduct rose 12.8 per cent last year  and the current year’sgrowth rate will again be in double digits. Our foreign tradeand economic cooperation have been expanding rapidly.Total trade volume in 1992 was a 5.2-fold increase over1978  the year before the start of the reform and opening-up and represents an annual growth rate of 13.9 per cent.Investments from overseas have flowed in rapidly. Nearly50 000 overseas-funded projects involving $58 billion wereapproved in 1992. The momentum has continued into thecurrent year. High-speed growth has helped basically solvethe problem of feeding and clothing a population of over 1.1billion and put China on the road towards prosperity. It hasalso boosted economic exchanges and cooperation with othercountries. This is good for both China and the world.But we have encountered some problems as oureconomy has picked up speed. These problems will beresolved by accelerating and deepening our reform. Wehave taken a number of measures to strengthenmacro-control and readjust the economic structure to ensurehealthy  rapid and steady economic growth. We are fullycapable of attaining our objective. We are full of confidencein the future of our development programme.It is an objective reality that China has indeed achievedimpressive economic success. But it does not tally with thefacts to exaggerate our economic strength. Given China’svast land area  huge population and uneven economicdevelopment in different parts of the country  our per capitagross national product is still quite low. Ours is still adeveloping country. It will require several generationsworking very hard for many decades before we can attainthe level of an average developed country.At this juncture  I would like to draw attention toassertions recently bruited about on the international scene:that China’s economic success would entail a militarybuild-up  or that China would move to ""fill up the vacuum"" thus constituting a threat  and so on and so forth. This isutterly groundless. A China with a burgeoning economy isan important factor contributing to the economic well-beingof Asia and the world at large. The Chinese people hadlong suffered under imperialist aggression  and it regainedindependence only after horrible sacrifices in countless grimstruggles spanning more than a century. Nothing can makeus forget the episodes of our history when our country wassubjected to foreign aggression  dismemberment andenslavement. Our ancient sage Confucius  that great thinkerand statesman  admonished: ""Do not do unto others whatyou would not like others to do unto you"".Even when China becomes more developed  we willnever engage in aggression or expansionism; nor will weever seek hegemony. This is a pledge which has beenenshrined in our Constitution and which has become part ofour consistent and firm basic State policy. It has been borneout by facts that China is a staunch force for world peaceand stability. Our limited defence capability is solely forself-defence purposes. Many of our military industrial plantshave been converted to civilian production. Our militaryexpenditures are the lowest among the major countries. Wehave neither troops nor military bases on foreign territory.We are immersed in economic construction. Therefore  weneed an international environment of enduring peace as wellas long-term amicable relations with our neighbours. We areready to cultivate and strengthen similar relationships withall other countries on the basis of the five principles ofpeaceful coexistence.No matter how the wind may change its direction onthe world scene  China will unswervingly play its part inpreserving world peace and promoting common prosperityand development."
"32",1348,"CIV",48,1993,"I should like to pay tribute to the wisdom of theAssembly in electing Ambassador Insanally to preside overthis session  thus highlighting the outstanding role of hiscountry  the Republic of Guyana  and beyond it that of LatinAmerica in international relations.I also wish to congratulate the members of the Bureauand to extend to the outgoing President  Mr. Stoyan Ganev our warm congratulations on the excellent work done duringhis mandate.I should also like to reaffirm the full confidence ofCôte d’Ivoire in the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. President Houphouët-Boigny who has met him several times this year  greatly appreciateshis impartiality and ability and his great devotion to hisduties to the international community.Finally  my delegation congratulates and welcomes theStates admitted since the last session to our Organization which is thus moving ever closer to its objective ofuniversality.The substantial transformations that have taken place inthe world since 1989 have given rise to profound changes ininternational relations. All the points of reference thatallowed us to analyse these relations with certitude havedisappeared. The new atmosphere of confidence and thespirit of understanding  and at times of solidarity  thatprevail in relations between States and peoples give groundsfor hope and the rapid advent of a new international orderthat will be more stable  more just and more able to meet theaspirations of peoples for shared happiness in a world thathungers for bread and thirsts for truth. Today’s world ismoving towards a convergence around certain values including the primacy of respect for human rights  theimperative need for democracy  development anddisarmament and the leading role of law in internationalrelations. Such development can only give rise to greathopes by opening up the possibility of correcting pastmistakes  sharing the benefits of progress with all andensuring the fullness of peace.With the beginning of real disarmament and the recentsigning of the Convention banning chemical weapons  therelationship between war and peace is today undergoing aclear qualitative change. Unfortunately  however  we mustrecognize that the international situation is far fromsatisfying our hopes for justice and lasting peace.Indeed  the collapse of the bipolar world seems paradoxically  to have opened the door for new threats tointernational peace and security. The accumulation of poorlybandaged wounds  blind ambitions and feelings of rivalryand hatred built up over decades has re-emerged in variousregions of the world in the form of extremely devastatingand brutal fratricidal conflicts. Thus  Europe  whose level ofsocio-economic development did not prevent it fromdestroying itself twice in less than thirty years  is today stillin the grip of a terrible conflict in the former Yugoslavia.That anachronistic and indescribably barbarous war hasjustified the creation  for the first time within the UnitedNations system  of an international penal tribunal  underSecurity Council resolution 827 (1993). So too  Africa pushed aside by the disappearance of the bipolar world  hasbeen torn by numerous internal conflicts with unfortunateconsequences for the entire continent  which needs  rather stability and peace within African States  between AfricanStates and between Africa and the rest of the world in orderto deal with the imperative needs of its development andeconomic integration.The situation in Somalia continues to be of greatconcern  despite the presence of the United Nations peace-keeping forces  for the spectre of anarchy  intolerance in allits forms and violence continues to hover over that country.We hope that the tireless and commendable efforts of theinternational community to re-establish peace in that countrywill  within the allotted time  lead to a positive conclusionand the reconciliation of all its sons and daughters.We also hope to see very soon a resolution of theconflict in Liberia. Recent developments in that brotherlyand neighbourly country  which led to the conclusion of theCotonou Agreement on 25 July 1993  tend to make us moreoptimistic about the rapid restoration of peace.Côte d’Ivoire has always wished fervently to see there-establishment of peace in Liberia and has  in addition acted along these lines  as the Yamassoukro Accords attest.We are gratified by the formation in that country of atransitional government in the form of a State councilentrusted with the organization of general elections. Wewelcome the firm determination of the political elements inLiberia to work for the ultimate collapse of the wall ofhatred and enmity between Liberian brothers and thus to laythe foundation for a future of peace and prosperity for all.In this context it is urgent that the international communitycommit itself further to finding the necessary means for therapid deployment of new contingents to reinforce theEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)Military Observer Group (ECOMOG) in Liberia to promotethe effective implementation of the provisions of theCotonou Agreement  particularly with regard to the entryinto force of the Council of State  disarmament and thecantonment of factions. It is equally urgent that theinternational community come to the assistance  within theframework of Chapter VIII of the Charter  of States orregional organizations  participating in peace-keeping effortsin Liberia. It is also necessary that the question of thedelivery of humanitarian assistance be rapidly resolved toallow for the regular supply of those regions of Liberiawhere famine is raging in order to prevent the incursions ofarmed bands in search of food that attack border villages andhamlets. Here we should like to congratulate all the non-governmental organizations that are making every effort with courage  tenacity and dedication  to save human livesin that strife-torn country.It is also fitting to welcome the conclusion of theInternational Conference for the Protection of War Victimsheld at Geneva from 3 August to 2 September this year organized by the Swiss Government and the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross. That Conference allowed fora reaffirmation of the provisions of the major treaties ofinternational humanitarian law aimed at the protection ofpopulations during armed conflicts and for sensitizing publicopinion concerning the valid bases of those provisions andthe plight of civilian victims.Concerning Angola  progress made at the outset in theapplication of the Bicesse peace agreements in May 1991now needs to be maintained  and efforts must be made andencouraged  both in the Security Council and in Africanforums  for the achievement of a just and lasting peace.Côte d’Ivoire knows only two paths for the settlementof conflicts: resort to force or resort to negotiation  that isto say  dialogue. Recent events in the international arenahave consecrated the value of dialogue  which has alwaysbeen advocated by President Félix Houphouët-Boigny  forthe peaceful settlement of all conflicts. They clearly indicatehow dialogue  conducted by responsible individuals  can regardless of the nature of the conflict  serve as an extremelyuseful instrument for peace.In South Africa  the recent developments in the politicalsituation are most encouraging  despite the uncertainties ofthe moment resulting from the escalation of violence. Forthis reason we welcome with satisfaction the joint statementof the political parties of South Africa concerning theirintention to organize free and democratic elections in April1994. We also welcome the establishment of an executivetransition council that  for the first time in three centuries ofwhite domination  after the first multiracial elections willinvolve the black majority in political matters.30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionWe send out an urgent appeal to those elementsopposed to democratic changes in South Africa to refrainfrom acts likely to jeopardize the sensitive negotiationprocess  which would delay South Africa’s return to thefamily of nations. We welcome the new spirit inspiring theSouth African leaders  particularly Mr. De Klerk and Mr.Mandela  a spirit that led to the historic request made by theAfrican National Congress (ANC) to the internationalcommunity to lift the economic and diplomatic sanctionsslapped on South Africa. We also welcome the agreementreached between the South African and NamibianGovernments concerning the transfer of the port of WalvisBay and the surrounding islands to the jurisdiction of theNamibian Government.In the Middle East we can finally discern  after somany years of war and built-up hatred  the prospect of asettlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The mutualrecognition of Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO) and the signing in Washington on 13September of the historic agreement on Gaza and Jerichoconvince us that the process begun in the Middle East isnow irreversible  despite the obstacles that might arise on theroad to peace.This is the moment to hail the courage  lucidity andself-abnegation of the high Israeli and Palestinian officialswho have risen above circumstances and resolutely chosenpeace. Their ardour in working for peace after such alengthy period of war has been recognized and saluted bythe international community. It is quite fitting that themembers of the jury for the Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize established by the United Nations Educational  Scientific andCultural Organization  unanimously awarded the Prize for1993 to those illustrious leaders of Israel and Palestine.As for the situation in the Gulf  where peace is stillprecarious  we reiterate our unswerving support for the fullimplementation of all resolutions on this conflict  particularlySecurity Council resolution 687 (1991) of 3 April 1991  aswell as resolution 833 (1993). We call on the partiesconcerned to respect these provisions. We believe that thisresolution is a major asset in assuring security and stabilityin the region.In Asia  we welcome the outcome of the conflict inCambodia  where the United Nations undertook one of themost ambitious and complex peace-keeping operations it hadever conducted. We congratulate the members of the UnitedNations Secretariat and the States that supplied variouscontingents for the success of this operation  which allowsworld public opinion fully to appreciate this other activity ofthe United Nations which is too often ignored.If the conflicts born of the cold war are now beginningto find solutions  it is none the less clear that we haveentered upon a period of uncertainty  questioning andinstability  with the re-emergence of a number of secondaryconflicts that had been effectively frozen or repressed duringthe cold war and that are essentially of ethnic  tribal orreligious origin  as illustrated by the wrenching events inNagorny-Karabakh  Abkhazia  and the former Yugoslavia.It is becoming clear as well that in today’s world there arefewer and fewer identifiable enemies and more and moreproblems that are very difficult to identify.The United Nations remains the indispensable recoursefor confronting these conflicts. Here  we solemnly wish tostate our full support for the proposals of the Secretary-General contained in ""An Agenda for Peace"".The strengthening of preventive action by the UnitedNations must prompt us to pursue the process ofrestructuring and revitalization of its bodies to allow it tocope with these new challenges. Given the dominant role ofthe Security Council in peace-keeping and internationalsecurity  the question of equitable representation in that bodyshould allow for a lengthy reflection so as to find a solutionacceptable to all - in this case  the expansion of the SecurityCouncil to accord with the growth in the number of ourOrganization’s Members and in the complexity of theproblems submitted to it.Such an expansion should be based on rigorous andobjective criteria which we need to define together  bearingin mind the imperative need for effectiveness in the takingand implementation of Security Council decisions. TheUnited Nations  as a reflection of universal values  cannotstand outside the trend towards democratization which issweeping across the world.The World Conference on Human Rights  held inVienna last June  was of pivotal importance  allowing for areaffirmation of human rights. If we can rightly be gratifiedby the fact that this Conference recognized the right todevelopment as a fundamental human right to the disastrouseconomic situation in numerous regions of the world  andparticularly in Africa  should remind us here of the need fora general awareness of the fact that human rights cannotflourish in a context of poverty and misery.In looking back over the economic situation  we notethat global economic activity in 1992 was characterized bya slow recovery  growing by only 1.1 per cent. This weakrecovery is primarily the result of a moderate growth in theglobal production of the industrialized countries  as well asa noticeable drop in the total production of those countrieswhich formerly had planned economies. Unfortunately these trends continued in 1993  and thus we are seeing a risein unemployment and the emergence of serious socialtensions throughout the world.These not very optimistic elements observed in theindustrialized countries can only have negative consequencesfor other countries  particularly those of the developingworld  among which the African countries remain the mostvulnerable.We can therefore hardly be surprised that in the lastUnited Nations Development Programme report on humandevelopment in 173 countries  41 of the 53 African countriesare among the 50 last countries in the classification. Thesepessimistic conclusions were reaffirmed in the reports of theWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund.We are aware of the causes of this serious recession.Aside from the drop in economic activities in numerousindustrialized countries  those causes are the collapse ofcommodity prices - for minerals  mining and agriculture -and the subsequent exacerbation of the foreign-debt burdenon our economies  which in turn limits our investmentcapability. Additional causes that should be noted are thegeneral inadequacies in economic management as describedin the World Bank study entitled ""The African Capacity-Building Initiative"". All these factors taken together haveled to the present crisis in our countries  manifested aboveall by a drastic drop in economic growth and an intolerablerise in unemployment  particularly among our young people- the driving force of our countries.The image this brief sketch of the African economicand social climate projects is hardly encouraging. In theface of such a situation  we believe that prospects for seeingthe advocated solutions succeed lie primarily in a consistentapproach to them.Our States have had the political courage to embarkupon deep-rooted economic reforms and our peoples haveprogressively become aware of the need for the adjustmenteffort. Thus in Côte d’Ivoire  for several years now  wehave been implementing a set of measures of economicpolicy aimed at creating the conditions for economicrecovery. The stabilization phase of this process hasprimarily tended towards putting our public finances on asounder footing  which is basic to the revival of oureconomy and its integration into a larger collective withinthe region and throughout the continent.The extension of the democratic process in Africa isevident. But it is also clear that there can be no democracywithout economic development  nor genuine sustainabledevelopment without democracy. One of the primaryconditions of this development for our countries is justremuneration in primary commodities - mineral  mining andagricultural.Statistics show that Africa represents only 2 per cent ofthe value of world trade  and that inter-African traderepresents only 5 per cent of the value of the region’s totalexternal trade. These data remind us once again of theeconomic urgency for Africa to achieve genuine economicintegration within the continent.In West Africa  this exercise has already begun  inparticular within the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS)  whose treaty has just been revised  andabove all within the West African Monetary Union(WAMU)  with the upcoming establishment of the WestAfrican Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).From our point of view  such an exercise in structuringand harmonizing the institutional and legal framework ofeconomic integration should be carried out and shouldrapidly be extended to all regions of Africa in order to pavethe way for the building of the African Common Market which we all so wish to see.It is also appropriate to note the great hopes we placeon the establishment of the African Import-Export Bank whose primary objectives will be to increase the level ofAfrican exports and of inter-African trade. We should alsonote the significant progress made in laying the groundworkfor an expanded cooperation between our States in severalareas  such as those of business law  the insurance industry and the establishment of a body for regional statistics.We wish here particularly to emphasize the extremelyimportant role played in the area of financing by the AfricanDevelopment Bank in implementing the objectives ofintegration in Africa. We must hail the will this institutiondemonstrates in its efforts to establish positive correlationsbetween actions implemented within the framework ofstructural adjustment programmes and the objectives ofregional economic integration. This step by the AfricanDevelopment Bank affects the central elements of thedevelopment strategies of African countries.32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionIt goes without saying that such integration can beimplemented only in an environment which is one of peace stability and security. We therefore welcomed the creation within the OAU and ECOWAS  of machinery for theprevention  management and settlement of conflicts.We must recognize that our efforts at regionalintegration will remain futile as long as the global economicenvironment remains unfavourable and as long as ourpartners in the developed countries lack the necessarypolitical will resolutely to tackle our countries’ problems inthis interdependent world of solidarity.At a time when the marginalization of Africa isincreasing  we welcome the positive initiative of theGovernment of Japan to hold  several days from now inTokyo  the International Conference on AfricanDevelopment  which will allow the developed countries tobetter grasp the specific problems of Africa.We must acknowledge  however  that any assistanceoffered by the international community will be only a smallcontribution  given the magnitude of the development needsof the African continent. This assistance will be effectiveonly if consistent and lasting solutions are found to ourproblems within the framework of an internationalcooperation even further based on interdependence andsolidarity  in particular in the areas of international trade foreign debt  the environment  the war on drugs  and theimportant question of raw materials  to avoid confining ourcountries to the exclusive role of purveyors of raw materialsand allow them also  through the transformation of theseproducts  to become consumers in trade relations.More specifically  the Rio Conference  by adoptingAgenda 21  reached a consensus on the planetary levelconcerning the need for immediate and bold internationalcooperation in the area of sustainable development and theenvironment. In applying Agenda 21  Côte d’Ivoire  for itspart  has established regional environmental committees todraw up its white book on the environment  which will helpit zero in on the objectives laid down in the Agenda.In this context  the elaboration of an internationalconvention on the struggle against desertification is ofcritical importance for Africa  and we continue to place ourhopes in the work of the Intergovernmental NegotiatingCommittee on that convention.Ultimately  given the importance and complexity of theareas affecting the question of the environment  it isindispensable for the international community to openlysupport the development efforts of the African countries bygranting them adequate financial resources and by helpingthem strengthen their scientific and technical capacities.Concerning the question of drugs and its financialramifications  the gravity of these issues requires that theinternational community give them serious thought. Themost recent studies of this phenomenon indicate that Africahas become one of the major centres for this illegal traffic.At the same time  we note that local consumption of harddrugs  in particular heroin and cocaine  are notablyincreasing in numerous African countries.This represents  therefore  a global scourge againstwhich individual States are doomed from the outset  for theravages of drugs spare no continent and no country regardless of how powerful they may be.Africa is the weak link from which the internationaldrug trade profits. Thus  given the extreme vulnerability andthe precarious nature of the means available to the Africancontinent to combat this danger  the international communityshould supply - specifically through the United Nations DrugControl Programme  with which my country is fruitfullycooperating - the needed financial resources.Since the end of the bipolar war  history has speededup. We are the privileged witnesses of political events ofthe highest importance  events that will shape internationalrelations along the lines of a rapprochement among nationsand will therefore contribute to the strengthening of peaceand global security  essential foundations for the building ofa more just world order and one of greater solidarity.However  despite the dynamics of peace  which promisebetter tomorrows  we must admit that the ideas of peace andsecurity can no longer be limited solely to the political field for the truth is that peace and security can be genuine onlyif economic development and social progress are ensured forall.The effective globalization of the economy as well asthe ever-increasing interdependence of nations today requiresalso an acceleration of history on the level of internationaleconomic relations  for the world must become aware of thefact that there can be no lasting peace  no universalprosperity  if the greatest part of humankind is on thesidelines of economic development and social well-being.In such a context  therefore  the North-South dialoguemust be reactivated with the goal of seeing that furthermeans are established to eradicate underdevelopment andpoverty  which today represent the greatest threat of our era.For peace does not coexist well with poverty  as PresidentFelix Houphouët-Boigny often says.The capability of the international community to graspthis danger and to find rapid and lasting solutions willdetermine our joint survival."

We are grateful to himand express all our appreciation to him.For two years now our Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  has devoted unusual energy to themanagement of the Organization  management that has beenmade difficult by the increase in the number of UnitedNations missions  the complexity of the challenges to bemet  and the acute financial crisis that is hindering thesuccessful carrying out of his activities. Cameroon wishesto commend him for his wisdom and to assure him of itssupport.The Organization’s universality has been enhanced bythe admission of six new Member States. It is a pleasure forme to welcome them among us and to assure them ofCameroon’s readiness to maintain and develop relations ofcooperation and friendship with them.The especially significant and unexpected changes thathave marked the end of this century confirm our feeling thatwe must never despair of the human being and that whatever the circumstances may be  we must keep faith inmankind’s future.Indeed  the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly is being held at a time when the image of thathistoric handshake between Prime Minister Itzhak Rabin andPresident Yasser Arafat is still bright in our minds  ahandshake that sealed the mutual recognition between Israeland the Palestine Liberation Organization and consecratedthe agreement on autonomy for Gaza and Jericho. Neverbefore have conditions been as conducive to the building ofa lasting peace in the Middle East.Forty-eighth session - 8 October l993 7That historic event  a sign of the times  was followedby the adoption by the Parliament of South Africa  which isstill composed exclusively of whites and coloureds  of theagreement to establish a Transitional Executive Council conferring upon the black majority a right to participate inthe management of that country’s affairs with an eye to theApril 1994 elections  which should usher in a united democratic and non-racial South Africa.Those are undeniably two major events of exceptionalsignificance  events that demonstrate the extent of theupheaval in the world we are now witnessing.Allow me  therefore  to salute the courage and greatvision demonstrated by the Israeli Government and theleaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Certainly the peace in the Middle East that had seemed elusive is nowwithin reach. Cameroon had always hoped for this  and weare therefore gratified at the progress made and wish to paya tribute to the various protagonists who contributed to it.And with regard to this situation  has the time not cometo update the Organization’s documents dealing with thesituation in the Middle East? Cameroon intends tocontribute to the consideration of this question thecircumstances call for. The tone and provisions ofresolutions concerning South Africa also need to be broughtinto line with the changes taking place in that country.Cameroon supported the appeal made from this rostrumby President Nelson Mandela for the lifting of the economicsanctions against South Africa. We salute that outstandingson of Africa  and we include in this commendationPresident De Klerk  whose open-minded attitude has earnedour admiration.The democratic transition in South Africa is at oncefragile and promising for the whole of the African continent.It demands the support of the international community which must work to put an end to violence and thedestabilizing actions of the forces in the country that areopposed to change.Unfortunately  this remarkable improvement in thesituations in the Middle East and South Africa cannot maskthe threats to international peace and security caused by thepersistence of armed conflicts in various parts of the worldarising out of ethnic claims  the resurgence of nationalisticfeelings  religious intolerance  the desire for power  povertyand underdevelopment.At the very heart of Europe  a frightful war continuesin the Balkans  a war the more frightful because the ideologyunderlying it is an affront to the conscience of mankind.The indignation it has aroused throughout the world demandsthat the weapons be silenced to enable the virtues ofdialogue to prevail over the logic of exclusion and conquest.That war is also sorely testing the international community’sability to defend the principles and values of civilization inour era.It is equally untenable that in Angola innocent people caught up in an increasingly senseless war  continue to bemassacred. It must be obvious to everyone that a solutionto the Angolan problem cannot be imposed by force of arms.It resides in concertation  dialogue and negotiation. Wetherefore urge the parties concerned to seize this most recentopportunity to achieve peace afforded them by strictimplementation of the Abidjan Agreements and the relevantresolutions of the Security Council.The imperatives of peace are also pressing upon ourLiberian  Somali and Mozambican brothers and sisters  whohave legitimate aspirations to the stability needed toreconstruct their countries.As regards Haiti  it is also important  if legality is totriumph  that everything possible be done for theimplementation of the Governors Island Agreement.In Western Sahara  we have not lost hope that following the negotiations now under way  the obstacles toa referendum on the future status of the territory will beremoved.In other parts of the world where hotbeds of tensionpersist the spirit of confrontation must yield to the search fornegotiated solutions. In this context  Cameroon welcomesthe decisive contribution of the United Nations to therestoration of peace in Cambodia. In paying tribute to thememory of all those who have paid for peace in Cambodiawith their lives  I include Captain Ndi Ncho Abrahams ofthe Cameroonian contingent of military observers of theUnited Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia(UNTAC)  who fell on the field of honour in Phnom Penhon 7 September 1993.I also wish to extend here our warm congratulations toHis Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk on his restoration tothe throne of Cambodia. We are convinced that his loftystature  eminent qualities and long experience will help hiscountry to set out again on the path to progress and thereconciliation of its children.8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionMeeting the challenge of peace  involves not only thesilencing of weapons  but also ensuring the reconstruction ofcountries ravaged by war. We therefore appeal that  asmeasures are taken to settle certain regional conflicts  thenecessary resources be mobilized to meet  as well ashumanitarian needs  the reconstruction needs of Africancountries that have been torn by armed conflicts.This would bolster the willingness of the African Headsof State to assume greater responsibility in the prevention management and settlement of conflicts in their region. Themechanism created for that purpose at the twenty-ninthSummit of the Organization of African Unity deserves thesupport of the international community  as it is involved inthe implementation of the agenda for peace adopted by theSecurity Council. Furthermore  the adoption in Libreville inSeptember 1993 of a non-aggression pact between the 11States members of the Economic Community of CentralAfrican States is part of this trend. Concluded in theframework of the Standing Advisory Committee on SecurityQuestions in Central Africa  created last year by theSecretary-General of the United Nations  this agreement isan essential link in the chain of confidence-buildingmeasures aimed at the progressive reduction of the armedforces and military budgets of the States of the subregion.Our States are thereby determined to create an area of peace security and solidarity. We are thus entitled to expect thecontinued support of the international community for thisinitiative  sponsored by the United Nations.In a more general context  the progress achieved in thefield of disarmament and arms limitation should continue.We call on the major Powers to redouble their efforts toaccelerate the disarmament process  especially in the field ofnuclear weapons. The conclusion of a treaty banningnuclear tests would meet the expectations of the internationalcommunity  just as the indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty would help reassure the non-nuclear-weapon States. In this respect  we praise the dialogue beingpursued by the parties concerned to find a negotiatedsolution to the differences between North Korea  on the onehand and the International Atomic Energy Agency and theGovernment of the United States of America on the other.Lastly  the progressive establishment of the structuresof the Organization’s executive secretariat for the control ofchemical weapons strengthens our conviction that generaland complete disarmament is not just a dream. It is afervent aspiration of mankind that could be achieved ifgreater political will were focused on that goal.At the recent World Conference on Human Rights  heldin Vienna  our common vision of the values underlyingmankind’s shared aspiration to the effective enjoyment ofhuman rights made the longstanding dispute about a possiblehierarchy as between civil and political rights and economic social and cultural rights outdated. Now enshrined asindivisible and interdependent  all these rights have oneobjective alone: the promotion and protection of humandignity  regardless of considerations of race  colour  sex orreligion. Recognition of that objective has contributed to therebirth of the idea of the universality of human rights andhas given those rights the moral and legal force of acategorical imperative with unassailable legitimacy.This development encourages the Government ofCameroon  with the impetus given by His ExcellencyPresident Paul Biya  to continue updating the legal andinstitutional frameworks to promote the effective enjoymentof human rights by our citizens. Our resolute march towardsdemocracy can be gauged by the incomparable freedom ofexpression burgeoning throughout our national media  theflourishing of political parties  the vitality of popularparticipation in public life and the establishment  in the wakeof the State’s gradual disengagement  of new and vast areasfor the development of private initiative.The National Committee on Human Rights andFreedoms  whose activities enhance its credibility  is helpingenormously to make public opinion aware of the importanceof human rights and to alert our authorities to any possibleviolation. The recent organization in Yaoundé by the UnitedNations Centre for Human Rights of a training seminar formembers of that Committee highlights the role ofinternational cooperation in the promotion of human rights particularly in developing countries.This cooperation suggests a new approach  necessitatinga reversal of the tendency to turn human rights into politicaltools. This tendency often leads to a selective awareness ofhuman rights violations and discrimination in the applicationof sanctions. Cooperation also suggests a new type ofpartnership  allowing the highly publicized activism onhuman rights to be replaced by calm and constructivedialogue between the various parties in charge of promotingand protecting human rights - States  national institutions non-governmental organizations and multilateral institutions.In this context  the proposal to establish a post of highcommissioner for human rights has its merits. None theless  it gives rise to some questions  the importance of whichrequires that it be considered attentively and in depth.Forty-eighth session - 8 October l993 9The universality of human rights  which everyone musthenceforth respect  requires the democratization ofinternational economic relations. It would be unrealistic tocircumscribe the exercise of democracy within nationalboundaries  when there are also flagrant injustices ininternational economic relations that constitute graveviolations of human dignity.A victim of such injustices  Africa  more than any otherdeveloping region  has the characteristics of a continentadrift. It is toiling under an intolerable debt burden in asituation exacerbated by an overall trend towardsdisinvestment  a decline in official development assistanceand a steady deterioration in the terms of trade as a result ofthe continuing fall in commodity prices.In these circumstances  is it acceptable that net financialflows should continue from the impoverished Africancountries to the rich countries? As we have already pointedout  this situation cannot be considered in economic termsalone. It is an ethical problem involving the conscience ofour Northern partners and of international financialinstitutions.Need we recall that despite the seriousness of theeconomic crisis they are facing the African States  like thecountries of the East  have undertaken courageous reformstowards liberalizing their economies and democratizing theirpolitical systems?While we are pleased at the mobilization of resourcesaimed at accompanying reform in the countries of the East we must deplore the fact that no similar effort has beenmade for the benefit of the African countries that are also ina state of transition. Structural adjustment plans are the onlyalternative solution proposed to them. Because they arebecoming increasingly exorbitant and difficult to bear  theirsocial costs need to be given more attention by our partnersso that the already fragile foundations of our young Stateswill not crumble.The very recent International Conference  on AfricanDevelopment  held in Tokyo  will give us an opportunity todraw the attention of the international community to thedistress of the African continent.The failure of the United Nations Programme of Actionfor African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 and the disappointing progress of the United NationsNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990sunderscore  if need be  the urgent need to establish for thatcontinent a consistent set of measures to stimulate recoveryincluding  in particular  debt alleviation and the enhancementof human resources  the transfer of technology  support forthe diversification of production and the improvement ofconditions for access of our products to internationalmarkets.We must set our sights on establishing a fund forfinancing African development. The imperatives ofinternational solidarity are not consistent withcompartmentalization on the basis of racial or geographicalconsiderations. Hence  we cannot leave the Africancountries at the mercy of market forces  which are devoid ofall legitimacy owing to speculation. The internationalcommunity must therefore undertake to construct a morelegitimate new world order that is in keeping with fullrespect for law and justice.The world partnership for sustainable developmentenshrined in Rio de Janeiro responds to this aspiration.While we are pleased at the establishment of theCommission for Sustainable Development  the release ofresources required for the financing of Agenda 21 has notyet been accomplished.In the social sphere  activities conducted throughout theUnited Nations system with a view to fighting against theAIDS pandemic and to repressing the illicit traffic innarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances deserve highpriority in the agenda of our Organization.Similar importance should be attached to the integrationof women in the process of development and to theprotection of vulnerable groups of society.The International Conference on Population andDevelopment planned for Cairo in 1994  the World Summitfor Social Development  to be held in 1995 in Copenhagen and the Fourth World Conference on Women  to be heldalso in 1995  in Beijing  will offer opportunities to review allof these issues at the highest level. These gatherings willmake it possible for us to refine our understanding of theseproblems in order better to integrate them in ourdevelopment policies.Guaranteeing international peace and security andpromoting the economic and social development of itsMembers are the tasks that the United Nations has beencalled upon to perform since its establishment. The changesgenerated by the end of East-West rivalry have createdconditions more conducive to the attainment of theseobjectives. Our Organization should therefore rethink itsstructures and its working methods in order to increase their10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioneffectiveness  the better to respond to the ever-growingexpectations of the international community.The restructuring process under way is of course partof this trend. We are pleased at the prevailing spirit ofconsensus in the search for solutions to this problem - aproblem made complex and delicate because of the need toreconcile the need for effectiveness and the imperative ofdemocratization which alone can safeguard the plurality ofapproaches that underlies the universality of ourOrganization.In this context  the reform of the Security Councilshould not be confined to a mere broadening of itscomposition. It should above all make it possible to revivethe spirit behind the decision to confer upon the members ofthe Council broad powers regarding the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. These powers shouldtherefore be exercised in the interest of all  and not on thebasis of other considerations.The General Assembly should  along the same lines remain a global forum where the positions of States areexpressed and harmonized. We are therefore in favour of astrong Secretariat endowed with adequate structures and witha highly qualified staff that reflects the diversity and theexcellence of the peoples of the United Nations. This meansthat throughout the system and within our Organization  theongoing process of restructuring should be consistent withthe spirit of the Charter.Mankind has always cherished the utopian dream of aworld in which man would no longer be a danger to hisfellow man  and in which peace  justice and equity wouldprevail. The sudden acceleration of history at the turn ofthis century gives this utopian hope an impetus that enhancesour shared perception of the need to establish a new andmore united world order. This ""promise of history"" beingshaped will be an expression of the convergence of our willto free mankind of the consequences of a past that we hopeis forever behind us. The universal conscience cannot putup with the horrors of war and of flagrant violations ofhuman rights  nor should it at the dawning of the thirdmillennium tolerate the persistence of poverty and hardshipthat trample underfoot the intrinsic values of our sharedhumanity.Thus the United Nations must meet the challenge ofrenewal in order fully to play its central role in the buildingof a world consistent with the ideals of its founding fathers.In the final analysis  history condemns us to be hopeful - inthe midst of violence  does man not persevere in his utopiandream of peace?"
"34",1434,"COD",48,1993,"Mr. President  the speakers who have preceded meat this prestigious rostrum have all unanimouslyacknowledged your outstanding intellectual qualities  yourwealth of experience and your intensive knowledge ofinternational issues which will guarantee a positive outcometo our work that promises to be very exciting at this timewhen we see emerging on the horizon the irreversibleturning of the activities of the Organization towards real mutually beneficial  cooperation.The delegation of the Republic of Zaire  which it is myhonour to head  associates itself with the congratulations andwishes expressed by other delegations here present andexpresses the hope that your presidency will see the essentialbasis laid down for the establishment of this new era ofpeace  prosperity  mutual understanding and tolerance thatwe all so wish to see.I should also like to extend my sincere congratulationsto the other members of the Bureau who  I am sure  willeffectively assist you in carrying out your onerous butinspiring tasks as President.To your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev I should like to pay a particular and well-deserved tribute forthe competence  skill and know-how with which he socapably guided the work of the General Assembly at itsforty-seventh session.I should like to express to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali the Secretary-General of the Organization  the sincereexpression of our appreciation and our encouragement of hisdetermination in the search for peaceful solutions to themany armed conflicts that are devastating the world.I should also like to welcome to the Organization thenew Member States. They can count on the cooperation andassistance  both bilateral and multilateral  of the Republic ofZaire.Barely three years ago the overwhelming majority ofthe inhabitants of this marvelous planet Earth were filledwith the hope of seeing close and multifaceted cooperationfor development among nations.Although the cold war was blown away by the force ofthe wind of perestroika we are obliged to note that thisforty-eighth session of the General Assembly has opened ata time when we are witnessing the resumption of armedconflicts in at least three of the five continents which makeup this world.The collapse of the socialist bloc brought with it onlya moment of calm for we note at present the explosion ofhotbeds of tension and fratricidal wars in the former Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics and the former Yugoslavia  andwe condemn the monstrous  inhuman and horrendous acts ofmodern civilization there.The primary cause of all these wars is religious orethnic intolerance and the non-acceptance of politicalopinions contrary to those which one believes to be ofimmutable and subject to imposition on all. Thus  in Asiaanachronistic situations persist and entire populations arecondemned to wander without any hope of a bettertomorrow.Nevertheless  my delegation backs the negotiations thatare now taking place between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) on the question of Palestineand urges all the protagonists in this drama to do all in theirpower to ensure that these consultations lead to theconclusion of a peace agreement guaranteeing the right ofeach people to exist in internationally recognized territory.We hail the courage and determination of theirexcellencies the Prime Minister of Israel and the Presidentof the PLO who have recognized autonomy for Gaza andJericho and have also committed themselves to put an endto acts of piracy and sabotage. May their example befollowed by other States involved in this conflict so that alasting peace can finally be established in this region andthat we can see genuine cooperation for development.So too  we reaffirm our full support and our backingfor the efforts made by the two Koreas towards theirpeaceful reunification.We should also like to take advantage of thisopportunity to congratulate the United Nations authoritieswhich have effectively contributed to the organization of freeand democratic elections in Cambodia.As regards Africa  this continent too has not beenspared by the situation of semi-war  semi-peace in whichyoung States must manage bloody conflicts which sorely trytheir fragile State structures and their precarious socio-economic infrastructures. However  the Republic of Zaire isgratified to see the international community mobilizing toprevent new conflicts and to find peaceful solutions to thosefratricidal wars which are devastating a good number ofAfrican States.The plethora of hotbeds of tension and the recourse tomilitary action  whether for intervention or for pacification are likely to wipe out these efforts and to damage thehumanitarian action and the noble objectives of peace andharmony pursued by the United Nations.Concerning southern Africa  in particular  Zairesupports the action being taken by the United Nations inMozambique  and urges all the parties to the conflict torespect the commitments they have undertaken and to worktowards the establishment of lasting peace there.The positive results that we have seen in South Africa where the white minority has agreed to involve the blackmajority in the administration of public affairs in aTransitional Executive Council  are grounds for satisfactionfor all those who have contributed towards them  and forlegitimate pride for Presidents Mandela and De Klerk.Given these prospects for peace that we can see justover the horizon  it is our keen hope that there will begenuine reconciliation within the black community in SouthAfrica so that a fratricidal war does not break out that wouldquite likely support the notions of those who wish to holdback the advent of a democratic and multi-racial Republic ofSouth Africa.I beg the Assembly’s indulgence  since I should likenow to dwell on the case of our neighbour Angola  whichshares with Zaire a frontier over 2 600 kilometres long; inAngola  the civil war  which is becoming more intense  iscausing considerable loss of life and incalculable materialdamage and is threatening the territorial integrity of thatyoung nation.The Republic of Zaire  which  since it acceded toindependence  has had to suffer the throes of civil war rebellion and many attempts at secession  cannot afford tosupport a civil war in Angola. The tragic situation beingexperienced by that fraternal nation is of extreme concern tous  because it is causing us enormous political  economicand social problems. Zaire is actually a semi-landlockedcountry  and the closure of the Benguela railway and thecontinuing insecurity right alongside Matadi port  our onlyoutlet to the sea - as a result of the crossfire between thePopular Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola(FAPLA) and UNITA - are doing my country considerableForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 3economic damage right at a moment when it is no longerreceiving bilateral or multilateral assistance.In addition to these many economic difficulties  therehas been a massive influx of our Angolan brothers andsisters  who are finding refuge with Zairian families  towhich they are linked by historical ties of blood. Providingfood  shelter and so on for the refugees is increasing thedifficulties being experienced by the host families  who arethemselves rather disadvantaged.The international community knows that the Republicof Zaire right now is going through a period of politicalturbulence and is encountering enormous economic andfinancial difficulties. In these conditions  where could Zairefind the additional resources to finance a civil war inAngola? Taking into account its internal problems  mycountry has no interest in promoting the traffic in weaponsof war through Matadi port  given that they could changehands and fuel a civil war on its own territory.Moreover  Zaire  which neither makes nor sells arms deplores the attitude of those countries whose citizensmanufacture arms and sell them to the belligerents - underthe tolerant gaze of their Governments - and then come andshed crocodile tears in international forums over the fate ofthe victims of this fratricidal war.The Republic of Zaire  which assisted the Republic ofAngola in its struggle for independence and  through Zaire’smediation  facilitated the historic meeting between Presidentdos Santos and Mr. Savimbi at Gbadolite  is still ready toseek  with them  ways and means of putting an end to theAngolan tragedy. This is the spirit in which Zaire welcomedMr. Alioune Blondin Beye  the Secretary-General’s SpecialRepresentative  on his visit to Kinshasa last September  andin which the President of the Republic of Zaire  MarshalMobutu Sese Seko  dispatched to his Angolan counterpart anemissary whose task was to dispel any ambiguity as towhether there was meddling of any kind by my country inAngola’s internal affairs.Lastly  the Republic of Zaire  which has played anactive part at the recent Libreville conference on securityproblems in central Africa and will soon sign the non-aggression pact that was drawn up there  considers itself animportant link in the peace and security of the subregion and does not intend to take any action that might sour therelations of good neighbourliness and cooperation that existbetween our States. Ancient African wisdom tells us thatwhen your neighbour’s house is on fire  you must help himput it out in order to stop the wind wafting the flamestowards your own house.After the political turbulence that Africa experiencedduring the first few years of independence  some politicalthinkers and players believed  in good faith  that establishingstrong government based on omnipresent and omnipotentsingle parties could forge national unity and ensure ourStates’ harmonious development. The Republic of Zaire wasno exception to this outline. In fact  for over two decadesnow a monolithic political system has been in operation with its ups and downs  and has ended up  as a result of itsown internal contradictions  in such deadlock that on24 April 1990 the President of the Republic  after threemonths of consultations of the people  decreed thedissolution of the single party and proposed the introductionof a pluralistic political system.Unfortunately  the enthusiasm that followed gave birthto a sort of collective outpouring and the frenziedestablishment of political parties  of which there are now360 for a total population of 40 million or so. In ourconcern to make an objective reassessment of our history map out our future and ensure national reconciliation  weheld a Sovereign National Conference  which  lasting over16 months  was the costliest and the longest in Africa.The Conference raised great hopes but was unable toachieve all its goals because  from the outset  those behindit had come to it for two different reasons. For some  theConference was the best place to take power alongrevolutionary-type lines - dissolving all the existinginstitutions and sidelining those in charge of them - whilefor others  who championed a reformist type of plan  theConference ought rather to be the place for organizinggovernment through a progressive restructuring of theinstitutions. This basic difference caused heightenedpassions from the beginning to the end of the Conference and the political players ended up more divided than theyhad been before.As the document setting out constitutional provisionsfor the transitional period was not taken to its logicalconclusion - it failed to abrogate expressly the Constitutionin force - the country found itself with two basicconstitutional texts. In conditions such as these  it has beendifficult to arrange an equitable sharing of power betweenthe various transitional institutions  which is why we have aninstitutional crisis and a political impasse.To extricate ourselves from this situation  and on theinitiative of the President of the Republic and the Presidentof the Supreme Council of the Republic  the delegates ofseveral political platforms met in caucus to create a newinstitutional framework. But the results of the caucus wereagain disputed and the entire political class felt the need to4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionresume negotiations. These achieved  inter alia  theestablishment of a new institutional framework  theunanimous acceptance of a timetable establishing the variousdates for elections in the next 15 months and the adoption byreferendum  within the same period  of a new constitution.Thus  a referendum will be held in 1994 on theadoption of the new constitution. There will also be free transparent and democratic elections for mandates for thepresidency of the Republic  the Parliament and the regionaland local councils. The presence of an independent nationalelectoral commission and international observers is plannedto reassure all sides of the proper carrying out of allelectoral operations. Thus  Zaire repeats its request to theUnited Nations bodies and countries with a long history ofdemocracy for substantial help in the implementation ofthese important timetables.I should like here  on behalf of the Government of mycountry  to thank Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General of our universal Organization  who  at the request ofthe President of the Republic  sent one of his closestassistants  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  to Kinshasa to try to gatherthe political class of Zaire around the negotiating table. Weextend to him here the deep gratitude of the people of Zairefor his selflessness and readiness in his attempt to reconcilethe sons and daughters of my country.In an atmosphere of political crisis and social tension the protection of human rights becomes very difficult and issubject to suspicions. The reestablishment of State authorityand respect for the laws of the land are often identified  atbest  with constraints and  at worst  with arbitrary actions while a country cannot become involved in developmentprojects without order or collective discipline.Despite the flaws noted in the implementation of humanrights  Zaire has nevertheless made commendable effortsalong those lines by granting full freedom to the press andauthorizing the free exercise of political activities and thefree expression of opinions. It intends to follow up thesemoves by cooperating with the specialized agencies of theUnited Nations in making more effective those bodies inZaire entrusted with ensuring the strict observance of humanrights.The democratization process is irreversible in Zaire andno one is contemplating re-establishing the old order. Weall aspire to change and to the establishment of a State oflaw. What is important at the present stage of my country’sdevelopment is to know how to implement that changepeacefully. For now  we are asking the internationalcommunity and in particular those countries which wronglybelieve that they have received a mandate to administerZaire to let the Zairians themselves settle their ownproblems  for whenever they are free of foreign interferencethey always manage to overcome their antagonisms. Wetherefore urge our usual partners to help us to overcome thiscrisis instead of dividing us by canonizing some andrendering others anathema.The opportunity has thus been offered to certaincountries that call themselves champions of democracy tosupport the organization of free and transparent elections inZaire rather than to propose undemocratic plans that bringpeople to power who do not have the vote of the population which alone can confer legitimacy. That  in our view  is theonly way to rein in the excessive ambitions of certainpolitical leaders who  in their obtrusive declarations inKinshasa and the Western capitals  are harming the properunfolding of the democratization process.The international community is certainly unaware of thedishonourable treatment experienced by Zairians in theirtravel to other countries. At present  it is nearly impossiblefor a citizen of Zaire to travel to  or opt to reside in  certaincountries of the northern hemisphere  since for his visa isautomatically refused unless he reviles his country and thelegally established authorities. Is it the full enjoyment offundamental human freedoms when he cannot reside in aterritory other than his own unless he requests the status ofpolitical refugee? Are the citizens of Zaire treated this waybeing punished for their opinions? How can those countriesthat practise this policy of exclusion have a precise idea ofwhat is transpiring in Zaire when they are preventing onecategory of my fellow citizens from freely expressingthemselves and championing political ideas that run contraryto their own?The political uncertainties that have overshadowed Zairefor three years have pushed into the background theeconomic and social problems of a country in which strikes city-wide shutdowns  civil disobedience and looting havetorn asunder the economic fabric and aggravated thepeople’s poverty. Zaire - which has seen itself arbitrarilyand vexingly deprived  under the pressure of certain WesternPowers  of access to financial facilities and to bilateral andmultilateral assistance at a time when its people has thegreatest need - hopes that the new era in the offing willprovide an opportunity for all its partners to assist it torevive its collapsed economy.In this context  my countryvery much hopes to resume dialogue with the BrettonWoods institutions to improve the management of publicfinances and to promote the flourishing of free enterprise.Forty-eighth session - 11 October l993 5As everyone knows  Zaire is a subcontinent made up ofa mosaic of tribes and ethnic groups which periodically  ashappens throughout the world  have trouble living together.As we approach major political or electoral stages  tensionsexacerbated by demagogues is transformed into openconflicts that compel  often in inhuman conditions  some ofour compatriots to abandon their homes.The Government of the Republic of Zaire cannottolerate a situation in which citizens of Zaire find themselvesrefugees in their own land. Thus  more specificallyconcerning Shaba  it is not correct to speak of ""ethniccleansing""  since the Shaba  like the two Kasai  are notethnic groups but the provincial homes of several ethnicgroups. The Government has taken measures to halt allforced displacements  ensure the security of those who wishto remain in Shaba  and organize transportation of those whohave opted to leave in humanly acceptable conditions. Thistask  like that of the restoration of displaced persons to theiroriginal homes  requires enormous material and financialmeans.In cooperation with the specialized bodies of the UnitedNations and non-governmental organizations  theGovernment is working to gather all available means inorder to come to the aid of the victims of this tragedy.Here we should like to welcome the action carried out at the request of the President of the Republic  by theSecretary-General of the United Nations  who sent aspecialized inter-agency team led by Mr. Darko Silovic tostudy in the field the ways and means to bring humanitarianassistance to these disadvantaged peoples. We ferventlyhope that the international community will respondmassively and positively to the Secretary-General’s appeal and we are grateful in advance for this.Concerning the ethnic difficulties in North Kivu  it isimportant to know that this is an ancient problem born ofcolonization  which was then perpetuated by thetransplantation of Rwandese peoples to Zaire and by theinflux of refugees following the ethnic conflicts thatneighbouring country has experienced. Without lingeringover the underlying causes of this conflict  we should like toinform international opinion that the Government has takenmeasures to re-establish calm in the region and to ensure thesecurity of all parties to the conflict.An appeal to humanitarian assistance for those peopleswho have lost everything in these sad events is sent out tothe international community  the non-governmentalorganizations and Zaire’s customary partners  in light of theurgency of the situation and the paucity of our means whichdo not allow us to cope with it alone.Before concluding my statement  I should like to takeup a problem which is of the greatest concern to theinternational community and to my country in particular:environmental protection. Zaire  whose considerableexpanse of tropical humid forest gives it the symbolic statusof the planet’s second lung would appreciate theinternational community’s acknowledgement of the hugesacrifices it is making  which are depriving it of incalculablefinancial resources.The preservation of the ozone layer requires thatadditional resources be found for the implementation ofAgenda 21 and the conventions dealing with biodiversity.Thus  my country believes that its commitment not to cutdown various species of trees which it considers thecommon heritage of mankind should allow it to benefit fromcertain types of compensation which would fill this financialvacuum or at least this lack of earning power.Finally  the delegation of the Republic of Zaire joins inthe request made by numerous delegations for a restructuringof the United Nations system to allow all Member States regardless of size  fully to play their role in building a worldof justice  peace and mutually advantageous cooperation."
"35",1481,"COG",48,1993,"Like previous speakers  I would like to seek yourindulgence before I start my statement as I associate mydelegation’s voice with those who have spoken here andconvey our very profound condolences to the delegation ofIndia and to the Indian people and Government for thedisastrous earthquake which has brought death to thousands.It is a particular pleasure for me to extend toAmbassador Insanally my sincere congratulations on hiswell-deserved election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session.

Finally  my delegationwelcomes the presence among us of new States  whoseadmission to membership has strengthened the universalityof our Organization.As we do every year  we have once again reached thetime when we assess the international situation.The end of East-West confrontation  by reducingalready-existing tensions and by promoting the settlement ofcertain conflicts  has engendered great hopes for peace andcooperation. But at the same time  it has unleashed forcesthat need to be channelled in order to avoid new excesseswhich will lead to fresh tensions.""An Agenda for Peace"" - very aptly reminds us of theexistence of other serious issues threatening internationalpeace and security as well as the future of mankind  such aspoverty  the deterioration of the environment and the debtcrisis. These various evils are indeed scourges which because of the anguish and despair they generate  candestabilize many societies. Nevertheless  laudable efforts areincreasingly being made to build a new world order basednot only on democracy and development but also on theabsolute need for respect for human rights.Many countries have begun to democratize theirpolitical and social systems. These changes are accompanied40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionby difficulties and shocks  for democracy is a difficult lessonto learn  requiring a lengthy apprenticeship that is made allthe more challenging by a fragile economic and socialcontext. The confusion of certain mentalities which are illprepared for change must be added to this  as well. Here patience  good will and even the assistance of theinternational community are necessary if the worst is to beavoided.In the Congo  the democratic process has beenextremely bumpy. After the national conference which ledto a laborious period of transition  elections were organized as a result of which a Head of State  Mr. Pascal Lissouba was democratically elected by 61 per cent of the votes cast.One might then have believed that the country was embarkedupon the right course  but  alas  25 years of totalitarianregimes took their toll. Dissensions within the newparliamentary majority are about to give rise to a motion ofcensure  which is to say the very least premature - scarcelythree weeks after the formation of the first Government.After numerous vain attempts at reconciliation  thePresident of the Republic was moved to dissolve theNational Assembly to allow the sovereign people to give thecountry a clear-cut majority by which he could govern. Thisconstitutional prerogative was challenged by the oppositionparties  which further exacerbated the political crisis. Theexpress will of the President of the Republic to opt forpeaceful means  the mediation of the high command of theCongolese armed forces  as well as the good offices of thePresident of the Gabonese Republic  Mr. Omar Bongo  madeit possible for an agreement to be concluded on3 December 1992. This agreement not only enshrines theformation of a Government with a majority participation ofthe opposition - more than 60 per cent - but also entrusts thepolitical parties with organizing elections to the legislatureon an equitable basis.The first round of these elections was thus organizedlast May without any major incidents and in the presence offoreign observers  who did not fail to attest to thecorrectness of the balloting procedures. The opposition which found itself in a minority as a result of that vote systematically challenged those results  demanding that thevote be invalidated by the organ in charge of organizing theballoting  whereas Congolese electoral law states thatelectoral disputes are the purview of the Supreme Court which is the only competent jurisdiction pending the creationof a Constitutional Council.Because of certain subterfuges  clever sabotage delaying tactics and high-handed manoeuvres that ignoredthe best interests of the nation  the Congolese oppositiondeliberately infringed the institutional process which shouldlead to democracy and development. After the memorablenational conference  no one would have imagined that theCongolese would find themselves in the situation of refugeesin their own country. If the people’s right to civildisobedience would appear to be a natural outcome of theConstitution of our country  civil disobedience should not beregarded as a synonym for destruction of the social andeconomic fabric. Even if the conditions for suchdisobedience had been present  the acquisition or thelarge-scale distribution of arms and weapons of war canhardly be understood  and even less their being used for thepurposes of mass destruction and blind terrorism.Is it conceivable that  when the vote has not turned outfavourably  the streets  urban communities and innocentpeople taken hostage become pawns which are used inbargaining over political decisions? Plundering the propertyof peaceful citizens - is this something which can validatelost causes?The acts of sabotage and systematic destructionperpetrated by bands armed by the opposition last Julycaused a massive loss of human life. To this we should addconsiderable physical and material damages. Today 3 000 families - in other words approximately 15 000Congolese - are homeless and their sole refuge areclassrooms and student dormitories. Such a situation posesa serious threat to the new school year which begins in afew weeks.Of course  the Government is making tremendousefforts in order to meet the vital needs of the displacedfamilies and to reintegrate them into Congolese society.But  unfortunately  in a Republic with a ramshackleeconomy and which is financially bereft  it is impossible forthis challenge to be met. That is why the Government ofmy country appeals to the international community in orderto obtain emergency aid to assist all those Congolese whohave been deprived of their property or who have beenphysically harmed.Despite this tragic situation  which might indeed haveelicited a rigid attitude from the authorities  the Republic’sGovernment threw open the doors to negotiation. Thus once again through the mediation of President Bongo ofGabon  an agreement - the so-called Libreville Agreement -was signed in the presence of foreign observers on 4 Augustlast. This agreement  which confirmed the results of the firstround  calls for the resumption of the second round ofelections to the legislature initially boycotted by theForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 41opposition. As for the electoral dispute  it is to be decidedby an international arbitral college which is made up asfollows: two judges appointed by the Organization ofAfrican Unity  two judges appointed by the EuropeanEconomic Community  two judges appointed by the FrenchGovernment and one judge appointed by the GaboneseGovernment.The Government thus has every hope that followingupon this vote and the resolution of the electoral dispute  itwill be able to lay the definitive groundwork for a real ruleof law with the establishment of all constitutional organs.This is the situation in the Congo today. I would liketo take this opportunity to thank all those countries and allthose agencies which have been kind enough to help theCongolese people resolve a crisis which seriously threatenspeace in the country and which could erode national unityand compromise the future of the democratic process itself.The Congolese Government would like to reiterate here through me  its commitment to abide by the decision of thearbitral college and the verdict of the ballot boxes.The Congo is going through a very difficult stage. Thedesperate state of its economy and its social fabric has ledthe Government to undertake economic reforms. Thesereforms have so far been unfortunately frustrated by politicaland social instability. These reforms deal  inter alia  withrestructuring the State productive sector by the total orpartial withdrawal of the State  the financing of economicrecovery  the reorganization and renegotiation of the externaldebt and finally the defrayment of the social costs of thisadjustment.If they are to bear fruit  these efforts and the sacrificesthey will entail must be sustained by financial aid  otherwisethe Congo will remain mired in poverty and instability.Far from being unique  the critical economic and socialsituation in Congo is but one illustration of a crisis thataffects almost all African countries and many developingcountries. Thus  to the political factors involved we mustadd major economic and social challenges. It is quite clearthat poverty threatens the cohesiveness of States and bringsabout profound imbalances in the developing countries endangering the very foundation of human rights. But thereis one basic human right that continues to have pride ofplace: the right to development. Despite the numerous stepstaken to date  the developing countries remain weighed downby the heavy burden of debt  and the increasing cost ofservicing that debt is becoming unbearable for economieswhich are already in great trouble.My delegation believes that resolving the foreign-debtcrisis requires bold steps. Nevertheless  we are very muchaware of all those efforts which are contributing to thesettlement of that crisis. That is why we greatly appreciatethe expression of solidarity from the French Government which decided last year in Libreville partially to cancel thedebt of medium-income countries  including the Congo.After many initiatives which proved ineffective  theinternational community must finally give priority to growthand development in the poor countries by building  on theruins of the former East-West order  a new order based onmore dynamic and more innovative North-South relationsthat would promote attainment of the objectives of theInternational Development Strategy enshrined in this body.This Strategy should receive all the support necessary topromote the creation of an international trade system that isboth open and non-discriminatory  with the successfuloutcome of the negotiations of the Uruguay Round; toencourage the conclusion of specific agreements to readjustcommodity prices; and  finally  to find lasting solutions tothe external-debt crisis.It is acknowledged that improving the situation inAfrica necessarily involves economic reform. Nevertheless efforts undertaken nationally  subregionally and regionallyhave unfortunately not enjoyed the international supportexpected. The adoption of the New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s signified the failure ofthe United Nations Programme of Action for AfricanEconomic Recovery and Development. Unfortunately  wecannot but conclude that so far  this new developmentprogramme has fallen far short of expectations.That being the case  my delegation welcomes thedecision taken by the Japanese Government to convene  incooperation with the United Nations and the GlobalCoalition for Africa  on 5 and 6 October next in Tokyo anInternational Conference on African Development  and wevoice the hope that this Conference will lead to concretemeasures.The economic crisis which besets our countries isparticularly damaging to young people. Juveniledelinquency  illicit drug trafficking  drug abuse and AIDSare all serious threats to our societies. It is essential thatthey be given close attention. In this connection  moresolidarity should be displayed in order to eradicate thesescourges.My delegation supports the conclusions reached by themost recent session of the Economic and Social Council on42 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionefforts to combat malaria  dysentery and  particularly cholera. The United Nations system must attach a highpriority to Africa  taking into account the seriousconsequences these scourges have for developmentprogrammes.There can be lasting economic and social developmentonly in a healthy environment. The results reached by theRio Conference  enshrined in Agenda 21  are extremelyheartening. They undoubtedly reflect a global consensus aswell as a political commitment at the highest level tocooperation for the purposes of development and theenvironment. But the key to their success resides in thefinancial resources made available.Today  more than ever before  the increase in naturaldisasters is a matter of concern to us all. That is why mydelegation welcomes the Japanese Government’s offer tohost  in 1994  a World Conference on Natural DisasterReduction  which will deal with the various dangers thesedisasters entail and identify the necessary guidelines underwhich they can be taken into account by the United Nationsin its development projects.Since we have boldly struck out on the path to buildinga State of law  my Government supports the internationalcommunity’s action to promote and develop human rights.That is why we welcome the results of the WorldConference on Human Rights  held last June in Vienna  andreiterate our appeal to fund-raisers to help finance thevarious action programmes which were drawn up in thatcontext.The current session has started at a time when thepersistence of local conflicts and the resurgence of hotbedsof tension are a daily concern of our Organization in itsmission to build and preserve peace. Nevertheless  althoughwe can welcome the favourable developments in certainsituations  it must be recognized that a large number of themremain subjects of grave concern.Among the former  we have the situation in SouthAfrica. A number of factors today indicate that theabhorrent system of apartheid will inevitably be eradicated even if tensions are still rife and there are still scenes ofviolence. The process of democratization in South Africacan no longer be in question. The fact that 27 April 1994has been fixed for the first multiracial elections is proof ofthis. My delegation gives their due value to the effortswhich have been constantly made by the South AfricanGovernment to eradicate apartheid and to democratize thecountry. Furthermore  we support the request for the liftingof sanctions formulated by Nelson Mandela.My Government believes that peace in Somalia can berestored only if Security Council resolutions 751 (1992)  794(1992) and 814 (1993) are implemented  resolutions which inter alia  call for the organization of a reconciliationconference and a national-unity conference.Turning to the question of Angola  we regret to notethat the refusal of UNITA to accept the result of the votingand the free choice of a sovereign people has once againplunged the country into hostilities  further complicating notonly the process of democratization that had been embarkedupon but also the peace negotiations which are currentlytaking place under the aegis of the United Nations. Mydelegation welcomes the adoption by the Security Council ofresolutions 851 (1993) and 864 (1993) and supports recentinitiatives by the King of Morocco  the President of Côted’Ivoire and the President of the African National Congress.The agreement recently reached between theGovernment of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Frontgives us reason to hope that an era of peace will come tothat country  contributing to the strengthening of the basesof national unity. We hope that the Rwandese people  afterrecovering peace and unity  will be able to get down to thedifficult task of rebuilding their country.Regarding the cases of Liberia  Mozambique andWestern Sahara  in which my delegation fully and firmlysupports initiatives of the United Nations  we call upon theparties to the conflicts to have recourse to negotiation  todialogue and to other peaceful means in order to restorepeace and security in that area.The Washington Agreement of 13 September 1993represents a decisive turning-point towards settlement of thePalestinian problem  and it will contribute to animprovement of the situation in the Middle East. Thesigning of this agreement promises a new era of peace andcooperation for the peoples of that region.Nor can we fail to commend the very fortunateoutcome of the situation in Cambodia  where elections organized under the auspices of the United Nations  led tothe creation of a government of national unity.Despite the involvement of the United Nations  thesituation in the former Yugoslavia has not basically changed.My country supports all the initiatives taken by the UnitedNations - in particular  those that encourage dialogue andForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 43negotiation - with a view to ensuring the success of the talksin Geneva.As in the past  the process of the peaceful reunificationof the Korean peninsula enjoys the support of my delegationand my Government.It is very pleasing to note that considerable progress hasbeen made in the process of disarmament and the control ofarmaments. Unfortunately  the danger of war has not yetbeen eliminated  as there still exist a number of arsenals ofweapons of mass destruction - in particular  nuclearweapons. For this reason my Government will continue toappeal urgently for general and complete disarmament.Peace and development are complementary. Eachdepends on the other. Thus  the promotion of confidenceand security  which are the prerequisites for the achievementof development targets  is becoming a new priority in Africa.Aware of this  the members of the Economic Community ofCentral African States  with the assistance of the UnitedNations  are now addressing themselves to progressiveimplementation of the work programme of the StandingAdvisory Committee on Security Questions in CentralAfrica  which was adopted by the General Assembly lastyear. That Committee  which adopted a draft non-aggressionpact following its third meeting  held in Libreville  will holdits fourth meeting in Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo.This indicates the political commitment of the States ofCentral Africa to the creation of a system of collectivesecurity through the promotion of confidence  security anddevelopment. These actions of the States of Central Africamust be seen as part and parcel of the machinery for theprevention  management and settlement of conflicts that wasset up at the most recent Summit of Heads of State andGovernment of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) which was held in Cairo in June of this year. Theinternational community - particularly the United Nations -should give these initiatives the support that is necessary iftheir noble objectives are to be accomplished.In recent years the United Nations has been workingvery positively on a number of fronts. Its efforts have lentit undoubted authority  especially in the settlement ofconflicts and in the shaping of the new order  whichmankind hopes will be more democratic and will generateprosperity for all. Nevertheless  there is now a pressingneed to restructure the United Nations. This is especiallytrue with regard to the question of enlargement of theSecurity Council and an increase in the number of itspermanent members. Such a reform would tend to increasethe effectiveness of that vital body  which is responsible forthe maintenance of international peace and security. This isone of the fundamental aspects of the necessary process ofdemocratizing international relations.The Government of the Republic of Congo attachesmajor importance to strengthening the role of the UnitedNations  as well as to increasing respect for the principles ofthe Charter  which is a sine qua non for the advent of a neworder based on justice for all  peace  prosperity andinternational solidarity."
"36",1528,"COL",48,1993,"Nearly all those who stand at this rostrumrepresent the dreams of their countrymen. Many who cometo this Hall bring with them the hopes of their peoples which have been shattered by violence  intolerance selfishness or misunderstanding. But all  without exception bring with them their own vision of the world; the sum ofthose visions will provide a model for the world in whichwe live and die and in which our children will live andgrow. It is therefore a great honour for me to address oncemore so many men and women of all origins and alldestinies. The world listens expectantly to what we sayhere  for the world has confidence and faith in thecommitment of the United Nations to action on behalf of abetter future for all mankind.Today  as we begin this session  I believe that those ofus who have worked for the triumph of peace anddemocracy are living at a crucial moment. Without doubt there is room for optimism  but our work is far from done.The end of bipolarism has not by itself brought thefeeling that peace  progress and justice are now nearer ormore possible. While bloc confrontation has disappeared we are seeing the resurgence of harsh ancient nationalismsand fanaticisms that threaten peace and stability  and thepresence of extreme poverty and social injustice in themajority of the world’s countries.Even as we meet here  thousands are dying  victims ofracism  xenophobia  fratricidal wars  hatreds which have fedon themselves for centuries  territorial disputes  or the simpleand terrible inability of mankind to provide everyone withthat which all are promised: freedom and equal opportunity.At the same time  we feel increasing pain at thesituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina  and in areas of Africa in many Eastern European nations and in other parts of theworld.During this session we will also hear of hopes and ofdreams of peace and reconciliation that until now seemedimpossible. I speak  for example  of the gradual abolition ofracial segregation in South Africa. I point also to the factthat rivals like Israel and the Palestinian LiberationOrganization have had the courage to declare mutualrecognition and respect. That Yitzhak Rabin andYasser Arafat can negotiate with courage and fortitude amidst their own memories of war  proves that when historyis written  the greatness of the human spirit can flourish andprevail.Although we know that the road ahead is still long anddifficult  the Israelis and the Palestinians have therecognition and support of the international community fortheir efforts to find peace. The agreements reached arefurther proof that the political will to reconcile is capable ofhealing even the deepest wounds.Much of the history of the twentieth century has beenwritten with the blood of victims of war  religious disputesor blind quests for power. Too much history has alreadybeen written by tyrants.The builders of the twenty-first century must be men ofpeace and work rather than of violence. The arms they useto build the future must not be cannons and bullets  butrather the wisdom  ingenuity and vision of men of initiative.Political activity  with its great capacity to transformreality  has in a few short years generated far-reachingchanges in the former Soviet Union  Central and EasternEurope  the Middle East and my own region  Latin America.Never before have so many millions of people around theworld enjoyed freedom.We Colombians  for example  have in just a few yearsachieved significant political  economic and social changesaimed at developing a new democratic century that is moreopen  more participatory  more pluralistic  moredecentralized and more just.Our new Constitution was conceived with theparticipation of all sectors of public opinion  includingex-guerrillas  indigenous people  industrialists  human-rightsactivists  environmentalists and millions of ordinary citizens.Our 1991 Constitution is the navigational chart of a newColombia heading for the next millennium.On the economic front  we have replaced our old modelof a closed economy with an open one  in which externalmarkets have to become  increasingly  the engines of growth.We are integrating our economy with the world and arehence demanding that other nations open their markets toour products. We are advocates of free enterprise  economicintegration and free trade. The results have been verysatisfactory: we have diversified and increased our exports significantly lowered inflation  reduced unemployment andincreased economic growth.On the social front  we have substantially increasedpublic resources available for financing new programmes ofinvestment in our people. With this effort we shall doubleour present per capita income by the beginning of the nextdecade. By that time life expectancy in Colombia will besimilar to that of many industrialized countries. Ourilliteracy rate will be less than 3 per cent and our infantmortality rate will be lower than 18 deaths per thousandbirths.In Colombia we understand that political democracymust go hand in hand with economic opportunity  becausea lasting true democracy can be achieved only througheconomic development and social justice. It would bedifficult  after all  for people who had fought so hard forfreedom to find that the tough road to democracy led topoverty  marginalization or social stagnation. Politicalfreedom with economic opportunity: this is now thedefinition of democracy.The developing world has placed its hopes ininternational trade as the instrument to create prosperity forall. In a global economy it is impossible to achieve socialwell-being without economic freedom  competition productivity  efficiency and growth.Perhaps we now have  more than ever before  theconditions for an unprecedented increase in the flow ofgoods  services  technology and knowledge between theindustrialized countries and the developing countries and therefore  for economic growth and the creation ofemployment and social well-being for all.For these reasons  this hemisphere’s liberalizationprocesses  such as the North American Free TradeAgreement (NAFTA)  the Andean Group  the Group ofThree  the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR)and the integration of Central America and the Caribbean are not just integrative trade agreements  but also representreal remedies for poverty.I wish to stress the importance of NAFTA as a decisivestep in the right direction to liberalize trade relations  to ourmutual benefit  between north and south. It is time to leavebehind outdated fears and commit ourselves to a relationshipthat will undoubtedly result in stronger economic growth andhundreds of thousands of new jobs for all. Those of us whoare supporters of an integrated  open and dynamichemispheric economy fully support the visionary efforts ofPresident Bill Clinton to achieve final approval of this treaty.And on a global scale it is critical to conclude theUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) successfully. This will be possible only if wetruly respect the multilateral character of that organization.It cannot be a matter of the most powerful agreeing amongthemselves about what is in their own interests. We hopefor the conclusion of the Uruguay Round  but not at anycost. We seek effective solutions to address the concerns ofthe least developed countries  with emphasis on dismantlingagricultural protectionism.We are deeply concerned that the attitude of many ofthe principal actors in the global economy has come toresemble dangerously that of another era  the years beforethe Second World War  when nations isolated themselveswithin their borders and produced goods for captivedomestic markets.Defending at any cost the selfish interests of privilegedrural minorities in the industrialized countries takes bread offthe tables of millions of poor peasants who only want theright to compete on an equal footing. That selfish attitudeis the greatest cause of poverty in the poor countries.We live in a world where frontiers between nationsought to be seen as points of convergence  not of division;where cries for independence should be replaced by showsof interdependence; where  for many developing nations  theeuphoria of political change has passed and what is neededis economic growth and the creation of jobs.Protectionism and isolationism belong to outdated perverse rhetoric. Do we really want to live in a worldturned upside down  where the largest and strongesteconomies deny the smallest ones the right to compete  orwhere the origin of goods and services is more importantthan their quality or value?The world must see that open markets and free trade areperhaps the best hope for serving the collective interests ofboth north and south  not simply favours graciously grantedto the developing world by the industrialized world. Freetrade is truly good business for everyone.The economies of the developed world are made up forthe most part of mature markets that have alreadyexperienced their greatest periods of expansion. The short-sightedness of protectionism lies in its ignoring the growthpotential represented by investment in and trade with nationsthat represent the future of the world’s economy.As President of Colombia  I want to reaffirm mynation’s commitment to the defence of free trade  for wehave invested in it our hopes for development andwell-being. So  too  we see in free trade the bestcontribution that the industrialized world can make toconsolidating democracy and freedom in developingcountries. Colombia is asking for free trade  not economicaid; the opening of markets  not mere assistance;competition  not insurmountable barriers.From its inception  the United Nations has had the dualmission of maintaining international peace and security andof promoting the social and economic development of allpeoples of the world. Even though we have been successfulin advancing collective global security  we cannot say thesame as concerns the areas of social welfare and economicdevelopment. Today  I call upon the internationalcommunity to achieve  with courage and dedication  anagenda for development. Only then will the goal of a lastingand stable peace be reached  for without social justice  peacecannot be permanent.I should like also to mention Colombia’s renewedcommitment to three issues of great global importance: thedefence and promotion of human rights  the fight againstorganized crime and the preservation of the environment.In Colombia  we have made a major and successfuleffort to create a culture that promotes  respects and defendshuman rights. Today  we have the institutional foundationsto ensure that Colombia’s society will overcome humanrights violations. The efforts to strengthen Colombia’sjudicial system has borne fruit. We are defeating impunity.In our fight against international organized crime  whichprofits from narcotics trafficking  terrorism money-laundering  arms trafficking  the flow of illegalchemicals and various forms of corruption  my country manyyears ago took a clear decision: Colombia will not rest untilthese criminals activities are wiped from the face of ourland.Innocent Colombians are continuing to lose their livesin the fight against evil multinationals. My deepestconvictions and my respect for the memory of so manycountrymen who have sacrificed their lives compel me tocall once again on all nations to contribute to the solution ofa problem that is global in its scope.My people’s brave efforts alone - or nearly so - cannotput an end to international organized crime; this will requiredetermined action with courage and political will  on the partof many more nations. We cannot counter sophisticatedinternational organized crime by simply developing nationalor bilateral strategies. We require a comprehensive multilateral effort that focuses on legislative cooperation;coordinated initiatives; the exchange of intelligenceinformation; a sufficient commitment of financial and humanresources; cooperation in the judicial field; and  perhapsmost important  strong political will.To this end  we will participate with great interest inthe high-level meeting that  on our initiative  will soon takeplace during this plenary session. Its main purpose will beto review the global strategy against the plague of narcoticstrafficking  with a view to seeking coordination of concretemeasures  the renewal of specific commitments and  finally the strengthening of the decision to continue with this jointstruggle.With regard to the preservation of the environment Colombia is fully aware of the importance of its magnificent varied and sometimes fragile ecosystems and of itsbiodiversity. Accordingly  we have adopted institutionalchanges that will allow us to fulfil in its entirety acommitment that stems not only from our Constitution butalso from our collective conscience and our stewardship ofa treasure we shall not squander.Colombia supports sustainable development  respectsthe terms of the agreements reached at the Earth Summit andis working with its neighbours  with other nations and itsown communities to devise strategies that will allow it bothto benefit from and to preserve its natural resources.I wish to conclude by congratulating the President ofthe General Assembly  the Ambassador of Guyana  Mr.Samuel Insanally  an outstanding representative of myregion. We also welcome the new States Members of theUnited Nations. On behalf of Colombia  we welcome themto this universal fraternity  which is enhanced by theirpresence.At the same time  I want publicly to express mycountry’s satisfaction at having coordinated the work of theGroup of 77 this year. Thanks to the collaboration andharmony that prevailed among all its members  we madeimportant advances in defence of the interests of thedeveloping world.But the satisfaction of seeing the United Nationsstrengthened each year by the presence of new Membersshould not hinder us from reaffirming Colombia’s positionin favour of the restructuring of this Organization  especiallywith regard to reforming the Security Council and toredefining the relationship between the General Assemblyand the Security Council. We hope that in this respect anopen and a democratic and multilateral debate will takeplace.I have come here today to ask a question that has beenon the minds of all peoples  in all parts of the world  whohave been on the side of the revolution of freedom: whyhave so many millions of people in the former Soviet Union in Central and Eastern Europe  and in countries throughoutAsia  Africa and Latin America fought so hard? What is itthat so many hoped to achieve by taking  at the cost ofimmense sacrifices  the road to democracy and its freedoms?I believe that the only answer is that they have seen  forthe first time  the possibility of transforming these dreamsinto realities. And they have taken that road because theywant to a leave a legacy of freedom to their children and tofuture generations.With the help of God and our strong solidarity  we arecertain that they will prevail."
"37",1569,"COM",48,1993,"In addressing this Assembly for the first time  Iam pleased to extend to you  Sir  the congratulations of thedelegation of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros which I have the honour to head  on your outstandingelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsforty-eighth session. In our view  your moral andintellectual qualities and your extensive experience ininternational affairs are clear guarantees of the success ofour work. I assure you that my delegation is fully preparedto assist you as you undertake your noble mission.I should like to join those representatives who havecongratulated your predecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev ofBulgaria  on his effective leadership of the Assembly duringits forty-seventh session.Let me take this opportunity also to express a warmwelcome to the new States Members of the Organization.The multifaceted action of the United Nations over thenumerous years of its existence has given us a trueappreciation of the institution’s major role  as well as of theworth of the men who  during that time  have borne theresponsibility for it. This is why my delegation expressessatisfaction at seeing Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the headof the Organization. We pay a resounding tribute to him forhis dedication and determination to work for peace and thewell-being of mankind.Forty-eight years after its creation  and despite aparticularly difficult international situation  our Organizationis still struggling to discharge properly the lofty and onerousmission entrusted to it. Equally  with the passage of time its activity has escalated and become more diversified.Unfortunately  we are today obliged to note that the UnitedNations is increasingly confronted by enormous financialdifficulties  which hamper its proper functioning. Thefinancial crisis that it is experiencing stems primarily fromthe crushing imbalance between its various tasks and itsscanty financial means.Thus  in the area of peace-keeping  the United Nationsis responsible for numerous rather costly operations  while in several regions of the world  hotbeds of tension andincreasing instability seem to presage other difficultsituations that are likely to transcend the boundaries of theOrganization’s ordinary or traditional role. The task is huge and we must not remain passive in the face of suchsuffering. It is therefore up to all Member States tocontribute effectively to securing an improvement in theOrganization’s peace-keeping system.While  within the framework of the work of this forty-eighth session  we are still reviewing a multitude ofproblems to which we must find solutions  let us recognizethat the session does have the advantage of being held at atime when  for the first time in more than 40 years  we areseeing encouraging and promising results with regard to thedevelopments in respect of the problem of Palestine.The Government of the Comoros would like  throughme  to congratulate the signatories of the Washingtonagreement. It provides grounds for hope that this mutualrecognition and the autonomy of certain territories representan unquestionable guarantee of the establishment of asovereign and independent Palestinian State  so that this partof the world  which for so long has been disrupted by war can finally experience peace and stability. We pay a well-deserved tribute to the Chairman of the Palestine LiberationOrganization for his perseverance in defending the rights ofthe brotherly Palestinian people  whose just struggle we havealways supported.In the same context  my country has great hopes for thenegotiations between the South African authorities and therepresentatives of the black majority. My country sincerelyhopes that these negotiations will culminate in theestablishment of a truly united  multiracial and democraticSouth African society.It is clear that action by the various United Nationsauthorities has made a considerable contribution tostrengthening the credibility of our Organization and theconfidence the international community has in it. On theother hand  the rebirth of democracy in Eastern Europe  theopening up of Africa to a multiparty system and therelaxation of tensions among the super-Powers are alsofactors which should give us hope for a better world. Buthow can we not be concerned or doubtful when in someparts of the world there are still hotbeds of tension andfratricidal wars? In fact  the deterioration of the situation inSomalia  with all its consequences  in particular the massdisplacement of the population and the murder of those whoare defending peace  calls for ever greater vigilance andsolidarity on our part. It is time for the internationalcommunity to take effective action with a view to theholding of a conference of national reconciliation to put anend to this war. It is also crucial that States andinternational organizations continue to render their valuableassistance to these peoples  who are in dire need.With regard to Africa  I am concerned about ourneighbours in Mozambique  in Angola  in Liberia and in allof these countries where human dignity and conscience arebeing jeopardized  where  unfortunately  dialogue is yieldingto force and violence. The Federal Islamic Republic of theComoros is launching a fraternal appeal to these countries toconsider the consequences of these wars for the future oftheir peoples and of Africa as a whole  and hopes that reasonwill finally prevail.Moreover  we are still deeply concerned at the presentsituation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Theexternal aggression perpetrated against this independent andsovereign State requires that our Organization  and inparticular the Security Council  the major organ responsiblefor the maintenance of peace  take the necessary action tosave that country. We fully support the resolutions of theSecurity Council concerning this problem  in particularresolution 859 (1993)  in which it called""for an immediate cease-fire and cessation of hostilitiesthroughout the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina asessential for achieving a just and equitable politicalsolution to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovinathrough peaceful negotiations"".On the other hand  the Federal Islamic Republic of theComoros is supporting the efforts of our Organization to finda lasting solution to the Korean problem. My country urgesthe parties involved to implement measures to facilitate thereunification of this country  whose people have suffered forso long from being divided.Environmental problems are a concern of theinternational community  which is aware of the adverseconsequences of the destruction of the ozone layer and thedeterioration of the ecological milieu. It is in this spirit thatour States are adopting strategies and policies aimed atsafeguarding the environment. Convinced that one cannotseparate the environment from development  ourGovernments must establish procedures and devise nationalframeworks which will give priority to sustainabledevelopment  in accordance with the recommendations of theRio Conference. Along these lines  the Federal IslamicRepublic of the Comoros  with a view to combating theproblems of pollution  deforestation and the destruction ofnatural species  has given priority in its development plan tothe preservation of the environment and its natural resources.Another area to which we should devote specificinterest is that of human rights. By the adoption of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights in December 1948 the international community  through the General Assemblyof our Organization  for the first time in the history ofmankind  shouldered the permanent responsibility ofpublicizing and championing human rights. Today morethan ever before  we continue to have confidence in ourOrganization  which has always known how to stress theconcept of fundamental human rights and freedoms and hasmade ensuring them one of its fundamental goals. It istherefore important for the United Nations to give priority tohuman rights programmes. There is also a need  within theframework of national policy  to implement and createinstitutional conditions that would guarantee respect forhuman dignity.The World Conference on Human Rights  held recentlyin Vienna  Austria  allowed the international community toForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 3reaffirm its unswerving dedication to respect for inalienablehuman rights. However  it is our Organization that must seeto the implementation of the Vienna recommendations.We cannot separate the concept of human rights fromthe concept of democracy  for we cannot conceive of ademocracy that would ignore or fail to guarantee humanrights and freedoms. This is why our Organization shouldshow particular interest in the changes taking placethroughout the world  changes which are  inter alia  reflectedin the collapse of dictatorships and the emergence ofdemocratic political regimes. The United Nations mustencourage and support actions aimed at advancing thedemocratic process.As members are aware  the wind of freedom anddemocracy that has wafted through the world has spared nocontinent. Thus  in the Federal Islamic Republic of theComoros  the time has come for democracy and a multipartysystem. We have engaged in a revision of our Constitutionin order to adapt it to the realities of today’s world  with theactive participation of all national political movements. Weare moving towards legislative and regional elections to givethe country all the institutions required by a State of law.You will agree with me  Mr. President  that thistransitional stage of our young democracy is difficult. Weare  however  aware that it must be passed through in orderto achieve a harmonization of the democratic process as awhole. The Government of the Islamic Federal Republic ofthe Comoros  concerned for the well-being of its people  issparing no effort to create conditions which promote respectfor human dignity and the maintenance of political andsocial stability in the country.Such an undertaking requires the assistance of peace-and progress-loving countries and organizations  to help ourcountry effectively manage these freedoms  and to place ouryoung democracy on a solid foundation.We cannot close this political chapter without recallinganother problem  a non-violent one  certainly but no lessimportant: that of the Comorian island of Mayotte. Thisquestion will be the subject of a debate in the Assembly  asit is at each of our regular sessions. That is why I will sparethe Assembly a list of the facts behind this thorny issue.But I express again the full readiness of the Government ofHis ExcellencyMr. Said Mohamed Djohar and the Comorian people to givethe highest priority to dialogue and concerted action toresolve this regrettable dispute which we have had withFrance since we attained our sovereignty.There is no need to emphasize that the newinternational political landscape at the end of the centurymakes the interdependence of peoples and the solidarity ofnations the irreplaceable and only means by which we canguarantee the economic and social development of ourStates.Unfortunately  international economic relations are stillmarked by the bipolar attitude responsible for the growinggap between rich and poor countries. We must now changethis attitude - an outcome of the cold war - as a result ofwhich the rich have been becoming even richer and the pooreven poorer  and create harmonious conditions for globaleconomic relations. We believe in the ideals of peace andsecurity  but we are firmly convinced that they cannot befully achieved if famine  malnutrition  disease and naturaldisasters continue to be the lot of the majority of the Stateswhich make up the international community.The future of the developing countries continues to bea priority of the various specialized institutions of ourOrganization  but the failure of various developmentprogrammes and strategies initiated in our respectivecountries is no secret. That fact compels us to give thoughttogether to ways and means to relaunch a different type ofdevelopment  of which our Organization must be thecatalyst.The advent of a new economic world order is morelikely today than yesterday  despite a crisis that is weakeningthe financial Powers  de facto reducing their capacity to givedevelopment assistance. We understand the new obligationsof the big Powers  faced with unemployment  reducedproductivity and the need to support the new States born ofthe fragmentation of the eastern bloc. But it is up to themto give a new impetus to vertical cooperation  in order toenable the countries of the South to extricate themselvesfrom chaos.In that spirit  the developing countries have indeedlearned the lesson that they must rely on themselves first andforemost. This is why  from Africa to the Orient  structuresare emerging whose objective is to assure regional economicintegration. The establishment of the African EconomicCommunity will meet Africa’s need for an instrument forfunctional cooperation which can harmonize developmentand cooperation between the States of this continent  thebreadbasket of the world.For the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros cooperation with the developing countries is an essentialelement in such cooperative relations. My country is one ofthose which are convinced that South-South cooperation can4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionbe an important factor in rebalancing world economicrelations.In its continuous development efforts the IslamicFederal Republic of the Comoros is focusing on freeing andrestructuring development support institutions. In the spiritof this impetus towards socio-economic recovery  we haveagreed with the International Monetary Fund and the WorldBank on a structural adjustment programme whose successdepends on the full and active support of the internationalcommunity.As the century draws to a close  the world isexperiencing profound changes in the ideological  political economic  social  scientific and technical spheres. Theproblems it is facing require consideration at the global levelfrom now on. International solidarity compels us to act ingreater cooperation in managing world affairs.We have the instrument for this: the United Nations.But we are among those who believe that if it is to be moreeffective the Organization and its specialized agencies mustbe transformed to adapt to the tremendous democraticdynamism of the new international system. In order to givethe United Nations the political power for real decision-making  the Security Council must genuinely represent theworld as it is today."
"38",1608,"CPV",48,1993,"I should like tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of thissession of the General Assembly. Your well-known skillsand your vast knowledge of the United Nations augur wellfor the success of the session’s work.I should like to pay a tribute to your predecessor asPresident  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  former Foreign Minister ofBulgaria  for work well done.I should also like to express my appreciation to theSecretary-General for the dynamism he has brought toUnited Nations activities  for his constant efforts tocontribute to the betterment of the Organization and for hispersonal commitment to reforming the Secretariat structuresand improving the Organization’s efficiency in the dischargeof its functions and duties.We live in a time of great hopes. The political eventsof the recent past have greatly facilitated adherence todemocratic values  while at the same time they havecontributed to the world movement in favour of respect forhuman rights and have promoted the world’s awareness ofthe necessity for urgent measures to improve the livingconditions of all peoples as well as the planet’s environment.Indeed  in a short period of time a substantial numberof countries have  against all odds  attained theirindependence and recovered their freedom. The ideologicalconfrontation of the past has been replaced by politicalcooperation between countries  and conflicts with a longhistory  such as the struggle against apartheid and thesituation in the Middle East  seem finally to be close to anegotiated solution. On the other hand  democracy  as adesirable system of government  has gained anunprecedented dimension and support  although muchremains to be done to consolidate it.These are indeed political developments of the greatestimportance that shape and at the same time are the result ofa world in profound transformation. That transformationbodes well for a more stable future in the relations betweennations and peoples. While on the one hand these changesaugur well for a better  more humane and more just and stable world  they have  on the other hand  beenaccompanied by the resurgence of many conflicts  most ofthem of an internal nature. Indeed  in many regions of theworld  especially in Europe and in Africa  ancient ethnicrivalries or internal struggles for power have turned intoopen conflicts  leaving a trail of death and destruction spawning millions of refugees and displaced persons andgiving rise to regional instability.I have been witnessing with deep concern thedevelopment of many of these conflicts in Africa  whichhave a negative impact not only on the countries involvedbut on the entire region. At a time when all our efforts andresources should be put to good use to assist thedevelopment of our countries and continent and to createbetter living conditions for our peoples  we have come torealize that the scarce resources that we still have in ourcountries are wasted on the fire of armed conflicts  and thefew economic structures that were left are being sacrificedto violence.The armed conflicts that appear to proliferate almosteverywhere seem to elude the efforts of the United Nations.In most of these conflicts  the world has been faced withtremendous difficulties in containing and managing them notwithstanding the constant efforts of the Security Counciland the Secretary General.Such is the case of the conflict in Angola  a sistercountry whose suffering people have for more than 30 yearsendured the horrors of war  the anxiety of constant instabilityand the uncertainty of the future. Despite the enormousefforts made  especially by the United Nations  the conflictin Angola continues to cause death and the destruction of thecountry. The international community had placed greathopes in the elections of September last year that weresupervised by this Organization. We all expected that thoseelections would be the last step in a peace process thatwould finally put an end to decades of destruction and givebirth to a new and democratic Angola  thus creating theclimate of political and social harmony in the country somuch needed for its development.Instead  the events that followed the elections have beenregrettably translated into a violent and tragic situationknown to the whole world  a situation which is a cause ofdeep concern to us all and in which many thousands of livesare being lost  while the suffering of the population that haslasted so long continues and the destruction of cities and theeconomic infrastructure goes on. Unfortunately  the repeatedmediation efforts of the United Nations and other forumsand entities  geared towards obtaining a cease-fire and theresumption of the Bicesse process  have so far not attainedthe expected results.There should be no illusions  for  as the long history ofthis conflict has abundantly demonstrated  no military victorycan guarantee lasting peace and stability and the prosperityof the country. I do not envisage any alternative tonegotiations if peace is to prevail as a goal to be achievedby all in Angola. The use of violent means following theelections cannot be justified and  indeed  shows blatantdisregard for the sovereign will of the people  which wasexpressed freely and fairly  as certified by the internationalcommunity.I sincerely hope that  worn out by a protracted anddevastating war  faced with a country whose economicstructure has been destroyed and touched by the social andhuman drama caused by the hostilities  the parties to theconflict  especially UNITA  will rise to the moment and moved by political realism  lend the negotiations the much-needed political will and seriousness  thereby demonstratingthe magnanimity that the security and the well-being of theAngolan people require.The Angolan experience is a lesson that should be takeninto consideration by the Organization in managing orassisting in the management of other conflicts. One suchcase is the conflict in Mozambique  a country to which CapeVerde is linked by fraternal ties. My country  as a memberof the Security Council  has been following the situation inMozambique very closely and with particular interest. Aftermany years of war  peace seems finally to prevail in thatcountry. The General Peace Agreements concluded last yeardefined the framework for the attainment of final and lastingpeace. I therefore ascribe the utmost importance to theobservance and timely implementation of these Agreementsby both parties. It is a moral duty to the people ofMozambique  who are still going through the hardships ofday-to-day life and who legitimately aspire to a future ofpeace  harmony and progress  that these Agreements berespected and abided by.The positive steps taken lately in this regard give megrounds for hope. In this context  I consider particularlyimportant the dialogue that has started between the Presidentof the Republic of Mozambique  Mr. Joaquim Chissano andthe President of RENAMO  Mr. Afonso Dhlakama. I hopethat that dialogue will continue on a regular basis with aview to facilitating the removal of obstacles that might ariseduring the implementation of the peace agreements  so as toenable the elections to take place on the scheduled date. Iappeal to both parties to exert all their efforts with a view toForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 3expediting the implementation of key aspects of theAgreements before the elections  namely  the demobilizationand the cantonment of troops and the formation of thenational army of Mozambique.I should also like to refer to the conflict in Liberia which has been the focus of the attention of the countries ofthe West African subregion to which my own countrybelongs.The conflict in Liberia has caused much destruction andthe loss of thousands of lives  and has inflicted enormouspain and suffering on the population. It has been a sourceof constant concern to the countries of our subregion. TheCotonou Agreement  a decisive step in the quest for a lastingpeaceful solution to the conflict  is the result of theinternational community’s commendable efforts to establishpeace in Liberia  efforts in which the Economic Communityof West African States (ECOWAS) played a pivotal role.The recent Security Council decision to deploy anObserver Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) to assist  incoordination with the forces of the ECOWAS MilitaryObserver Group  in the implementation of the CotonouAgreement is an appropriate and commendable one. Iappeal to all the parties involved to abide by theirobligations and cooperate with the United Nations andECOWAS in order to secure the timely implementation ofthe peace agreement and the holding of the legislative andpresidential elections on the scheduled date at the beginningof next year.The situation in Somalia is one of the most tragicconflicts of modern times. This tragedy has resulted in theloss of hundreds of thousands of lives and in thedisintegration of the country’s civil society andadministrative structures. The Security Council’s timelydecision to involve the United Nations in the management ofthe conflict and the humanitarian action of variousorganizations and entities have changed the situation inSomalia and created the conditions for the return ofnormalcy to the country.I commend the internationalist and humanitarian role ofthe United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM)  whosepresence there has contributed much to eliminating famine re-establishing order and guaranteeing the security of thepopulation  despite the condemnable and deliberate attacksto which the Operation has been subjected.It is imperative that immediate efforts be made  inaccordance with the last decision of the Security Council  toaccelerate the process of consultations and contacts with allthe parties and forces in Somalia  with a view to creating aclimate of security there and bringing political harmony andadministrative normalcy to the country.On a more positive note  it is encouraging to see theprogress made in the negotiations to bring the regime ofapartheid to an end. The announcement of the establishmentof a Transitional Executive Council is a major event in thelong struggle against apartheid which will finally beeliminated with the holding of democratic elections nextyear.Notwithstanding the substantial progress made over theyears in the field of peaceful solution of inter-State conflicts the tendency still persists in some countries to solve conflictswith other countries through the use of force. The conflictbetween Iraq and Kuwait illustrates well such a tendency which led to the disastrous Gulf war. Despite the tragiclesson taught by this war and the various resolutions adoptedby the Security Council  much tension still exists betweenthe two countries. I hold it to be of fundamental importanceto peace in the region that the two sister countries livetogether as good neighbours and respect their commonborders  in accordance with the relevant Security Councilresolutions.Not long ago  we all thought that the conditions forpeace and stability in the world had finally arrived  since thedanger of a super-Power military confrontation and therivalry between the two blocs had disappeared with the endof the cold war. However  we are now  paradoxically confronted as never before with a series of armed conflicts.The time has come for a deep collective reflection in orderto identify ways to contain these conflicts. At the sametime  preventive measures should be adopted to eliminate ordiminish the possibility of potential conflicts degeneratinginto armed confrontation. Preventing conflicts is the mostsecure and least expensive way of saving lives andpreserving international peace and security.The Secretary-General’s ""Agenda for Peace"" containsa series of ideas and recommends a number of measures forthe management  control and prevention of armed conflicts.I believe that most of the measures proposed by theSecretary-General  in particular those having to do withpreventive diplomacy  should be put into practice as soon aspossible.4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe United Nations and the regional organizationsshould be able to create effective mechanisms to controlpotential conflicts and to eliminate the political and socialconditions which spawn them. We should bear in mind thatthe majority of the armed conflicts which today affect almostall regions of the world are internal  though some haveinternational implications because of their repercussions onthe peace and stability of neighbouring countries. If wewant to prevent such armed conflicts  we should be able toaddress their root causes.Amongst these root causes  attention should be focusedon the limitations imposed by the denial of effectiveparticipation by all citizens in the process of the governanceof their country  as well as on the violence resulting fromdisrespect for the fundamental human rights of the individualor of ethnic or religious groups.I believe - and this is demonstrated by our owndemocratic experience in Cape Verde - that the internalstability of a country and the social harmony among itsvarious groups have much to gain when all citizens are ableto exercise freely  fairly and fully their political rights byparticipating in the definition of their country’s destiny choosing their system of Government and freely andperiodically selecting their Government leaders.The changes that have taken place in the internationalscene have unequivocally demonstrated the importance of theprotection of human rights for all countries. Indeed  therespect for and the promotion of these rights have gained aglobal dimension and are today one of the most visibleglobal issues on the international agenda. My country hasa Constitution enshrining a vast list of fundamental rights and the respect for human rights is one of the mostimportant pillars of its internal and external policies. Wetherefore welcome the central role that the protection ofhuman rights has today on the agenda of nations. CapeVerde is deeply committed to the cause of human rightspromotion. Our policies and Government actions are guidednot only by humanistic considerations but also by practicalmotives  for we believe that the respect for human rightsintroduces an equilibrium that creates internal conditionsfavourable to economic development and social harmony.I therefore find it all the more difficult to accept theprecarious human-rights situation in which the people ofEast Timor find themselves. In this regard  I encourage theSecretary-General to pursue his efforts with a view tofinding a negotiated solution to the question of East Timor.In a world fraught with ethnic conflicts  respect for the rightsof minorities should deserve the best of our attention andrequires a deeper national awareness and better internationalprotection as well.I commend all those countries that have actively beenpromoting  at the world level  the cause of human rights.However  I think that such promotion must not be selective.For my country  the situation in which migrant workers findthemselves in certain receiving States is an equally importanthuman-rights issue.Since Cape Verde is a country with an emigrantcommunity abroad that is larger than the island’s residentpopulation  I cannot miss this opportunity to express mydeep concern about the hurdles and difficulties that migrantworkers are increasingly facing in certain receivingcountries  difficulties that  in some cases  amount to flagrantviolations of their fundamental human rights.It is unfortunate to note that in many countries including some developed countries  the rights of migrantworkers are being neglected or simply forgotten. Theworsening of the economic situation in these countries hasbeen accompanied by a worsening of discriminatory actionsand practices against the expatriates and the implementationof policies that frustrate the enjoyment of their hard-wonrights  leading to their expulsion from countries where theyhave  for long  been making an honest living and to whoseeconomy they have been making great contributions. Thefuture of humankind cannot be seriously protected in theabsence of values that are inherent to sincere and fraternalsolidarity.Human rights cannot be adequately promoted andprotected if  in many countries  poverty persists and if theirpeoples continue to live on the periphery of development andtheir populations continue to endure the hardship of extremepoverty. Underdevelopment brews conditions conducive togeneralized and persistent violations of the most fundamentalrights of the human person  especially the rights of womenand children. Indeed  the poverty and precarious livingconditions generated by underdevelopment give rise to socialand political instability  which  in the end  will have anenormous effect on international peace and security.It therefore becomes imperative for us all to worktowards effective cooperation for development in order toguarantee a minimum standard of human dignity and livingconditions  thus breaking the chain of poverty and humansuffering. I hope that the answer to some of these concernswill be found during the World Summit for SocialDevelopment.Forty-eighth session - 4 October l993 5In this regard  the African countries are facing aparticularly difficult economic and social situation. Affectedby drought and desertification  confronted with the socialand economic strangulation caused or worsened by manyarmed conflicts  marginalized by a system of economic andfinancial cooperation more prone to respond to the needs ofother regions and countries  and torn by widespread povertyand the worsening of living conditions  the African countriesare in dire need of urgent measures on the part of theinternational community to assist them in their necessaryinternal development efforts.Against this background  I commend the timelyinitiative of the Japanese Government to promote theconvening of an International Conference on AfricanDevelopment  set to take place this month in Tokyo. It ismy sincerest hope that this Conference will produce theexpected results. In this regard  developed countries shouldincrease substantially the resources earmarked to supportAfrican countries in their development efforts  especially ata time when these countries have embarked on fundamentaleconomic reforms  imprinting more dynamism on the privatesector  promoting the economic diversification of theircountries and introducing structural adjustments.I share the views of those who advocate the need forthe democratization of Africa. I would  however  like toemphasize that the promotion of democracy cannot bereduced simply to the setting up of formal democraticmechanisms and guarantees. Our own democraticexperience in Cape Verde has taught us that  althoughdemocracy is the most desirable system of government andshould  at all times  deserve our support  its consolidationand full acceptance by all the segments of the populationrequire a favourable internal economic climate so as to havea positive impact on the creation of better living conditionsfor all.I would like to seize this opportunity to emphasize thegreat interest that my country  as an island nation  attachesto the preparatory work for the First Global Conference onthe Sustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates  which is to take place next year. It is my mostfervent hope that this Conference  the first initiative on theimplementation of the decisions and commitmentsundertaken in the framework of Agenda 21  will producesatisfactorily concrete results.Cape Verde equally attaches utmost importance to theongoing negotiations on the draft convention ondesertification  in the implementation of a Rio Conferencedecision. Let us hope that this draft Convention will beconcluded at an early date and will substantially contributeto the creation of the international mechanisms needed todeal effectively with the devastating effects of drought anddesertification  which have been causing immense damage tothe economy of the affected countries and to the globalenvironment as well.We are living a historic moment  a moment full ofpotential for a collective future of peace and development.While on the one hand we have lately been confrontingpainful realities and negative developments that have raisedreal concerns for those of us interested in the maintenanceof international peace and security  on the other hand it iscomforting and encouraging to note the profound positivechanges that have taken place not only in inter-Staterelations but also  and especially  in the redefinition of oursystem of values which will  we hope  in peace and harmonyguide nations in their internal as well as in their internationalrelations in the coming decades.We should seize the opportunity offered by theremaining few years of this century to act with determinationand commitment with a view to consolidating democracy inthe world  promoting human rights and  at the same time andwith the same commitment and determination  recognizingthat the foundation for a new world order can reside only inthe development of countries and in cooperation amongstthem in order to arrive at solutions to the global problemsthat affect us all.This is my conviction as the Head of State of a small peace-loving country that has always advocated dialogueamong peoples and countries  and also as a citizen of thisworld  which I wish were more humane and more united."
"39",1653,"CRI",48,1993,"It has been four years since the end of thecold war and the fall of the old ideological order. Fouryears ago we were told that war and global confrontationhad ended and that history itself had come to an end  giving8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionway to a new age. Today  yesterday’s hopes and illusionsare confronted by a reality with which we are all familiar.What is keeping us from turning our world into a fertilefield and a common abode for all human beings?These meetings are taking place at a time when afeeling of hope animates the hearts of men. The agreementssigned between Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization have shown that peace is possible and thatliving in harmony does not require portentous events  butonly awareness and willingness. We all know that these firstagreements  if respected by both parties  can lead to a newdawn not only for Israel and Palestine but for all thecountries of the Middle East - a new awakening of peaceand prosperity in which this sublime teaching of the Korancan be made real:""Those who believe (in the Qur-an) And those who follow the Jewish (scriptures) And the Christians and the Sabians -Any who believe in GodAnd the Last Day And work righteousness Shall have their rewardWith their Lord: on themShall be no fear  nor shall they grieve."" (Surah II  62)But while Israelis and Palestinians are shaking handsand demonstrating their good judgement  the tragedy ofBosnia and Herzegovina continues to fill the world withshame. A Member State of the United Nations which is notexpressing ethnic or religious intolerance is trying to survivethe bloodiest harassment witnessed by Europe since 1945 -nations respond with passivity and indifference. It isshameful that an international community rejoicing at theend of the cold war has not been able to take more decisiveand effective action in respect to the inhuman aggressionagainst Bosnia and Herzegovina.Decade after decade  the echoes of that cold war wereheard in this Hall. The East-West confrontation was viewedas the supreme obstacle facing the countries of the world inattempting to respond to their peoples’s common yearningfor liberty  justice and development. The ideologicaldivision  we were told  hampered the efforts made to ensurethat all humanity benefited from development.Today we no longer talk about the cold war  nor aboutideological conflict  nor about the balance of terror.Nevertheless  the reality of what happened during thoseyears continues to brand us. Some walls have come downbut still others have been built. The peoples of Asia  Africaand Latin America remain forgotten  marginalized  second-class human beings. The technological gap has become anabyss. Material progress is increasingly remote from ourcountries  and cooperation is decreasing before our veryeyes. The North-South dialogue has once again beenreduced to an implacable monologue or  in the best of cases a rhetorical exercise to which justice and equity are rarelyinvited. And when we speak of new initiatives forcooperation  such as those recently announced for the peopleof Palestine  thought is given not to a global increase in aidbut  rather  to cutbacks in other programmes. As an old andgraphic Spanish proverb puts it: ""You undress one saint sothat you can dress another "".What does the new peace mean for the countries of thethird world? The assurance that their children will not bekilled by bullets  but will continue to die of hunger orendemic diseases? The certainty that they will no longerhave to go to war  but will continue without schooling without a dignified life  decent jobs or proper medical care?Sometimes ironic statements are made about theoptimism of the diplomacy of the 1920s  with its agreementsto renounce war and its naive faith in the capacity of theLeague of Nations to resolve every difficulty. We all knowwhat happened in the end to optimism and that League  butit seems that we have not really learned the lesson. If theinternational community of the 1990s does not translate theend of the cold war into a true effort to build one world  inwhich there are no first- or second-rate countries  we shallvery soon experience realities more tragic than those wehave already known.My country was overjoyed at the General Assembly’sdecision to choose you  Sir  to preside over the forty-eighthsession. You have the most sincere congratulations of CostaRica  a country that  like Guyana  forms part of the greatCaribbean brotherhood. We are certain that  under yourguidance  the General Assembly will be able to fulfilmankind’s hopes for peace and development.We should like to express our sympathy to theGovernment and people of India at this time of grief forthem.The present situation is especially critical for theCentral American and Caribbean States  which  because oftheir territorial dimensions  demographic situations and weakeconomies  are of little significance to the developed world.When the small  peripheral nations like ours try to unite ourefforts  we are immediately faced with the locked doors ofthe international financial organizations  the large economicblocs and the transnational corporations  which even try tocreate apprehension and confrontation among us.Forty-eighth session - 8 October l993 9We are not asking for handouts. Begging is not part ofa realistic and wide-reaching international policy. What ourcountries need is greater understanding of our realities greater openness for our products  and more sincere andeffective support for our desire to live in peace anddemocracy. What developing nations need is a change inattitude originating from a sense of the inalienable identityof humankind  a change in that amazing effrontery shown bythe developed world for our tragedies.The case of Central America clearly demonstrates thedirection in which this widespread indifference is taking us.It is taking us into a prolonged and difficult effort  in whichthe international community is providing wide support. Thepeople of Central America left behind many years of bloodyconvulsions. They decided to embark with enthusiasm on anew life  cemented in peace  democracy and freedom. Butthat joyful Central America  reborn for its children  has seenhow the doors close one after another. Those who wereinterested in a Central America full of bloodshed andtrenches do not want to deal with a Central America of thepoor  the Central America that calls for cooperation fordevelopment  for understanding of its human and economictragedies.Figures can be deceiving. For example  it is said thatNicaragua receives $500 million in foreign aid. That soundsvery good. What is not stated is that $450 million of the$500 million goes back to where it came from to service theexternal debt. In the meantime in that sister country evenmore disturbing outbreaks of violence flourish  reflecting itsdistressing situation. Recently an attempted coup d’état inGuatemala failed  but that failure did not translate intogreater external support for the consolidation of Guatemalandemocracy in the sectors most needed.We do not know in which Central American countrythe next crisis will come  but it will not be long before ithappens. It is regrettable that those who said so much aboutdemocracy and freedom and about peace and developmentin Central America are no longer being heard from. Todaymy delegation asks where is that support. What of thepromises  the golden offerings  the abundant talk of a fewyears ago?For example  let us take the case of banana production.Throughout the bloody crisis in Central America theEuropean Community time and time again expressed itssupport for a peaceful and negotiated solution. It effusivelysupported the initiatives to transform Central America intoa land of freedom and democracy  to keep our countriesaway from the strategic interests of the large hegemonisticblocs. Now that results have been achieved  the sameEurope is placing strong barriers to the entry of CentralAmerican bananas to its markets  without stopping to thinkabout the thousands of humble families that depend on thisactivity. Other Latin American democracies are facing thesame attitude. As if that was not enough they are trying toprovoke a conflict between the banana-growing countries ofthe Caribbean and those of Latin America  as if  followingthe custom of colonial times and invoking a non-existentantagonism between brothers  promoting divisions to hidethe barriers that in other cases they themselves denounce asunjust.Costa Rica believes that the time has come for frank open dialogue that will permit a fair and adequate solutionto this serious problem. For this reason we invite themember countries of the European Community and theproducer countries of Latin America and the Caribbean without exception  to enter into political talks which together with the talks already under way at the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  will facilitate arapprochement between the positions of the only two partiesto the problem  namely the producer and consumer countries.These contacts should have as a basis the recognition of therights of the Latin American countries to sell their fruit inthe Common Market and the reaffirmation of preferentialtreatment given to the Caribbean countries in the context ofthe Lomé Conventions.While democracy endeavours to put down roots inCentral America  markets for Central American products arebeing restricted by developed countries  cooperationprogrammes are being decreased or canceled  and attitudesof inexplicable severity are being adopted in commercial andfinancial negotiations  and even in diplomatic relations. TheCentral America of peace and freedom is being dealt with ina way that the Central America of violence was nevertreated.My country  which for many decades has not sufferedfrom the Calvary of dictatorship and civil war  which hasmaintained intact its tradition of effective respect for humanrights  has also had to face the same attitudes of indifferenceand lack of awareness. In this matter we draw attention tothe disturbing decision of the United States Government toadmit an administrative action brought before it againstCosta Rica in which it is argued that the Costa Ricanworkers are not being guaranteed internationally recognizedrights. This claim ignores our labour legislation which dealswith rights and guarantees for workers and has gone furtherin more than 50 years than those of many developedcountries  including the United States. The threat ofexcluding Costa Rica from commercial preference systemsis not only a clear interference in its internal jurisdiction but10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionalso ignores the basic principles governing coexistenceamong nations  and  more specifically  respect for sovereignrights  and that attitude is at variance with traditionaldemocratic principles and values which have always existedbetween both peoples and Governments.The task of consolidating the achievements of theCentral American peace process is everyone’s responsibility.In the first place  as a new political commitment  thesecuring of peace and democracy and making humandevelopment a priority require a true national consensussustained by a broad and participatory commitment  one thatinvolves Governments and the organized sectors of civilsociety.Secondly  a renewed and creative attitude on the part ofCentral American Governments is needed  an attitude thatwill rework and update the regional political agreements and from a new point of view  will direct regional effortstowards creating a new Central America. We want a CentralAmerica where peace  freedom  democracy and developmentwill prevail and this requires national and regional consensuson fundamental subjects such as enforcing the rule of law strengthening democratic institutions  developing ademocratic political culture  promoting and enforcing humanrights  economic and political decentralization  decision-making at the local level  the modernization of production guaranteeing equality of opportunity  widening thepossibilities for economic participation  social development and  finally  preserving our heritage for the society of the future.Thirdly  the collaboration and commitment of CentralAmericans in the creation of this new Central America isnecessary  but at the same time the participation of theinternational community is indispensable in order to fulfil thecommitments made by the region in its transition to peace freedom  democracy and development. In this perspectiveCosta Rica urges the General Assembly to decide in duecourse to offer its political and material support to this newchallenge that is Central America at the end of this century.In the present state of affairs the role of internationaland regional organizations as promoters and guarantors ofpeace and supporters of harmony and cooperation among thenations of the world is particularly decisive. For many longyears lamentations were heard about the problems createdfor the United Nations by ideological conflicts whichhindered the Organization and made it impossible for it toact dynamically and effectively. We have left such sombrehours behind and without doubt there have been importantsigns that this and other international organizations can andmust provide many valuable and decisive contributions to theinternational community as a whole. Precisely for thisreason we find ourselves at a key moment and we must nowredefine and transform the United Nations and the regionalorganizations and make them vital mechanisms so that a lifeof peace  freedom and development will illuminate all thecountries of the world.A little more than a year ago the Secretary-Generalpresented us with a series of important ideas regarding therestructuring of the United Nations. My country hasexpressed support for these wise proposals but at the sametime we consider that the present circumstances areespecially important and that this is an opportunity tomeditate profoundly on the appropriateness of emphasizingmore the role that international organizations should play asbuilders of a world of peace and development for allpeoples.My country considers that the United Nations cannotcontinue to ignore the question of the Republic of China inTaiwan. The existence of that exemplary country and thefuture of its 21 million inhabitants demand a revision of itsrelations with the United Nations. We firmly support theestablishment of an ad hoc committee to study and findsatisfactory solution to that problem in accordance with thefundamental principles of international law.For many years we have urged that the two importantinstruments of the United Nations system be created andstart functioning. These two instruments - so indispensableto the attainment of that system’s aims of peace and defenceof fundamental human rights - are the University for Peaceand the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights. Weask for support for both institutions  which are true pillarsfor the realization of the principles of the Charter.My delegation applauds the efforts made by the UnitedNations in situations like those that exist in Haiti andSomalia. The defence of international peace and securitycontinues to be a basic responsibility. We therefore supportall efforts accepted in the cause of disarmament and armscontrol  and we view with special concern the case ofcountries that  like the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea  object to controls that are directed towards ensuringthe non-proliferation of nuclear arms. At the same time however  Costa Rica considers it of fundamental importancethat States Members of the United Nations not lose sight ofthe Organization’s role in the task of making peace productive -a ""sublime task""  to borrow the term used by AmilcarCabral to define the progressive advancement of mankindtowards dignity and infinite growth.The world is one. Our shared concerns for peace andthe deterioration of the environment are an ampleForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 11demonstration of this. Why not also acknowledge thatmankind is one and that all who form part of mankind havea right to development and freedom?The commitments undertaken last year in Rio deJaneiro at the United Nations Conference on Environmentand Development to join in the search for sustainabledevelopment  in all its economic and environmental as wellas its political  social and cultural dimensions  constitute afundamental requirement if we are to achieve true peace anda dignified life for all the peoples of today’s and tomorrow’sworld. The convening of the Conference and the agreementsreached there  notwithstanding their limitations  are majorachievements for the Organization. In this connection  thefact that many countries  including my own  have engagedin activities to carry out the commitments entered into thereis of great importance. We also welcome the actions takenby the United Nations at the International Conference onPopulation and Development  the World Conference onWomen  and the Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States  aimed atbroadening discussions about the hoped-for development.But if those efforts are to be successful  it is indispensablethat the promises made by the industrialized countries at theRio Summit be fulfilled - that is  that they provide new andadditional financial aid  something they have so far done ona fairly meagre scale.For nearly half a century  we have been living amiddivision  struggles about ideologies  worries overhegemonies. To a large extent  those sterile years are nowbehind us  but so much remains to be done. We are stillconfronted by hatreds of all kinds  by a polluted world  bynatural disasters  by illiteracy and by peoples suffering fromhunger and disease. However  if the international systemmanaged to avoid allowing the cold war to lead to militarycatastrophe  surely it can find solutions to these othercatastrophes that are afflicting mankind. If we do not wantthe military and ideological alliances of past years to re-emerge  we must replace them as soon as possible with asolidarity that is not founded on economic interests. Mydelegation firmly believes that the Organization can andmust effect  as a priority  the qualitative transformationrequired by the international community - that is  thecreation of a great family  without East or West  North orSouth. Brothers and sisters know nothing of the points ofthe compass.In his book entitled Things Fall Apart Chinua Achebetells of a community in Nigeria where the harvest was poor.Attempting to encourage a young man  his father tells him:""Do not be disheartened. I know you will not bedisheartened. You have a brave and dignified heart. Adignified heart can survive a serious problem because theproblem does not impinge upon his dignity. But it is moredifficult and more bitter when you face it alone.""Hope resides in solidarity and in union. Mankind isone. All the peoples of the world must understand that weshare the same future  that there are no longer problems thataffect only others or differing destinies for mankind.Working together with goodwill and in one spirit  wewill be able to transform our world into a common home into a fertile ground for the promotion of and respect for thedignity of all human beings  joined to face a common futureof peace  justice and freedom."
"40",1722,"CUB",48,1993,"I come from a free  small and sovereignisland in Latin America. My ancestors were able to shed theyoke of a colonial empire and achieve an independence that since the moment of its birth  has been burdened by theinterventionist impositions of a foreign power. I belong toa people that was able  for several generations  to forge anauthentic revolution  which also opened the path to hope forother peoples of the Third World.For these reasons  and as a Caribbean people  we aredoubly proud of having you  Mr. President  presiding overthis session. Because you are a son of that South that makesus brothers  we are convinced that that world and its hopeswill not be ignored once again. In that just aspiration youwill certainly find Cuba’s support.Conditions in the world have radically changed in lessthan five years. Bipolar balance is being replaced byunipolar hegemony. The world is increasingly plagued bystill insuperable contradictions between words and deeds.While it is said that the threat of a nuclear holocaust hasdisappeared  the poverty and underdevelopment that causemisery and death are continuing. Millions of men  womenand children die every day  with no possibility of beingsaved. It is said that the arms race between the superPowers has ended but  increasingly  there is a rush todevelop new weapons systems and even to introduce themto outer space.Today  the warlords aspire to rule the skies withouthaving resolved many of the problems on Earth.Paradoxically  they argue that they lack the resources to doso  while the world today is becoming increasinglyungovernable because of them. The total budget of theWorld Health Organization equals the expenditures causedby three hours of the arms race. How can hunger inSomalia be alleviated  for example  if for every dollar usedto feed the hungry  $10 are spent on the maintenance ofmilitary operations in that country?The existence of treaties on a partial ban of nucleartests and on a moratorium  or on the non-proliferation ofsuch weapons  is not enough. A single agreement wouldsuffice  one providing for general and complete disarmamentand for the use of the enormous resources that would thuscease to be squandered for the final resolution of ourplanet’s serious problems.Regrettably  the end of the cold war has not resolvedany of the fundamental problems facing humankind; instead it has created many others. The sacred principles ofindependence and national sovereignty are being shredded topieces  and are guaranteed only to a few powerful countrieswhose views prevail even in this lofty Organization. TheUnited Nations was created  among other objectives  for theachievement of a lasting peace  justice and equality ininternational relations. Some things have been done  butmuch remains to be done for the benefit of human beingsand of peoples.While the longstanding problems of the Third Worldpersist and become more acute  aggravated by stagnation indevelopment assistance  what peace can we speak of? Whileunequal exchange  external debt and the transfer of resourcesfrom developing to developed countries - to mention but afew examples - still persist  will there truly be peace? Whileprotectionist and discriminatory practices in internationaltrade prevail  and the terms of trade of developing countriescontinue to deteriorate  will we honestly be able to achievejustice?Only through effective cooperation  radicallyrestructuring present international economic relations  wouldpoor nations be allowed to develop and to grow. Theinitiatives adopted by the Organization by consensus arecountless yet we continue to be ignored by the mostpowerful countries.The new international economic order  threeinternational development strategies  four United Nationsdevelopment decades  at least four special sessions of theGeneral Assembly  a number of conferences on population environment  habitat  and even the Rio de JaneiroConference itself exemplify hopes placed by peoples theworld over in the United Nations  but without tangibleresults. The selfishness and lack of political will faced bythe poor of this Earth  the children of colonialism  racism plundering and foreign intervention  are truly disappointing.10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionOn the other hand  neo-liberal doctrines are nowrampant in the assistance programmes of the Organization proclaiming only the virtues of the market and of privateenterprise. Defending only these options means separatingpopulations of developing countries from the real productionof wealth. This accentuates the inequalities  attacks truedemocracy  social development and the right of humanbeings to achieve a productive and dignified life.We the countries of the South are no more thanstatistics to the North. Meticulous studies are carried out todetermine that we will be born in greater numbers  that moreof us will fall to disease and that more of us will die.The quality of life of the generations that have beenborn and have died while I speak would demand that thosebulky files where tragedies are noted in detail  would alsohave the power to feed and heal the needy. Simply knowingthat we are dying in the countries of the South on this planetwill not prevent us from being buried.The surviving third world has once again placed itshopes in the preparation of an agenda for development andis awaiting with interest the Secretary-General’s report onthe subject. A new frustration would be a luxury for whichwe would never be forgiven by this suffering humanity.The World Summit for Social Development to be heldin 1995 will also provide us with a new opportunity to placehuman beings at the centre of the United Nations efforts  andto give this subject the priority it deserves in the work of theUnited Nations.The world we live in is condemned to a gradualdestruction that can only be stopped by our collectivewisdom. The right to life  the most basic of human rights is constantly threatened by the progressive deterioration ofthe ozone layer  by the pollution of the environment and itsunderground and surface waters  by the exhaustion of arableland and by the constant increase in the legions of theundernourished and underemployed. This dehumanizingcruelty is the result of what is mistakenly calledcontemporary industrial civilization. Together with theselacerating realities  humanity is facing other challengeswhich  though different  are no less complex.Recently  the World Conference on Human Rightsconcluded by reaffirming the universality  interdependenceand indivisibility of those rights. That Conference rightlyreiterated that the issue must be dealt with in an objective impartial and non-selective manner.Attempts are made to say that the majority of violationsof human rights originate in the impoverished countries ofthe South  while an overwhelming majority of their accuserscome from the affluent countries of the North. It seems thatthose who claim to be the resolute defenders of certainindividual freedoms  also include among those freedoms  andwith equal ease  the violence that increasing neo-fascist andracist currents are unleashing in their own societies.Has that North not been the source  and now more thanever  of discrimination against migrant workers  against theincreasingly dispossessed strata of society and againstnational minorities?Who are the main beneficiaries of the trade in humanorgans? Where are the deviant practices of pornography andchild prostitution  of drug addiction and the sale of minors most common? Are these by chance the individual freedomsthey defend with such zeal? Why are they not equallyintransigent in defence of the right to eat  to work  to learn to live a healthy life  to not suffer discrimination by reasonof sex or race  in other words the most basic rights of ahuman being?We all recognize the responsibility of the UnitedNations in the field of the promotion of human rights andfundamental freedoms in accordance with the United NationsCharter. There are United Nations bodies that canadequately carry out this responsibility if attempts are notmade to assign them functions with which they areincompatible  if they are allowed to work objectively andwithout political conditions  and if they are based oncooperation and not imposition. This role must not andcannot be distorted. Thus  the idea of creating a highcommissioner for human rights should be considered with allnecessary care and without undue haste  which we could inthe future regret.In a similar context  those who reap benefits from theexisting international order are introducing into it their ownideology. They are trying to impose those norms ofpolitical  economic and social organization most likely topreserve that order and irrationally defend their ideasregarding the links between democracy  human rights andthe market economy  a new trilogy that masks the sufferingsof millions of persons.It is necessary firmly to reject any and all attempts todecide unilaterally on these issues of vital interest to allpeoples  and avoid their becoming new sources of conflict new obstacles to international cooperation and the unifyingrole that humanity today expects of the United Nations.Forty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 11In order to fulfil the purposes enshrined in the UnitedNations Charter and to allow the Organization to contributeto ensuring peace  cooperation and development  it is urgentto democratize the United Nations.This would facilitate the finding of solutions to themalformations with which the United Nations was born andwith which it developed  and its transformation into anOrganization devoted to truly strengthening cooperationamong peoples. It is not acceptable that at the dawn of thetwenty-first century  the United Nations continues to respondto the interests of a handful of Powers.The United Nations has not been and is not democratic.A veto privilege linked with the might of States isinadmissible  above all if the Security Council can becomea docile instrument in the hands of a few Powers  a riskwhich is present now more than ever before. There isnothing more insecure in this world  and I say this in allsincerity  than the Security Council.The full democratization of the Security Council wouldrequire  among other measures  that all its members besubject to periodic democratic elections  as is now the casewith non-permanent members. It would also require theelimination of the veto privilege and the establishment of asingle category of members  which would be consistent withthe principle of the sovereign equality of States that mustbecome  once and for all  the cornerstone of the activities ofthe Organization.We are  nevertheless  conscious of the obstacles that atpresent prevent us from achieving that objective  and weconsider it not only feasible  but indeed indispensable  toprogress in that direction.The number of peoples present in this Hall has almostquadrupled since 1945. It is therefore necessary to institutea new order in the United Nations.Cuba favours an increase in the membership of theCouncil to reach a proportion  with respect to the totalmembership of the United Nations  that is as close aspossible to that existing in 1945  and favours also a triplingof the number of permanent members so that Latin America the Caribbean  Africa and Asia would have more than twoseats in that category  as is now the case for Europe.Suffice it to say that more than 3 700 million inhabitants ofthose continents  that is  two thirds of humankind  do notenjoy that privilege.It is also essential for the principle of equitablegeographical distribution to be ever present in the SecurityCouncil  and not only among the non-permanent membersbut among the totality of its membership. By so doing  wewould be advancing one step farther towards democratizationof the Council’s membership.It is also indispensable to modify the operationalmechanisms of the Council and eliminate the practice ofso-called informal consultations  thereby increasingtransparency in the work of the Council. This is a need thatthe Secretary-General recognizes in his latest report on thework of the Organization. By the same token  it is notpermissible for the Council to go beyond its mandate andinterfere in fields that are not within its purview.The adoption of measures to ensure greater participationby the General Assembly on issues to do with themaintenance and strengthening of international peace andsecurity  as a means for achieving the necessary balancebetween the Assembly and the Security Council  cannot bepostponed. We cannot disregard the fact that  under theCharter  the General Assembly is the only truly universalbody in the United Nations and that this gives it specialresponsibilities. The Security Council acts on behalf of allthe Member States represented in this Hall and isaccountable to them. This accountability should therefore beimplemented through substantive and analytical reports fromthe Council to the General Assembly that would allow theAssembly not only to systematically consider and assess theCouncil’s activities  but also to formulate necessaryrecommendations.There is undoubtedly a general will to revitalize theOrganization  but this objective should be achieved throughthe fullest and most transparent consultations  guided  aboveall  by the decisions taken by Member States.Certain recent initiatives that  without any consultationor mandate whatsoever  attempt to reinvent the priorities ofthis Organization are cause for concern. There are evenproposals that seem to consider the United Nations as asupranational body with a Secretariat acting as a universalgovernment  and implementing actions that not only lack anappropriate legislative basis  but also confer on itprerogatives that are far removed from its legitimate nature.We call the Assembly’s attention to the dangers involved inthese attempts because  if their acceptance is forced through they would cause serious conflict that could endanger thevery integrity of the Organization.12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionAttention should also be called to theimplementation of certain new ideas and mechanisms in theUnited Nations. Even if the resolutions regarding the reportentitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" were adopted unanimouslyin this Hall  their implementation is not free of dangers thatcould jeopardize the most sacred principles of the UnitedNations. Nothing in those texts can justify violations of thesovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Statesor interference in their internal affairs.The excessive multiplication in the number ofpeace-keeping operations and related procedures is alsocause for increasing concern. The proliferation in this typeof operation is no indication that the United Nations isfunctioning better today than in the past; quite the contrary.In any case  it is a symptom of the grave dangers thatthreaten world peace and stability.The resulting financial burden that is falling on theshoulders of Member States is reaching unsustainableproportions. Hence  we must prevent this increase frombecoming even more onerous for Member States  and inparticular for those of the third world.In the last decade of the millennium  our worldnevertheless does show some rays of light. One of these isthat shed by the Ibero-American Summits  the most recentof which was recently held in the Brazilian city ofSalvador da Bahia. I mention this as a valid example offraternal discussion  in which  without anything beingimposed by any party  issues of common interest weredefined and coordinated.Recently also  the world learned of the signing of theDeclaration that  as a preliminary measure  recognizesPalestinian autonomy over part of the occupied territories.We hope that this development constitutes an effective steptowards the restoration of the legitimate right of thePalestinian people to have their own State  in their ownnational territory  and towards the definitive withdrawal byIsrael from the other occupied Arab territories  includingJerusalem. This would be an important contribution to adefinitive solution to the Middle East conflict and to theestablishment of a just and lasting peace in that troubledregion.Only a few days ago  in the Special Committee againstApartheid  my delegation had the honour of hearingNelson Mandela. We are encouraged by his confidence inthe future  and we hope that the process of dialogue nowunder way will be conducive to the establishment of aunited  democratic and non-racial South Africa. We areready to contribute  with our modest efforts  towards thatend.In my country  a genuine revolution succeeded. Sincethe outset  it has faced hostility from its neighbour but against all odds  it has been able to carry out  in solidarity its humane task. We have continued our endeavour evennow that international circumstances have radically changed.Cuba is inserting itself into the world economy and isopening up to foreign investment  but without the loss of anyof its principles. In order to continue to safeguard thedevelopment of our people  we are also making profoundchanges based on the concept of preserving ourindependence and the gains we have already achieved. Weare indeed facing serious problems as a result of an inhumanblockade  but we nevertheless continue to hold a prominentplace in the fields of health  education and social security which are guaranteed for all even in the midst of all ourdifficulties. The results of these efforts have beenrecognized this year by the United Nations and by theUnited Nations Children’s Fund.Attempts are being made to crush this dream. TheGeneral Assembly  at its last session  adopted resolution47/19  regarding the necessity of ending the economic commercial and financial embargo imposed by the UnitedStates of America against Cuba. The resolution waswelcomed by international public opinion. Since then  therehas been an impressive rise in world-wide solidarity towardsour country  from every part of the world  from the mostdiverse sectors and creeds  even in those wide swaths of thepopulation of the aggressor country that reject the measurestaken by their own Government. Sympathy has increasedfor a people that for more than three decades has managedto resist a ferocious siege by a huge  neighbouring Power with admirable gallantry in the midst of unimaginabledeprivation. Nevertheless  in open defiance of the decisiontaken by the General Assembly and in defiance of worldopinion  the blockade has been reinforced during the last fewmonths by means of regulations cruelly implementing to theutmost the same laws rejected by this forum less than a yearago.The extra-territorial nature of the blockade hasincreased  and the pressures are on the rise. Actions havemultiplied to impede or affect the links with Cuba of privateand public economic entities in third countries. They aspireto defeat by hunger and disease the exemplary nation whichthey have not been able to vanquish by force or by sirensongs.Forty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 13It must be difficult for the illustrious representatives ofthat great northern nation still to sustain today the thesis thattheir actions constitute a bilateral embargo  in the face of theirrefutable evidence that in fact those actions constitute ablockade.We have provided the Assembly with irrefutableevidence of their ambition not only to maintain but also tostrengthen the blockade  to economically strangle myhomeland  to undermine the sovereignty of third States andto violate the freedom of trade and navigation  to thedetriment of the most fundamental principles of internationallaw.But there is more: if this is a case of bilateral relations then there are two blockaded peoples  that of Cuba and thatof the United States. North Americans are denied aneconomic opportunity that would benefit them; they aredenied access to the scientific advances that alreadyguarantee the prevention and cure of diseases such asmeningitis  retinitis pigmentosa  hepatitis B and vitiligo among other achievements of our science. The right totravel freely to any place  which their Constitution conferson all citizens  is also infringed upon.The blockade’s effect on my people is even moreinhuman. We are prevented from purchasing drugs essentialfor health; our ability to acquire resources to meet the needsfor our material and social well-being is curtailed; our peaceand daily life is threatened. The generation to which Ibelong was born and grew up under the blockade’s siege.To live in a sovereign and steadfast country is a crime forwhich two million children may have to pay with their lives.We affirm before the peoples of the world that therewill be no possible absolution for those who commit orsupport this genocide  because ""to condone a crime istantamount to committing it"". If against all logic our rightwere to be denied  if aggressive forces were to prevail overreason  Cubans will nevertheless always maintain theirunshakeable faith in victory. We love life  and life isfreedom  independence  sovereignty. We demand that thepath we have chosen be respected. It is not our desire to bea model for anyone  but we will never accept eitherimposition or force.I know that my words will be understood in differentways  but I have said what our conscience as free humanbeings dictates. My words may be applauded as a matter ofsolidarity  courtesy or obligation  but I know that there aremany who wish us to be successful  for that is what theyhope for themselves.To you  Mr. President  I am thankful for havingallowed me to express the feelings of a worthy people."
"41",1768,"CYP",48,1993,"Mr. President  it is with greatpleasure that I congratulate you on your election as Presidentof the General Assembly. This is not merely a recognitionof your long experience and your outstanding ability anddiplomatic skill  but also a reflection of the esteem in whichyour country  Guyana  is held in the United Nations. We arecertain that  under your able guidance  the work of thissession of the General Assembly will be a landmark in thenew international scene and in facing the new challenges forpeace  democracy and progress.I should like also to pay a warm tribute to theSecretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for the determined leadership that he hasdemonstrated on vital international issues and for hisexcellent report on the work of the Organization  whichprovides much food for thought and indicates various areasof important activities that are the object of soul-searchingconsideration in this debate.May I remind Members that  from the beginning of itsexistence as an independent State after many years ofcolonial rule until its admission to the United Nations in1960  Cyprus has consciously made the principles of theUnited Nations Charter central to its foreign policy  and within its limited possibilities  has endeavoured in everypossible way to be supportive of the Organization.Frankly  I have to admit that we followed this approachin our foreign policy both as a matter of principle and as amatter of self-interest. We have always believed that theUnited Nations was mankind’s best hope for a system ofinternational order  despite the fact that we were aware ofthe possibilities of non-adherence to it and of the limitationsto the effectiveness of the world Organization resulting fromthe existence of military blocs. Our self-interest as a smalland militarily weak country made us feel the need for theprotection of the world Organization  and  as a developingcountry  we stood to benefit from multilateral technicalassistance and know-how.The Secretary-General’s excellent report testifies to thefact that  in today’s post-cold-war era  the United Nations isat a crossroads. Some years ago  in the context of theEast-West divide and the continuing build-up of nucleararsenals  we were agonizing in international forums over thefuture of our civilization. The cold war is finally over opening up new prospects for positive change ininternational policies. New prospects are also opening upfor concerted action and a global approach to the problemswe face.In some parts of the world  the old regimes havecollapsed and a move to pluralistic societies and the freemarket economy is being made. However  the newlyacquired freedom has revived old enmities. This is not astrange phenomenon because  as the eminent  late PrimeMinister of India  Mr. Nehru  said  the walk to freedom isnot an easy one. World developments indicate  and clearlydemonstrate  that unless the international community adoptsa more unified approach in its understanding of thechallenges it faces and promotes the necessary solutions human rights abuses  increasing insecurity and hunger andsuffering will create an explosive situation that will spare noone; we are  though  gradually becoming aware of thecomplexity and scope that even minor issues acquire in aninterdependent world.The world is full of challenges and opportunities. Ourcommon responsibility is to strengthen the worldOrganization in order best to respond to these challenges andincrease mankind’s expectations of peace  prosperity anddemocracy. These expectations can be met only by makingthe United Nations more effective  through theimplementation of its own resolutions and the mandatoryprovisions of the Charter.The General Assembly  based on the principle ofsovereign equality  has much to offer and must continue toplay its important role under the Charter.Nowadays  however  the Security Council has asubstantially enlarged agenda. As the Charter envisages  itis able to decide and act. At present it is able to act in amore effective manner in the crucial areas of internationalpeace and security. It is evident that the Security Councilcan now play a much more important role than ever before.This is a welcome development  and within the context ofthis expanded role a review of its membership to reflect therealities of today’s world is highly appropriate.However  the effectiveness of the Security Council  thehighest organ of the United Nations  can be achieved only ifit applies the practice of acting with determination.Experience has demonstrated that in those cases where theinternational community has shown determination to upholdthe principles of international instruments and fully applytheir provisions  progress can be made. In those cases whereunity of purpose has not been shown or interests of nationshave been placed above universal principles and rule of law the problems remain  and peace is elusive.I wish to point out with emphasis that gaps ininternational law and practice - failure to upholdinternational law and human rights  or upholding them inone situation and closing our eyes to their violation in others- must no longer be acceptable behaviour  particularly in thenew world order to which we all aspire.In today’s world  where economics plays anincreasingly important role  the United Nations  through theSecretariat  the United Nations Development Programme andthe various specialized agencies  carries out multi-purposeactivities for the betterment and economic well-being ofpeople throughout the world. These activities are outlinedin the Secretary-General’s report  and in the interest ofsaving time I do not intend to comment on them other thanto declare that we fully recognize their importance andsupport them. We look forward to receiving later in thissession the Secretary-General’s integrated approach todevelopment issues in his forthcoming agenda fordevelopment  which will no doubt appropriately complementhis groundbreaking ""An Agenda for Peace"" in matters ofpeace and security.In the light of our overall philosophy  as I indicatedearlier  we attach much importance to the effectivefunctioning of the principal judicial organ of the UnitedNations  the International Court of Justice. The increase ofits jurisdiction in contentious cases is encouraging  and wealso attach importance to the possibility of clarifying legalpoints in political disputes through advisory opinions. TheInternational Court of Justice is indeed an integral part ofUnited Nations peace efforts and we support theSecretary-General’s proposal that he be authorized to seekadvisory opinions from the Court as an important componentof the United Nations peacemaking apparatus as a whole.The Secretariat’s role in an improved and moreeffective United Nations is indisputable  and we pay tributeto the many men and women in the international civilservice whose competence and dedication enable theOrganization to respond to the ever-increasing demandsmade of it in today’s world conditions. TheSecretary-General has already done much in the direction ofrationalizing and streamlining the Secretariat  as well as inputting in place effective machinery for inspections andinvestigations whenever necessary  and he certainly has oursupport in the additional measures needed to carry out thisHerculean task. We join in recognizing the undoubted needfor an adequate financial basis for the Organization and forassessed contributions to be paid early and in full byMember States  in terms of both the regular budget and thecosts of peace-keeping. Voluntary contributions are also tobe encouraged in order to carry out the tasks at hand  and Imight recall that Cyprus  besides endeavouring to play itsForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 3modest role in as many such cases as its means allow  hasalso undertaken to make  on a continuous basis  a majorcontribution towards the financing of the United NationsPeace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).Past and recent experience in every region of the worldhas demonstrated that the protection and promotion ofhuman rights is an indispensable ingredient of a stable worldorder. Over the years the United Nations has played its fullpart in affirming human equality  which is  indeed  the heartof all rights  and in building bridges across the divides ofrace  ethnicity  culture  socio-economic disparities andpolitical philosophies. Democracy and human rights are twoof the United Nations Charter’s most cherished principles and they have always figured prominently in United Nationsconferences.Democracy is the only system of government that cansafeguard the liberty of the people  respect for human rightsand quality of life. We have a duty to remain vigilant andcontinue to look for ways in which these new opportunitiespresented by world developments may be used for thepromotion of international peace  the advancement of therule of law and the protection of human rights.The world community must clearly oppose chauvinisticnationalism  take a clear-cut stand against policies of ""ethniccleansing"" and unequivocally continue making all effortsuntil we achieve the complete dismantlement of the unjustand inhumane social systems based on ethnic politicalsegregation and the development and consolidation of anon-racial  democratic South Africa.The effective promotion of human rights cannot beseparated from the global trend towards democratization.Cyprus is in the forefront of States that have become partyto treaties for the protection of human rights  both at theglobal level  within the United Nations  and at the regionallevel  primarily through the Council of Europe. We areespecially sensitive on this subject  since one largecomponent of the Cyprus problem in its present dimensionsis the massive violation of the human rights of the displacedpersons who have been evicted by force from their homes bythe Turkish forces of occupation. Their homes andproperties have been usurped by illegal settlers importedfrom Turkey to Cyprus in an effort by the aggressor tochange the demographic composition of the population ofCyprus.All these flagrant violations of human rights have beencommitted by Turkey  a Member of the United Nations despite General Assembly and Security Council resolutionscalling on all United Nations Members to respect theindependence and territorial integrity of the Republic  avoidany actions which could change the demographiccomposition of the population of Cyprus  withdraw allforeign forces from the territory of the Republic and allowthe return of the refugees to their homes under conditions ofsafety.Cyprus is a case in point of the complete defiance ofGeneral Assembly and Security Council resolutions by oneof its members. In reality  the intransigence of the Turkishside  which has rendered every effort to find a solutionimpossible  accounts for the hesitation of the SecurityCouncil to adopt measures for compliance with itsresolutions. If a viable and lasting solution of the Cyprusproblem is to be arrived at without further delay and afederally united State is to be established without occupationtroops and settlers  concerted action is required by theinternational community as a whole.It is not only in the solution of the Cyprus problem thatTurkey shows intransigence. The Turkish intransigenceextends to purely humanitarian issues  such as cooperationin ascertaining the fate of missing persons and inimplementing the third Vienna agreement regarding personsenclaved in occupied areas.I wish to express appreciation for the support extendedto Cyprus by the General Assembly  the Secretary-Generaland the Security Council. We consider a good omen offurther determined action the declaration of theSecretary-General in his most recent report to the SecurityCouncil on Cyprus  and the Council’s positive response to it that unless progress is made on the Cyprus problem he willrequest the Security Council to consider alternative ways ofsecuring compliance with the many resolutions of the UnitedNations on Cyprus.We have had occasion in the past to express oursupport for the constructive suggestions of theSecretary-General for improving the potential of UnitedNations peace-keeping operations in today’s increasingdemand for them  including the training of personnel  thestrengthening of the Department of Peace-keepingOperations and the earmarking of appropriate equipment andpersonnel for use by the United Nations. We are encouragedthat progress has been made in all these areas and in thesetting up of a peace-keeping Reserve Fund  but  in view ofthe ever-increasing demands and the worsening of financialproblems associated with these operations  complacency isnot justified and we should all continue to do our best to4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionassist in discharging this major responsibility thrust on ourOrganization.With regard to peace-keeping  it has been said - notwithout justification - that the United Nations should avoidopen-ended involvement in peace-keeping operations.Cyprus has been pointed out as an example of over-longUnited Nations peace-keeping involvement. The broaderlesson to be drawn from the experience of United Nationsinvolvement in peace-keeping and peacemaking in Cyprus isthat  so long as one of the parties concerned is not willing tocomply with the dictates of the international community asspelt out in unanimously adopted and binding resolutions ofthe Security Council; and so long as the members of theinternational community  and more particularly thepermanent members of the Security Council  are not willingor able to act effectively in order to implement resolutionsfor which they voted  peacemaking will lag behind peace-keeping  resulting in the indefinite perpetuation of theproblem and of the peace-keeping operation concerned. Thisis  obviously  an unsatisfactory situation - unsatisfactory tothe Government and the country directly concerned;unsatisfactory to the countries contributing to the cost of thepeace-keeping operation; and of course  unsatisfactory to theUnited Nations. I submit that the answer lies not inabandoning the peace-keeping effort and thereby abdicatingresponsibility  leaving the weak at the mercy of the strongand striking a blow against longstanding efforts to solve theproblem  but in pressing on with effective peacemakingthrough the implementation of the relevant Security Councilresolutions by all available means  so as to reach a solutionconsistent with the Charter and the United Nationsresolutions. Cyprus is indeed a test-case  not  however  withregard to peace-keeping  but with regard to the effectivenessof the United Nations in peacemaking.If I set out at some length our views on ""An Agendafor Peace""  I did so not only because it is very important but also because Cyprus is itself a case-study of most of theproblems it raises. I shall refrain from commenting on thelong litany listed in this year’s report of internationalproblems in which the Organization is actively engaged andwhich extend to all five continents. Each presents its owncomplications and special characteristics. They provide ameasure of the enormous expectations placed upon theUnited Nations  the awesome burden of the Secretary-General’s responsibilities  and the respect and admiration hedeserves in carrying out these responsibilities. As he rightlypoints out:""The United Nations  by undertaking a range ofproblems as wide as the globe itself  must be expectedto achieve successes but also to experience failure.""(A/48/1  para. 512)While in the past few years the world has witnessed thecreation of new areas of tension and conflict through theunleashing of destructive and centrifugal forces of excessivenationalism and ethnic strife  there have also been somenotable successes through the solution of several regionalissues and the withdrawal of foreign forces following theend of cold-war antagonism. We have witnessed in manyparts of the world the triumph of democracy and theemergence of free-market economies. More concretely there has been the collapse of the Berlin Wall and thehistoric reunification of Germany; major progress towardsending the odious practice of apartheid in South Africa hasbeen achieved; and  as recently as last month  the historicaccord between Israel and the PLO was signed at the WhiteHouse  marking a new era in the Middle East. All threesituations had appeared to present the insurmountableproblems of unending and seemingly irreconcilable conflicts.And yet  with vision and imagination  the political will forsolutions was found.In contrast  the problem with which my own countryhas been confronted for too long has remained intractable despite the existence of unanimously adopted United Nationsresolutions and despite the mutually acceptable procedure ofthe good offices of the United Nations Secretary-General.In our view  the problem is solvable and must be solved  yetthe efforts of many years have come to no result owing toTurkish intransigence backed by Turkish military might.We remain committed to reaching a peaceful solutionon the basis of the United Nations resolutions and the high-level agreements. As clearly emerges from successivereports of the Secretary-General  we have cooperated withhim in all sincerity in the exercise of his good offices for anoverall solution  and we have responded positively to hisproposals for the adoption  as a first step  of the confidence-building measures and in particular the placing of Famagustaand the opening of the Nicosia airport under United Nationsadministration.In 1945  the founding fathers signed the Charter in SanFrancisco  in the aftermath of a devastating war  with thevision of establishing the foundations of a better and morepeaceful world. As it nears its fiftieth anniversary  awatershed in its history  the United Nations is again facinga major challenge in a rapidly changing international climate.Peoples and nations all over the world place growingexpectations in the Organization’s response to the newsummons for a universal alliance for peace and justice  forForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 5democracy  development and international legal order. Atthe same time  the ominous phenomena of ethnic strife destructive nationalism  widespread poverty and socialinjustice are undermining the vital role of the United Nationsin opposing aggression and maintaining international peace and are thus posing new challenges.As the Organization is restructuring itself in order tomeet these challenges more effectively  it is clear that  byand large  the Charter has stood the test of time. As weapproach the milestone of the fiftieth anniversary of theOrganization  let us agree to spare no effort to make it moreeffective  and let us look upon the Charter not merely as acode of international behaviour that is difficult to live up toand comply with  but as a reasonable and practical model foreveryday international behaviour and political ethics."
"42",1792,"CZE",48,1993,"Mr. President  letme start by congratulating you on your election to this highoffice. I am sure that under your leadership this year’sGeneral Assembly will be particularly successful andeffective.Today is the first time that a representative of theCzech Republic has had the honour to address the UnitedNations General Assembly as part of the general debate.The Czech Republic is indeed a new State. Still  thedivision of Czechoslovakia is nothing to be happy about. Itis always better for equal communities to unite than toseparate. However  once we determined that the continuedexistence of Czechoslovakia could not be assured by quietand peaceful means  we strove to separate peacefully. Whilein other parts of the world similar separations are frequentlyaccompanied by terror and violence  in our country not asingle window pane was broken. This experience makes usbelieve that good will and common sense can lead topeaceful settlements  even of problems traditionallyaccompanied by violence.The Czech Republic is currently undergoing profoundpolitical and economic changes. On the political side  weare constructing a democratic regime in what used to be thecommunist world. The Government has proven to be astable one. Meanwhile  we emphasize human rights  and ourrobust press freedom as well as our human-rights recordhave been recognized even by very finicky non-partisaninternational organizations.On the economic side  the Czech Republic has alsochalked up certain successes. Privatization of property thatwas formerly State-owned is continuing apace. Prices arebeing freed so that they can find their natural  market-drivenlevel. Meanwhile  we have managed to maintain tightmonetary policies  keep inflation and unemployment at rathermodest levels  and hold to a balanced budget. We livewithin our means.In this context  let me emphasize one thing. We aremanaging the process of economic transformation with ourown efforts and our own resources. We do not ask fordirect financial assistance. We do not seek to siphon offscarce development resources from countries whose situationForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 13is much worse than ours. We tell our friends fromdeveloped countries  ""We seek trade not aid from you.Open your markets to us  not your pocketbooks."" Actually open markets would benefit all of us  whether our economiesare developed or developing  settled or in transition. This iswhy we are convinced that the successful conclusion of theUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade would finally benefit us all.In addition to the transition of our domestic politicalsystem and the transformation of our economic system  wehave also modified our foreign policy. One of our foreignpolicy priorities concerns Slovakia. Over the last months the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have beenlearning how to live together as two independent countries rather than as two regions of the same country. We haveconcluded a series of agreements and treaties  and havebecome used to having an international border between us -a border  I stress  which is peaceful.We are assuming our natural place in Europe. Mycountry has recently been accepted as a member of theCouncil of Europe  which my President is about to addressin a day or two. Just two days ago in Luxembourg I signeda Europe Agreement with the European EconomicCommunity. Also unmistakable is the transatlanticdimension of our diplomacy  as exemplified by our activitieswithin the Conference on Security and Cooperation inEurope (CSCE) and the North Atlantic Council forCooperation (NACC)  and by our interest in joining theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).Our relations with the developing world have also beenchanging. On the one hand  there is a long history offriendly relations with many countries which we are nowtrying to put on a new and more balanced footing. On theother hand  we are seeking cooperation with a number ofimportant countries which until recently had been ignored forpolitical reasons. Thousands of physicians and techniciansfrom the developing world who have been trained in ouruniversities act today as so many goodwill ambassadors forus. I am sure that in a short time we will be able to provideappropriate economic assistance to needy regions of theworld  preferably through multilateral channels.Our foreign policy is that of a small country andreflects that country’s position in Europe and in the world.It is  however  an independent foreign policy which is notbeholden to anyone and which does not blindly copy theforeign policy of any other country.The end of the cold war era is connected with the fallof European communism  and its consequences have not yetbeen fully grasped. While the danger of a world nuclearcatastrophe has significantly abated  conflicts provoked bypolitical  ethnic  religious  social and economic disputes haveflared up. Meanwhile  rays of hope have appeared inregions where we perhaps did not expect them. I have inmind the prospects for a peaceful settlement in the MiddleEast  the shaping of a democratic process in the Republic ofSouth Africa and last  but not least  the success of theUnited Nations in Cambodia.In recent days we have been following with greatconcern developments in the Russian Federation. We hadhoped that Russia’s problems would be settled peacefully but the anti-reformist opposition initiated violence. Free anddemocratic elections are the only solution to the situation.Elections will determine whether those who waved theRussian flag in Moscow or those who waved the communistred flag should guide Russia’s future.Post-cold-war conflicts have shaken many of the values principles and certainties with which we have been living.Nowhere have these values been questioned as radically andas viciously as in the countries of the former Yugoslaviaduring the several wars that have taken place there in recentyears. Wars in the former Yugoslavia  the Caucasus andelsewhere have made us aware of the need to ask oldquestions anew  to re-examine concepts that have been basicto international politics since the Second World War.These questions concern  for example self-determination; the role of internal borders as new Statesemerge; non-interference in internal affairs; internationalrecognition of new States and its timing; and probablyothers. We will need to scrutinize them far more daringlyand rigorously and with far greater imagination. Here  Ithink  is where some of the greatest challenges for theUnited Nations will arise in the immediate future. This istreacherous ground  but it might offer one possible vehiclein the search for guidance in the times ahead.Today  however  the fighting in Bosnia andHerzegovina seems to be resulting in a division of thatcountry along ethnic lines. We find the enforcedcoincidence of statehood with ethnicity odious. We cherishthe principle of a civic society in which citizens enjoy equalrights regardless of their ethnic background  mother tongueor religious creed. By contrast  we feel that ethnic  not tomention religious  purity is a concept from another age irrelevant in the modern world. We regard as inadmissibleany violent changes of frontiers as well as ""ethnic cleansing""14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionaccompanied by massive and flagrant violations of humanrights.One need not stress how important for my country -particularly when it was not free - was adherence to humanrights  including their codification by the United Nations.Individual  universally valid human rights and theirobservance are inseparably linked to democracy andprosperity. This year’s World Conference on Human Rightsheld in Vienna was an important turning-point. In ouropinion  a more effective use of the means spent on theprotection of human rights  the concentration of activitiesinto one body  and the establishment of the office of a highcommissioner for human rights would be steps in the rightdirection.The Czech Republic is proud of its share in the workof the United Nations. Let me mention some of ourcontributions. Currently we have military observers inMozambique and in the former Yugoslavia. Two moreteams are to be deployed in Georgia and in Liberia. Othershave helped keep the peace in Angola and in Somalia. Wehave an infantry battalion stationed in Croatia under thecommand of the United Nations Protection Force. Ourcivilian observers monitored Haiti’s elections. Our militaryparticipated in the liberation of Kuwait. Our specialists areworking for the United Nations Special Commission. Alarge group of security personnel is about to join the UnitedNations guard contingent in Iraq. Our officers also servedfor 40 years on the armistice line in Korea as members ofthe Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.T h i sdemonstrates our tradition of service to the internationalcommunity  a tradition of shouldering our fair share of theinternational burden.Along different lines  we have participated for 30 yearsin the work of the United Nations decolonization Committee.And as I look around this Hall  I realize that there is not asingle country among the 130 or so which have beenadmitted after the founding of the United Nations that wewould not have helped assume its seat here.As members of the Assembly know  the CzechRepublic is running in elections for one of the non--permanent seats on the Security Council. We are running onour record - our record of service and the record of ourexperience. On this basis I ask members for their support inthe forthcoming elections.As many have already mentioned in the general debate the world is different than it was 50 years ago.Consequently  the United Nations and its Security Councilhave reached a turning-point. Still  it is the consideredopinion of my Government that  on the whole  the SecurityCouncil now serves us well. In the past few years  it hasceased to be a mere side-show in world politics. Indeed  ithas frequently come to occupy centre stage. As a result  theCouncil and the United Nations as a whole are striving tomeet the rising expectations the world is pinning on them.Whatever changes we suggest  we must proceedresponsibly in efforts to reform the Council  in the spirit ofmutual understanding and consensus. The Security Councilmust adapt to the new political  economic  social andsecurity realities of the world. Some countries have becomeimportant members of the international community. Anexpansion of the Security Council must above all respectprinciples of effectiveness and responsibility forimplementing its own decisions. A just geographicalrepresentation is equally important.However  some changes should be made today. Thereis a certain sense of frustration among non-members of theSecurity Council  which is steadily increasing the number ofits informal meetings behind closed doors. We need greatertransparency. We need more communication. We need abetter balance between the Council and the GeneralAssembly.In this respect  distributing the monthly agenda of theSecurity Council to Members is a welcome first step.Inviting the chairmen of regional groups for briefings is alsohelpful. I am sure that the Council will find furthermeasures along these lines that could be implementedimmediately. If the Czech Republic is elected  myPermanent Mission will try to identify other such measures.The credibility of the United Nations hangs on  interalia  the performance of some 80 000 military and civilianmembers of United Nations forces in 17 peace-keepingoperations all over the world. Crisis management nowincludes not only the classical separation of adversaries butalso the protection of humanitarian convoys  the monitoringof elections and the observance of human rights. Peace-keepers are sent more often to countries where there are nofunctioning Governments and where agreements are worthonly the paper they are written on. Thus  Blue Helmets areincreasingly becoming the targets of uncontrolled armedgroups. Even as we hold this general debate  members ofpeace-keeping forces are dying in clashes with warlords.The Czech Republic welcomes the intensifyingdiscussion of the Secretary-General’s ""An Agenda forPeace"". The resolution adopted at the forty-seventh sessionForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 15of the General Assembly is a first step  however small  inthe right direction. However  much more intensivecooperation not only among Member States but also betweenMember States and the United Nations Secretariat is neededin order to create an effective mechanism of functioningpeace-keeping. The work of our Organization mustcorrespond to the changing character of peace-keeping. Oneinteresting idea is the proposal to create a working groupunder the auspices of the Security Council that would reviewthese issues and prepare proposals and recommendations.The considerable number of regional and domesticconflicts is a part of the global security picture. Cooperationbetween the United Nations and regional institutions isanother useful instrument for solving them. The Conferenceon Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) is oneorganization that plays an important role in the Euro-Asianarea. The first formal step towards cooperation between theUnited Nations and the CSCE was resolution 47/10  adoptedat the last session of the United Nations General Assembly.Not by accident  the cooperation and coordination of thesetwo organizations was formalized during Czechoslovakia’spresidency of the CSCE. The limited resources of bothorganizations force us to try to coordinate and complementtheir operations and missions.Guided by our own vital interests  we have beenstriving to develop closer cooperation and interaction withorganizations capable of giving effective security guarantees.This  however  does not mean we want passively to letothers look after our security. On the contrary  we wish tobe active participants in this two-way process. This effortinvolves  for example  the following: first  our constructivecontribution  as a country with an advanced nuclear industry towards the strengthening of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its extensionbeyond 1995; secondly  the adoption of obligations to reducethe risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction andtheir means of delivery  particularly through joining theMissile Technology Control Regime and the so-calledAustralia Group; and thirdly  the early ratification andthorough implementation of the Convention on theProhibition of the Development  Production  Stockpiling andUse of Chemical Weapons.A financial crisis is threatening our Organization. Thefinancial discipline of Member States is but one prerequisitefor improving the situation. Equally important is the needto make more effective use of available resources and tostrengthen the control of Member States in using them. Weneed to make better use of existing control mechanisms. Wefavour the creation of a strong  meaningful post of aninspector general.The United Nations system also pays great attention tothe problems of social development  and a lot of good workhas been done since development programmes andspecialized agencies were established. The Czech Republicconsiders the problems of economic and social developmentto be one of the priorities for international policy-making  asthese issues directly influence other current burning issues such as local and ethnic wars  drugs  poverty andundernourishment in some regions of the world.However  despite the numerous successes of specializedagencies  there is considerable space for further improvementof their performance and efficiency. We think there is roomfor improvement in  inter alia  focusing more carefully onspecific targets; eliminating overlap in some activities;utilizing available resources more effectively; reducingbureaucracy and enhancing flexibility; and developinggreater cooperation among agencies.Environmental issues are also high on our agenda  asparts of our country are in the most environmentallydevastated areas of the world. The situation is not onlytaking its toll on people’s health but is also undermining theeconomy of the country as a whole. Sustainabledevelopment is more than a new-fangled catchword for us:in our country  it means finding the right balance betweenenvironmental concerns and aspirations of development.The United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment (UNCED) was an important step forward intackling this problem in all its dimensions. AllUNCED-related decisions adopted at the forty-seventhsession of the United Nations General Assembly are veryimportant. The Czech Republic will take part in theirimplementation  even if not all of them relate directly to itsnational interests. We welcome the creation of theCommission on Sustainable Development. The mandate ofthe Commission  its programme of work and the experienceit has accumulated even during the short period of itsexistence indicate its budding importance. The CzechRepublic  as a member of the Commission  is seriouslyinvolved in its work.Central and Eastern parts of Europe border on a zoneof instability. We have gained priceless experience insolving problems resulting from the disintegration of thetotalitarian world  even as we perceive the world through theeyes of a stable European democracy. This dual vision canhelp us identify risks and seek their solutions. We feel we16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionhave something to contribute  and we are prepared toshoulder our share of responsibility for world affairs. Thisis one of the reasons why the Czech Republic submitted itscandidacy as a non-permanent member of the SecurityCouncil. We believe we will be able effectively to use ourexperience and our perception of the world  and we hopethat you will all support us."
"43",1854,"DEU",48,1993," Please accept my warmcongratulations  Sir  on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. I wish youluck and success in your high office. At the same time  Iextend a cordial welcome to the new Members of ourOrganization.Addressing the Assembly 20 years ago  Willy Brandtsaid that the Federal Republic of Germany’s purpose injoining the United Nations was to help serve the cause ofworld peace. That has always been  and will remain  thefundamental aim of German foreign policy. At that time  ina bipolar world  Germany was divided. In that year  1973 the October war broke out in the Middle East. In SouthAfrica the inhuman apartheid regime was dominant. Todaymy country is united in peace and harmony with ourneighbours. Today we can congratulate Israel  the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and neighbouring Arabcountries on a historic breakthrough. Today the policy ofapartheid has been overcome. Without the resolve to seekpeace  these developments would not have been possible.World peace  which appears to have come closer asbipolarity has receded  must not remain an unfulfilled vision.The international community’s desire for peace led to thefounding of the United Nations after the Second World War.It remains our moral and political obligation to fulfil thatlegacy. There can be no more important task. In the questfor peace we are faced with a new challenge and a newdanger  but we also have a historic opportunity.We are faced with the great challenge of overcominghunger and poverty around the world  of preserving thenatural sources of life  and of creating the foundations for along-term global population policy. When people have toleave their native lands  when human rights are violated there can be no peace. Peace is not merely the silence ofguns. Hence  economic and social challenges must be veryhigh on the global agenda. The world is deeply unjust. Thedistribution of mankind’s opportunities is woefully unequal.This we should not tolerate.The danger confronting us is that peace in many partsof the world is threatened by new conflicts  especially thoseof an ethnic nature. The continuing proliferation of modernweapons and weapon technology increases the destructivepotential of these conflicts.Our opportunity  after the end of the East-Westconfrontation  is to develop the United Nations into what itsfounding fathers intended it to be: the principal guardian ofpeace. In performing that role the United Nations must havethe support of the numerous other international organizationsthat are functioning successfully today.I truly believe that we can master the economic ecological and social challenges and overcome the danger ofa relapse into a confrontation of States  peoples  cultures andreligions only if we resolutely seize the historic opportunityto strengthen the global multilateral system and the UnitedNations.Today no country alone can cope with globalchallenges. Hence we must counteract nationalism withmultilateralism. German foreign policy is aimed atstrengthening the multilateral world order. It is committedto the goal of European integration. Its purpose is toharmonize and create a fair balance of interests. Germanforeign policy is therefore a policy within  in support of  andtogether with the United Nations.I agree with the Secretary-General: Peace can only bepreserved if we strike at the roots of conflict. His proposedagenda for development must go hand-in-hand with ""AnAgenda for Peace"". Misery  starvation and poverty are stillthe overriding problem in many countries.At the eighth session of the United Nations Conferenceon Trade and Development and at the Rio Conference  thedeveloping and industrial countries agreed on acomprehensive partnership for promoting development andprotecting the environment. For that partnership to besuccessful both sides  North and South  must contribute theirshare. By carrying out economic and political reforms making more efficient use of their funds and cutting militaryexpenditure  and ensuring greater democratic control andrespect for the rule of law  many developing countries haveembarked on the right course. The World Summit for SocialDevelopment  scheduled to take place in Copenhagen in14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session1995  must be a forum for dialogue on the social issuesre-emerging all over the world.The industrial countries have undertaken to support theefforts of the developing countries by improving the generalconditions for world trade in a spirit of solidarity. Suchassistance can never be more than help towards self-help.What is required is more entrepreneurial cooperation withdeveloping countries  more direct investment  improvedcooperation in the field of technology  the opening ofmarkets and the elimination of trade barriers. The UruguayRound of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) must at long last establish reliable rules for freetrade and be brought to a conclusion by December 15.Germany  one of the leading trading nations  is committedto these goals. If new trading blocs were to form  with theattendant conflicting interests  new political confrontationswould soon follow. Protectionism would be the worstoutcome.The global economy is in the throes of a fundamentalstructural change. International competition is becomingmore intense. Many highly industrialized societies areconfronted with fresh challenges. Unemployment andsluggish growth are unexpectedly severe burdens on theirproductive capacity  both domestically and externally. Onthe other hand  the trend towards a single world economyopens up the first opportunity for billions of people to offertheir products in all markets.All of us  industrial and developing countries alike must make peace with nature. The United Nations is calledupon to protect the natural foundations of life. I proposethat the United Nations develop an early-warning system forenvironmental disasters. The momentum of the UnitedNations Conference on Environment and Development mustbe maintained. My country is ready for comprehensivecooperation. Germany can make a special contribution particularly as regards the transfer of environment-friendlytechnologies.The population explosion is a threat to the planet’sequilibrium. Whereas in the eighteenth century the worldpopulation increased by a quarter of a billion in 75 years  itis now increasing by this number every three years. Mostof this increase is taking place in countries whose economicand ecological resources are already strained to the limit.Family planning must be enhanced  the poverty gap reduced and education and knowledge disseminated among womenand men alike. A successful International Conference onPopulation and Development  to be held in Cairo next year is therefore mandatory.Respect for human rights is a universal obligation. Itis a focal point of German foreign policy. Human rights andthe protection of minorities belong together. Racism cultural arrogance and the delusion of wanting to create""ethnically clean"" areas constitute a threat to peace.Yugoslavia is a terrible example of this. Where civic economic  cultural and religious rights of minorities areconcerned  the majority may not rule by fiat.The Declaration and Programme of Action of theVienna World Conference on Human Rights represent theconsensus opinion of the community of nations. Theyreaffirm the universal validity of the human rights. Now itis important to seek rapid implementation. I wish tomention five specific points:Firstly  my country has long advocated the appointmentof a high commissioner for human rights. He should beauthorized to take steps on his own initiative to protecthuman rights and to give active support to those countriesseeking to improve the human rights situation.Secondly  we need an international criminal court. TheInternational Law Commission has submitted a full draftstatute for such a court. The pressure on those who tramplehuman rights under foot must be increased now. Those whotorture on this Earth must live in fear of punishment.Thirdly  in order to prosecute speedily those who areresponsible for the ghastly violations of human rights in theformer Yugoslavia  the Security Council has set up an adhoc Tribunal. The elected judges must now begin their workright away. A chief prosecutor should be appointed withoutdelay.Fourthly  the non-governmental organizations havebecome part of the world’s conscience and therefore have anincreasingly important role to play in the defence of humanrights.Finally  the instruments for ensuring respect for humanrights must be given a higher priority in the United Nationsbudget.The crisis in the former Yugoslavia  and especially thewar in Bosnia and Herzegovina  is one of the mostdepressing episodes of our time. A Member of the UnitedNations has fallen victim to a war of conquest accompaniedby genocide and mass expulsions. For the first time sincethe Second World War  frontiers in Europe are beingredrawn by force of arms. The principles of the UnitedNations have been treated with contempt. The credibility ofForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 15our institutions - indeed the credibility of the United Nationsitself - is being put to the test.If the fighting continues  the winter will prove to be anawful disaster for the suffering people. It must therefore bestopped as quickly as possible and steps taken to ensure thathumanitarian aid is provided. We therefore support theGeneva efforts to settle the conflict  in spite of doubts aboutthe current plan  and we express special thanks to theCo-Chairmen  Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg  for thedifficult job they are doing.A settlement now seems within reach  but it must beaccepted by all parties to the conflict. No party must imposeits will on another. The Bosnian Muslims must be givenviable territory. We need an assurance that the communityof nations will be resolutely and actively involved in theimplementation of a settlement.We cannot tolerate a situation in which the Muslims who have lived in Europe for centuries  would have fewerrights than their Christian neighbours. Through preventivemeasures we must ensure that the tragedy of this war doesnot spill over into neighbouring regions. What is nowrequired is proposals for controlled disarmament in theregion. This is a task for the Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe (CSCE).After decades of war and bitter antagonism  the MiddleEast is experiencing a historic breakthrough towards peace.We all want the peace process to become irreversible.Germany and its partners in the European Community haveundertaken to provide political  economic and particularlyfinancial support. They have earmarked about a billiondeutschemarks for this purpose.I should like to express my respect for both sides fortheir political courage and their will for peace. I call uponthose who still hesitate to help sustain the peace process. Iappeal to all to renounce the use of force.The continuing proliferation of arms in many parts ofthe world is still highly disturbing. President Clinton’sproposals have our support. Encouraging progress has beenachieved in the form of the Convention placing a global banon chemical weapons and of the agreement reached on amandate for negotiations in the Geneva Conference onDisarmament with a view to a comprehensive test-ban treaty.The test moratorium must be extended. There must be nofurther testing.The nuclear and non-nuclear Powers alike are urged toconsolidate the non-proliferation regime. When the mattercomes up for decision in 1995  the Non-Proliferation Treatymust be extended indefinitely. As the representative of acountry which many years ago unilaterally and bindinglyrenounced the possession of nuclear weapons and othermeans of mass destruction  I appeal to all Members: accedeto the Non-Proliferation Treaty.The laying of mines in large regions in many countrieshas become a scourge for the population. It prevents thereturn of refugees and the resumption of farming.Thousands have been killed or horribly mutilated. It mustbe stopped. The European Community has  with oursupport  seized the initiative. We need a fund to financemine detection and disposal operations.My country’s European anchorage is indispensable onboth political and economic grounds. My Belgian colleague Willy Claes  has already explained the position of the 12members of the European Community.Stability in Europe cannot remain a privilege of theWestern nations. The peoples of the reformist countriesfought for their freedom and we encouraged them to do so.We shall not abandon them now. We must gradually openthe road to the Euro-Atlantic institutions for the countries ofCentral and Eastern Europe. Those institutions include theEuropean Community and the Council of Europe as well asthe Western European Union and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO). I am expecting a clear message fromthe NATO summit - which is to take place at the beginningof 1994 - like the one that came from the EuropeanCommunity summit meeting in Copenhagen. In this process no new ruptures must emerge. A lasting peaceful order inEurope is not feasible without including Russia.Over the last four years Germany has made a greaterfinancial effort than any other nation to help the reformistcountries on their road to democracy  the rule of law and afree market economy. This assistance  too  is a majorcontribution to conflict-prevention and the safeguarding ofpeace. In the present critical phase  Russia’s friends andpartners - who include the Germans in particular - mustcontinue to provide political and economic support forPresident Yeltsin’s reforms.I am concerned about developments in Georgia. Wemust achieve a cease-fire and work out a viable politicalsolution. This is a task for the United Nations in particular.16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe desire for peace makes it imperative for allcountries to seek closer regional cooperation.We supportintra-Africa efforts to resolve conflicts and welcome thestronger commitment on the part of the Organization ofAfrican Unity.We are gratified by the democratic changes to beobserved in Latin America in recent years. Nearlyeverywhere democracy and free-market principles haveasserted themselves and sources of conflict have  thank God been eliminated.The Association of South-East Asian Nations hasbecome an important instrument for cooperation in theAsia-Pacific region. European-Asian cooperation must beintensified.""An Agenda for Peace"" has become the lodestone forthe world Organization’s further development. I wish totake this opportunity  Mr. Secretary-General  to express mythanks for your commitment. The Security Council and theGeneral Assembly have constructively taken up the Agenda’sproposals. However  conflict prevention must begin at anearly stage. Preventing fires is better than having to putthem out. We must focus our energy on the possibilities ofpreventive diplomacy  confidence-building measures fact-finding and the early detection of conflicts.The CSCE must back the United Nations within itssphere of jurisdiction. The relations between the twoorganizations have been intensified. The CSCE should begiven wider scope for conflict prevention and crisismanagement.In wars and crises  the Blue Helmets have helped toprotect the civilian population  to prevent the spread ofwarfare and to initiate the transition to democracy. Some80 000 troops from more than 70 countries are engaged in17 peace-keeping missions around the world. They and theUnited Nations Secretariat’s Department of Peace-keepingOperations deserve our thanks.One of the most successful operations was the one inNamibia. In Cambodia the United Nations has sponsoredfree elections and restored hopes of lasting peace afterdecades of terror and oppression. Of course - and it isimportant to stress this - not all the hopes placed in theUnited Nations can be fulfilled  and it would be wrong todeny that difficulties have been encountered. But whatwould happen without the United Nations and the BlueHelmets? To the critics I therefore say that we need not lessbut more commitment to the United Nations.In Somalia starvation has been overcome. Thereconciliation process has been overshadowed by incidentsin which troops and civilians have been killed. These aretragedies  but without the United Nations Operation inSomalia  hundreds of thousands would have had to die.Germany has been providing humanitarian aid within thescope of this major peace-keeping operation  our largestcommitment of personnel so far within the framework of theUnited Nations.Our involvement in such operations has the backing ofthe German people. There is a consensus in our country infavour of widening our scope for contributing to peace. Weare engaged in a passionate debate over proposedconstitutional amendments which would enable Germany toparticipate in all United Nations operations withoutrestriction.A policy for peace also means strengthening the rule oflaw as opposed to the rule of the strong. If the UnitedNations is prevented from carrying out its mandate  it willhave to be in a position to authorize the Security Council toresort to force  as provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter.However  the use of military means should beconsidered only if we have a clear political blueprint forresolving the conflict. Force must always be the last resort.Consequently  our contribution to the United Nations willcontinue to be of a mainly political and economic nature.Greater emphasis will have to be placed on United Nationspeace-keeping measures in view of the growingresponsibilities and demands.First  the United Nations Secretariat’s Department ofPeace-keeping Operations must be improved logistically andorganizationally and in terms of staff. The GermanGovernment is willing to make further experts available tothe Secretariat.Secondly  effective crisis management presupposes theability to react swiftly. The Secretary-General’s initiative forthe establishment of stand-by forces has my support.Stand-by forces should not be confined to military units butshould include civilian personnel and experts ranging frompolice to election observers. But participation must alwaysbe voluntary and be subject to the fulfilment of nationalconditions.Thirdly  enhancing the efficiency of the United Nationspresupposes a link-up of military forces. The North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO) has declared its willingness toForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 17make its capacities available. The same holds true for theWestern European Union (WEU).Fourthly  in many countries military training is gearedsolely to the traditional duties of the army. The specifictasks of peace-keeping require a completely different kind oftraining. The national preparation of ""Blue-Helmet"" forcesneeds to be coordinated to a greater degree by the UnitedNations. For this  common training guidelines are needed.The United Nations should also create its own trainingcapacity; that is my view. Common training and exercisesare  at the same time  important steps in confidence-building.Fifthly  peace-keeping operations require soundfinancing. The responsibility for peace also includes theprompt and complete payment of contributions by allMembers.Humanitarian concerns have been of pivotal importancefor Germany’s involvement in United Nations activities fromthe very start. In the Middle East  in Africa  in South-EastAsia  in the Gulf region  in Somalia and in formerYugoslavia we are providing humanitarian assistance. Wehave assumed responsibility for transport  medical care  themonitoring of disarmament measures and the repatriation ofrefugees. Together with our partners in the EuropeanCommunity we have called for the creation of a post ofcoordinator for humanitarian assistance.Part of our humanitarian commitment is the readinessto assist refugees from the civil war  whose situation is verydistressing. We have admitted more than 350 000 refugeesfrom former Yugoslavia. I urge the General Assembly touse every opportunity to strengthen the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Mrs.Ogata deserves high praise for the job she is doing. Moreinternational solidarity and burden-sharing is called for. Wemust not abandon those countries which  as neighbouring ortarget countries for the refugees  are particularly affected.The aim must be to offer shelter to refugees from civil warsor other disasters near their home countries in order tofacilitate their early return to those countries. For this weneed binding rules. I therefore propose the drafting of aninternational convention to regulate large-scale refugeemovements.Another focal point of our involvement in UnitedNations activities has been what the Secretary-General refersto in his ""Agenda for Peace"" as post-conflict peace-building.Lasting peace depends on the establishment of democraticand market-economy structures based on the rule of law.Investment in the democratization process is an investmentin peace. My country  Germany  sees this as a priority of itscommitment to development. That is why Germanyparticipates in missions to observe elections  provideseconomic experts  and assists in the creation of democraticadministrative  judicial and police institutions.I should like to stress that a culture of peace is anotherprerequisite for lasting peace. Not only governments butalso individual citizens must develop the will for peace if wewant to overcome racial hatred and religious conflict. Aculture of peace encompasses a dialogue between ethnicgroups as well as between religions and cultures. TheEuropeans live next door to and in close contact with Islam.We need bridges of mutual understanding  not new enemyimages. We need to promote education for peace. TheUnited Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO)  with its mandate to foster relationsbetween nations  therefore deserves comprehensive support.Germany advocates the strengthening of all UnitedNations bodies. We do not want a never-ending discussionon reform  but greater efficiency. We welcome theSecretary-General’s efforts to reorganize the Secretariat.The efforts to revitalize the General Assembly and theEconomic and Social Council also meet with our fullsupport. We would be happy if the United Nations werebetter represented in Germany and have therefore made anoffer for the relocation of institutions of technicalcooperation to Bonn.The most important decisions on security and peace aretoday made in the Security Council. This is what theCharter envisaged right from the start. Anyone who wantspeace must strengthen the Security Council.In its response to the Secretary-General’s request  theFederal Government has stated that efficiency and credibilityare of equal importance for the future composition of theSecurity Council.Germany is prepared to assume responsibility as apermanent member of the Security Council also. I statedthis at the last session of the General Assembly. However we will be able to maintain and strengthen the credibility ofthe Council only if  in deliberating on reforming it  we alsotake into consideration the growing importance of the thirdworld.Finally  let me state that Germany wants to be and willbe a driving force in efforts to strengthen the UnitedNations. We need to achieve a basic consensus for theimportant tasks ahead of us. In my view this consensus lies18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionin the rule of law. The law protects the weak andlegitimizes force where it is unavoidable. The law is anexpression of partnership and is opposed to tyranny andhegemony. It is the acceptance of law that creates justice.Only where justice reigns can peace flourish."
"44",1892,"DJI",48,1993,"I wish to take this opportunityto congratulate Ambassador Insanally on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighthsession. I am confident that his great experience andwisdom will guarantee the success of this session.I wish also to pay a tribute to the President of the forty-seventh session  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria Mr. Stoyan Ganev  for his significant achievements and hisconstant  unfailing commitment to the work of theAssembly.Let me pay a well-deserved tribute also to HisExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  a man ready to faceany challenge and an ardent champion of human rights  forthe masterly and enlightened way in which he is heading theSecretariat of the Organization. My country appreciates thetireless efforts of the office of the Secretary-General as itstrives to keep the peace throughout the world.I take great pleasure in welcoming the States that havejust become Members of the United Nations  particularlyEritrea  which by dint of courage  self-denial and sacrificehas regained its dignity and its place in the great family ofindependent States.The opening of a new session of the General Assemblygives us an opportunity to share our thoughts on importantworld events and to mark a line of collective conduct inhuman affairs. The most striking trend over the past fewyears  one which has borne fruit  is that of the protection ofhuman rights vis-à-vis the State. This ideology of humanrights and minority rights has been decisive: today  evilsthat had plagued the international community havedisappeared or are disappearing  for example the seeminglyunbridgeable ideological gap between East and West  thesituation in South Africa  and the Arab-Israeli conflict.Entire regions see the possibility of releasing significantintellectual and material resources which were once devotedto preparing for conflict but which now can be used toestablish genuine  welcome peace.We must hail the courage of visionary leaders who fighting against the current  have dared to challenge thosewho saw security concerns as the only political wisdom andto blaze new trails for their peoples and for the world.The sight of the Chairman of the Palestine LiberationOrganization and the Prime Minister of Israel signing theirhistoric agreement in Washington  D.C.  and shaking handswith each other has been for many of us a source of hope inspiration and the will to persevere. They deserve ourpraise for having recognized each other and engaged indialogue  thereby taking the first step down the long roadthat we must now follow to arrive at a viable and lastingpeace.That courageous decision shows all those who refuse tospeak save through the voices of their guns that it is stillpossible to break free from the grip of hatred and denial ofeach other’s existence.The process that has been set inmotion in the search for a comprehensive and lastingsettlement must of necessity be based on Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). It deserves the fullpolitical and financial support of the internationalcommunity.In an equally explosive context  the white minorityregime of South Africa has embarked on a process ofpolitical reform by signing an agreement for provisionalpower sharing with the country’s black majority. Thatcrucial measure will have a lasting effect on the politicalstability  economic progress and prosperity both of thatcountry and the entire region.This development represents a threat to the extremistand intransigent minorities  which threaten chaos andanarchy if their demands are not met. However  we areconvinced that the Government of South Africa and theAfrican National Congress  acting in a spirit of openness andcompromise  will oppose any concession or half measurethat might jeopardize the long march towards a multiracialand egalitarian society. In that connection  we support theappeal made by Mr. Mandela that the economic sanctionsimposed upon his country be lifted to facilitate the transitionto democratic rule.Unfortunately  South Africa is not the only battlefieldfor extremists. We must recognize that Mozambique Somalia  Bosnia and Angola  to mention but a few  are stillthe victims of fratricidal conflicts. What we are witnessingis a phenomenon that was long contained and suppressed bythe antagonisms that existed between the two power blocsduring the cold-war period  when super-Power pressureswere so great that satellite countries were often employed asintermediaries in the settlement of accounts. As a result internal conflicts were promptly nipped in the bud. Today the concept of two blocs is no longer valid  andconflagrations are breaking out almost everywhere.Unfortunately  the task of dealing with these hotbeds ofconflict has fallen to the United Nations  and  as a result  allnations must now participate in one way or another in theactivities of the Organization.We are convinced that there are other ways of haltingthe renewed outbreak of such conflicts than through asystematic recourse to force. Naturally  violations ofinternational law and human values and the ever-increasingcontempt for human life are of central concern to theinternational community. However  we must recognize thatthe United Nations is suffering from inadequate structures from poor organization and from a lack of financing  as wellas from a personnel shortage that renders it impotent to dealwith such situations. It is therefore vitally important that theOrganization be provided with the financial and humanresources it needs to remedy its shortcomings.My Government believes that the United Nations shouldhave its own volunteer rapid-deployment force underSecurity Council control and the command of the Secretary-General  prepared to be deployed at any time in hotbeds oftension  for we are constantly being made aware that the bestmethod of dealing with conflicts is to prevent them. Webelieve in preventive diplomacy. Such a force should betrained and armed for limited and defensive actions andprovided with a logistical support capable of dealing withany eventuality.However  we are aware of the difficulties such a forcewould face. The principle of humanitarian interventionwould conflict with the notion of State sovereignty  but atthe present juncture the United Nations is still the onlyavailable ""fire department "" if I may use that term. It is thushigh time that its finances were put in order  even if thatentailed granting it the power to seek access to other sourcesof financing  while reinforcing integrity and austerity throughthe establishment of a general inspection body.Apart from those financial questions  we believe thatthe United Nations system also needs reform. The SecurityCouncil should be expanded by the addition of a permanentmember for each region  thus modifying the monopoly onthe right of the veto. Indeed  the United Nations must beperceived as an international body that expresses theconcerns of every sovereign country and in whichtransparency and globalization prevail.All of those questions arise each time the Organizationintervenes in a given conflict. In Somalia  in Angola  inMozambique  the Organization has suffered from its inabilityto mobilize the military personnel required for the scheduledperiod  to such an extent that its mission finds itself at astandstill. In Angola a tragic situation exists owing to theOrganization’s inability to disarm the combatants.Fortunately  in Mozambique a spirit of compromise hasprevailed over deadly passions. As for Somalia  the UnitedStates initiative under the auspices of the Unified Task Forcehas made it possible to avoid an unprecedented disaster.The United Nations experience in Somalia is far fromthe negative one it is casually described as being. A missiondesigned to ensure a safe environment and the distributionof humanitarian aid has achieved remarkable progress.Hunger exists only in a few remote areas  violence issporadic and limited but controlled. Training centres andhospitals have been opened  and there are signs that businessis beginning to pick up. Political reconciliation meetingshave been held by the clan leaders in various parts of thecountry  and the creation of a basic political framework  thedistrict council  is well under way. We can confidently lookforward to the groundroots development of the regionalcouncil that will elect future political leaders. Somalians areparticipating to a greater degree in the development processof planning  identifying and setting priorities.We believe that the police services and judicial systemthat will soon be re-established will be capable of assuminga large part of the responsibilities for the maintenance oforder and security in Somalia.As a result  we would reiterate our appeal to donors tofulfil the financial commitments they have made to theOrganization  because the complete success of the UnitedNations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II) will dependon it. Should they fail to do so  the procrastinations andfailings of UNOSOM II will be a great encouragement to theso-called warlords  skilled as they are in clan violence  anddestroy any chance of the development of democracy andthe rule of law.We would also recall that in its initial desire to bringabout the prompt restoration of political structures theOrganization agreed to work with the elements that wereavailable  which gave the Somali ""hawks"" an exaggeratedidea of their own importance. It is vital that such detractorsbe stripped of their ability to do harm  so that truedemocracy can be established. In our opinion  that is theonly way to avoid getting stuck in a rut of passivity  as hasoccurred in the United Nations experience in Bosnia  wherethe worst violations of basic human rights have merely givenrise to expressions of indignation or verbal condemnations apart from a few resolutions that have remained a dead letterwhile extortions and ""ethnic cleansing"" continue  in defianceof international law.In addition  the excessive delay in setting up the WarTribunal has only aggravated the morbid passivity of theinternational community. Nevertheless  we are hopeful thatthat Tribunal will soon begin to hold sessions  with thepersonnel  powers  funding and cooperation of MemberStates that will be vital to its effective operation. We arestressing this point because we deplore the policy of doublestandards being pursued by the United Nations  a policy thatallows the criminals in Bosnia to operate with impunitywhile mercilessly pursuing others elsewhere in the world.This unquestionably discredits United Nations activities andexposes collective security to the insatiable appetites ofaggressors and warlords of all kinds.When resolutions are adopted  the United Nations mustensure that they are respected and complied with  or""collective security"" will come to mean ""selective security"".Unfortunately  ethnic and community conflicts are notthe only threats to world peace. The poverty of thecountries of the third world  compounded by artificialborders inherited from the colonial era  constitutes anothercatalyst for conflict  because this completely misguidedcarve-up created territorial entities that are scarcelyeconomically viable. These countries  once buffer States forthe super-Powers  have become veritable arsenals  and  withthe added element of poverty  the regimes in power thustend to opt more often for force than for reason.In the face of so many constraints  building aprosperous and harmonious nation with a common identityand inspired by the values and principles of democracy hasbeen a daunting challenge. Many developing countriesembroiled in internal strife and turmoil have become boggeddown in chaos  leading to the disintegration of the State.Hence  populations fleeing these regions invade suchcountries as Djibouti  which is currently groaning under theburden of 130 000 refugees  equivalent to 23 per cent of itspopulation.We bear this immense burden nevertheless  because  inthe end  the only driving force of the great global villagethat the world has become is interdependence. Thus assistance to developing countries should be increased  asshould the provision of skills and technology throughmultilateral cooperation. Furthermore  we believe thatForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 43regional economic integration is the basis for continuingprogress and lasting prosperity.With the emergence of important regional economicblocs  our countries are threatened with marginalization. Inthe context of economic stagnation  the great hope born ofthe end of the cold war has gone up in smoke. We are stillawaiting the extra resources that might have been allocatedto development. Worse still  the commitment of developedcountries to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross nationalproduct - a modest goal set by the United Nations fordevelopment aid - has been met by only two countries. Theothers have barely managed to achieve 0.2 per cent at themost.Despite a difficult and sometimes chaotic situation  anumber of developing countries have made substantialprogress and present the necessary conditions to benefit fromsignificant and ongoing assistance  while others are regardedas insolvent by international lending institutions.It is obvious that we desperately need increasedmultilateral and bilateral aid to enable us to meet ourbudgetary and investment needs because our private sourcesof investment have dwindled. To this gloomy picture wemust add the misappropriation of aid or mismanagement ofit. Nevertheless  many countries have committedthemselves to economic reform and structural readjustment which require increased aid  especially from the internationalfinancial institutions.My country  responding to the rapid developmentstaking place in international trade and navigation - the basesof our economy - has revamped its port facilities  financialservices and communication networks.Anxious not to sail against what has been called thewind of democracy  we have undertaken political reforms elections have been held and a new Constitution has beenadopted defining and guaranteeing individual rights.Despite a very hostile and very unstable regionalenvironment  Djibouti has always been an island of stabilityand a safe haven. The ill effects of the deep turmoil in ourregion have considerably weakened the Republic of Djibouti and the deployment of enormous quantities of armaments inthe region has not helped to maintain a peaceful climate andenvironment.Thus  the Republic of Djibouti will come to have itsown share of political troubles  a natural extension ofregional instability. But these troubles will be contained because Djibouti will strengthen its nation by discouragingviolence.Such are the road taken and the commitment made bythe Republic of Djibouti to preserve and strengthen peace athome and throughout the world."
"45",1914,"DMA",48,1993,"On behalf of thedelegation of the Commonwealth of Dominica  I amhonoured to congratulate you  Sir  and your country  theCooperative Republic of Guyana  on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.I am particularly pleased that this position is held this year for the first time  by a national of a country that is amember of the Caribbean Community and I have no doubtthat your intellect and wide experience as one of theCaribbean’s most outstanding diplomats will ensureexcellence in the performance of your duties. I assure youof the full cooperation of the delegation of theCommonwealth of Dominica in the conduct of the affairs ofthis General Assembly.The Commonwealth of Dominica wishes to congratulateAndorra  the Czech Republic  Eritrea  The Former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia  Monaco and the Slovak Republic ontheir admission to membership of the United Nations. Theinternational community is  in the words of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali:""Humanity’s best hope in the pursuit of peace development and human rights"". (A/48/1  para. 513)We therefore welcome these new Members as they join inthe commitment to world peace  development and supportfor democracy and human rights.The universality of membership is an importantprinciple of the United Nations. We believe that  in keepingwith this principle and in accordance with the establishedpattern of parallel representation of divided countries in theUnited Nations  the exceptional case of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan should be seriously considered by theinternational community at the next session of the GeneralAssembly. The Republic of China on Taiwan  with its richnatural and human resources could  if given the opportunity make a significant contribution to the internationalcommunity. Its people are also entitled to enjoy the rightsenjoyed by all populations of the Members of this worldbody. The Commonwealth of Dominica therefore supportsthe efforts of the Republic of China on Taiwan to obtain fullmembership of the United Nations after being unable toparticipate for 22 years.Permit me to congratulate Secretary-GeneralBoutros Boutros-Ghali on his ongoing reform efforts aimedat streamlining the operations of the United Nations. Thestate of the Organization’s finances is an issue which shouldbe of concern to all its Members. In that regard theCommonwealth of Dominica is making every effort tohonour its financial commitments to the Organization.As the international community takes on greaterresponsibilities in its efforts to establish a more stable worldorder  restructuring the Organization with improved costeffectiveness is becoming ever more critical. TheOrganization must do its utmost to avoid wasting limitedresources. However  the effect of cost-cutting on theinterests of small developing countries needs to be examinedclosely. While the United Nations becomes more active inpeace-keeping in various parts of the world  programmesaimed at assisting developing countries must not be allowedto suffer. We firmly believe that the right to developmentis an inalienable right  a right of every human person and ofall peoples.Dominica’s economy is entirely dependent  at thepresent time  on the banana industry and on favoured accessto our traditional markets in Europe. Our industry  vital tothe survival of the Dominican people  is being threatened bythe major banana producers of Latin America  although theWindward Islands industry accounts for only 2 per cent ofthe world’s production of bananas. A threat to the bananaindustry in Dominica is also a threat to the fundamentalhuman rights of its people as the collapse of this industrycould lead to economic collapse  social upheaval andpolitical disaster. The same prospect looms over the otherWindward Islands of St. Lucia  St. Vincent and Grenada with consequential effects on the other States of theOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). Indeed just last week we heard of serious unrest in St. Lucia as adirect consequence of adverse trends in banana prices. Thisis an augury of what could happen in any or all of theWindward Islands.We call on the international community to supportDominica in its efforts to ensure the survival of its economyand the protection of its peoples’ political  civil  economic social and cultural rights. More particularly  I call on ourLatin American neighbours to honour the spirit of theDeclaration of Managua and to take into account theseverely adverse impact on the economies of OECS Statesthat their policies on bananas  not critical to their owneconomies  are likely to have on ours.Democracy and human rights have been a priority ofthe world community since the inception of the UnitedForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 15Nations. Over the years there has been much debate on theuniversality of human rights and its indivisibility from  andlink to  development. The decision of the GeneralAssembly  by its resolution 45/155  to convene the ViennaConference to deal with crucial issues surrounding thepromotion and protection of human rights was timely andsignificant. Dominica applauds the efforts of those whoworked towards the success of this important and historicConference. I am particularly proud of Dominica’sparticipation in the preparatory process as well as in theWorld Conference  which is an indication of our fullcommitment to the universalization of respect for humanrights and the preservation of democracy.Representatives at the World Conference gave a clearsignal that it is necessary to increase financial and otherresources to the United Nations Centre for Human Rightsand the regional Commissions in order to reinforce theirability to provide greater technical cooperation between theUnited Nations and regional and national human rightsinstitutions. As the focal point for human rights activities ofthe United Nations and the primary organizational institutionwithin the Secretariat for the implementation of the humanrights programme  the Centre for Human Rights must beprovided with adequate means for carrying out its mandate.On the international scene  the breakthroughs made inthe Middle East and South Africa must be celebrated.Recent decisions taken by the leaders of those countries areencouraging and augur well for the future. The Madridpeace process launched in 1991 has not been in vain.Dominica noted with great satisfaction and pleasure thesigning of the peace agreement between Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization - an agreement which willserve to secure a firm foundation for the mutual recognitionof the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. We sincerely hopethat this agreement will eventually bring an end to thepersistent violence and conflict that have plagued the MiddleEast for over four decades.One year ago in this body  Dominica called forconstructive and open dialogue between the African NationalCongress and the Pretoria regime in an effort to arrive at anearly agreement on majority rule in South Africa. PresidentDe Klerk and Nelson Mandela’s recent actions are a clearindication of their interest in peaceful progress towards atruly just and democratic society in the affairs of thatcountry.The finalization of the demarcation of the boundarybetween Kuwait and Iraq is a step towards the enhancementof stability and security in that region. We welcome theadoption of Security Council resolution 833 (1993)  in whichthe inviolability of this boundary is guaranteed  and we callupon Iraq to respect the terms of the resolution.It is indeed disheartening that while progress is beingmade in the protection of human rights in certain parts of theworld  the rights of the people of our Caribbean sister island Haiti  continue to be violated even after moves by membersof the international community to suspend sanctions againstHaiti. Dominica  acting on Security Council resolution861 (1993)  ordered the immediate suspension of allsanctions against Haiti  following the confirmation of RobertMalval as Prime Minister.The Governors Island Agreement of July 1993 offereda glimmer of hope for the restoration of democracy andconstitutional order in that country and for the eventualreturn of President Aristide to power. These hopes wereshattered by the actions of those who officially sanctionviolence  threatening the lives of constitutionally appointedofficials. The members of the de facto regime mustunderstand that the international community will not standidly by if the terms of the Governors Island Agreement arenot respected. If the parties in Haiti fail to comply in goodfaith with this Agreement  Dominica will be ready toreactivate sanctions in keeping with the United Nationsresolution to that effect. We will also do whatever we canwithin our limited resources to contribute to the restorationof democracy in Haiti. In that regard  Dominica is willingto contribute to the civilian police and training contingent toHaiti to assist in the return of President Aristide to the fullexercise of his constitutional office and the stabilization ofHaiti. In the meantime  we support President Aristide’s callfor the immediate replacement of the Chief of Police  aprecondition to the security of the officials of the legitimateregime in that country.The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and inSomalia continues to be cause for concern to all those whosupport the promotion and protection of human rights. Wedeplore the human tragedy resulting from ethnic differencesand more specifically the barbaric torture and killing ofhundreds of innocent people. We also condemn recentevents in Nigeria  which demonstrate a lack of respect forthe wishes of the people and a violation of their rights toparticipate in the affairs of their country.While we are focusing on the subject of human rights it is fitting that we make reference to the International Yearof the World’s Indigenous People launched on 10 December1992. The rights of indigenous people all over the worldcontinue to be violated as they fight to preserve their cultureand identity. This is of particular concern to us in Dominicaas our country is one of the few countries with an16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionindigenous Carib population  a courageous and hard-workingpeople with a rich history and culture. I urge theinternational community to lend its support to programmesand activities designed to allow for the participation of ourindigenous peoples and other minorities in every aspect ofthe life of our countries. We in the Caribbean should havea special interest in this matter when we recall that within 28years of the arrival of Christopher Columbus in our part ofthe world  the entire indigenous population of the Bahamashad been wiped out by the European conquerors. Thefailure of the industrialized nations to contribute significantlyto the special fund is a matter of deep regret  which can yetbe reversed.Dominica has played a vital role in the regional andinternational effort to include women fully in thedevelopment process and it hopes to participate in the FourthWorld Conference on Women to be held in Beijing in 1995.We are particularly concerned about the needs and situationsof our indigenous women and the necessity for specialprogrammes to address these needs. I wish to expresssatisfaction at the establishment of a regional office of theUnited Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)in the Caribbean and look forward to its support andcooperation in all aspects of women’s affairs.General Assembly resolutions 46/91  46/94 and 45/106called for a set of global targets on ageing for the year 2001to provide a pragmatic focus for the broad goals of theInternational Plan of Action and to accelerate implementationof the Plan. In accordance with the aforementionedresolutions  a National Committee on Ageing was establishedin Dominica. The Committee is responsible for developinga national plan of action and making inputs into a regionalplan of action on ageing. We call on the internationalcommunity to support programmes tailored to the needs ofsenior citizens in keeping with national policies.The sustainability of life on our planet is dependent onthe importance we place on conservation of the environment.Dominica reaffirms its political commitment made at theEarth Summit held last year to pursue sustainabledevelopment.We have recently acceded to the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change  the ViennaConvention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer  and theMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the OzoneLayer and its amendment  conventions which play a key rolein the protection of our environment. Sustaining theenvironment is compatible with economic growth anddevelopment and is essential to sustainable development.However  it demands considerable additional resourceswhich developing countries such as Dominica do notpossess. We realize that we have an obligation to contributeto global solutions but additional finances are needed toassist in the many actions we will have to undertake toconserve the environment and follow sustainabledevelopmental practices. We call on the internationalcommunity to strengthen and give fuller support toinstitutions such as the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) and the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme (UNEP) which are concerned with assistingdeveloping countries to achieve sustainable development.We also call on the industrialized countries to offer greaterassistance to developing countries in the latter’s efforts tomake the transition to environmentally friendly technologiesand economic activity. The industrialized countries of theworld  which have disproportionately contributed to theenvironmental devastation that has occurred over the past200 years  must take seriously their responsibility tocontribute to the Global Environment Facility. The abilityof developing countries to contribute to environmentalsustainability depends on this.Dominica welcomes the decision of the United Nationsto organize the Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States in Barbadosin 1994. We intend to participate fully in this laudableeffort.The United Nations now offers hope for a future ofpeace  security and development. Let us not allow ourlegitimate emphasis on peacemaking and peace-keeping todivert our attention from the equally legitimate demands ofthe developing world for development and security.The delegation of Dominica salutes you  Mr. President and wishes you a very successful presidency of this sessionof the General Assembly."
"46",1957,"DNK",48,1993,"Let me begin bycongratulating President Insanally of Guyana on his electionto the presidency of the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. I feel confident that under his guidance we shallsucceed in strengthening the United Nations and establishingpeace and prosperity.The number and importance of the challenges facingthe United Nations after its almost 50 years of existence callfor reforms. The number of Members is increasing. Nowthat the cold war has ended  the United Nations  and notablythe Security Council  is in a better position than ever tofunction as foreseen in the Charter. The peoples of theworld are looking more and more to the United Nations tosolve their conflicts. The United Nations is expected tobring political stability and economic prosperity to all partsof the world. The United Nations is expected to play aleading role in surmounting the poverty gap. It is expectedto secure ecologically sustainable development. The UnitedNations is expected to provide development assistance Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 29environmental assistance and emergency assistance. It isexpected to play a leading role in securing democracy andrespect for human rights  including women’s and children’srights. It is expected to bring relief to refugees anddisplaced persons. And the United Nations is expected toprevent the spread of the means of mass destruction.Reform of the United Nations is necessary to meetthese challenges. Let me concentrate on seven items on thereform agenda.First  Denmark attaches particular importance to therole of the Security Council as stated in the Charter. Theefficiency of the Council in making decisions during therecent past has raised new expectations as to its ability torespond to crises.It is therefore important to ensure that the Councilmembership reflects the situation of today. The Governmentof Denmark recognizes that the developing countries have acase for improving their representation. We also recognizethat there are countries with global influence andresponsibilities that may wish to see this acknowledged inthe composition of the Security Council. Those MemberStates will  I am sure  also assume a special responsibilityvis-à-vis the activities of the United Nations and  inparticular  to contribute politically  militarily and financiallyto the implementation of the Council’s decisions.As my second point I wish to recall that Denmark hasalways participated actively in the peace-keeping operationsof the United Nations. Consequently  it stands ready todiscuss how to strengthen the Organization in the area ofpeace-keeping  peacemaking and preventive diplomacy. TheNordic countries intend to follow this question withparticular interest with a view to putting forward proposalsduring this session of the Assembly.The deployment of a largely Nordic peace-keepingforce in Macedonia is a concrete example of preventivedeployment. In addition  Denmark is setting up a reactionbrigade of 4 500 soldiers. They could be deployed in peace-keeping  peacemaking and humanitarian United Nationsoperations. We are ready to make part of that forceavailable for the United Nations stand-by force arrangement.The stand-by force arrangement could be vital in improvingthe planning  reducing the lead-time and increasing theflexibility in the peace-keeping field.Denmark supports a more active role for the UnitedNations in conflict prevention and crisis management. Iwelcome the fact that some of the recommendations in ""AnAgenda for Peace"" in this respect have already beenimplemented.Thirdly  the World Conference on Human Rights inJune this year in Vienna reaffirmed the universal characterof human rights. The conference also focused on the humanrights of women  and rightly so: women’s rights are humanrights.The General Assembly should decide to establish thepost of high commissioner for human rights  asrecommended by that Conference. We should also takesteps substantially to increase the resources for the UnitedNations human rights programme  including the UnitedNations Centre for Human Rights.There are times when the principle of non-interferencein the internal affairs of a Member State must yield to adecision by the international community to secure respect forfundamental human rights and freedoms  such as freedomfrom hunger and protection from genocide. Furthermore  theright of the civilian population to receive humanitarianassistance must also be respected  regardless of nationalfrontiers.Denmark fully supports efforts to secure the safety andprotection of United Nations personnel operating in areas ofarmed conflict.Fourthly  we also need a strong United Nations in theeconomic and social fields. The United Nations mustrespond effectively to the economic and social needs of thedeveloping countries. There can be no lasting peace andsecurity unless the growing inequalities are addressed. The""agenda for development"" to be drafted in the coming yearby the Secretary-General will  it is hoped  contribute tosetting the priorities for the United Nations for the twenty-first century.By attaining the accepted United Nations targets forofficial development assistance - 0.7 per cent of grossnational product and within that 0.15 per cent to the leastdeveloped countries - we would dramatically increase thevolume of support for the developing countries. That wouldalso clearly demonstrate the world’s commitment to dealseriously with its economic and social problems.Fifthly  as is well known  Denmark contributessubstantially to United Nations development activities. Ourcontributions must be used to the optimum benefit ofdeveloping countries and not lost in bureaucracy andinefficiency. We must convince donors that the United30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionNations and its funds and programmes can serve as efficientchannels for a large part of their development assistance. Ifnot  other channels will increasingly be used. MemberStates must demonstrate their commitment to fundamentalreform - not just window-dressing.During the past year a compromise solution forrestructuring and revitalizing the United Nations in theeconomic and social fields was carefully negotiated  butfinally not agreed upon. The Government of Denmarkdeeply regrets this situation. We sincerely hope that it willbe remedied by this session of the General Assembly.Sixthly  it must be recognized that social peace is asimportant as strategic peace. We see the World Summit forSocial Development to be held in Copenhagen in March1995 as an opportunity to put people at the centre ofdevelopment. To us  democratic practices and fairdistribution of resources are closely related to dynamiceconomic development.The Copenhagen Summit and the fourth WorldConference on Women will both mark the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations in 1995. The preparationsfor the women’s Conference should lead to a substantialinput for the Copenhagen Summit. Likewise  the outcomeof the Copenhagen Summit ought to be a strong messagefrom the world’s leaders signalling their commitment toclosing the gap between men’s and women’s social andeconomic opportunities.My seventh point concerns the Secretariat. Since hetook office the Secretary-General has carried out a numberof changes in the Secretariat. I commend the Secretary-General for these changes and assure him of our support inhis efforts to make the Secretariat more efficient.All efforts should be undertaken to eradicate corruption waste and mismanagement in the Secretariat. I welcome theestablishment of the post of Assistant Secretary-General forInspections and Investigations. This is the first step towardsthe creation of the post of Inspector-General. But suchinitiatives cannot of themselves solve the financial crisis ofthe United Nations. That requires that Member States paytheir assessed contributions on time and in full. That is oneof the basic requirements for membership of theOrganization.I fail to understand how Member States  including someof the permanent members of the Security Council  can callfor United Nations assistance  including in peace-keepingoperations  and then not pay. This leaves the United Nationsunable to perform vital functions. It also leaves troop -contributors such as Denmark with the problem that theUnited Nations does not honour its financial obligations tous - that is  to repay expenses for Danish United Nationspersonnel and equipment.Let me now turn to a few current problems facing theworld and the United Nations.In the Middle East we are witnessing a historicbreakthrough. I pay tribute to the Israelis and thePalestinians for having taken this step towards acomprehensive  just and lasting solution. I commendNorway for its role in bringing about this agreement.I also welcome the fact that Israel and Jordan havesigned an agenda for further negotiations. I hope thatprogress will soon be made in the Israeli-Syrian andIsraeli-Lebanese tracks of the peace process.Ample support  both economic and political  is essentialto keep momentum  and must be provided by theinternational community. Denmark  at an early stage together with the other Nordic countries  decided to pledgea substantial amount. We have also demonstrated ourcommitment to the developments in the Middle East regionthrough the European Community  the major donor in thiscontext.In contrast  it is with dismay we see the developmentsin the former Yugoslavia. The international communityshould accept only a solution reached by peaceful means andnegotiations. In this connection  I pay tribute to the tirelessefforts of Lord Owen and Mr. Thorvald Stoltenberg.The solution to the crises must respect theindependence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosniaand Herzegovina. We cannot accept a territorial solutiondictated by Serbs and Croats at the expense of the BosnianMuslims. It is extremely important now that all parties showthe necessary flexibility in order to arrive at a solution theyall can freely agree to. Such an arrangement must ensurethe protection of human rights and the rights of minorities.Sanctions will remain in place until conditions for theirlifting have been met. They should not be eased before apeace agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina is under faithfulimplementation by the Serbian side. Future attempts tohinder humanitarian aid and the guaranteed free passage ofconvoys are unacceptable and will have seriousconsequences for relations between the party responsible andthe European Community.Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 31By its resolution 827 (1993)  the Security Councildecided to establish the International Tribunal for theProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations ofInternational Humanitarian Law committed in the Territoryof the Former Yugoslavia since 1991. Denmark stronglysupports this decision.The conflict in the former Yugoslavia is probably themost difficult task taken on by the United Nations in itshistory. Denmark participates in the United NationsProtection Force with almost 1 300 peace-keepers and hasmade substantive contributions to the European CommunityMonitoring Mission. Large numbers of Danes are alsoinvolved in the humanitarian work carried out under theauspices of the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees. In addition  Denmark has madelarge financial contributions to the various international reliefprogrammes and through Danish non-governmentalorganizations.Responding to the calls for swift and effectiveimplementation of Security Council resolution 836 (1993) onsafe areas  the Nordic countries have decided to field a jointNordic United Nations battalion group of about 1 300 mento protect the safe areas around Tuzla in Bosnia andHerzegovina. The force is expected to be ready fordeployment in October. That decision is evidence of thewillingness of the Nordic countries to make theircontribution to resolving the tragic conflict and protect thecivilian population from the horrors of war.In the African continent  we see both hope andcontinued distress  regional conflicts and violations of basichuman rights.As Mr. Nelson Mandela eloquently told the SpecialCommittee against Apartheid last Friday  historic advancestowards democracy in South Africa have been achieved. Iwelcome his call to lift the economic and diplomaticsanctions vis-à-vis his country. I also share his view thatthis will give added impetus to the process  and strengthenthe forces  of democratic change.I wish to recall the decision of the EuropeanCommunity and its member States on 8 June 1993 to adjusttheir policy towards South Africa concurrently withdevelopments towards majority rule and democracy.Denmark stands ready to support South African effortsto normalize relations with the United Nations. The UnitedNations  for its part  should support South Africa during itsdifficult transitional period. An urgent priority should be tosupport the first democratic elections. It is essential thatthey be free and fair. I can only echo Mr. Mandela’s calllast week to the Security Council to consider how the UnitedNations can best support South Africa in this endeavour. Itmust be ensured that this last mile on the road to democracyis successful. Denmark intends to make a substantialcontribution. We will also - once the Transitional ExecutiveCouncil has been established - initiate a programme oftransitional assistance to South Africa amounting toapproximately 600 million Danish kroner  or about $100million.The level of violence in South Africa remainsunacceptably high; it is the single most serious threat to theprocess. We appeal to all parties to make every effort tostop the violence. The international community shouldcontinue to support such efforts.In Somalia the situation is still very grave. Thedeplorable actions in the form of continued attacks directedagainst the United Nations Operation in Somalia forces andrelief and aid personnel cannot be condemned stronglyenough. All parties in the civil strife must understand thatviolence does not pay in the long run. We support theefforts by the United Nations to bring about a negotiatedsettlement in Somalia as well as the efforts to relieve thesuffering of the people.Civil strife and violations of the most basic humanrights have characterized the Sudan for far too long. TheSecretary-General has appointed a Special EnvoyHumanitarian Affairs for the Sudan. Denmark urges allparties to seek political solutions to the problems of thecountry. We fully support the work of the Special Envoy aswell as other steps to redress the prevailing situation including the violation of human rights.Denmark congratulates the people of Cambodia on thehistoric and successful elections for a Constituent Assemblyand on that Assembly’s presentation of a new constitution.The impressively high voter participation and the ConstituentAssembly’s dedication in fulfilling its task constitute avictory for democracy and for the peace process.I also wish to thank the Secretary-General  the UnitedNations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) andparticipating international polling-station officers for theirenormous effort and hard work.The international community must continue its supportfor the peace process and for the reconstruction of32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionCambodia. I can confirm Denmark’s commitment in thatrespect.This year  1993  is the International Year of theWorld’s Indigenous People. The Government of Denmarkwishes to promote indigenous peoples’ own organizationswith a view to their full participation in political  economic social and cultural life. In collaboration with the Home RuleGovernment of Greenland  we support all efforts to increaseawareness of the special situation facing indigenous peoples including the Inuit of Greenland.A particular concern of Denmark is that the indigenouspeoples who have been permanent residents of the Arctic formillenniums are at risk from environmental degradation. On16 September 1993 the Government of Denmark and theHome Rule Government of Greenland hosted the secondMinisterial Conference on the Arctic Environment  at Nuuk the capital of Greenland. In the Nuuk Declaration  adoptedand signed at that Conference  the eight Arctic countriesrecognized the special role of indigenous peoples inenvironmental management and in development in the Arcticand the significance of their knowledge and traditionalpractices. The Government of Denmark will establish andfund a secretariat to promote the indigenous peoples’effective participation in the Arctic Environmental ProtectionStrategy and in the achievement of sustainable developmentin the Arctic.In conclusion  let me state that there is no alternative toour United Nations. Only the United Nations has thenecessary legitimacy to undertake humanitarian action peace-keeping operations  the creation of an internationaltribunal  and assistance to suffering peoples around theworld.At the same time  the need for reforms in the UnitedNations is evident. The job facing all of us as MemberStates is to agree in concrete terms on such reforms. Wemust show that behind the words spoken from this rostrumlies a will to enable the United Nations to serve the manyfunctions we the peoples are asking for."
"47",2002,"DOM",48,1993,"The delegation of theDominican Republic takes great pleasure in extending itswarmest congratulations to Mr. Samuel Insanally on hiswell-merited election to preside over the General Assemblyat this forty-eighth session. A man from our America - and more specifically  from the Caribbean region  where both ofour countries are located - he has the required abilities andexperience successfully to guide our work at this session which must confront and deal with the major challengesfacing the international community  namely  the achievementof peace and the economic and social development of ournations.We also wish to express our appreciation to theoutgoing President  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  for the wisdom withwhich he led our deliberations at the previous session.I should also like to take this opportunity to extend ourthanks to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his commitment and for hisefforts to carry out the principles and purposes of theOrganization’s Charter.Today  in our America  we are witnessing thebeginnings of a negotiated solution to conflict  and we arepleased that in Central America  and particularly in ElSalvador  Nicaragua and Guatemala  the disputes that havedisturbed the peace and hindered the development of ourpeoples are now being resolved at the negotiating table. Inour Island of Hispaniola  imperial and colonial rivalrydivided the population into two peoples who  over the courseof time  established two independent States - the DominicanRepublic  which we represent here  and the Republic ofHaiti. The efforts being made by the Haitian people andtheir leaders  with international assistance in the form ofnegotiations under the aegis of the United Nations and theOrganization of American States  are now beginning to bearfruit and will  we trust  restore normalcy to that fraternalcountry with the re-establishment of constitutional order.In that connection our delegation reiterates its appeal tothe international community to lend real assistance tostabilize the democratic regime and to ensure the economicreconstruction of Haiti - assistance and cooperation adequateto meet the needs of peace and employment. TheDominican Republic  in so far as it is able  remains ready tocontinue to cooperate with this fraternal people to lighten theheavy burden of its current problems.In this respect  we are pleased to report that the PrimeMinister of the Haitian Government  Mr. Robert Malval recently made an official visit to the Dominican Republic with a view to fully normalizing relations between theDominican and Haitian peoples and establishing the fullspectrum of relations between the two countries  in theirmutual interest. I am happy to say that the Haitian PrimeMinister was given a very warm welcome by the Presidentof the Dominican Republic  Mr. Joaquín Balaguer  who hasalways been interested in finding a solution to our brothercountry’s political conflict and especially in alleviating theserious economic situation there. As a result of the meeting the two statesmen reached an agreement  subsequentlyformalized  that will ensure the speedy and constructivenormalization of relations  with real reciprocal cooperation between our two States.There is no more appropriate forum than this for me on behalf of my country and Government  to appeal againfor massive aid from the most developed nations of theEarth to that afflicted and impoverished neighbouring brothercountry.Since the conquest and colonization of America  theDominican Republic has defended human rights. It was inour island  Hispaniola  that a loud voice was first raised onbehalf of the rights of the indigenous inhabitants of ourAmerican lands - the voice of Brother Antón de Montesinos in his famous Advent sermon. Faithful to that first call forthe redemption of our continent  our Government honoursthis historical tradition  which is fully valid today in ourcountry’s official and private practice. It has been workingon instruments - which might eventually becomeinternational in nature - that will contribute to givingjuridical force to that tradition.18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionOur country has advocated the universality of humanrights. We believe that neither geographical  economic social  religious nor cultural differences can ever be used asa pretext for showing contempt for human rights.The Dominican delegation believes that  because of theincrease in the membership of the United Nations - currentlyat 184 countries - there should be a more equitablerepresentation in the Security Council  while at the sametime we continue to abide by the provisions of paragraph 1of Article 23 of the United Nations Charter. Now that thebipolarity of the past has disappeared and the use and abuseof the veto are fading  the Council should become morerepresentative of the new international reality. This shouldbe done in broad consultations  after due reflection and withaccount taken of the need for equity  so that the Council canbecome more representative without its effectiveness beingin any way mitigated or weakened. Rather  its authority andresponsibility will be enhanced so that it can respondeffectively to any crisis with which the internationalcommunity might be confronted  as the Council has donerecently. In this regard  we consider that it would bepractical and feasible to give the Council greater flexibilityin meeting the just aspirations of nations  such as theRepublic of China  that wish to become Members of theUnited Nations and cooperate in carrying out its principles.I would now like to express our views on developmentsin the international situation  particularly on conflicts that  inone way or another  have been affecting international peace.I shall refer first to the Central American crisis  which happily  today is on the road to a definitive solution becauseof the positive evolution  under the auspices of the UnitedNations  of the El Salvador peace agreements  and the recentreturn to democracy in Guatemala  which augurs well for theinstitutionalization of peace and prosperity in that region.Next  we would like to refer to one of the mostcomplex and difficult conflicts facing the internationalcommunity today - that is  the existence of extremenationalism  which in some cases has led to fratricidal warsand the annihilation of large groups of people because ofracial and cultural hatred. This has happened in the formerYugoslavia  where even now  despite the efforts of theUnited Nations and intensive diplomatic activity  blood isstill being shed between brother peoples that until recentlylived together under one flag. Our Government wishes tosee a swift solution to the situation in the former Yugoslaviaand reiterates its support for measures taken by the SecurityCouncil  in particular the establishment of an internationalwar tribunal to pass judgement on crimes against humanitycommitted in some areas of the conflict.We would especially like to point to one positivedevelopment that represents perhaps our best hope for peacetoday: the transitional agreement between the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and the Government of theState of Israel. The long-standing conflict in the MiddleEast engendered dangerous tension that has kept the entireworld in suspense and has been regarded as the potentialsource of a future conflagration of incalculabledestructiveness.In connection with the development to which I havejust referred - the agreement between the Palestinians andthe State of Israel - it might be time to defer considerationof or remove the items on that conflict that have longappeared on the General Assembly’s agenda. With thisreciprocal exchange of olive branches of peace  we can seethe promise of harmony between peoples that have beenliving in such uneasy proximity.We must recognize how the persistent diplomacy of theUnited States contributed to securing the results that havebeen achieved. The United States considered the situationwith a view to deciding what was possible in relationsbetween the Arab and Jewish peoples. The agreementculminated in the signing at the White House in Washington.In our opinion  that demonstrated unequivocally and veryclearly to international public opinion the sincerity of theparties  who were fully aware of the extreme importance ofthe commitments into which they were entering.We must constantly stress the importance of theenvironment. After economic crisis and the imbalancebetween North and South  the major challenge facingmankind is the environmental crisis. The gradual destructionof ecosystems and the deteriorating quality of life of humanbeings are unavoidable aspects of everyday existence for thepeoples of the world. Thus  it is essential that the course ofevents be changed. The political will of Governments andof all those who participate in organized civilian society willbe necessary to our taking up this great challenge  whichwill involve commitment on the part of everyone - acommitment from all mankind.In that connection  the Dominican Republic supports thegeneral outline of the Plan of Action that was adopted at thesummit Conference on Environment and Development in Riode Janeiro in 1992. Here we have a valuable instrument forpolitical programming and regional cooperation to protect theenvironment in Latin America and the Caribbean.The latter part of the twentieth century has witnessedmajor changes in world political affairs  ranging from theend of the cold war to democratization in the countries ofForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 19Eastern Europe.Despite this ideological thaw  however  westill have arms trafficking and nuclear arsenals and therefore  a serious threat to peace.Let me refer once again to the situation in the Koreanpeninsula and mention specifically North Korea  which iscontinuing its nuclear research and investing enormousresources in this undertaking. Let us invite the Governmentof North Korea to become a party to the universalagreements on the control of nuclear weapons. Let us inviteit to cooperate transparently and effectively with theInternational Atomic Energy Agency in that body’simportant task of inspecting and monitoring nuclearfacilities. Willingness to do so would constitute evidence ofthat Government’s respect for its own nation and of itsconcern for the future of its people and of all mankind.We support United Nations measures to put an end toarms trafficking. We support efforts to ensure transparencyin military expenditures so that military activity may bemade more predictable  and peace and international security at the regional and world levels  strengthened.Let me now turn to two important issues that are stillon the agenda of this Assembly.May I  first  draw the attention of the internationalcommunity  as represented here  to the positivedevelopments in the area of drug trafficking  which are dueto the success of many measures aimed at combating anderadicating what has for too long been one of the mostominous scourges of mankind. None the less  we mustredouble our efforts to ensure that measures are implementedboth internally and internationally and result fromcoordinated policies of all the nations represented here today.The Dominican Republic has just become a party to the1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic inNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and the 1972Protocol Amending the Single Convention on NarcoticDrugs of 1961  bringing itself up to date on internationallegislation in order the better to play its role in collaboratingwith other States and agencies.The other issue to which I wish to refer is the economiccrisis affecting most countries of the world. Today  thephenomenon of globalization of the economy and integrationof regional blocs is typical of the international situation which is evolving so rapidly that countries such as mine canno longer put off negotiations to determine their participationin multilateral free-trade agreements  customs unions orregional markets.In this connection  the international activities of theDominican Republic focus on the economic programmes ofcountries in our region and regional organizations that canhelp in our development and in our enjoyment of technicaland financial cooperation.The implementation of appropriate domestic policies byour Government will ensure that trade and investment willbecome the ideal means to strengthen bilateral relations underpinned  of course  by the unilateral granting of tradebenefits under the Caribbean Basin Initiative and by theopening up of our market under the Americas Initiative.In the new international order  another of the majorchallenges that the Dominican Republic must face is theNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and itspossible implications; we understand that NAFTA  as atheoretical possible outcome  would imply an effort towardsthe complete liberalization of trade throughout thehemisphere.I should like to emphasize the Dominican Republic’sstrong support for holding a World Summit for SocialDevelopment to take up matters relating to the socialsituation in the world  particularly that of women  youngpeople  the elderly  the handicapped and families. TheSummit will have to deliver a clear undertaking for commonpolicies to defend and protect these important segments ofthe world’s population collectively  and we hope that manyof our countries will take measures to extend coverage andprotection for these social sectors  especially for children andthe elderly.We should like to draw to members’ attention a subjectof serious concern to my Government and country  and thathas complex and serious ramifications that will be broughtbefore the appropriate forums during the forty-eighthGeneral Assembly session. This is the Secretary-General’sproposal to merge the International Research and TrainingInstitute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) withthe United Nations Development Fund for Women(UNIFEM). Theoretically  the General Assembly will studythis proposal in November.My Government attaches the greatest importance to thisdecision  and requests this world forum to give it its closestattention in order to avoid committing a grave injustice bytaking hasty action or the like.INSTRAW was conceived at the First WorldConference on Women  held in Mexico City in 1975  andwas established as the result of a series of resolutions including  we should like to recall  Economic and Social20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionCouncil resolution 1979/11 of 9 May 1979. This resolutionspecified clearly that the permanent headquarters of theInstitute was to be my country  the Dominican Republic  adeveloping country.Moreover  my Government gave the United Nations thebuilding that is being used as the Institute’s headquarters.Not only that  it had to make significant investments interms of money and other resources in order to overhaul thebuilding to bring it up to the specifications required by theOrganization.We request the Secretary-General to postpone anyaction leading to merger between INSTRAW and UNIFEMuntil such time as the General Assembly considers hisproposal and comes to its own conclusions on the matter.Also  it would seem that there is an attempt being madeto ignore  unilaterally  the Agreement between the UnitedNations and the host Government that is the legal frameworkwithin which INSTRAW operates. My Government regardsthis as a serious - an extremely serious - impropriety  andreserves the right to use all relevant legal means to assert itslegitimate rights.Finally  the delegation I lead calls upon the consciencesof all nations and on all those leaders who bear upon theirshoulders responsibility for the destiny of their countries andthe world  for peace  common sense and mutual respect toprevail over violence and for there to be cooperation andsolidarity between peoples; for these are the supremepurposes of this Organization."
"48",2049,"DZA",48,1993,"Your unanimous election  Sir  to the presidency of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly represents a justrecognition of your great diplomatic experience  your humanqualities and your constant commitment to the promotion ofForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 11dialogue and multilateral cooperation in the service of peace security and development.I should like to congratulate you most warmly on thewell-deserved tribute from the international community bothto you personally and to your country. I am particularlypleased that the prestigious responsibility of guiding thework of the General Assembly has been given this year toan eminent son of Guyana  a country which  side-by-sidewith Algeria  has always been resolutely in the forefront ofthe defence of the cause of peace  justice  progress andunderstanding among nations.Your predecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  firmly andtactfully conducted a busy and productive forty-seventhsession. We wish to express our deep gratitude to him fora mission accomplished with open-mindedness anddedication.I also wish to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali who has spared no effort in making the United Nations riseto the many and complex challenges of a crucial period inthe development of international relations. His foresight courage and initiative have won him the esteem of all. Hispersevering activity bears for the United Nations the promiseof the renewal after which our peoples fervently aspire.Algeria extends a warm welcome to the new MemberStates which have joined our Organization  and is gratifiedthat their accession to the membership of the United Nationswill contribute to the achievement of its objectives in theareas of peace and development.In recent years  the history of the world has acceleratedits pace considerably. Rapid and profound changes have putpaid to an international order that had long been frozen inplace by the cold war. However  far from moving steadilytoward the achievement of a well-ordered internationalsociety  those changes have generated the makings of adisquieting explosion. While the world changes under ourvery eyes  we are unable to grasp and take cognizance of thelaws that govern such change. This dynamic  and the majorupheavals it causes  have shaped a new geopoliticalconfiguration in many parts of the world that has affectedthe lives of many of its peoples. Given this type of change wherein inter-State relations are jostled by a proliferation ofprotagonists  of ambitions and gambles  and of the methodsof international action there is a need for a collective effortto revitalize both our means of knowing and our methods ofaction. In short  we need to rethink the world order. Wemust  as a community of nations  succeed in controlling thechanges which are taking place and the unwieldy trends thatare now emerging. In this maelstrom of historical change this period of transition with all its hesitations and emergingglobal dangers  the thing that attracts one’s attention morethan any other is the hope  the promise of a new world orderthat must be fashioned side by side with the daily sufferingthat goes on in the world and which we cannot ignore.Indeed  in spite of the glowing promises of peace andinternational cooperation  the world order that is takingshape now not only contains too many old hotbeds oftension  but also gives rise to new mushrooming conflicts.Tensions between ethnic and religious groups are increasingand are being exacerbated while whole regions  and evenentire continents  are being marginalized in a most atrociousmanner. The right of peoples to self-determination is beingviolated and obstructed here and there. Hunger and povertyare expanding. Imbalances in the world economy aredeepening and worsening. All of these situations posechallenges to the international community that call for urgentand concerted action.It is therefore up to us - and this is the challenge facedby all nations that are bound by an ever-growinginterdependence - to see to it that the ideals of justice andpeace prevail  that new possibilities for the settlement ofcertain regional conflicts and for general and completedisarmament lead to comprehensive action eliminating theroot causes of conflicts while  at the same time  promotingeconomic and social development  a prerequisite forinternational peace and security.This is why it is appropriate to underscore here the factthat the Agenda for Peace (A/47/277)  whose importance isrecognized everywhere  will achieve its objectives only if itis accompanied by an agenda for development; for peace anddevelopment are closely interrelated  and conflicts too oftentake root in the soil of injustice and poverty. It is obviousthat the future of the system of collective security which wewish to build will depend to a great extent on our ability toforge a consensus on the different aspects contained in theAgenda for Peace. This means that it is necessary for us tocontinue  collectively and without bias  to consider thoseaspects of the Secretary-General’s report about whichdifferences persist or which require further elaboration andconsideration.The encouraging progress achieved in strengthening thecapability of the United Nations in the areas of activepreventive diplomacy  as well as in peace-keeping andpeacemaking operations  should be welcomed  but a greatdeal remains to be done in this field if we are to make better12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionuse of all the experience gained in those areas by the UnitedNations. We should see to it that our action remains strictlyfaithful to the goals and principles of the Charter of theUnited Nations. Algeria  which is honoured to participateactively and concretely in peace-keeping operations  willcontinue to do its share in this collective endeavour in theservice of peace.The restructuring  revitalization and rationalization ofthe structures of the organs of the United Nations and theirworking methods have made considerable progress.However  this process  which is not an end in itself  willproduce its full effects only if the Member States  andparticularly the developed countries  reaffirm and strengthentheir commitment to the United Nations and renew theirpolitical and financial support for its activities  particularlyin the economic and social spheres.It is this exacting and responsible approach that mycountry consistently promotes in all the areas of cooperationin which it takes part. In so doing  Algeria conducts its ownaction within the context of the efforts by the Non-AlignedMovement toward greater democratization of the UnitedNations and better balance between the spheres ofcompetence of its organs. In our view  it is time wereflected collectively on how to reform the Security Council with a view to broadening its composition  improving itsworking methods and making it more accountable for itsaction to the entire international community in whose nameit adopts its resolutions. A more representative  moretransparent Security Council that would be more cognizantof the views and concerns of all; a General Assembly thatwould fully play its role in activating  guiding andsupervising; and a United Nations system that would bemore coherent and better coordinated in carrying out itsdevelopment tasks: these are the three pivotal approachesthat may give to the fiftieth anniversary of our Organizationsignificant political scope and operational content andgenerate the makings of a new beginning. The credibility ofthe United Nations and the effectiveness of its action dependon this  as do international peace  security and cooperation.All the initiatives by my country at the national andregional levels are inspired by the ideals of peace  justiceand cooperation. The national-renewal plan upon whichAlgeria has embarked in the interests of political stability the consolidation of the democratic process  the revitalizationof economic growth and the upholding of the rule of law isa plan that translates into action our resolve to guarantee  forall Algerians  the rights to security and well-being in a just modern and democratic society.Given this determination  our efforts in combatingterrorism and our efforts aimed at providing the conditionsfor real growth stem from the same overriding priority  thatof meeting the expectations of our people be fulfilled byrestoring the authority of the State and creating theconditions for an orderly transition that would make possiblestable and coherent progress towards a market economythrough viable and orderly reforms.Such a vast enterprise must find its expression andderive its support from an active foreign policy based on theprinciples and ideals of non-alignment and geared towardsthe promotion of peace  stability and cooperation at theregional and international levels.In this spirit  Algeria works steadily and resolutely forsuccess in the process of building a united Maghreb. Theimportant achievements that have been made so far  whichwill help us to benefit from the complementary nature of thecountries of the union of the Arab Maghreb  confirm that thedynamics of this unifying process have enabled us tomobilize our energies  despite certain persistent problemsthat affect regional stability.Our country’s central position in the region  its resolveto reinforce and promote the building of the Maghreb and itscommitment to international legality have prompted it toencourage the kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Frontto turn to direct  sincere  constructive dialogue that canfacilitate the implementation of the peace plan preparedjointly by the United Nations and the Organization ofAfrican Unity  with the full agreement of the two partiesconcerned.It is important  now more than ever before  that thedialogue which was initiated at El-Ayoun between Moroccoand the Polisario Front should resume and continue at anauthoritative level. Algeria  for its part  hopes that the twoparties will choose the path of reason and that will do all intheir power to resolve outstanding questions in a seriousmanner and without delay  thus promoting the holding of afree and orderly referendum on self-determination for thepeople of Western Sahara. Algeria is convinced that a justa lasting solution to the question of Western Sahara canpromote stability and peace in the region. We thereforehope that the international community  as well as the UnitedNations and its Secretary-General  will redouble efforts toensure  in the best conditions of credibility and impartiality implementation of the United Nations settlement plan  withthe complete cooperation of the two parties.Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 13The same applies to the Mediterranean region. In fact Algeria has always worked to make that region  with theparticipation of all the States concerned  one of peace stability and mutually advantageous cooperation. It is to thisend that we continue to work for the consolidation anddeepening of political agreement in our region and for theestablishment of new types of cooperation. Algeria istherefore making constant efforts to have the forum of ""5 +5"" activated  as this is a promising framework forcooperation between North and South in the Mediterranean.It is in the field of disarmament that the end of the coldwar has produced tangible results most rapidly. However considerable work remains to be done  especially by thenuclear Powers. The final cessation of nuclear testing in allenvironments and the renunciation of the development ofnew weapon systems are objectives the attainment of whichis now within the reach of the international community -provided  of course  that the nuclear Powers go beyondcurrent agreements and summon up the necessary politicalwill for this purpose.In this context  Algeria notes with interest and withhope the proposals made from this rostrum on 27 Septemberby the President of the United States of America. Thecomplete elimination of all weapons of mass destruction is in fact  part of the logic of history. The conclusion of theConvention on the prohibition of chemical weapons hasshown that this objective is no longer Utopian. Anyapproach to the question of disarmament and internationalsecurity and  in the final analysis  to the question of peaceshould be universal in scope. This is a conviction that isbeing reiterated time after time by Algeria and by theNon-Aligned Movement. Disarmament  if it is to be lasting must take account of all aspects of the situation  and not ofthe military dimension alone. It is now clear that  in anincreasingly interdependent world  peace and security cannotbe dissociated from their natural corollaries - socio-economicdevelopment and the promotion of all human rights.The protection and promotion of human rights - allhuman rights - is a high priority for Algeria. Therefore  weare pleased at the positive results of the World Conferenceon Human Rights  held in Vienna  which expressed supportfor an integrated and global approach to human rights whose civil  political  economic and social aspects reinforceand complement each other.Algeria  which subscribes completely to this view andendorses this approach  is now at a juncture that makes it anobligation of the State to give priority to human rights  toprotection of the fundamental right to life and to personalsecurity. In this context  the restoration of public order andthe struggle against terrorism are manifestations of Algeria’sdetermination to give a firm guarantee of the developmentof human rights and the building of a lasting democracybased on the rule of law  the changeover of political powerbetween parties and republican principles.This declared struggle against terrorism has an internalaspect  but it has international dimensions as well. Here weshould like to make it abundantly clear that Algeria willcontinue to oppose  firmly and with the utmostdetermination  every outside attempt at destabilization andthat it will tolerate no interference in its internal affairs. Itis Algeria’s belief that the international community mustassert itself and mobilize its energy to defeat the modernbarbarity of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.It is therefore important for the deliberations at thissession of the General Assembly vigorously to lead to theformulation of an international convention on the preventionand repression of terrorism.While a number of regional conflicts are on the way topacification and lasting settlement  others  however  there isno peaceful  just solution in sight.In the Middle East  which has been buffeted fordecades by waves of suffering and confrontation  newprospects are emerging. Algeria welcomed the recentagreement between the Palestine Liberation Organization(PLO) and Israel and expressed the hope that it would be thefirst step towards an overall settlement of the Middle Eastconflict in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973). Now as in the past  Algeria whichstands firmly behind the independence of decision-making bythe Palestinian leaders calls upon the Palestinians to closeranks and reaffirms its support for the PLO.At this crucial stage for the future of the region  Algeriabelieves that the international community continues to beresponsible for building peace. For that peace to be genuineand lasting  it must be comprehensive and must meet thenational aspirations of the Palestinian people and restore allthe territories occupied by Israel  including Al-Quds Al-Sharif.As an Arab country  Algeria  naturally  is intimatelyinvolved in the future of the Arab world. Overcoming theaftermath of the Gulf war ought to open the way to theinter-Arab reconciliation for which our peoples ferventlyhope. Since Iraq has undertaken to meet fully all theobligations stemming from Security Council resolutions and14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionsince international law has established the geographical basisfor peaceful neigbourliness between Iraq and Kuwait  wehope that the outstanding humanitarian questions will soonbe resolved so that the collective conscience of the Arabpeoples may be able finally to heal itself of the scars of theGulf war.My country reaffirms its support for the Government ofthe United Arab Emirates in its legitimate efforts to regainsovereignty over the three islands under illegal foreignoccupation.Algeria welcomes with hope the positive developmentsin South Africa  despite the continuing violence and otherfactors that endanger peace. The agreement to set up theTransitional Executive Council holds promise for the speedyachievement of a united  democratic  non-racial SouthAfrica. Chairman Nelson Mandela’s call from this rostrumfor the lifting of economic sanctions against South Africa isfurther testimony to his lofty sense of responsibility and anillustration of the progress that has been achieved in thepeaceful dismantling of apartheid. This developmentdeserves the full attention of the international community which should spare no effort in contributing to putting anend to the inter-ethnic violence and to provide the means bywhich the democratic forces can participate effectively in thelong-awaited elections.Algeria also follows attentively developments in severalfraternal African countries. We encourage the peace effortsof the United Nations  the Organization of African Unity(OAU) and the relevant subregional organizations. We notewith satisfaction the progress achieved in Mozambique Rwanda and Liberia  and express the hope that thosecountries will overcome their problems with the help of theinternational community and devote all their energy toreconstruction and development. We hope that peace andharmony will be restored in Angola in accordance with theagreements reached between the two parties and with theresolutions of the Security Council  which have clearlydetermined where the responsibilities lie.We are gravely concerned about the ongoing violencein Somalia  particularly in Mogadishu. It reminds us thathumanitarian assistance and promoting political solutionsmust go hand in hand. The tragedy of Somalia is the mosttelling symbol to date of Africa’s marginalization ininternational relations  and it attests to the tragic effects ofthe international community’s inadequate response toAfrica’s clear needs with respect to economic and socialdevelopment.The tragedy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a challengeto the world’s conscience. In spite of the Security Council’smany resolutions  the acquisition of territory by force ""ethnic cleansing"" and trampling of all the norms ofinternational law continue to prevail there. In the absence offirm action by the international community  thedismemberment of Bosnia and Herzegovina  a State Memberof the United Nations  continues unabated  and puts at riskthe peace and stability of that country and of the region asa whole. Algeria expresses its solidarity with the Bosnianpeople  and most particularly with its Muslims  who havebeen the victim of untold hardships. We appeal to theinternational community to reject the fait accompli imposedby aggression and help protect the independence  sovereigntyand territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina.The international situation is not disturbing at thepolitical and security levels alone but is also causing concernbecause of the persistence of world recession  thedeteriorating economic situation of the developing countries and the grave instability brought about by profound changesin international economic relations.At a time when our interdependent world is in themidst of a complex and perilous historic transition  thecommunication gap between North and South must come toan end. The universal imperative of peace  security anddevelopment makes us consider the developing situation inthe countries of the South. Most of them are facing thechallenges of globalization with economies made uniquelyvulnerable by the crushing weight of foreign indebtedness their precarious internal balance and a highly unfavourableinternational economic environment.The efforts of developing countries to promoteeconomic growth and make the structural changes necessaryfor development are made far more difficult and risky by theerosion of multilateral cooperation  the conflicting interestsof the dominant economic players and the constraintsimposed by economic decisions that are too often selfish andexclusionary.It is therefore essential to respond in a concertedfashion to the need for an orderly restructuring ofinternational economic relations by establishing coordinatedmechanisms to regulate the functioning of the worldeconomy. In this context  it is important that the questionsof debt  the scarcity of capital and technology inflows  to thecountries of the South  the continued decline in commodityprices  the deterioration of the terms of trade and thedifficulty of access to markets should become the focus ofForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 15the international community’s attention in order for us tofind lasting solutions to such problems.Such a collective concerted type of action that would beconsonant with the requirements of adjustment by thedeveloping countries themselves  is a must if we are torelaunch the international economy on a fair and well-balanced basis and make it possible for the developingcountries to reap the expected benefits from the economicreforms they have undertaken. This would make meaningfulthe sacrifices being made by the developing countries inundertaking the necessary restructuring changes aimed atrelaunching their economies and integrating them into theworld economy. It would also make it possible for theinternational community to learn from the experiencesacquired in debt management and structural adjustmentprogrammes. Lastly  it would promote the creation of a truemarket environment in the developing countries.The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro demonstrated thatenvironmental protection is inconceivable without thepromotion of sustainable development and sustained growthin the developing countries. We must therefore workdeterminedly towards achieving this objective and placesustainable development on the agenda of the new worldorder.The holding of a world summit on social developmentscheduled for 1995 to deal with problems of human securityaffords us an opportunity to engage in an internationaldialogue on the implications and results of transition in theworld. The United Nations and the Bretton Woodsinstitutions must grasp these new problems and contribute todeveloping a new framework for reflection and guidance todirect better the evolution of the international system. Thisendeavour may seem difficult  but it is essential for a betterunderstanding of this new order  which we wish to bebalanced  fair and consensual. It would also tend to supportthe Secretary-General’s efforts to draw up an agenda fordevelopment.At a time when our Organization faces variouschallenges  the reform  restructuring and revitalizationprocess now under way in the United Nations acquiresspecial importance. Restructuring the Secretariat and theeconomic and social sectors  revitalizing the Economic andSocial Council  relaunching the operational developmentactivities of the United Nations system and assuring thestable and predictable growth of its resources are all tasksthat should be combined to give multilateral action theutmost credibility and effectiveness.This undertaking is part of the vast effort to equip theUnited Nations for and adapt it to present and futurechallenges  and it requires participation by all of us. Thisendeavour is the vessel for feeding the faith of the peoplesof the United Nations in an indivisible humankind. It isbound to succeed so long as our more democratic and moreeffective Organization is the active centre and catalyst forthe promotion of fair and equitably shared development andthe foundation of a peace built by mankind as a whole."
"49",2096,"ECU",48,1993,"I am pleased to convey my congratulations toAmbassador Samuel Insanally  the Permanent Representativeof Guyana and a distinguished member of our LatinAmerican and Caribbean Group  on his well-deservedelection as President of the General Assembly.A short while ago  we were hailing the end of the coldwar. There seemed to be a fresh possibility of building anew international order based on sound moral principles namely the principles of justice  law  freedom anddemocracy.The Gulf crisis  caused by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait offered the international community an opportunity to reactresolutely to restore the rights thus violated. The principlesof condemnation of the use or the threat of the use of forceas a means of settling disputes were underscored. Theinadmissibility and illegitimacy of the acquisition ofterritories through force were reaffirmed. The principles ofthe peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for thesovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Stateswere strengthened. Ecuador was gratified to see theresultant reinforcement of the fundamental and age-oldpillars of its international policy.The world today aspires more firmly and decisively tolive in freedom and democracy and in an atmosphere of fullrespect for human rights.This fundamental change has allowed the spread  notonly of positive forces  but also of underlying conflictswhich  within various regions  have set off apparentlyuncontainable escalation.The United Nations  whose prestige had reached newheights  was facing increasingly numerous  pressing andcomplex problems. Extreme nationalism had flared up in theForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 17Balkans and elsewhere  while the breakdown of authorityhad given rise to tragic humanitarian situations in Somaliaand in other regions. In Cambodia  the Organization had tocontribute to rebuilding the State.The problems have not disappeared; on the contrary they proliferate in the former Socialist Federal Republic ofYugoslavia and in the former Soviet Union. The largenumbers of refugees created by war serve as a pretext forextremist  nationalist and xenophobic ideologies to arise inthe very heart of Europe.The world  which applauded United Nations action onthe Iraqi invasion of Kuwait  is examining with a critical eyethe Organization’s inaction and ineffectiveness in Bosnia andHerzegovina. In Bonn  the graffiti read  ""Europe is dying inSarajevo"". In the Iraq-Kuwait conflict  the use of force andthe acquisition of territory by force was condemned  but itseems that in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina the use offorce is being allowed to yield results and to expand theterritory of the aggressor. Here is a clear illustration thatinternational morality is opposed to double standards ofaction.In that context  Ecuador views as vital the work underway to restructure and strengthen the world Organization.The General Assembly must shoulder with greater authorityits responsibilities as the most representative democraticorgan of the United Nations. The Security Council needs tobe restructured to reflect the striking changes in themembership of the United Nations and to ensure that it ismore representative and  hence  more legitimate. Wecommend all the steps being taken to that end  and wesupport others that still need to be taken to ensure that thework of the Council is characterized by vision andtransparency. We think that its membership should beexpanded  within limits ensuring that its work will beeffective and aimed at the democratization of theOrganization. Democratizing participation in the Council’swork requires the presence of States of special significanceon the international scene  such as Germany and Japan  andof representatives of other geographical areas not nowproperly represented.The work of the United Nations in the economic andsocial fields should be strengthened and made moreeffective. We must not forget that peace is threatened notonly by military aggression but also  and even more  bysituations of injustice or crisis that ought to be settled in aspirit of international solidarity. For that reason  Ecuadorlooks forward to seeing as soon as possible the report theGeneral Assembly has requested of the Secretary-General  onan agenda for development.Ecuador was pleased by the results of the recent WorldConference on Human Rights. We believe that the ViennaDeclaration and Programme of Action constitute animportant step forward towards recognizing the universalnature of human rights. The right to development isuniversal and inalienable. Ecuador appeals to all States tomake an effort to implement the goals and purposes of theVienna Programme of Action.Ecuador is deeply gratified by the positivedevelopments in South Africa. We hope that the electionsscheduled for 1994 will mark the conclusive establishmentof a democratic  non-racial  pluralistic society truly free andopen to progress.The most important element of progress may well besocial development. For that reason  Ecuador firmlysupported the initiative to convene the World Summit forSocial Development. We reiterate our backing for theinternational community’s decision  which will add meaningto the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations.The world economy is at a difficult stage. Even thedeveloped economies are in deep crisis. We must adopt anew monetary and fiscal policy aimed at promoting short-term recovery and at eliminating structural imbalances in themedium term. It is vital to coordinate the macro-economicpolicies of the strongest countries in order to promote worldeconomic growth. It is necessary also to take account of thelegitimate interests of all countries  especially developingcountries.It will be impossible to maintain and bolster ourdemocracies without at the same time engaging in economicand social programmes aimed at improved living standardsfor all. In addressing these issues we should not rely solelyon old economic statistical systems  but should turn tosystems that evaluate the quality of life  such as thatproposed by the United Nations Development Programme.I would recall that a country’s domestic policies play adominant part in its development process. Ecuador hasdecided to carry out serious and thorough structural reformsthat will permit greater scope for private enterprise andindividual initiative and that will reduce Governmentintervention wherever it has proved to be ineffective andinappropriate.18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionEconomic development is meaningful when it addresseshuman reality. To achieve this  we must be firmlycommitted to modernizing the State and  by our example ensuring that morality prevails in the work of theGovernment.But national efforts to modernize the State and open theeconomy to the universal trend towards freedom requiretimely  adequate financial support. This should be obtained basically  by establishing a trading system making possiblefair prices for commodities and other exports of developingcountries. Ironically  while they make splendid speeches infavour of free trade  the powerful countries continue toimpose measures that contradict their fine words. Oneexample is the import barriers on Latin American bananasimposed by the European Economic Community.We are concerned about what results will issue fromthe Uruguay Round of negotiations under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). We needtransparent machinery to fight protectionism; this must resultfrom true international negotiations.For many countries  certainly including Ecuador  theexternal debt continues to be one of the most seriousproblems and one that has the heaviest negative impact  notonly in the economic but also in the social and even politicalfields. We must review the financial policies of theinternational credit agencies and complement their resourceswith direct private investment  so that the flow of capitalfrom the developing world to the developed countries doesnot  as has happened to date  exceed the amount of aid orinvestment channelled to the developing countries.Prudent and appropriate regulation of the environmentand development is a task that concerns and interests us all.We must promote sustainable development that will meethumanity’s needs today without jeopardizing the rights offuture generations. The Rio Conference is of far-reachingimportance and the fulfilment of the decisions andcommitments undertaken there is crucial. Agenda 21 is ahistoric document requiring political resolve on the part ofall if it is to be put into effect. In that regard  theestablishment and consolidation of financial sources isessential.In the context of international security it is vitallyimportant that all international agreements concluded withinthe framework of the International Atomic Energy Agencybe strictly complied with  and that the inspection systems bestrengthened to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.In this respect  we support all efforts to create newnuclear-weapon-free zones and we voice our concern at anyfailure to comply with the resolutions relating to the Koreanpeninsula. We urge the Government of the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea to heed the just demands of theinternational community.Today  I have heard with great concern of a possiblebreach of the moratorium on nuclear testing by the People’sRepublic of China. If that information is confirmed  it willrepresent a grave step backwards in the process ofestablishing moratoriums on nuclear testing. We hope thatit will not trigger a rush to new testing on the part of othernuclear Powers.In Latin America  democracy and freedom have beenstrengthened. It is our hope that  by means of the exerciseof the right of peoples to self-determination  Latin Americanwill soon be free of the remaining exceptions.The case of Haiti is particularly disquieting. Respectfor democracy and human values is a basic pillar of civilizedcoexistence. Ecuador believes that the joint action of theinternational community must encourage a new phase thatwill provide the Haitian people with certain basic guarantees.Throughout its history  Ecuador has demonstrated itspeaceful spirit in true and unquestionable terms. In thatspirit  it participated in the United Nations Observer Groupin Central America and the United Nations Observer Missionin El Salvador. It continues to support the latter and hasoffered its forces for other peace-keeping operations.The proliferation of peace-keeping operations hashighlighted the need to carry out a careful review of theconditions in which these operations are created and carriedout and the limits of their respective mandates. ThisOrganization should set the example of austerity in fundmanagement in order to enhance its moral authority and itseffectiveness.In the light of its special links with Latin America Ecuador attaches particular importance to its relations withneighbouring countries. Our Government has strengthenedand expanded its traditional relations with Colombia  andthey have recently been evolving with great promise.A similar process is under way between theGovernments of Ecuador and Peru. The Presidents ofEcuador and Peru have given repeated and eloquent proof oftheir political resolve to make progress in the process ofdialogue that has opened between the two countries. ThisForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 19process will enable us to ensure a climate of friendship  trustand understanding and to narrow the differences in ourpositions on the territorial issue. Together we can makesignificant steps towards promoting the well-being of ourpeoples  and as we move towards understanding we will beable to overcome the differences which have long been anobstacle in the way of a new era of fruitful coexistence.The Government of Ecuador was pleased and verygrateful to note the demonstrations of support from manycountries  particularly American ones  for our dialogue withPeru. We also appreciated the message that His HolinessPope John Paul II addressed to President Sixto Durán Ballénand President Alberto Fujimori on the occasion of theirmeeting in Bahía de Caráques in December 1992.Ecuador  by tradition and inclination  has been a peace-loving nation and believes that the only valid way toovercome the territorial differences persisting between it andPeru lies in the peaceful settlement of disputes. One optionin that regard is the arbitration of His Holiness the Pope who  with his lofty moral authority and his enduringdevotion to understanding and harmony among peoples  isextremely well qualified. That is why the ConstitutionalPresident of Ecuador  Sixto Durán Ballén  speaking from thisvery rostrum at the forty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly  reiterated the initiative which former EcuadorianPresident Rodrigo Borja set forth at the forty-sixth sessionof the General Assembly concerning the arbitration of theHoly See.In response to this initiative and in keeping with thespirit of dialogue that has been maintained and cultivatedbetween the two countries  the President of Peru proposedthe participation of the Holy See through the mediation of anexpert adviser who would offer his opinion from the pointof view of that neighbouring and friendly country withrespect to the ""frontier disputes"" with Ecuador.We now have two proposals that are distinct in scopeand content: on the one hand  arbitration  and on the otherthe assistance of an expert adviser. But they coincide intheir recognition of the great help to be had from the Pontiff who in the course of history has traditionally worked forrapprochement and understanding among peoples. Thesevery differences and varied proposals highlight the need topreserve and strengthen the process of dialogue between thetwo countries. Ecuador is faithfully committed to thatprocess with a view not only to finding the fairest  mostrealistic and honourable solution to the problem  but also inorder to respond appropriately to all the possibilities forcomplementary action  cooperation and joint endeavour thatthese two countries could and should pursue with a view tosecuring the development  integration and well-being fortheir peoples.Thus  we shall no longer be divided by borders andborders will become points of union and of promisingcooperation  with tremendous scope and possibilities. Thishas been the case with regard to the maritime area that weshare; this is the hope of the two peoples  especially thepeoples of southern Ecuador and northern Peru; this must bethe case with regard to the Amazon River meeting for ahistoric reconciliation of our two nations that adequatelymeets the major interests of the two countries in the Amazonregion and identifies them in plans that take account of theirindividual and collective rights  enhance their potential andcreate conditions reflecting the importance of a major riversystem and a region that all the countries of the basin mustpreserve and promote for the sake of current development aswell as the future well-being of our peoples.In this spirit of frank and constructive dialogue President Sixto Durán Ballén accepted the kind invitation ofPresident Alberto Fujimori to visit Peru. Ecuador’s ForeignMinistry is busy making preparations with the authorities ofthat friendly country for this mission so that the greatestpossible success may be achieved.A few days ago the world enthusiastically welcomedthe handshake between two courageous men who had optedfor peace and understanding. I should like  on behalf ofEcuador  to pay tribute to Prime Minister Itzhak Rabin andPresident Yasser Arafat. I am confident that this gesture this historic event  will be not only the beginning of a toughbut promising relationship aimed at securing understandingand cooperation between the two peoples but also a signal a sign of the times  for many other peoples who have topursue the arduous path of peace and understanding.For this reason  President Clinton was absolutely rightwhen  on that historic morning  he said:""We know that a difficult path lies before us.Every peace has its own enemies - those who alwaysprefer the easy attitudes of hatred to the hard task ofreconciliation.""Ecuador believes in peace and trusts in peace andunderstanding. Hence  I wish to associate myself with thenoble words of Cardinal Antonio Samoré  the delegate of theHoly Father in the Papal mediation between the fraternalcountries of Argentina and Chile  in his speech at the time20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionof the signing  in Montevideo  of the commitment betweenthe two countries:""I say to all of you - Christians  believers and menof good will: do not be afraid to opt for peace  toeducate for peace. The aspiration to peace will neverbe disappointed. The endeavour to achieve peaceinspired by charity that never fails will yield its fruits.Peace will be the last word in history.""Against this background  and with a view to ensuringthat these efforts are made in an appropriate climate ofgenuine understanding and harmony and will be effective  Iformally take the opportunity  at this rostrum  to propose tothe Government of Peru that  reaffirming the commitmentthat both countries have made in accordance with manyexisting international instruments - principally  the UnitedNations Charter - we give our word of honour that  in ourmutual relations  we shall not resort to force or to the threatof the use of force. Such a solemn commitment wouldunderscore an essential legal obligation and amount to aneloquent additional means of promoting mutual trust; and itwould be an appropriate framework for continued dialogueon the path of peace and understanding  with a view toachieving  as soon as possible  a fair  honourable and lastingsettlement between the two countries."
"50",2141,"EGY",48,1993,"Itgives me pleasure to convey to you  Sir  and to your friendlycountry my sincere congratulations on your election to thepresidency of the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. I wish you every success in carrying out yourresponsibilities in light of the current developments andchanges in the international situation.On this occasion  I should also like to pay tribute toyour predecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  for the constructiveefforts he made and the positive role he played as thePresident of the past session.Since the end of the cold war  reference has been madeto a new age. The implications of this have given rise  notonly to hopes and aspirations  but also to caution andapprehension. Although there was overall satisfaction thatthe era of confrontation  the arms race and polarization hadcome to an end  and while there was cause for hope that anera of justice  cooperation and disarmament was about todawn  there has been grave concern over the great injusticesthat we have witnessed in Bosnia; over the attempt atpolitical suicide in Somalia; over the illogical and irrationalwars in many parts of the world; and over the multiplecriteria used in addressing various problems.Side by side with concern  there has been increasingdespair and frustration over the continued deterioration ofeconomic conditions in most developing countries particularly in Africa. It must be acknowledged  however that international developments  judged fairly and consideredclosely  are still in flux  and that the world situation is stilldynamic. We truly hope that such dynamism is movingtowards the strengthening of the positive factors and therectification of the negative ones  in order that the politicaloutlook worldwide might change and that everyone mightembrace the new world order with satisfaction and a will toparticipate rather than with despair and frustration.Fortunately  this session begins amid increasing feelingsof optimism in view of the ongoing progress towards a justsolution to the question of Palestine and of the steadyprogress towards a solution to the problem of South Africa.At the Israeli-Palestinian level  a major step has beentaken through mutual recognition by Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization. This means mutual recognition bythe two peoples of each other and mutual acceptance of theidea of coexistence with one another. This also opens thedoor to serious and substantive negotiations which wouldprovide an unprecedented opportunity to achieve a justsettlement to the problem that has cast its shadow on theMiddle East - indeed  on the whole world - since the end ofthe Second World War.If what has been achieved represents the first steptowards such a settlement  it will undoubtedly lead to theestablishment of a positive relationship that would deal withissues such as withdrawal  self-determination and refugeesuntil the historic and comprehensive settlement betweenIsrael  Palestine and the Arabs is finalized. This may be thereal meaning behind the statement of the Israeli PrimeMinister at the signing ceremony in Washington  D.C.  whenhe said: ""Enough""  and when he said that the time for peacehas come; and also of President Yasser Arafat’s statementthat the Palestine Liberation Organization has turned a newleaf in its relations with Israel. And God bless the memoryof the late President Anwar El-Sadat  who said: ""No morewars"".Sixteen years ago  Egypt made a breakthrough towardsthe outer reaches of the future and shook off the shackles ofthe status quo by realizing that wars neither create peace norresolve conflicts and that only reason and dialogue providethe effective means of tackling problems  no matter howinsurmountable or intractable they may seem. Peace wastherefore initiated by Egypt  a peace founded on the solidfoundation of respect for international legality and on theresultant responsibilities in a balanced manner that ensuresjustice for all.The peace process initiated at the Madrid Conferencein October 1991 is now bearing fruit after unrelentingefforts  and we are encouraged by the initial outcome weForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 11saw recently on both the Palestinian-Israeli and theJordanian-Israeli tracks and look forward to similar resultson the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. Both countries rightlycall for complete withdrawal from their territories within acontext based objectively on the principle of land for peace.In order to put an end to the legacy of wars and enmity Egypt  which has devoted a substantial part of its efforts toMiddle East issues  calls upon all the peoples of the regionto look to the future and to reflect upon our relations in theperiod following the settlement of the conflict. It calls onthem to reflect upon the future of the region and itsdevelopment to ensure optimum utilization of the ampleexpertise available and optimal investment of the rich humanresources at our disposal and of the valuable naturalresources with which it has been endowed.Egypt calls on these peoples to reflect upon the mostsuitable social contract for our region so that they mightmaintain their respective unique  intrinsic characteristics andachieve harmony and integration among the region’scommon elements  so that social and cultural stability mayprevail and the region may achieve comprehensive culturalintegration in a genuine era of comprehensive integral peace.Finally  Egypt calls on the peoples of the region todevelop a system of relations based on equal security  thenon-use of force  a balance of armaments and the eliminationof all weapons of mass destruction in a context oftransparency and peaceful relations.In the same vein  Egypt calls on all States in theMiddle East  and particularly on Israel  to accede to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and totake the necessary practical measures to prohibit andrenounce the possession  the use or the threat of use ofnuclear  chemical and biological weapons so that the MiddleEast may become a zone free of these weapons as called forin President Hosni Mubarak’s initiative of April 1990. Weconsider this to be an indispensable prerequisite for securityand stability in the Middle East.Side by side with the considerable optimism generatedby what has been achieved in the context of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict  there has been progress in another area  thatfor far too long has been a hotbed of serious historical andinternational conflict  namely  the conflict in South Africa between a people calling for its rights to equality andfreedom and a regime that was based on repression andapartheid. Egypt  an African state with an African people feels glad to see positive developments in South Africa  themost important of which is the agreement on the formationof a transitional Executive Council that would lead towardsdemocracy and equal rights. The Council consists ofrepresentatives of majority as well as minority groups andwould work within a framework of cooperation  co-existenceand understanding. Despite the many obstacles and the greatchallenges that still lie ahead  the start has been encouragingand developments are promising. In this regard  werecognize the role played by President De Klerk. We alsopay tribute to the role played by Nelson Mandela and hiscompanions across the political spectrum in South Africa inturning a new leaf towards a common future.The twenty-ninth African Summit Conference was heldin Cairo last June. It gave the countries of the continent anopportunity to evaluate its progress on the thirtiethanniversary of the establishment of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU). The meeting produced the CairoDeclaration  which reflected the imposing record of thestruggle of the peoples of the African continent over the pastthree decades. The Declaration also put forward the memberStates’ vision for the future and their conception of themanner in which they may adapt to the successive and quickinternational changes in shaping their conditions andrelationships. The Cairo summit discussions establishedmany landmarks that would guide the direction of Africanactivities in the coming years. They noted the optionsavailable to the continent and the challenges it has to face.The continent has expressed its determination to eliminatepoverty  desertification and indebtedness and to initiate acomprehensive development process for its countries andpeoples and to improve their economic and politicalconditions.Despite the numerous problems of Africa  the continenthas demonstrated that it is prepared to shoulder itsresponsibilities in facing up to the challenges posed by thoseproblems. Most prominent among its decisions in thisregard was the decision to establish an African machineryfor resolving disputes. In that regard  the African States arehave set forth a new mode of international cooperation andcollaboration in shouldering responsibilities  notwithstandingall the difficulties facing the continent because of itscontinued low share in the world gross national product andthe increasing cost of debt servicing. Such a situation though restraining the continent’s endeavors and weakeningits capabilities  has not debilitated either its will or itsdetermination.The Cairo Summit was an expression of a determinedattitude towards the indispensable need to make a number ofadjustments to African policies and plans. It showed that thetime has come to take the difficult decisions required tobridge the gap between Africa and the developed world -indeed  between Africa and many countries of the thirdworld itself.Mention of Africa leads to a discussion of thedevelopments in the Horn of Africa. This is all the moreimportant owing to the fact that the developments andinteractions in the Horn of Africa are closely related to thesecurity of the Middle East and of Africa in general. Hence we welcome the independence of Eritrea and its accession tomembership of the United Nations. We also express ourdeep regret at the situation in Somalia. In this regard  Egyptis fully cooperating with the international community  whichhas moved effectively to put an end to the famine thatbeleaguered that country and to the armed conflicts that haveshaken its very existence. In the meantime  Egyptsympathizes with the people of Somalia in their aspirationafter a secure future based on a national reconciliation thatwill serve the interests and meets the aspirations of all theSomali people and not merely the ambitions of a certainleader or faction. As a result  immediately after being electedChairman of the Organization of African Unity  PresidentHosni Mubarak  inspired by Egypt’s keen interest in theimplementation of Security Council resolutions on thesituation in Somalia  coordinated efforts with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Secretary-General ofthe OAU to create the climate that would make it possibleto achieve continued progress in the efforts designed toenable that brotherly country to begin the reconstruction andrehabilitation of its infrastructure and to permit its people -torn by conflicts and dissension - to clear the debris ofdiscord and to reunite. That can be done only by helpingthe Somali people to achieve a comprehensive nationalreconciliation that would allow all its elements to expresstheir will freely  without any repression or apprehension andwithout being blackmailed by power-seekers who instigatepolicies of destruction and annihilation. This is aresponsibility that the Somali people  who fell prey to tribaldisputes and personal ambitions  must shoulder  and the timehas come to put an end to that situation from an exclusivelynational perspective.Moving from Somalia to Angola where the situationhas been aggravated by UNITA’s disregard for the will ofthe majority of the people  expressed in free elections  Egyptcalls for absolute support for Security Council resolution 864(1993) which was adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter and which condemned UNITA and urged all States to refrainfrom providing any form of assistance to it until it respectsthe provisions of the ""Acordos de Paz"" as well as the will ofthe people of Angola and the resolutions of the UnitedNations.Africa’s problems are not confined to those of SouthAfrica  the Horn of Africa or Angola. They also extend tonumerous African States whether in the form of civil wars such as the one in Liberia  with its impact on its neighbours or in the form of internal political dissension  like thatprevalent in many African States at the present time  inaddition to all the development-related problems and thepangs of democratization. Nevertheless  Africa is ready with determination and political will  to go beyond thoseproblems and to embrace the twenty-first century and  alltotal confidence  steadfastness and determination  to be anactive partner in the formulation of the desired newinternational order.I began by reviewing some of the positivedevelopments in international relations that gave us reasonto look toward the future with hope. However  there havebeen other recent developments in the world which give riseto concerns and fears. Those developments have posed anessential question among a number of thinkers: What kindof a world order do we need  and would such an order whose foundations would be laid today  be an extension ofthe past  with its notions and policies  but in some new form or would it be a mere reflection of the present with all itsimbalances  contradictions and double standards? Or  rather would it be a real and genuine development towards a futurethat may take us into the twenty-first century?Living in just peace and prevailing stability is the primedemand  without which none of our aspirations will beattained. Peace is not a passive or abstract concept. It is theexpression of the active and conscious will of all countriesand peoples  small or large  to manage the common life onthis planet  with all its peoples  entities and groupings according to commonly agreed principles  values andguidelines.Certain principles underlie our concept of living inconditions of peace and security  the most important ofwhich are the following: first  respect and support forinternational legality to maintain the reverence for andpredominance of the law we have all accepted; secondly  theprinciple of equal rights and obligations to relieve frustratedpeoples and to encourage them to utilize their expertise andefforts in joint and integrated action for the benefit of all.All men are required to abide by the same rules in theirinternational relations and to have a balanced share inregional and international responsibilities within a frameworkthat gives priority to public interest.Thirdly  the same standard should be applied in judgingall cases that are similar in nature. The same provisionsshould be applied on a universal basis without selectivity orbias to ensure stability and security  reward compliance andpunish and deter those who breach the accepted norms ofinternational legality.Fourthly  the principle of peace for all in the context ofcorresponding and balanced commitments should berespected.Fifthly  the right to development should be respectedand joint assistance made to developing countries particularly to the least developed among them.Respect for these principles constitutes direct and activeimplementation of the rules of international legality. It alsorepresents a sincere response to the will of the internationalcommunity. Their violation would threaten our efforts toagree on a more just and humane international order andwould greatly harm the credibility and progress of suchefforts.I have to state here in all frankness that Muslimcommunities  and many others  have witnessed themanifestations of repression and bias in a number ofinternational policies. This has become apparent in thehesitation and inconsistency witnessed in addressing thequestion of Bosnia and certain other issues. There is nodoubt that a great deal of the suspicions of the Muslimworld could have been dispelled if the Bosnian problem hadbeen dealt with according to the established principlesenshrined in the United Nations Charter relating toaggression  occupation  war crimes and crimes committedagainst humanity. All of those crimes have been committedagainst the people of Bosnia. This will not be forgotten bythose who have witnessed that tragedy unfolding under theirvery eyes  day in and day out. Instead of addressing theproblem in accordance with the principles of the Charter  theblockade has been tightened around the people of Bosnia andall manner of procrastination and stalling has prevailed.Egypt rejects this flagrant manipulation of the norms ofjustice. Such manipulation rewards the aggressor for hisaggression. Egypt rejects this gross breach of human rights.How can anyone justify this hesitation in the face of Serbaggression against Bosnia on the part of the internationalcommunity that stood against Iraq’s Government when itcommitted aggression against Kuwait? And if we approvethe demarcation of the Iraq-Kuwait border  why do we allowthe Serbs to expand at the expense of the Bosnian peopleand their territorial rights?The protraction of the Bosnian problem without a justsolution acceptable to its people weakens the credibility ofmany international policies and developments. The onlypositive development in this regard may be the establishmentof the International Tribunal for the prosecution of warcriminals who have practiced ethnic cleansing. Theseprosecutions should target those who advocate or condonesuch practices that bespeak cultural decadence andcriminality in those who perpetrate or advocate them.The issue of human rights is one of the major questionsthat face us. We in Egypt believe that the human rightsissue is universal both in content and nature. When we dealwith this issue in Egypt  we look at it through theperspective of the cultural and historical heritage which ispart of our national identity. We view it through ourdeep-rooted history extending through the millennia; throughour ancient Egyptian civilization; through our Islamiccivilization  which is deeply impressed upon ourconsciousness; through our interaction with theMediterranean civilizations; and through the legacy of theages of renaissance and enlightenment in contemporaryEurope  which have had their effect on philosophy andmodern thought in Egypt.The essence of this interlocking and integrated culturalheritage is the assertion of the individual human being’svalue  recognition of his role in working for revival andprogress  and upholding his right to freedom of thought andcreativity in line with Islam’s sound principles which upholdman’s personal and social freedom. Those principlesmaintain a balance between rights and duties as well asbetween the individual and society  so that neither mayencroach on the rights of the other and so that all may livewithin a framework of a meticulously formulated socialcontract.As we see it  the main aim of human rights is to protectthe real interests of the individual  his family and hishomeland  as well as his fundamental  essential and genuineright to live in safety and security. This is the primary rightfrom which all other rights should emanate. All these rightsmust be protected from those who try to violate or denythem through terrorism or intimidation. All communities ofthe world are now in the same struggle against terroristicpractices  whether they emanate from racial chauvinism  the14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionradical right  doctrines of ""ethnic cleansing"" or religiousfanaticism. All these doctrines follow practices thatconstitute gross violations of human rights  and should bedefied.In view of our firm stand in favour of safeguarding andmaintaining human rights - foremost of which is the right tolife and security - we are aware that real democracy is thebest guarantee of stability  security and social peace. Allpolitical freedoms and rights  individual or collective  willremain forever incomplete if they are not complemented byeconomic  social and cultural rights. We believe that it isnot an overstatement to say that the right of the individualand of the community to development and economic andpolitical progress is closely related with their political andcultural rights in general. They reinforce each other andneither can proceed on its own.One of the challenges now facing us is the need todemonstrate our collective ability to bring about a realchange in the world economic order that would transcendnarrow interests and considerations and rise to the level ofreal world partnership in striving for sustainabledevelopment for all and the protection of our commonenvironment. Such a challenge requires us frankly toexpress our views concerning current internationaldevelopments that give cause for concern with regard to thefuture.The current world economic situation pivots on thecentrality of the decision-making process which remains inthe hands of the industrialized countries  with all that thatentails with regard to the economies of developing countries.Furthermore  the current recession in the industrializedcountries is reflected directly in the depression andincreasing unemployment and poverty rates that plague thedeveloping countries.This situation is exacerbated by the protectionistmeasures put in place by rich countries in trying to face upto their economic problems. Developing countries findthemselves helpless before such measures. They can onlyplead and hope. And this takes place at a time when mostof the developing countries are in the throes of implementingrigorous programmes of economic reform. As theliberalization of trade constitutes a fundamental resource fordevelopment in the case of the developing countries protectionism deprives those countries of the opportunity toreap the fruits of their agonized efforts in the area ofeconomic reform and liberalization and severely hampers theintegration of their economies in the world economy.So far  we find nothing in the Uruguay Round ofmultilateral trade negotiations that augurs well for the future.Today  the developing countries find themselvesmarginalized by side deals in which they do not participate.Such deals are characterized by ambiguity rather thantransparency. They jeopardize the interests of developingcountries. On the other hand  the developments of the lasttwo years have demonstrated that the international monetarysystem is no better than the trade system. Conflicting goalsof monetary and macro-economic policies in industrializedcountries have led to a state of chaos in foreign exchangemarkets  destabilizing the world economic order  with allresultant adverse effects on developing economies.The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro was an importantmilestone on the road of constructive dialogue betweenNorth and South for a world partnership to counter thedangers facing our planet. In spite of the meagre progressthat has been achieved in the implementation of the Rioresolutions  we still perceive a marked difference betweenthe perspectives of the developed and the developingcountries. The developed countries focus mainly on thesymptoms of the crisis  which represent a major threat totheir life styles and their welfare  even though it was thosevery countries which contributed to the deterioration of theenvironment.By contrast  many developing countries continue tosuffer from environmental pollution for which othercountries are largely responsible. In their attempt to solveproblems of debt  declining commodity prices and tradebarriers as well as the problems of sustainable developmentand the requirements for environmental protection Governments found that they were facing a real impasseleading to low productivity and declining growth rates whichin turn led to more poverty.In the long run  the divergence between these twoperspectives may hinder comprehensive world action to dealwith the world environmental crisis. In order to surmountthis dilemma  all parties are called upon to shoulder theirresponsibility for lending credibility to and promoting theacceptance of the slogans of interdependence and worldpartnership.In this regard  it is important to address an integralaspect of the equation for achieving development andpreserving the environment: the population problem  whichthreatens both sides of that equation. We are all aware ofthe extent of this problem  which completely absorbs theyields of development and will ensure the continueddestruction of the environment.The International Conference on Population andDevelopment  which Cairo will host in September 1994 represents an opportune occasion for the internationalcommunity to address population issues from the appropriatedevelopmental perspective and from the perspective of theirrelationship to issues of economic and social development.We in Egypt  as the host country  shall exert everyeffort to ensure the success of this important conference  andwe are confident that its outcome will represent a soundcontext for international cooperation in the field ofpopulation and development.Our discussion of the conditions and circumstances ofthe Third World leads us to a broader and morecomprehensive discussion of the political movements andgroupings with which the various developing countries areassociated  despite their different orientations and stages ofdevelopment. It is high time for us to stop and askourselves what these groupings have achieved and what canbe done to further their legitimate goals. We need to reflecton this issue in a frank  constructive and objective manner.It has become apparent that the challenges facing thedeveloping countries have changed substantially. We are onthe threshold of new international conditions and challengeswhich have different economic  political and security effects.In Egypt  we have already begun to study this issue taking into consideration the positive and the negative effectsof the past decades at the political  economic and sociallevels in the Third World  and the implications for changingpriorities and areas of concern. We have come to thefollowing conclusions:Firstly  the so-called Third World represents themajority of the world population and the majority of worldcountries. It has the major share in the production ofprimary commodities  and it has vast market potential. ThisThird World is fully entitled to be a full-fledged partner inthe ongoing restructuring process at the world level.Secondly  in order to be able to do so  the Third Worldhas to mould a political collective will  and this can only beachieved through democratic open discussion between itsStates.Thirdly  this  in turn  can only be achieved through theestablishment of a political system or movement that wouldinclude all these States.Fourthly  the ultimate aim should be dialogue negotiation and partnership within a framework ofcooperation  collaboration and integration  rather thanconfrontation or conflict.Today  I propose that the developing countries embarkon a dialogue aimed at establishing a grouping for the ThirdWorld  a grouping within which the developing countrieswould deal with the political  economic and social aspects ofvarious world issues  a grouping to coordinate theirpositions and shape their contribution towards the laying ofthe foundations of the new world order which we hope willprevail during the 21st century.The developments we have just reviewed  and thesuccessive changes we are witnessing  strengthen Egypt’sbelief in the pivotal role of the United Nations in managinginternational relations in line with the principles andprovisions of its Charter.Egypt attaches great importance to increasing theeffectiveness of the United Nations and preserving itscredibility. We are aware of the nature and number of thechallenges that face the international Organization  perhapsfor the first time. These urgent challenges were suddenlypushed to the surface of international relations by historicaldevelopments that were never imagined by the foundingfathers or the drafters of the Charter. We all agree that themomentum that characterized the past few years was sopressing and rapid that there should be a comprehensivereview of the United Nations mechanisms and structure  ifwe are serious in our effort to adjust the international will tothe facts of our age  and if we are eager to maintain thecredibility and effectiveness of the United Nations.In this connection  and with reference to the envisagedstructural changes  I would like to state that Egypt  as one ofthe States which took part in the formulation of the Charter and as one of the founding states of the Organization  ismainly concerned with the continued presence of the UnitedNations and its principles  message  prestige and credibilityto serve the causes of international peace and securitywithout interruption.Needless to say  the burdens of the United Nations inthe post-cold war era are far greater than they were duringthe cold war itself. If the collective will of the internationalcommunity agrees to make structural changes in themembership of the Security Council  for example  Egypt -which is undertaking an effective role within theinternational order in the formulation of regional andinternational relations and in establishing the concepts andprinciples on which we all agree  in addition to itsparticipation in numerous peace-keeping operations onseveral continents - has the right and the potential tocontribute in a responsible manner to the proposedinstitutional restructuring of the United Nations. Egypt hasthe desire and determination to take part both in the processitself and in setting the standards and values to be used inthe process. Egypt believes that it has now gained therequisite standing to be included within the framework of theongoing discussion and within the new membership.We must open the doors to a better future in whosecreation all of us will participate to achieve the 21st centuryworld for which we hope. This is the time for collectiveformulation of a new solid and stable world order. This isthe great challenge that faces us all at a time ofunprecedented opportunity."
"51",2165,"ERI",48,1993,"Let me begin by congratulatingyou  Sir  upon your election to the presidency of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly.I feel particularly privileged and honoured to addressthe General Assembly on behalf of a people that struggledfor half a century to regain its fundamental human andnational rights and that  despite the outright military victoryit won  took the unprecedented step of organizing a free andfair referendum so as to join the community of independentStates on the basis of its freely expressed wish and on solidlegal grounds.As I speak here today  I cannot help but remember theappeals we sent year in and out to the General Assemblyand the States Members of the United Nations  describingthe plight of our people and asking for legitimate sympathy support and recognition. We appealed to the United Nationsnot only in its capacity as a representative of theinternational community  but also because of its specialresponsibility to Eritrea. For it was the United Nations thatdecided in 1950  at the beginning of the cold war  to denythe colonized people of Eritrea their right toself-determination  thereby sacrificing their national andhuman rights on the altar of the strategic interests of thesuper-Powers.In adopting that resolution  the United Nations affirmedthat it remained an international instrument which theGeneral Assembly could be seized of at any time. But forthe next 41 years  as a brutal war of aggression wasconducted against the Eritrean people  initially with theactive support of the United States and later with a muchworse and massive involvement of the Soviet Union  anddespite the repeated appeals of the Eritrean people  theUnited Nations refused to raise its voice in the defence of apeople whose future it had unjustly decided and whom it hadpledged to protect. Not once in 41 years did Eritrea  sceneof the longest war in Africa  and victim of some of thegrossest violations of human rights  figure in the agenda ofthe United Nations.This deafening silence pained our people. It also gavea free hand to the aggressors  thereby prolonging oursuffering and increasing the sacrifices we had to make. Butit neither shook our resolve nor undermined our belief in thejustness of our cause and the inevitability of our victory. Asan Eritrean proverb says: ""The rod of truth may becomethinner but it cannot be broken."" Indeed  justice has finallyprevailed. This is a source of hope and happiness not onlyfor the Eritrean people  but for all those who cherish justiceand peace.While we rejoice at the peace and freedom that havebeen attained and the promising prospects that lie ahead  weare confronted with the reality of a devastated country andpopulation. The extent of the physical and economicdestruction visited on our country  in terms of infrastructure industry  agriculture  education and health services  as wellas the more painful human losses - the death of over150 000 people  the exile of a quarter of the population Forty-eighth session - 30 September l993 9massive displacement  and over 100 000 disabled andorphaned - are appalling by any standard  especially whenmeasured against the meagre resources and small size of ourpopulation.Formidable as our problems are  we are confident thatwe can and will rebuild our devastated country and providea decent life for ourselves. It is our firm conviction thatoutside assistance  no matter how generous  cannot of itselfsolve our problems. Ultimately  deliverance will depend onour own efforts  on the mobilization and efficient utilizationof our resources. But as we start to clear the rubble andpick up the pieces after three decades of war and destruction we find that our resources are too limited for the awesometask of rehabilitation and jump-starting our economy. Wecannot help but ask: Will the United Nations and theinternational community come to our assistance this time orwill our pleas once again go unheeded?At this critical juncture of its history  Eritrea needs anddeserves international support and assistance  not onlybecause the United Nations and the international communitybear special responsibility for Eritrea  but also because it isa test case for the United Nations ""Agenda for Peace"" andthe whole concept of peace-building. Eritrea has not onlysecured peace and stability; it has made the rare achievementof establishing warm relations of cooperation with its formerenemy  Ethiopia. And it is tackling the task ofreconstruction with popular support and participation  withcommitment and determination  with sound and flexiblepolicies  with prudent and efficient utilization of limitedresources  and with a demonstrated readiness to promoteregional understanding and cooperation.Unfortunately  the response of the United Nations andthe international community so far has not been encouraging.Though the active involvement of the United Nations in thereferendum was generally commendable  United Nationscontributions to the Eritrean referendum - one of the mostsuccessful electoral processes in which the United Nationshas ever been involved - was less than $2 million  a meagresum compared to the tens of millions of dollars devoted tosimilar exercises  many of which were dismal failures.Similarly  the response of the international community to theprogramme for the repatriation of half a million Eritreanrefugees from the Sudan fell far short of reasonableexpectations  and the Government has found no alternativebut to start the programme regardless of funds and expectedproblems. Eritrea has also embarked on a crucialdemobilization programme - it has demobilized close to onethird of its 90 000-man army in the first phase - withoutUnited Nations or other contribution. It had to cut backsome of its rehabilitation and development projects andborrow money to finance this first phase.In our efforts at mobilizing international resources  wehave repeatedly been met with such excuses as ""a lack offunds""  ""competing demands""  ""more pressing priorities"" and""donor fatigue"". There well may be some truth in all of this.And we are appreciative of the constraints and commendableefforts of some donors. But  I believe  we cannot andshould not hesitate to acknowledge that  by and large  theinternational aid programme is deeply flawed  unfair  unjustand ill-structured to respond to the vital needs of recipientcommunities. Assistance and the amounts of assistanceappear to be decided  not on the basis of need or thecapacity to put the assistance to good use  but - even afterthe proclamation of the end of the cold war - on the basis ofthe interests and agendas of donors. Moreover  theinternational community tends to be more responsive toputting out fires than to preventing them  and once the firesare put out it often turns its back on the smoulderingcombustible remains.One of the most disquieting features of the presentinternational situation is the marginalization of the entirecontinent of Africa. Every indicator shows that Africa issliding back and being left behind  which results inintolerable poverty  suffering and desperation for millions ofits people. There is no denying that the onus of theresponsibility for these problems falls first and foremost onus Africans. But  I believe  the international communitymust squarely face the fact that it also bears responsibilityfor Africa’s plight. Many of the dictators who have sown somuch havoc and suffering were in fact brought to power andsustained during the years of the cold war by sections of theinternational community. Perhaps more significant is thefact that the now discredited economic policies and failedprojects were generally designed and approved byinternational donors and implemented under the direction ofan army of foreign experts and advisers.In our present highly interlinked world  Africa’smarginalization  the poverty and desperation of its people  ofits youth  cannot be walled in within the continent’sboundaries. They are bound to threaten global prosperityand stability. The frustration and resentment that continueto swell and may well explode must be defused in time.Once again Africa must seize its own destiny. Its peopleand leaders must tap deep into their human and materialresources and come up with the wisdom  strategy andcommitment to lift Africa from the mire. But as they set outon this difficult road the international community needs tocome to their assistance  not with hand-outs that only10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionincrease dependency  not with the familiar packages andprojects that have gone down the drain  not withpreconceived formulas and attitudes of ""We know what isbest""  but in a spirit of partnership dedicated to helpingAfrica to stand on its own feet and contribute to theenrichment of human life and the protection of theenvironment.Of course  not everything in Africa has been bleak.Just as gross human failure is not limited to Africa - witnessevents in Bosnia and Herzegovina  the former Soviet Unionand elsewhere - Africa has its share of positive and upliftingdevelopments and successes. We are following with muchinterest the determined and promising efforts of severalAfrican countries  both at the individual country level andwithin a regional context. Despite the neglect and inequitiesof the international community  many African peoples aremaking a determined assault on poverty and social injustice.In our part of the continent  Eritrea and Ethiopia havealready started mutually beneficial economic cooperation and  together with the other countries of the Horn  areworking to set up a regional mechanism to foster peace andcooperation. We strongly believe all of the many positivedevelopments in Africa should be duly recognized.In view of the positive developments in the Horn ofAfrica  the tragedy that has gripped Somalia has beenprofoundly disturbing. As the bloodletting among ourSomali brothers assumed harrowing proportions  and at atime when many were hesitating  we strongly advocated theconstructive intervention of the international community under the umbrella of the United Nations  to save lives andhelp extricate Somalia from the destruction it was headingfor. Despite our opposition in principle to external militaryintervention  we realized early on that the extraordinarysituation in Somalia demanded extraordinary measures.It was therefore with great relief that we welcomed thedecision of the United States Administration to intervene inSomalia. Encouraged  we sought - individually and inconjunction with our regional partners - to ensure that theintervention would be guided by clear and comprehensivesecurity  and humanitarian and political objectives. And wedid not hesitate to share our views on the size  type andlength of stay of the intervention force needed for thesuccess of the mission. But unfortunately our views werenot heeded  although we were  and still are  better placed tounderstand and work in the realities of neighbouringSomalia.Be that as it may  we recognize and appreciate theachievements of the international intervention in Somalia.The improvement of the humanitarian situation and theMarch 1993 Addis Ababa Accords on national reconciliationare major steps forward. At the same time  the worseningsecurity situation in Mogadishu and the increasing toll inhuman lives  including women and children  have cast a longshadow on the intervention in Somalia. Repeated mistakesin handling the situation have led some people openly to callfor an immediate end to the intervention.It is our conviction that a precipitate withdrawal ofUnited States troops - which we strongly warned againstfrom the beginning - would not only signal a lack of UnitedStates commitment to the intervention  but would eventuallymake the position of the United Nations Operation inSomalia (UNOSOM II) untenable. This would plungeSomalia into a catastrophe much worse than the anarchy thatprompted the intervention in the first place. We thereforeurge the United States and the international community atlarge to stay the course in Somalia and to shoulder theirresponsibility to the Somali people in the hour of theirgreatest need. We also urge them to review  frankly anddispassionately  the intervention to date  build on thesuccesses and achievements and  more importantly  admitand correct mistakes.We sincerely believe that the countries of the region whose role has so far been deliberately or otherwiseneglected  can make a constructive contribution to theinternational effort. Consulting them informally every oncein a while  as has been the case in the past  is clearly notenough. They need to become part of the process in a moremeaningful and formalized way  as it concerns and affectsthem directly and more than anyone outside the region.The advent of the new State of Eritrea happilycoincided with the end of the cold war  that era ofsuper-Power rivalry that caused so much human misery andled to the virtual paralysis of the United Nations. Like therest of humanity  we place much hope on the new era  onthe prospects of an enhanced role for the United Nations  arole that would make it truly representative of ""We  thepeoples of the world"". And yet we have no illusions that anew  just and equitable world order has dawned. We see toomany old habits and practices - inside the United Nationsand outside it - to entertain any illusions. Although we hopefor successes  we see that the failures of United Nationsinitiatives far outnumber any of its successes. Injusticeendures within nations and between nations.We are awed by the challenges that continue to facehumanity and are deeply aware of our minuscule capabilities.Still  Eritrea is determined to make its own smallForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 11contribution to the betterment of human life in its owncorner of the world."
"52",2211,"ESP",48,1993,"I should like first of all  Mr. President  toconvey to you my warmest congratulations. Your electionto the presidency of this Assembly is a clearacknowledgement of your personal qualities and diplomaticskills and is a tribute to your country  the Republic ofGuyana. We are pleased that you were nominated as a16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioncandidate by the Group of Latin American and CaribbeanStates  with which my country has particularly close andcooperative relations.I should also like to pay tribute to and greet warmlyMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. The United Nations needs hisproven competence and political experience in order to facethe numerous challenges before us at the end of the century.You may rest assured  Mr. Secretary-General  that incarrying out your complex tasks you can count on the firmcooperation of the Spanish authorities.Allow me also to convey at this time to theGovernment and the people of India our deepest sympathyfor and solidarity with the victims of the earthquake thatravaged that country yesterday.Over the last year the universality of the United Nationshas once again been enhanced by the admission of the CzechRepublic  Slovakia  the Former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia  Eritrea  Monaco and Andorra as new Members.I welcome them all  and most particularly Andorra  aneighbour of Spain with which we are linked by special tiesof history  culture and deep friendship.A few days ago Belgium’s Minister of Foreign Affairs speaking on behalf of the European Community and itsmember States  set forth our common points of view in thisgeneral debate. On behalf of the Spanish delegation  I shallmention some issues that I think deserve special attention.A year ago  when I addressed this Assembly for thefirst time  I referred  as did many other speakers  to thefundamental changes that had taken place in the world sincethe middle of the last decade. It is the SpanishGovernment’s firm conviction that those changes have led tothe advent of a new era. The United Nations has a greatopportunity to play an effective  central role in harmonizingworld-wide the efforts of the international community inorder to achieve the common purposes embodied in the Charter.Thus  it seems that the time has come to strengthen ourOrganization by providing it with the necessary human andmaterial resources to enable it to carry out its goals. Wemust also think about the measures necessary for a possiblerevision of the Charter.A review of the Security Council is an item on ouragenda  and this needs to be approached in a constructivespirit and with the aim of increasing its representativenessand ensuring that its actions be not only fast but alsoeffective. Such a review should be based on the criteriaestablished in Article 23 of the Charter  that is to say  takinginto account the contribution of Member States to themaintenance of international peace and security and to theother purposes of the Organization  and also to equitablegeographical distribution.We believe that the time has come for a moderateincrease in the membership of the Council so as to reflectthe increase in the number of Members of the Organizationsince 1963  when  for the first time  it was decided toexpand the Council’s membership.We also deem it appropriate to consider the creation ofnew categories: one that would enable certain States tobecome permanent members without the right of veto  andanother that would allow more frequent non-permanentmembership in the Council to certain States with weight andinfluence in international relations that have the capacity andpolitical will to contribute significantly to the fulfilment ofthe purposes and principles of the United Nations. All thiswould undoubtedly serve to put our Organization in a betterposition to face the challenges of maintaining peace andinternational security.In this context  it is also necessary to make reforms inorder to deal with the changing nature of the tasks assignedto the peace operations established by the Security Council.The traditional concept of peace-keeping operations embracing monitoring of cease-fire agreements  interpositionbetween adversarial forces and the establishment ofconfidence-building measures - all by primarily militarymeans - has been expanded  increasingly encompassing new non-military aspects. These new tasks range fromhumanitarian assistance to nation-building  and include themonitoring of elections and of the observance of humanrights. Nearly 100 000 men and women from all over theworld are currently serving in the framework of theseincreasingly complex and demanding operations.The United Nations has made a commendable effort toadapt the structure and functioning of peace operations to thenew exigencies. We should pursue our efforts in thisdirection  as we are convinced that it is always preferable tosolve a conflict under the aegis of the United Nations thanthrough the unilateral action of a Power or group of Powersoutside the framework of the Organization.Here I should like to draw the Assembly’s attention tosome relevant questions regarding the proper functioning ofpeace operations and to offer some ideas and suggestionsaimed at enhancing their performance and effectiveness.Forty-eighth session - 30 September l993 17When establishing a peace operation  the SecurityCouncil should pay the utmost attention to definingaccurately its mandate. The Council should also receiveperiodic information on the development of the operation.Consultation mechanisms should be established with thoseStates that have a special interest  because of theirinvolvement in the operation or their troop contributions.Special attention should also be given to questions ofsafety. Acts of violence against the Blue Helmets haveincreased alarmingly because of the growing complexity andrisks of the operations. The issue of safety should beconsidered most seriously. In this regard we have examinedwith the greatest interest the Secretary-General’s report tothe Security Council and the recommendations of the SpecialCommittee on Peace-keeping Operations. We believe thatthe use of force against United Nations personnel must beregarded as unacceptable interference in the exercise of theresponsibilities entrusted to the Security Council by theCharter. When such acts occur  the Council should takeappropriate measures  the first of which should be to holdresponsible the perpetrators of the acts.The Spanish Government considers it imperative thatthe appropriate financial resources be made available to theUnited Nations in timely fashion to meet the cost of theseoperations. We all share the responsibility for ensuring asound financial and administrative basis for peace operations.Before a new operation is established  an estimate of itsfinancial implications should be presented to the Council.A the same time  the task assigned to the SecurityCouncil in terms of peace-keeping and peace enforcementshould not lead us to forget the competence of the GeneralAssembly on budgetary questions and in the field ofpreventive diplomacy  especially peace-building. With thecooperation of United Nations operational activities  theGeneral Assembly must play an important role in this overallapproach to international security  as is referred to by theSecretary-General in his ""An Agenda for Peace"".Neither should the Secretariat be overlooked. Itsstructure and logistical capacity for managing peaceoperations need to be reviewed and expanded. We applaudthe Secretary-General’s efforts in this respect.Aware of the crucial importance taken on by peaceoperations  Spain - which has participated and continues toparticipate through a large number of military and civilianobservers in various operations  particularly in CentralAmerica and southern Africa - decided a year ago to send amilitary contingent of about 1 000 soldiers to Bosnia andHerzegovina as part of the United Nations Protection Force(UNPROFOR).Within the framework of the increasingly necessarycooperation between the United Nations and regionalorganizations  my country sent observers to help inmonitoring compliance with the sanctions imposed againstSerbia and Montenegro and is maintaining naval units in theAdriatic. Spanish personnel also take part in the observermissions of the European community and the Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).The people and the Government of Spain are proud ofthe work being done by our forces and observers. I wishto take this opportunity to pay tribute to those who havegiven their blood and their lives while serving in thesepeaceful humanitarian missions of the Organization.Since the beginning of the terrible conflict in the formerYugoslavia the Spanish people and Government have donetheir best to alleviate the suffering of the population andhave contributed  within the framework of the SecurityCouncil and the International Conference on the FormerYugoslavia  to the development of a political process aimedat achieving a peaceful solution acceptable to all parties.We have all been appalled by the cruelty of that war andfrustrated by the endless negotiations.It is only fitting to acknowledge the splendid workaccomplished  under extremely difficult circumstances  bythe United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Wewould also express gratitude for the skill and dedication ofthe co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of theInternational Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.Provided they can rely on the parties’ basic goodwill andcapacity for compromise  their efforts should lead to anagreement before this coming winter brings with it adreadful human catastrophe. If the hoped for agreement isreached  the international community and the Organizationwill then be faced with a new challenge  that of guaranteeingimplementation of the peace agreement through theestablishment of a peace-keeping operation under theauspices and authority of the United Nations. Spain wouldbe prepared to contribute to such a force.This year the Security Council decided to establish anInternational Tribunal to bring to trial those charged withserious violations of international humanitarian lawcommitted in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Webelieve that this crucial step will also encourage at thissession of the General Assembly the speedy completion of18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionwork leading to the establishment of a permanentinternational criminal tribunal with universal jurisdiction.In the past few months important developments havetaken place in various other parts of the world.My Government is following with anxiety and hopethe recent events in Russia - with anxiety  because at onetime it appeared that the internal stability of that countryand  therefore  of Europe and the rest of the world  was injeopardy  but also with hope that the Russian peoplethemselves will become the masters of their own destiny.We are concerned about the worsening conflict inAbkhazia and the continued confrontation in Nagorny-Karabakh between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. We appealto the wisdom and capacity for dialogue of all the partiesinvolved and reiterate our support for the peace efforts of theUnited Nations and the Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe (CSCE).In Angola the process of restoring democratic normalityand coexistence has been seriously hampered by UNITA’srefusal to accept the outcome of free and fair elections  thuspreventing the implementation of the Bicesse Accords. Thishas compelled the Security Council to impose sanctions onUNITA in the hope that its leadership will reconsider itsattitude and begin to cooperate in good faith to put an endto a conflict of catastrophic human proportions.We wish to recall that a number of the problems arisingfrom the war between Iraq and Kuwait are still unresolved among them the exchange of prisoners and the return ofstolen assets by the invader. The fact that Iraq has not yetrecognized either the existence of Kuwait as a sovereignState  Member of the United Nations  the demarcation of theborder between the two countries  which was recentlyconfirmed by the Security Council  constitutes a seriousobstacle to peace.The persistence of those and other conflicts should notmake us forget the progress achieved in the solution ofmany others.Here we would especially mention the success achievedin Cambodia through the United Nations TransitionalAuthority in Cambodia (UNTAC)  with the holding last Mayof elections for a Constituent Assembly  elections that pavedthe way to national unity and reconciliation.In the Middle East  the serious obstacles that werethreatening to scuttle the peace process launched two yearsago in Madrid have been overcome. The mutual recognitionbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization(PLO)  along with the signing in Washington on 13September of an Agreement on the establishment of anautonomous Palestinian regime in Jericho and Gaza  is adevelopment of far-reaching significance. Spain welcomesthis fundamental step in the tortured history of the MiddleEast and is prepared  together with other countries  tomaintain its political and economic support in order toensure that the Agreement between the Palestinians andIsraelis becomes effective. We are aware that the process isfraught with difficulties  but we believe that they can besurmounted with the same courage and imagination alreadydisplayed in achieving the recent agreements  and with thesupport of the international community.In Africa  new developments have taken place  althoughnot without some delay and difficulties. In Mozambique wehave witnessed the implementation of the General PeaceAgreement  with the invaluable cooperation of the UnitedNations Operation in Mozambique (UNOMOZ). In Somalia the Security Council has given the United Nations Operationin Somalia (UNOSOM II) one of the broadest mandates everconferred upon a United Nations operation. It cannot bedenied that problems of internal adjustment have beencaused by the very novelty and magnitude of the tasksentrusted to UNOSOM II  and they will have to taken intoaccount in future peace-keeping operations. Nevertheless the Operation’s contribution has been vital in reducing theconsequences of a catastrophe caused by natural disastersand armed rivalries that have claimed hundreds of thousandsof victims.Turning to the question of Western Sahara  I wish toexpress Spain’s full support for the efforts being made bythe Secretary-General and his Special Representative to finda solution to the outstanding problems that will makepossible the holding of a free and fair referendum on self-determination. That referendum will pave the way for theclimate of understanding and cooperation that is necessaryto deal with the challenges in the region. My countryresolutely supports the process of integration in the North ofAfrica and the development of stronger links betweenEurope and the Maghreb.We also welcome the progress made in the transitionalprocess in South Africa  although we regret the fact thatviolence still holds sway in certain areas. The progressmade in the drafting of a Constitution and the promptestablishment of the Transitional Executive Council are theForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 19best possible foundations for the holding of general electionsin 1994 to prepare the way for a truly representativeParliament and a democratic South Africa that will be ableto find its true place in the Organization and in theinternational community.In Latin America  a number of recent events deservespecial consideration.I should mention first the process of consolidation ofdemocracy through the free election of civilian Presidentsand Parliaments in nearly the whole of the continent. Thatfact  enhanced by a number of forums such as the RioGroup  the Central American Summits or the Ibero-American Summits  has reversed attempts to violate thelegitimacy of the democratic process.Latin America continues to place special emphasis onthe use of negotiation  mediation and conciliation in solvingits conflicts  in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VIof the Charter.Respect for international law and democracy are theprinciples that have guided and will continue to guide theactivities of the international community aimed at restoringdemocratic legality in Haiti. Those principles have alsoinspired the decisive agreements with regard to the peaceprocess in El Salvador  where we hope the recommendationsof the Ad Hoc Commission and the Commission on theTruth will be implemented. Finally  those same principleswill be the basis for reconciliation and development inNicaragua and Guatemala.Once again this year I have to mention a matter that  asthe Assembly knows  is of fundamental importance to Spain namely  the decolonization of Gibraltar. I wish to reiteratemy Government’s firm decision to continue the process ofnegotiation with the United Kingdom in a constructive spiritand on the basis of the Brussels Declaration of 27 November1984. Those negotiations should duly take into account thelegitimate interests of the population  but be based on thedoctrine established by the General Assembly that thedecolonization of Gibraltar is not a case of self-determination but of the restoration of the territorial integrityof Spain. The Spanish Government firmly hopes that thosenegotiations will finally eliminate this anachronism.In the field of disarmament new challenges haveemerged  such as the need to put an end to the proliferationof weapons of mass destruction. Now  more than ever  weneed to redouble our efforts to move beyond a period ofconfrontation that belongs to the past.There is a pressing need to strengthen the multilateralnegotiating forums to enable them to face the newchallenges efficiently. In this respect  my country considersthat priority should be given to enlarging the Conference onDisarmament  on the basis of a consensus that will enablecountries like Spain  which have been participating activelyin its work for a long time  to become members.There is a clear link between international peace andsecurity on the one hand and economic and socialdevelopment on the other. In this new era  when the UnitedNations is renewing its efforts to maintain internationalpeace and security  we must note the persistence of deepdisparities and serious economic and social problemsbesetting all countries  in particular the developing countries.To confront these challenges  the reform of the UnitedNations should extend to the Organization’s economic andsocial machinery. The reforms  which have already begun should be aimed at achieving more effective functioning andat using available resources more rationally to meet theneeds of developing countries.In that context  let me mention the convening of thefirst session of the Commission on Sustainable Development.We hope its work will maintain and even intensify the greatmomentum generated by the Rio Summit on environmentand development and lead to the speedy implementation ofthe commitments made there in Agenda 21.But it is not enough to repair and fine-tune themachinery we intend to use to deal with the challenges ofdevelopment. We need clear guidelines by which to steer itunerringly towards the wide range of current needs  inparticular those of the developing countries. Hence  we lookforward with great interest to the Secretary-General’s""Agenda for Development""; in conjunction with ""An Agendafor Peace""  this will supplement the guidelines for action bythe international community with respect to the indivisibleequation of world peace and economic and socialdevelopment.In that context  I want to recall that the thirdIbero-American Summit  held at Salvador de Bahía  Brazil last July  considered ""An agenda for development""  with theemphasis on social development. The conclusions adoptedby the Heads of State or Government of the 21 participatingcountries were submitted to the Secretary-General as acontribution to the preparation of his own ""Agenda forDevelopment"".The final document of that Summit stressed thegrowing interrelationship among the concepts ofdevelopment  democracy and human rights. It drewattention to the priority that should be given to the fightagainst poverty both on the governmental level and whenallocating resources and creating machinery for internationalcooperation. Our starting-point should be to promoteintegrated economic and social development  bearing in mindthe three priorities the Secretary-General set out at the lastsession of the Economic and Social Council: redistribution integration and protection.The structure of and developments in the worldpopulation give rise to grave uncertainties about theirconsequences and about the aspirations of developingcountries to attain sustainable development. These and otherimportant issues such as large-scale migration  improving themachinery for cooperation  and managing resources for thatpurpose will be discussed at the International Conference onPopulation and Development to be held next year at Cairo.We hope that Conference will mark a significant steptowards the solution of these questions by addressingtogether the issues of population  economic growth andsustainable development.The Spanish Government considers that there is also anurgent need to integrate women into the developmentprocess  eliminate discrimination against women and ensuretheir full participation in the economic  social  cultural  civicand political spheres. We trust that this commitment will berenewed and buttressed by the international community atthe Fourth World Conference on Women  to be held inBeijing in 1995.The World Summit for Social Development  theconvening of which my country strongly supported from theoutset  is to be held at Copenhagen in 1995. It will give apolitical impetus to improving the living conditions of themost disadvantaged sectors of our populations. It will helppromote their social integration and the creation of a conceptof social development taking into account the relationshipbetween peace and well-being  while aiming to reducepoverty and increase employment.Year after year from this rostrum we emphasize ourfirm intention to build a better world in which the protectionand promotion of human rights and fundamental freedomswill become real and effective. Unfortunately  year afteryear we are forced to observe that  despite all our efforts  thepractices that endanger human life  freedom and securitypersist. It is therefore no longer enough to state ourreadiness to step up our efforts; we must now move  insolidarity  to action.In that respect  the outcome of the Vienna Conferenceon human rights gives us an excellent opportunity to worksteadfastly towards our common goal. We now have a setof universal rules  universally accepted; we must now insiston their obligatory application. There can be no democracywithout respect for human rights  and without democracythere cannot be the harmonious  balanced and lastingdevelopment to which we all aspire.For that reason  it is of high importance that weproceed expeditiously to implement the Viennacommitments  in particular the programme of action. In theview of the Spanish Government there are two key issuesthe resolution of which could lead to unprecedented progressin this area. First  we must agree on the establishment ofthe office of a high commissioner for human rights; andsecondly  we must provide the United Nations Centre forHuman Rights with the resources it needs to carry out itsmandate fully.In my statement today I have tried to address the mostpressing challenges facing the Organization  challengesinherent in the increasingly free but increasingly uncertainworld in which we live. I have also advanced proposals forthe reform of the Organization aimed at adapting it to thenew circumstances.It is difficult but necessary that we focus both on thenew problems and on the reform of the Organization. Ourability to do this will determine whether the United Nationscan increasingly serve as the proper forum for resolvingworld problems."
"53",2237,"EST",48,1993,"Before commencing my address  Iwould like to express  on behalf of my nation and myself my sincere sympathy with the people of India on this day ofgreat tragedy.Let me convey to you  Mr. President  mycongratulations on your election to the presidency of theUnited Nations General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.Your election is a fitting tribute to your personal andprofessional qualities  and also to your country  the Republicof Guyana. As an Estonian  I have a special empathy withyour homeland: much like Estonia  yourcountry was liberated from colonial dependence and becamea Member State of the United Nations. Like Estonia  yourcountry remembers that independence is the decisive factorwhich permits small countries to share with great Powersequal responsibility for creating a better world  towardswhich all of us  seated here in this Hall  are striving.To your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev I express my recognition for his proficiency in chairing theforty-seventh session. We also express our deep gratitude toMr. Ganev for visiting Estonia and her sister States Latviaand Lithuania  and for his efforts to apply the moralauthority of the United Nations towards removing theremaining vestiges of colonialism from the Baltic States.To our neighbour in the General Assembly  the State ofEritrea  I express my sincerest welcome and congratulationson its finally joining the family of nations.I would  however  like to take this opportunity toextend especially warm thanks to the Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who has given theUnited Nations and the whole world new hope through hisstrong moral conviction that we need not passively wait forconflicts to arise  but that conflicts should be prevented fromarising; that the United Nations is  in the first place  anarchitect  whose building must not be allowed to be engulfedin flames; that the Organization is only secondarily a fire-fighter who rushes to extinguish fires still burning from thepast. This is so even and perhaps especially when metaphorically speaking  it happens that only a poor man’scowshed has caught fire - for after all  that was enough toburn down all of Chicago.Let me express my appreciation and gratitude forMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali’s radiant moral sense ofresponsibility and for the steadfastness with which he hasdefended the principle of preventive diplomacy. As a smallState  Estonia well understands and desires to support theSecretary-General fully in his defence of the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations and in the implementationof preventive diplomacy.Three years ago  in 1990  I visited the New Yorkmeeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation inEurope as a foreign minister whose entry into the conferenceroom was strictly prohibited. I was interviewed bytelevision journalists in front of United NationsHeadquarters  as chance had it. I stated then that the nexttime I would be here it would be for the raising of theEstonian flag. The journalists did not even attempt to hidetheir polite sympathy nor their desire to bring the interviewquickly to an end. Did they even attempt to present such an""unrealistic"" interview on their television programme?One year later  in September 1991  I watched theraising of the Estonian flag on a United Nations flagpole andconcluded that my mission had been completed. Today I amhere to tell the Assembly  and perhaps also thosesympathetic journalists  that my work as the firstdemocratically elected post-war Estonian President has onlyjust begun.Today my words are infused with self-confidence andhope. Estonia has been and is once again a State; Estoniahas re-established its place under the sun. In this sense weshare common attributes  experiences and goals with the vastmajority of States represented here today. The majority ofthe States Members of the Assembly are only slightly largeror slightly smaller than Estonia  with its 47 000 squarekilometres and 1.5 million inhabitants living on the shores ofthe Baltic Sea. Estonia was robbed of its independence andforced to be the colonial subject of an imperial Power  aswas the case with the majority of the Members here today.Just as they did  so have we restored our independence at thecost of untold suffering. For Estonia  as for most of theMembers here  this work is still incomplete. The UnitedNations General Assembly is the best place for uniting ourforces  so that we can work together.This however requires that the Second World Warfinally end for Estonia. For the Second World War is stillcontinuing in Estonia in a rather peculiar way  because theforeign armed forces which occupied Estonia in 1940 stillremain on our territory  regardless of General Assemblyresolution 47/21. Estonia has for two years patientlyconducted negotiations on the withdrawal of these forces  butwithout positive results. Of course  we were aware thatbehind this rigid position stood the Soviet nomenklatura andthe Russian so-called parliament  which acted on the basis ofthe Brezhnevite Soviet so-called constitution and whose goalwas to restore the Soviet Union in a modernized form.President Yeltsin was a prisoner of this imperialisticallyminded parliament.For this reason  we consider the present momentespecially opportune for President Yeltsin to strengthen theworld’s confidence in democracy by withdrawing theremaining armed forces from Estonia and Latvia and bysigning international agreements to this effect. This wouldguarantee stability and security for the Baltic region  whichis an inseparable part of Europe’s Nordic region - and thatregion  in turn  is an inseparable part of Europe.In my correspondence with President Yeltsin I haveemphasized my readiness to meet him in the nearest future.I would be grateful to the General Assembly  to the SecurityCouncil and to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali if with all their collective moral authority  they would help usrapidly to cut this Gordian knot. This is  after all  not onlya problem for Estonia  Latvia or Lithuania: with this effortthey would also be supporting the democratization of Russia.With the implementation of preventive diplomacy  theywould be removing a potential source of conflict and wouldthereby strengthen the prestige of the United Nations itself.And last  but not least  by implementing international lawequally in the interests of great Powers and of small Statesthey would give back to all of us the hope that  even interms of realpolitik  justice is singular and indivisible.The United Nations could mandate such a mission  tobe led by an authoritative European politician  one in whomboth Russia and the Baltic States could feel equallyconfident. The time is ripe for action. The rapid preparationof an international agreement is in the interests of both sides.When two years of negotiations conducted between a greatPower and a small State remain unproductive  it is a sign ofdanger. Preventive diplomacy consists in the ability torecognize danger signals at an early stage and resolve themin a lightning-rod fashion. This is our first problem and ourprimary task.At different stages  two different arguments were usedin stalling and detouring the negotiations. First  the Russianside claimed it would be unable to find housing for forceswithdrawn from the Baltic States. From a legal standpoint this argument lacks any content whatsoever. The stationingof foreign forces on the territory of a sovereign State againstthe express will of that State and its people is incontradiction with international law and cannot be an itemForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 3for negotiation. At the same time  I would like to repeatagain that Estonia is ready  together with its Nordicneighbours and other partners  and to the extent that itsresources permit  to assist in the solution of this essentiallyhumanitarian problem. We are grateful to our friends  whohave promised housing construction aid in excess of$200 million  and we are prepared  with the help of thesepartners  to mobilize our construction industry towards thisend. We have on several occasions publicly repeated andconfirmed this readiness to our Russian partner.The second argument for the maintenance of foreignarmed forces and their installation on the territory of theBaltic States is in a curious way linked to human rights.According to this line of thinking  which has beenpromulgated primarily in the Western media  the continuedpresence of ex-Soviet armed forces in the Baltic States isrequired for the defence of the human rights of the Russiansresiding there. However  the Russian residents of Estoniahave never supported this argument  since they have notwished to become pawns in a political game.In this connection  I should like to take the opportunityto thank you  Mr. President  and you  Mr. Secretary-General  for the assistance of the United Nations. TheRepublic of Estonia had already enunciated  during the timeof the League of Nations  and now it does so even moreclearly  the basic principle that human rights are not the""internal affair"" of any State. For this reason  on thequestion of human rights in Estonia we turned for expertopinions and advice not only to the United Nations  but alsoto the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe the Council of Europe and the Nordic Council. Thus  I canconfirm that not one of the 15 missions invited by Estoniato inspect the situation firsthand has found human rightsviolations in Estonia. This has also been emphasized bymany speakers during this General Assembly session. It wasalso  I am happy to note  emphasized by President Clintonin our recent meeting.I am disappointed that the idea of human rights -which  for Estonia  is self-evident and sacrosanct  and for thelack of which Estonians themselves  during five decades ofCommunist totalitarianism  had to pay with the loss of theirpride  their freedom and their blood in Soviet and Naziconcentration camps - has been cynicallyexploited. The Republic of Estonia was the first State in theworld to guarantee Jews and other minorities  as early as1925  the right to cultural autonomy. Estonia will neverstand idly by while anyone tries to manipulate human rights.For this reason  Estonia supports the creation of the post ofa United Nations high commissioner for human rights andthe expansion of the United Nations budget earmarked forthe defence of human rights.We wish to work to defend the human rights of allindigenous peoples. We defended the rights of someSiberian peoples during the decades of Soviet totalitarianism although we had to do it alone and quietly. Now we intendto join forces and to do it  with the help of the UnitedNations  publicly.I like to speak of the future in optimistic terms on theassumption that we are capable of finding resolutions to ourpessimistic present  or to be more precise  that we arecapable of applying these resolutions  since they are alreadyoutlined in Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali’s report ""An Agendafor Peace"" (A/47/277). Allow me  Mr. Secretary- General to thank you wholeheartedly for the clear analysis and soberrecommendations on the implementation of such keyconcepts as preventive diplomacy  peacemaking andpeace-keeping. The tragedy in Yugoslavia has reconfirmedthe fact that fire-fighting is much more difficult thanfire-prevention. This lesson  which is written in the Torah the Bible and the Koran  is  thanks to the Secretary- General now slowly penetrating the consciousness of internationalorganizations. Preventive diplomacy  peacemaking andpeace-keeping can be a real hope for the United Nations onthe condition that we learn to recognize danger  where andwhen it becomes manifest.However  in a potential zone of conflict  peace-keepingmust be strictly neutral. We must remember the proverbthat ""You should not let a fox mind the henhouse""  thatpeace-keeping in a particular area cannot be turned over tothose parties that have an obvious interest in the outcome ofa conflict. Estonia supports the principles of democracy  theinviolability of borders and non-interference in the internalaffairs of other countries  principles enshrined in the UnitedNations Charter and in other international agreements.Consequently  we were disturbed - as  I am sure  manyrepresentatives were - by the suggestion of one nationalrepresentative that the troops of one country should beallowed to intervene up to the borders of a State that nolonger exists. I do not have in mind the formerAustro-Hungarian Empire.4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionEstonia can only support a position whereby the choiceof peace-keeping forces by the Security Council meets theapproval of broad international opinion. On this condition Estonia also feels a moral responsibility to participate ininternational peace-keeping according to its capabilities  aswell as in other related activities.This brings me to the consolidation of democracy andthe free market economy in Estonia after 50 years of anabsurd colonial command economy. Estonia has alreadybeen successful  but  together with other Members of theOrganization  we could be even more successful.Democracy and the free market economy are interconnected because they presuppose the right and the responsibility tofreely choose. The former Soviet Union spent more moneyon repressing free thought than it ever did on the creation ofa nuclear arsenal. The murder of freedom and the birth ofaggression are two sides of the same coin. The first enemyof every totalitarian regime is the domestic enemy  and itsfirst object of attack is free thought. Everyone presentknows Adam Michnik’s wonderful metaphor about how easyit is to make fish soup from an aquarium  but how difficultit is to make an aquarium from fish soup.The main resource from which we have drawn theenergy for the transformation of Estonia’s economy has beenthe idealism of the Estonian people. This is a largeresource  but it is not endless. I want to prevent exhaustionfrom setting in  exhaustion which could be followed bypolitical apathy and thereby by a desire to be free both ofrights and obligations. The replacement of a commandeconomy by a market economy is a disintegrative processboth at the State and individual level as long as the markethas not started working. Once the market is working  itworks for economic and political integration. Therefore Estonia is more interested in trade  not aid  and therefore wework actively to keep and expand our free trade agreementsthrough negotiations with Brussels.My aim has been to suggest that the internationalcommunity has gained new members - the countries intransition. Here the question arises whether the UnitedNations has realized our special possibilities and our specialneeds. Estonia does not belong in either the first  second orthird world. Do we really need a fourth world  or do weneed the ability to react more sensitively to a world whichis in constant dynamic change?I offer as an example an issue that is as unpleasant tothe Assembly as it is to me: the division by 15 of thefinancial commitments of the former Soviet Union  includingits United Nations assessment. Estonia has stated repeatedly and I do not hesitate to state here again  that we cannot andwe will not accept this  as we were never legally part of theSoviet Union. Times have changed; our world communitymust realize this.We also feel a responsibility to assist others as we havebeen assisted during the past few years. While Estonia isstill reeling from the disastrous consequences of a 50-yearoccupation  we do have well-educated specialists who couldbe of service to the United Nations in parts of the worldwhere their skills would be welcome. And I should like tooffer the experience we have gained in starting up a countryand in creating a new  stable currency.Allow me to close with some very personal comments.The United Nations is approaching its fiftieth anniversary.The post-war world is approaching its fiftieth anniversary.The United Nations is acting on the basis of an unalteredCharter. But  as I mentioned above  the world has beenaltered totally. This ever-increasing contrast is most stronglyfelt by some of the most sensitive United Nations Members the majority  the small States. I believe that small Stateshave the obligation to redefine the international order. Thelarge nations have the larger obligations  the small States thelarger possibilities. This is not a contradiction  but abalance. After all  an Inuit kayak can change its courseimmediately  while a supertanker needs perilously much timeand space to do so.The best place to redefine the world order is theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations. I am deeplygrateful to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali who sensing this need  has entrusted into our hands his vision ofa stable world  entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"". As arepresentative of one of Europe’s smallest countries andoldest nations  I should like to suggest that the prevalenttendency of the past century  and especially the past decades has been an increase in the numbers of small countries anda reduction in the number of large ones. The issue ofincreasing the number of permanent members of the SecurityCouncil has been introduced into the agenda  and Estoniasupports this as a step towards accepting today’s newrealities. Personally  I should like to put to you  membersof the General Assembly  the following question: should theSecurity Council not also include as a member with vetopower a representative of the world’s majority  the smallnations?I do not have an answer to this question and neither doyou. This is not tragic. The opposite would be tragic.Seeking for answers is the United Nations future and ourcommon hope. Today we speak of the fatal differencesForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 5between cultures. Thereby the inevitability of conflicts issuggested.Conflicts are not fatal only because someone believesin Buddha  another in Jehovah  another in Christ or Allah orthe shamans of Siberia. Cultures have to be different toallow man  with his rights and duties  to look like man  tolook like hope. The day before coming here I read a bookby the famous Finnish philosopher Matti Kuusi on whathope means to man. The Mexican says that you cannot fillyour stomach with hope  but it will keep the soul in yourmouth; a Kanuri African will say that hope is the pillar; theFilipino says that daring is the fruit of hope and the Maltesesays that he who gives up hope dies.This diversity is the unity of mankind. And to make iteasier for you to keep the unity of man and the world  I willadd for salt  pepper and enjoyment a proverb from myshores  the shores of the Baltic: do not lose yourhopelessness. Hopelessness is the inevitable shadow ofhope  and the ever-persevering United Nations is thecollective hope of mankind.I thank you for your hopeful patience."
"54",2283,"ETH",48,1993,"It gives me great pleasure tocongratulate Ambassador Insanally of Guyana on his electionto the high office of the presidency of the forty-eighthsession of the General Assembly.I am also delighted to welcome the new Members ofthe Organization. In this regard allow me to welcomeespecially the State of Eritrea as a Member of the UnitedNations. At the end of a cruel war the people of Eritreaexercised their right to self-determination and opted forForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 33sovereign statehood in a referendum which won praise fromthe United Nations  the Organization of African Unity andother international organizations as being free and fair.Addis Ababa and Asmara took steps immediately to forge anew era of close relationship and cooperation.The healing of the wounds of war has progresseddramatically. Building for shared prosperity is progressingin earnest. Ethiopia believes that the spirit in which theEritrean problem was resolved  as well as the developmentstaking place to forge a basis for permanent peace and all-round cooperation  is a unique manifestation of the era ofchange from conflict to concord. Peace has provided uswith the opportunity to concentrate on reconstruction and laythe groundwork for sustainable development in Ethiopia andin Eritrea.The vision of the Ethiopian and Eritrean leadershipsand peoples is for economic  social and cultural integrationleading to political integration on a new plane. Theleaderships of the two countries have a vision for expandingsuch integration to include the countries of the subregion.The establishment of peace and stability is therefore apriority agenda in the coordinated efforts of our twoGovernments and we are determined to pursue ourobjectives  however difficult the hurdles may be.Nevertheless  we recognize that the Ethiopian and Eritreansituation does not cover all the hopes and expectations forthe changes that have taken place in the last few years.As there are encouraging developments in some partsof the world  we are also witnessing painful situations inothers. The crisis in Somalia is a case in point. Since thiscrisis is at the heart of my Government’s concerns  I wouldlike to beg the indulgence of this Assembly to take a fewmoments to make a brief comment on the disturbingdevelopments there.It is to be recalled that the Security Council’s decisionto restore order and to open the channels for the delivery ofhumanitarian aid was put into effect in December 1992 andthereafter. Immediate action was then taken to bringtogether the warring factions as well as representatives ofvarious sectors of Somali society. The aim was to securetheir agreement on a plan of action for the restoration ofpeace and the establishment of the structures of civiladministration. In particular  the reconciliation input of thehigh-level Horn of Africa Standing Committee on Somaliawas brought to bear at the Conference held in Addis Ababain March of this year. An agreement was hammered out ona series of measures leading to peace and political stabilityin the country. The main elements of the agreementincluded a cease-fire; a programme of disarmament; regionalreconciliation; measures on finding a political solution to beachieved through the establishment of elected district andregional councils  to culminate in the establishment of atransitional national council as the highest organ of state; andthe principles for the settlement of conflicts relating toproperty claims.Concurrently  the Addis Ababa agreement of March1993 provides for modalities of continuing humanitarianrelief and the initiation of rehabilitation as well asreconstruction programmes. The United Nations Operationin Somalia (UNOSOM) was to manage peace-keeping andthe maintenance of an appropriate environment for theexecution of rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes.It was then hoped that implementation of the politicalaspects of the Addis Ababa agreement would proceed asplanned.However  the Somali situation took a tragic turn particularly when  on 5 June this year  United Nationspeace-keepers from Pakistan and many Somalis were killed.That was a deplorable incident indeed  and we continue tobe seriously disturbed by the tragic events which haveresulted since then in further loss of life with no apparentend to the crisis. Indeed  there is a deadlock and a dilemmaas to how to overcome the impasse in Mogadishu.In the view of my delegation  a thorough review of allaspects of the Somali situation by the United Nations isimperative. Such a review should be aimed at restoring thesituation that existed before 5 June and at proceeding fromthere with the implementation of the Addis Ababaagreement. In this respect  it is clear that involving thefactions as well as representatives of the various sectors ofSomali society in the processes is vital.UNOSOM is the last chance Somalia has. Therefore it must not be allowed to fail. Its preoccupation with the 5June incident should not be allowed to divert its attentionfrom its ultimate goal of political reconciliation andeconomic and social rehabilitation. It must be recognizedthat  for the objectives of UNOSOM to be achieved  thebattle for the hearts and minds of all Somalis must be won.My delegation believes that all UNOSOM troops should bematerially and spiritually equipped to fight and win such awar  and that whenever there are shortcomings in that regardUNOSOM should be prepared to act promptly to redressthem. Ethiopia is ready to contribute its share to such ascenario. It will be recalled  in this regard  that theOrganization of African Unity at its summit meeting inCairo in June of this year gave a mandate to President Meles34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionZenawi of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia to followup and assist in the resolution of the Somali crisis. Thismandate was endorsed by the fourth summit of the Heads ofState and Government of the Inter-Governmental Authorityon Drought and Development (IGADD).I would like to quote from the Declaration adopted bythe fourth summit of IGADD  held in Addis Ababa on 6 and7 September 1993.""We applaud the positive achievements of theUnited Nations in Somalia in preventing the death ofthousands of Somalis through starvation and conflict;""We reinforce the conviction that caution isrequired in handling the current very complicatedpolitical situation in Somalia;""We further call for a meaningful consultationbetween UNOSOM and the countries of the subregionand reiterate the need for a more active role on the partof the countries of the subregion;""We fully endorse the mandate given to PresidentMeles Zenawi to follow developments in Somalia onbehalf of the OAU by also mandating him to follow upthe developments in that member State on behalf of thecountries of the subregion.""While the implementation of the Addis Ababaagreement is  in our considered view  the only viable avenuetowards a political solution to the Somali crisis  we alsoregard UNOSOM as a guarantor against a slide into anarchyin Somalia. We urge UNOSOM to continue with its taskuntil the objectives of the Addis Ababa agreement are fullyachieved.The problem of refugees and persons displaced by ahost of calamities continues to haunt the Horn of Africasubregion. In this regard  Ethiopia continues to faceimmense difficulties  the solutions of which are beyond whatits meagre resources and capacities allow. On top of this Ethiopia has to cope with the requirements of settling closeto 1 million returnees.It is to be recalled that agreement on principles for thedelivery of humanitarian assistance was reached with thedonors at the Horn of Africa Conference held in AddisAbaba in April 1992. Those principles should be observedto ensure that relief assistance reaches the needy.Human life is precious. Denying people the right tosurvival  therefore  is a crime. Those who hamper thedelivery of relief aid to the needy are criminals. Likewise those who hold human survival hostage to their politicalagendas cannot and must not be regarded as anything butcriminals.It may be possible to put pressure on the recipients witha view to adjusting their positions in ways that wouldfacilitate the delivery of relief aid. But the thought ofapplying pressure on the donors is  to say the least nightmarish. I would like to stress that humanitarian workshould be absolutely depoliticized.With respect to other issues of concern to theinternational community  I would like to refer to thepromising developments in South Africa. My delegationwelcomes the decision on the establishment of a TransitionalExecutive Council responsible for supervising the process oftransition towards a non-racial  democratic South Africa.We commend and support all the political leaders for theirbold actions in paving the way for a peaceful transition todemocracy in South Africa.Regrettably  however  there are areas of grave concernwhere peace has yet to materialize. In this regard  theresumption of hostilities in Angola is a blow to thestupendous efforts made by the international community andby Angolans themselves to restore peace in that country.We appeal to the parties concerned to resolve theirdifferences at the negotiating table  taking into account theelections  which have been declared free and fair byinternational observers  as a reference for a politicalsettlement of the Angolan conflict.On other areas of conflict in Africa  Ethiopia appeals toits brothers in Rwanda  Mozambique and Liberia to continuethe momentum towards the establishment of peace in theirrespective countries. Likewise  it is Ethiopia’s fervent hopethat our brothers in the Sudan will soon discover the happymedium that brings peace and tranquility.On the Middle East  Ethiopia welcomes the first steptowards a settlement embodied in the historic agreementsigned in Washington by Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO). We warmly congratulate the leaders ofboth sides on their courageous move  and hope that themomentum towards a comprehensive settlement of theMiddle East conflict will pick up speed as a result.Forty-eighth session - 4 October l993 35However  it appears that our hopes in some areas of theworld are destined to be tempered by virtual despair inothers. I am referring here to the tragic situation in Bosniaand Herzegovina and the senseless killing that seems to haveno end. I call it senseless not with the intent of passingjudgement on the legitimacy of the respective positions ofthe parties to the conflict  but rather to underline theuniversal belief that the dividends of peace are so muchgreater than the gains of an enormously destructive war. Infull recognition of the fact that an end to the war in Bosniaand Herzegovina is in the hands of the combatantsthemselves  we appeal to them to cooperate withinternational mediation efforts.Humanity wants peace. Thus  humanity is looking tothe United Nations and hopes that this Organization’sresources and fortitude will make the desired impact throughpreventive diplomacy  conflict management and conflictresolution. At the regional level  the Organization ofAfrican Unity  at its twenty-ninth summit  held in Cairo lastJune  decided to establish a mechanism for the prevention management and resolution of conflicts. Ethiopia iscommitted to work vigorously for its effectiveimplementation and for its success.Although we are far from being satisfied  the newlyemerging international situation indicates some encouragingprospects in the area of political relationships. In the fieldof international economic relations  however  the situation isfar from encouraging. Our world still faces theuncomfortable reality of its division into two blocs: theaffluent and the poor  the North and the South. Poverty stillrepresents the greatest threat to democratic governance andworld peace and security. Political instability  corruption hunger  illicit drug trafficking and a litany of other evilstrace their roots to mass poverty. And the internationalcommunity is not unaware of the factors that have conspiredto frustrate the hopes and aspirations of poor countries.Promises of special programmes for the least developedcountries  10-year action programmes and so forth agreedupon by the international community have so far made littledifference by way of alleviating poverty. In Africa  overalleconomic growth continues to lag behind population growth.And the continent remains the poorest of all. Since therecan be no stability or better prospects for the world withoutreducing the disparities in levels of global development  bothdeveloped and developing countries should conduct aconstructive dialogue on practical measures for stimulatingdevelopment.Environment and development are the two majorconcerns to which the international community has turned itsattention. In particular  Ethiopia appreciates the internationalcommunity’s support for the effort to combat desertificationand drought  which are causing extensive environmentaldegradation in Africa. We appeal to all Member States tosupport fully the efforts of the intergovernmental negotiatingcommittee for the elaboration of an international conventionto combat desertification. Environmental degradation is amajor development bottleneck which must be addressed asa matter of urgency.This occasion provides me an opportunity to share withthis Assembly a few thoughts on the situation prevailing inEthiopia since the establishment of the transitionalGovernment two years ago. The process of democratizationand self-rule has been consolidated through local andregional elections. The policy on equitable power-sharingamong the various regions and nationalities has succeeded inensuring peace and stability throughout the country. These coupled with the implementation of liberalized economicreforms  reconstruction programmes and improved weatherconditions  have brought about encouraging improvements inthe economy. The supportive role of international financialinstitutions and the donor community have had a usefulimpact on the positive outcome of Ethiopia’s reconstructionand recovery efforts. Therefore  in a brief period of twoyears  Ethiopia has emerged from a state of despair to oneof recovery. We are now looking to the future withconsiderable confidence.With respect to political programmes  Ethiopia haslaunched the final phase of the transition period with workon drafting a constitution. When the constitution isapproved  multi-party elections are planned  on the basis ofwhich permanent State structures will be put in place.Already  an independent judiciary is functioning  andlegality is assuming a prominent role in guaranteeing thehuman rights of the people. Peaceful political activity  afree press and freedom of expression and of conscience areestablished features of Ethiopian life today. Our democraticattitude is working. It is working in consolidating peace andstability and in generating investor and business confidence.It has worked in restoring the confidence of the people intheir own future.Ethiopia is committed to the observance of all aspectsof the protection of human rights. Protection of the dignityof man also means freedom from poverty. ""Prisoner ofconscience"" and ""prisoner of poverty"" are one and the same.The right to freedom of expression and the right to education36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionare indivisible. Concern for human rights is virtuallymeaningless without corresponding action on the alleviationof poverty  ignorance and other causes of deprivation.Ethiopia therefore appeals to the international community tocooperate in addressing the issue of human rights in thecontext of these general principles.Our democratic outlook with respect to our relationswith neighbouring countries and peoples has borne fruit.Ethiopia has never enjoyed such harmony  both internallyand in its relations with its neighbours.Ethiopia has attained the requisite self-confidence thatmakes it a true partner in the community of nations. I wishtherefore to reiterate the continued faith of my country in thecollective wisdom of our global Organization and to pledgeanew our unreserved support for the laudable efforts of theUnited Nations system. We believe that as the guarantor ofinternational peace and stability  the United Nations shouldexpand its efforts by stepping up its activities in the field ofpreventive diplomacy. It should develop new  moreeffective machinery to coordinate actions aimed at enhancingrespect for the norms of international law and ensuring thesecurity and interests of all States.Alongside the maintenance of international peace andsecurity  we welcome United Nations efforts in assisting thedeveloping countries in their endeavour to achieve a greaterdegree of economic development and self-reliance. The roleof the United Nations in world affairs is all-inclusive. Forthis role to be effective  it is important that theOrganization’s methods of operation be characterized byaccountability and transparency. Ethiopia subscribes to thecalls for democratizing the decision-making processes of theUnited Nations system and for streamlining its bureaucracy.I am hopeful that at this session the General Assembly willreview and assess these priority issues with a view torevitalizing the Organization so that it can meet theimperatives of the time."
"55",2329,"FIN",48,1993,"I wish to begin bycongratulating Ambassador Insanally on his election to thehigh office of the presidency of the General Assembly. Hecan rest assured that the delegation of Finland will renderhim its full support in his challenging task.On behalf of my Government  I also wish tocongratulate and extend a warm welcome to the newMembers among us. Their participation in the work of theUnited Nations will further strengthen the Organization.Just a few years ago  in a promisingly changingpolitical environment  high hopes were placed in the UnitedNations. Some of these hopes were fulfilled  others werenot. Namibia’s independence process is a fine example ofnation-building in which the United Nations played a crucialrole. Eritrea is another. Let these be examples of wise andpatient conciliation and conflict management. Yet anotherexample is South Africa  where today we see irrevocablechanges taking place  leading towards a non-racial anddemocratic society. I wish to express my Government’sadmiration for the achievements of the parties in SouthAfrica in their work for peace  cooperation and mutualrespect. Finland has actively supported the shaping of a newSouth Africa and will continue to do so.We have in recent days witnessed yet another exampleof brave and visionary leadership which can overcomeseemingly insuperable obstacles and lead peoples from astate of war and hatred towards reconciliation. I amreferring to the peace accord between Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization. In this context I wish topay a tribute to the Government of Norway for its role inbringing the two parties together. The United Nations mustnow stand ready to play its part in this important endeavourfor peace. Finland  together with the other Nordic countries was among the first to initiate an international supportprogramme for this historic process.The United Nations also has to its credit otherachievements in recent years. Among the most importanthave been the rebuttal of the aggression against Kuwait andthe restoration of democracy in Cambodia. However numerous other conflicts have proved very difficult to solve.War is raging in the former Yugoslavia and in Somalia Angola  Abkhazia and Nagorny-Karabakh. Conflicts persistin Western Sahara and Cyprus. All these conflicts constituteformidable challenges to the international community and tothe United Nations.From that balance sheet of success and failure animportant question emerges: how can our Organization bebest adapted  reformed and revitalized to face effectively notonly the challenges of today but also those of tomorrow?Undoubtedly the United Nations is today a more viableinstitution than ever before. Nevertheless the many unsolvedconflicts illustrate that the United Nations still has seriousshortcomings. These stem primarily from the nature of theproblems and challenges of the increasingly interdependentglobal society in which we live.It is now our responsibility to launch a process ofreform of the United Nations. It must cover all of theOrganization’s agencies  programmes and funds  in both thepolitical and the development fields. It must be undertakenin an integrated manner  with a view to better adapting ourinstruments of cooperation to the needs of a profoundlychanging world.Many crises seem political in nature but have theirroots in social injustices and a lack of economicopportunities. The fulfilment of social needs and thepromotion of economic development are necessary elementsof sustained political stability. Some significantimprovements have been made in this field  too  but theirscope and importance are clearly dwarfed by the immensityof the challenges. Human development  human rights andthe environment are cases in point.Thanks to the dynamic initiatives of ourSecretary-General  a process of reform of the United Nationsis under way. In addition  several Member States haveintroduced important proposals for reforming andrestructuring our Organization. My own country  togetherwith other Nordic countries  has actively participated in thisprocess  particularly as regards peace-keeping and reform ofthe United Nations work in the economic and social sectorand in the area of humanitarian assistance.World events have forced the United Nations and itsMember States to re-examine closely the Organization’scapacity to maintain international peace and security. TheCharter provisions as well as the structures and machinerycreated for this purpose reflect a world that was verydifferent from the one we live in today. That is  of course the reason for the great attention that has been accorded overthe past year or two to what traditionally has been calledpeace-keeping. The concept of peace-keeping is  as a resultof increasingly complex operations  going through a periodof evolution. Related activities such as preventivediplomacy  peacemaking and peace-building are the newtools for maintaining international peace and security.Forty-eighth session - 30 September l993 27The United Nations and its Member States must adjustto the rapid growth in and new approaches to peace- keepingoperations. The President of the Security Council in hisstatement of May this year outlined the operational principlesin accordance with which such operations should beconducted. My Government fully subscribes to theseprinciples.The great increase in requests for peace-keeping troops military observers and monitors makes it necessary  in myGovernment’s view  for the United Nations to adopt stricterand clearer criteria and procedures before launching suchoperations. The United Nations must not overextend itself;it cannot be present everywhere.Mandates for peace-keeping operations must be preciseand clear. The necessary funding must be secured  andbefore launching any operations the Security Council mustsee to it that the required contingents are available. Recentexperiences also prove that command structures must beclearly spelled out and subsequently fully adhered too. It isnot sufficient for the Security Council to agree onresolutions setting up new operations; all the conditions fortheir implementation must also be at hand.We also face new challenges in disarmament and armscontrol. The nuclear arms race has stopped  but nuclearproliferation still constitutes a serious potential threat tointernational security and stability. It is vital to ensure thatthe Non-Proliferation Treaty regime works efficiently. Ingeneral  disarmament and arms regulation should beintegrated into the broader agenda of international peace andsecurity. This should be reflected both in the United Nationsdisarmament machinery and in the Geneva Conference onDisarmament. The review of the composition of theConference on Disarmament would enhance this objective.We regret that no agreement on this issue has been reachedso far.The Security Council is vested with the primaryresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. In carrying out its duties  the Council acts onbehalf of the entire membership of the United Nations.Trust and confidence in the Council by all Member States istherefore a crucial factor  affecting its ability to engage inconflict resolution. It is only natural that a review beundertaken of the composition of the Security Council inorder to make the Council better reflect today’s membershipas well as the prevailing political realities.My Government has an open mind on this question.We are ready to accept a limited increase in the membershipof the Council  provided that such a change will not affectnegatively the capacity of the Council to perform its tasks.Moreover  there would seem to be a need to review theCouncil’s organization and methods of work. The aimshould be to increase transparency and to providenon-members better opportunities to be heard when mattersof immediate concern to them are considered by the Council.It would seem desirable - especially in negotiating themandates and the financing of peace-keeping operations - toinvolve to a greater extent non-members of the Council also as provided for by the Charter. Such involvement would beparticularly called for in the case of those States that arepotential contributors of troops and logistical support.Work on revitalizing the General Assembly andrationalizing its activities is also under way. Certainimprovements have already been introduced. However further efforts have to be made to ensure a more meaningfuland responsible role for the Assembly. To enhance theAssembly’s standing and add weight to its resolutions it is in our view  necessary to establish clear priorities. It isimportant to focus the work in the Assembly on thesepriorities and to reduce the number of items on its agenda.Indeed  time has come to consider even some radicalmethods to enhance the effectiveness of the Assembly. Onemight ask whether a full-fledged General Assembly sessionevery year is really necessary and productive. Alternatively a high-level political debate and meetings of the MainCommittees might be held every other year. Moreover  thePresident and the Bureau of a session of the GeneralAssembly could perhaps be designated well before the endof the preceding session. That would permit the officers ofthe General Assembly and the Secretariat better to preparethe work of the General Assembly. These and other ideasmerit further consideration.The economic and social sectors of the United Nations including the Economic and Social Council itself  are otherareas where reforms are being actively discussed. TheNordic countries initiated a reform of the operationalactivities for development. Although there is virtualagreement on a number of reform issues  there are stilldetails to be settled concerning the governance and financingof the development agencies of the United Nations. I hopethat these much needed reforms can be agreed upon by theend of November so that the new structures can be put inplace as early as 1994.During the discussions on the ongoing reforms it hasbecome obvious that the extraordinary extent and rapidity of28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioneconomic and social change  as well as the challenges of theglobal environment  necessitate reforms that are even muchmore profound. We must now devote our efforts to areorientation of the United Nations system in this new anddaunting environment. We should  in particular  clarify ourthinking about the institutional and structural linkagesbetween work on peace and security and work on sustainabledevelopment. Likewise  we should establish the truepriorities in the economic and social sectors as well as in theUnited Nations system’s relations with other internationalorganizations. Such rethinking and reform cannot be carriedout during one single session of the General Assembly. Itwill take a sustained effort over several years  which  in turn presupposes a consensus on the basic outlines of a reformprogramme.The shaping of a consensus is our primary task. Theagenda for development which the Secretary-General willpresent will no doubt have a catalytic effect in this respect as could the upcoming important conferences on population social development and gender issues. The fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations will  in my view  providea suitable occasion for launching such an ambitious fundamental and visionary reform programme.In order for the United Nations to function effectivelyit must have a solid executive branch  a Secretariat that hasat its disposal sufficient human and financial resources. TheSecretary-General has taken several steps to streamline theSecretariat and make it a more efficient tool forimplementing the decisions of the Member States. But moreneeds to be done in order to permit the Secretariat to takeinitiatives and pursue its intellectual leadership role.At a time when resources are scarce and so many newtasks have been entrusted to the United Nations  it is clearthat a pruning of activities and rationalization of workingmethods must be done. The cutting of unnecessary andobsolete programmes must continue. It is the task of theMember States to give guidance to the Secretary-General but also to draw conclusions and take the necessarydecisions. The United Nations should apply the same policyof austerity as national Governments in the prevailingeconomic circumstances.Perhaps the greatest concern for the United Nationstoday is the unwillingness of the great majority of MemberStates to pay their assessed contributions. My delegation hassaid time and again  and I will repeat it now: Payment ofone’s dues is not an option. It is an obligation falling onevery Member  big or small. Let it be our collectivebirthday present to the United Nations at the fiftiethanniversary to see to it that by then there is full compliancewith the obligation concerning payment of contributions.Member States  in fulfilling their financial obligationstowards the United Nations  have the right to expect fullaccountability for the resources placed at the disposal of theOrganization. It is essential that the Organization exerciseprudent economic management and constantly improve theinternal control system. We therefore believe that ideas suchas the creation of the post of an independent inspectorgeneral are well worth considering. The main objectivemust now be to restore the confidence of the Member Statesand the general public in our Organization. The UnitedNations cannot afford to have its public image and integritytarnished by allegations of mismanagement.As the United Nations approaches its fiftiethanniversary  humanity is faced with formidable challenges.Meeting them will not be easy. And yet  the United Nationsnow has a better chance than ever to use its full potentialand show leadership for the sake of a better future. ""We thepeoples of the United Nations  ... united for a better world""has been chosen as the theme for the celebration of ourfiftieth anniversary. Let us all together join in making thisa reality."
"56",2373,"FJI",48,1993,"On behalf of the people andGovernment of the Republic of Fiji  I congratulateAmbassador Insanally very warmly on his election asPresident of the Assembly. I am confident that his extensiveknowledge of the United Nations system and his wideexperience in the field of international relations will helpguide this session to a successful conclusion.I wish to pay a tribute to Mr. Stoyan Ganev for theexcellent manner in which  as President  he conducted thebusiness of this Assembly at its last session. I express myadmiration and deep appreciation to him for a job well done.I also congratulate him for his initiative in rationalizing thework of the Assembly  and especially in rationalizing itsCommittee structure.My delegation applauds the excellent work done by ourSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  in the periodsince he assumed his high office. I take this opportunity toexpress my Government’s deep appreciation for his untiringefforts in tackling the difficult and complex problems facingthe world Organization.I should also like to extend a warm welcome to thenew States Members of the United Nations  the Principalityof Andorra  the Czech Republic  Eritrea  the Principality ofMonaco  the Slovak Republic and The Former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia. I am confident that theOrganization  as it continues to strive for universality  willgreatly benefit from their participation in its work.New threats are endangering international peace andsecurity in all corners of the world. Incipient nationalism ethnic conflicts and excessive protectionism are threateningpeace  security  and growth in trade. Thus  a heavyresponsibility is placed on this Organization  which  as weall know  is the main body responsible for promoting socialprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom.Behind these complexities  there are also manydevastating structural problems that undermine even the bestefforts to achieve security and economic progress.Population growth  if left unchecked  will add 97 millionpeople a year throughout the 1990s. Poverty  disease famine and oppression account for the 18 million refugeesand 24 million displaced persons throughout the world. Thegap between the rich and the poor countries has notnarrowed  but continues to grow as economic difficulties inthe industrialized countries have led to increasedprotectionist measures against trade. Environmentaldegradation further compounds these problems.In the light of these trends  we must underscore theneed for better international cooperation in order to arrive ateffective solutions. This  we believe  is a critical element inmoving us towards the creation of an international order inwhich this Organization assumes greater importance as thecentre of global endeavours.The process of reviewing the role of the Organizationthat is currently under way is therefore very timely. Wehope that the review will assist greatly in determining howthe United Nations can be strengthened and  most important how each of us as Member countries might best contributeto the new order.The Secretary-General  in his report on the work of theOrganization  has quite rightly stressed the need for adequateresources. We share his anxiety  and join in his call toMembers to ensure that their contributions to the regularbudget  as well as to the peace-keeping budget  are met ontime and in full. We must make every effort to explore allpossible avenues for ensuring that the Organization is putback onto a viable financial path.My Government would like to pay a tribute to theentire United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia(UNTAC) team for the way in which they carried out theirmission in particularly difficult and dangerous conditions.Fiji is pleased to have joined other Members of the UnitedNations in restoring peace in Cambodia through itsparticipation in UNTAC.That mission has now successfully completed its majortask. For the people of Cambodia  who unambiguouslydemonstrated their desire for peace and democracy  it is thebeginning of a new era. We urge all factions to cooperatefully with the new Government by keeping alive the spirit ofthe Agreements signed in Paris.The age-old problem in the Middle East has taken anew turn during the past month. This turn of events spellshope for the future in the Middle East - indeed  in the entireworld and for all humanity. The desire of both Prime10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionMinister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and Chairman YasserArafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) toachieve peace for their peoples has necessitated thedismantling of differences that have existed for decades.The Washington accords should pave the way for a lastingpeace.Humanity has been touched by this historic event - thecoming together of two arch-rivals for the sake of peace.We congratulate Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat- indeed  all who have laboured to bring this peace pact toreality. We must also acknowledge the contribution of theUnited States of America and  indeed  the United Nationsand others over the years.While positive developments are taking place in theMiddle East and Cambodia  Fiji is deeply saddened at thefact that the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina remainsunresolved. Our profound sympathy goes to all who havesuffered untold misery. Such a tragedy should not beallowed to continue. We recognize that the issue is a highlycomplex one  but the international community must do all itcan to stop the slaughter  prevent the conflict fromspreading  and achieve a lasting and equitable settlement.We are equally saddened at the events in Somalia. Thesuccess of the United Nations Operation in Somalia(UNOSOM) in meeting the humanitarian challenge has casta ray of hope  for which the United Nations deserves praiseand  indeed  support. However  recent violence againstUNOSOM II personnel must be condemned  and efforts tofind ways of reducing tension between the peace-keepers andthe local population must be given high priority.Having for years witnessed the repugnant policy ofapartheid in South Africa  we are pleased at the rapidity withwhich that policy has recently been broken down. Wecongratulate the leadership in South Africa - the SouthAfrican Government  the African National Congress (ANC)and others - for their courage  determination and foresight ingetting together and dismantling apartheid. The UnitedNations has played a major role in the process  but weshould continue the effort until a democratic Government iselected by all - I repeat: all - the peoples of South Africa.Fiji  like the other members of the South Pacific Forum shares the sentiments that the Secretary-General expresses in""An Agenda for Peace""  in which he highlights the positiverole that regional organizations can play in the maintenanceof international peace and security in their own regions. Fijiwill support such regional initiatives.On the economic front  we believe that a successfulconclusion to the Uruguay Round is vital to economicgrowth and prosperity in all our countries. Only increasedaccess to markets for our exports  especially in areas ofcomparative advantage  will enable us to increase ourexternal purchasing power - our ability to pay for importsfrom the developed countries. In any event  we lookforward to a genuinely equitable outcome that will includea substantial and liberalizing effect on trade in agriculturalproducts.Slow progress in finalizing the Round has led to theformation and strengthening of regional trading blocs. Manynew initiatives now being put in place are defensiveresponses to existing regional trading arrangements. Thesehave the potential to weaken the multilateral character of thetrading system  as many of them do not comply with thespirit and the provisions of the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT).Developing countries  it has been estimated  lose about$100 billion a year in export revenues as a result of marketbarriers in industrialized countries - about twice the officialdevelopment assistance that the industrialized countriesprovide. Furthermore  it is most ironic that taxpayers in theindustrialized countries pay both for aid and for imports thatare more costly as a result of trade barriers  while thepoorest developing countries lose more in trade than theygain in aid. For these reasons alone  further progress intrade liberalization  through success in the Uruguay Round is very urgent  and we join other delegations in stressing thatno effort should be spared in bringing the Round to asuccessful conclusion.Of the 42 resolutions on disarmament issues adopted bythe Assembly at its last session  15 deal with various waysof controlling nuclear arms  the management of nuclearwaste  the banning of nuclear tests and the elimination ofnuclear weapons. In this regard  we welcome the decisionsby nuclear Powers to extend their testing moratorium  andwe regret very much that this moratorium has just beenbreached. We call on all nuclear Powers to continue tohonour the moratorium. In August this year  the SouthPacific Forum welcomed the commitment by theGovernments of France  the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates to the early negotiation of a comprehensive test-bantreaty. We take this opportunity to urge all the nuclear-weapon States to participate actively in the negotiations andto adopt the Treaty as soon as possible.The signing of the chemical-weapons Convention inParis early this year was a major step forward in the processof eliminating weapons of mass destruction. As aForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 11demonstration of its commitment to that end  Fiji has notonly signed the Convention but also ratified it - the firstcountry to do so.In the South Pacific Forum  member Governments including the Government of Fiji  highlighted the importanceof an enhanced international regime to deal with possibletransboundary damage arising from peaceful nuclear activity and noted the absence of effective international rules fornuclear liability. Members of the Forum have agreed toparticipate in the ongoing deliberations of the StandingCommittee on Nuclear Liability convened by theInternational Atomic Energy Agency and to support theestablishment of a comprehensive international legal regimedealing with liability for nuclear damage and reflecting fullythe principle that the polluter should pay.Fiji welcomes the continuing growth in the number ofparties to the non-proliferation Treaty and will supportindefinite extension of the Treaty.In support of international peace and security  we haveconsistently contributed to many peace-keeping operationsover the years. Since our first participation in peace-keepingoperations in 1978  Fiji has been involved in seven. We paytribute to the men and women currently engaged in UnitedNations peace-keeping operations around the world.Peace-keepers are being increasingly asked to serve inhigh-risk environments. That these are high-risk operationsis tragically borne out by the fact that hundreds ofpeace-keepers have made the supreme sacrifice in theirservice to humanity.The time is right for the issue of the safety and securityof peace-keeping personnel to be addressed in a moresystematic  comprehensive and practical manner  and wesupport the notion wholeheartedly. The related question ofresponsibility for attacks on United Nations and associatedpersonnel  and measures to ensure that those responsible forsuch attacks are brought to justice  is also now an importantone to address. We shall fully support any effort in thatdirection.Apart from the large increase in the number ofpeace-keeping operations  many important changes are takingplace in the nature of peace-keeping. The eightpeace-keeping operations undertaken since the end of thecold war have involved not only traditional military activitiesbut also a wide range of humanitarian and civilian activities.The constantly changing nature of the various crises meansthat we must increasingly be more innovative in designingpeace-keeping operations  as they are normally very costly.As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General  the17 peace-keeping operations are now costing theOrganization some $2.8 billion annually. To some extent the answer to the increasing costs lies in more preventivediplomacy aimed at defusing potential conflicts. Moreover the involvement of Member States  either on an individualbasis or through regional organizations  in peace-buildingand peace-keeping activities appears to be another effectiveway of preventing military clashes. In this regard  theSecretary-General has placed before us several suggestionswhich  we believe  deserve our serious consideration andaction.I now wish to turn briefly to a subject that has been thefocus of a great deal of attention  especially during the lastthree years; that is  the subject of sustainable development.Several resolutions adopted by the Assembly on followingup the important decisions taken at Rio about 15 months agoare now being implemented at various levels. It is mostencouraging that we now have 162 countries that havesigned the Framework Convention on Climate Change  and26 countries that have ratified it.Fiji ratified the Convention in February this year  andhopes that the required number of ratifications  50  will soonbe achieved  so that the Convention can enter into force. Asglobal warming and a rise in sea level are amongst the mostserious threats to the Pacific region and to the survival ofsome small island States  Fiji reaffirms its support for theConvention and takes this opportunity to urge all States tosign and ratify it as soon as possible.Fiji has been active in the area of environmentalmanagement and protection. The Rio Conference has however  changed the way in which many of us now viewenvironment and development issues. More than everbefore  we are committed to the idea that the developmentof our economy and society must not come at the expenseof our environment. To the contrary: development andenvironmental protection are complementary.My Government is committed to sound environmentalmanagement and protection as an integral part of ourdecision-making process. A national environment strategyhas now been adopted by the Government  and will form thebasis for further work on environmental issues in Fiji.The United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment has recognized in the Agenda 21 plan of actionfor sustainable development  that small island developingcountries are a special case for sustainable development.Small island countries supporting small communities areecologically fragile and vulnerable; because of our small12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionsize  our resources are limited  and because of ourgeographic dispersion and isolation from markets  we areplaced at a disadvantage economically and have limitedeconomies of scale.Our dependence on the ocean and our coastalenvironments is also very significant. They are not only ofstrategic importance to us; they also constitute a valuabledevelopment resource.It was in this context that  last year  we welcomed theadoption of General Assembly resolution 47/189 calling fora Global Conference on the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States  to be convened inApril 1994. We appreciate the very important work that hasbeen put into the organizational session and the preparatorymeetings  convened early this year. We hope that theConference will be successful and will help us not only toidentify the most critical issues involved but also to agree onprecise and practical solutions for overcoming ourvulnerabilities. We urge all member countries to participatein this Conference and to assist in finding solutions toproblems that have buffeted small island countries for a verylong time.The small island States contain a wealth of biologicaldiversity of global significance - our rich marine ecosystemsrivalling the better-known tropical rain forests in theirimportance to life on this planet and in their potential fornew knowledge and new products  including medicines. Aninternational cooperative approach to conserving our coastaland marine resources would benefit not just the island Statesbut the world as a whole.The international community met in July this year andexamined ways and means of conserving and managingstraddling and highly migratory fish stocks. We believe thatgood progress was made at this meeting in identifying theproblems that exist and areas in which fisheries cooperationbetween States could be improved.There are still  however  several important tasksremaining that need to be completed before the next sessionof the Assembly. Fiji  therefore  fully supports theconvening of two further sessions next year to enable theConference to reach agreement on all issues relating to theconservation and management of straddling and highlymigratory fish stocks.Fiji was the first country to ratify the 1982 UnitedNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We aretherefore gratified that the Convention is soon to achieve the60 ratifications required for its entry into force. Wecontinue to support all efforts towards universal participationin this very important Convention  which is to govern over70 per cent of the Earth’s surface. In this regard  we arepleased that all States - including now the United States -are engaged in the ongoing dialogue to resolve theoutstanding problems and thereby pave the way towardsuniversality for the Convention.Over the next few years  the Organization will befocusing its attention and energies on the convening ofseveral very important international conferences. Whilethese conferences will be important in themselves  as theywill bring together the world community  they will not onlydiscuss issues that are assigned to them but will also provideopportunities to arrive by consensus at solutions to many ofthe critical problems facing the world today.The World Summit on Social Development planned for1995 will help to strengthen social development in allcountries by giving political impetus  at the highest level  tothe promotion of social policies. The three core issues thathave been established for the Summit - the alleviation ofpoverty  the growth of employment  and the enhancement ofsocial integration  especially of disadvantaged groups - areall essential. Above all  the Summit should  in our view foster greater understanding of the importance of socialdevelopment and  particularly  its relationship with economicdevelopment and protection of the environment.The Fourth World Conference on Women  to beconvened in Beijing in 1995  will  we hope  be action--oriented and provide an opportunity to review past activitiesand  most important  set new priorities. For its part  myGovernment is fully committed to strengthening the role ofwomen in economic and social development and has takenseveral steps to integrate women into the mainstream ofnational development. Towards this end  plans have beenformulated and are being implemented by the Ministry ofWomen and Culture  other sectoral ministries and non-governmental organizations. Women constitute more than50 per cent of Fiji’s population  which makes them valuablepartners in the growth and development of our country andthe uplifting of our people.We are  at the same time  also turning our attention tothe situation and needs of children in Fiji as we continue toparticipate actively in Universal Children’s Day. Fiji hasratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child and hassigned the World Declaration on the Survival  Protection andDevelopment of Children in the 1990s. We have alsoundertaken a detailed study of the situation of children inFiji and have identified areas which require our attention.Forty-eighth session - 11 October l993 13We are now in the process of following up therecommendations of this study.Fiji  as a multiracial and multicultural community attaches great significance to family values and familytraditions. We therefore welcome and appreciate thedecision by the United Nations to observe 1994 as theInternational Year of the Family. My Government hasalready formed a national committee  comprisingrepresentatives from both government and non-governmentalsectors  to make preparations for observance of theInternational Year of the Family in a meaningful andpractical way.The International Year of the World’s IndigenousPeople will soon be coming to a close. With the observanceof the International Year the attention of the United Nationshas for the first time been focused directly and solely onindigenous peoples. Next year  the Commission on HumanRights will assess the activities of the Year. It is importantthat the voices of indigenous peoples should continue to beheard  and their right to self-determination  their right torebuild their communities in dignity with freedom of choice must continue to receive the full support of the UnitedNations.The draft text of a declaration on indigenous peoples’rights  first proposed in 1985  received the approval of theWorking Group last July. Fiji welcomes the WorkingGroup’s decision as an important step towards amuch-needed international instrument on indigenous peoples’rights.The International Year of the World’s IndigenousPeople  should not  we believe  be treated as an isolatedevent  but as the beginning of a long-term policy ofsupporting  protecting and learning from the world’sindigenous peoples. For our part  we have set aside aspecial day in our nation’s calendar to commemorate thisevent  coinciding with the birthday of Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna one of the great leaders of the indigenous people of Fiji.The indigenous people now comprise the majority ofFiji’s population but my Government recognizes the needand will do its utmost to ensure unity  order  equity andsecurity for all the people of Fiji  so that we can all live inpeace and harmony. We will continue to ensure thatharmonious relationships are established and maintained bothamong our own people at home and with other peopleabroad.With reference to my own region  the South Pacific  weare following very closely the current progress in NewCaledonia towards the self-determination of that territory.We hope that the developments  as envisaged under theMatignon and Oudinot accords  will continue so that theindigenous Kanak population will be fully prepared to takepart in the referendum in 1998 and to decide on the futurepolitical status of their country.Speaking at the session of the General Assembly lastyear  on 8 October  Fiji’s Prime Minister  Major GeneralSitiveni Rabuka  promised to initiate a review of the 1990Constitution of Fiji  which has been the subject ofcontroversy both locally and abroad. I am pleased to saythat my Government has already set in train the process forthe review of the Constitution  as promised. The review isto consider how the provisions of the Constitution can beimproved upon to reflect fully the concerns and interests ofFiji’s multi-ethnic and multicultural society.This Organization  now almost 50 years old  has stoodthe test of time but  like other institutions  it must also adjustto change. We must continue to examine ways of makingit a forum for both discussion and action on the importantsocial  economic and political issues facing the worldcommunity as they evolve.In conclusion  I should like to reaffirm my country’scommitment to the United Nations and to the spirit ofinternational cooperation and solidarity that it embodies. Mycountry  and its people  joins with other nations to do itsutmost to seek world peace  stability and sustainabledevelopment for all. We firmly believe that the UnitedNations remains the only hope for mankind to achieve peaceand prosperity. It is through the combined efforts of allMember States  large and small  that we can develop aglobal environment which is just and equitable and whichreflects the legitimate needs and interests of all peoples."
"57",2420,"FRA",48,1993,"Ishould like first to say  Mr. President  that France is pleasedto see the General Assembly meeting under your guidancethis year. Your election is just testimony to the esteem inwhich the international community holds your country. Italso affords us the opportunity to welcome the ""silentrevolution"" that has been taking place in Latin America overthe past few years  which has put many States back on thepath of national reconciliation  democracy and economicdevelopment.22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe year which is ending will have been as rich inpromise as it has been fraught with danger. Conflicts oncethought to be insoluble suddenly seem to be on tracktowards resolution. On behalf of my country  I should liketo pay tribute to the men in the Middle East  in South Africaand in Cambodia who found the courage to take the pathtowards reconciliation and peace: Yitzhak Rabin and YasserArafat  F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela  His MajestyKing Norodom Sihanouk and all those  known and unknown who accompanied or even preceded them on this courageouspath.The agreement between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) opens the way to thesettlement of a conflict which some had despaired of seeingresolved  and makes it possible to conceive of a radicallynew future for the entire region. This revolution gives usnew reason to believe in human will and encourages usnever to consider the hope for peace as a chimera. From us it calls for collective effort  including financial effort  inorder to translate this hope into reality as soon as possible.It also invites us to erase the aftermath of conflicts asreflected in past resolutions of this Assembly.But the end of what was for years called the balance ofterror has also led to new kinds of uncertainty and disorder.Russia is going through a political and economictransition that could lead to serious internal difficulties  asthe events of the past few days have shown. In that context I should like to reaffirm France’s support for the process ofdemocratization and reform courageously undertaken byPresident Yeltsin.In the former Yugoslavia war has been raging for twoyears  with its attendant death  suffering and destruction.Other regions in Africa  Central Asia  the Balkans and theCaucasus are falling or could fall victim to this new type ofconflict  resulting from the break-up of States and theresurgence of nationalist  ethnic or religious passions.Elsewhere  States put under a sanctions regime by ourOrganization for failing to comply with the obligations ofinternational law or with commitments they have madepersist in refusing to take the measures that would permitthem to regain their place in the international community.Almost everywhere  the proliferation of weapons is afearsome factor for instability.In the face of the promises and dangers I have justoutlined  France bases its foreign policy on a few guidingprinciples. Whether they are found reassuring or disturbing I should like to recall them to the Assembly.The first principle is the desire for independence.France has amply demonstrated that it is ready to act inconcert with others where the ends are genuinely collective.But  needless to say  it does so in complete sovereignty.Exercising freedom of judgement and choice  France refusesto follow the orthodoxy of the moment or to succumb topressures resulting from relative material strengths.The second principle  shared by many in this Hall  is acommitment to our fundamental interests. Like every otherState in this Organization  France has its own strategic commercial and cultural interests which it seeks to preserve.While we are open to negotiation and to the mutualconcessions it implies  we cannot be made to give upanything we consider to be an essential element of oursecurity  our prosperity or our culture.The third principle is devotion to law and justice.Beyond its own interests  France aspires to help ensure thatcertain fundamental principles first inspired by France among others  triumph throughout the world: the right ofpeoples to self-determination and security  human rights andthe right to development.Finally  one last aspect of our diplomacy  in the serviceof the others  is France’s perseverance  and at timesstubbornness. May I recall our resolve - despite obstacles -in opening up the path that would eventually lead to therestoration of peace in Cambodia  and our determination tosee institutional legality restored in Haiti.These unchanging principles dictate the two main linesof the policy which my country hopes to implement on theinternational stage.Our ambition concerns Europe first of all.Whatever the present difficulties  whatever theprevailing scepticism  France will not falter in its resolve tobuild with its neighbours a strong  prosperous  democraticand generous Europe  capable of making its voice heard andof contributing to world peace. This is an irrevocable choicefor us because the peoples of Europe need a plan that bringsthem together  and European unity is the only goal thatmeasures up to the values they share. Moreover  thebuilding of a united Europe is the only way to avert thedangers threatening our continent at this time: dangersarising from the resurgence of the most implacable forms ofnationalism and from the persistence of unacceptableeconomic disparities. Europe’s success will serve as anexample for other regions of the world as did in its day theForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 23reconciliation between France and Germany sought byGeneral de Gaulle and Chancellor Adenauer.I have already spoken of the conflict raging in theformer Yugoslavia.France has spared no effort to put an end to it. As youknow  France initiated most of the Security Councilresolutions designed to discourage or punish aggressors.Together with its partners  France provides an essential partof the humanitarian aid sent there. Its soldiers represent thelargest of the contingents made available to the UnitedNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  and more than adozen of them have paid for their generous presence therewith their lives. It has so far been the only country to sendreinforcements in accordance with resolution 836 (1993) inorder to contribute to the security of the protected areas andthe Muslim populations there. France was  as well  the firstnation to deplore the inadequacy of the actions taken by theinternational community in regard to the former Yugoslavia.The efforts it has made entitled it to tell those who havebeen free with their advice and lessons that they might bebetter heard if they were agreeing  when they are able to doso  to commit their own troops to the field. Once in contactwith the realities of the situation  they would undoubtedlybetter appreciate the fact that between negotiated peace andchaos there is no middle ground.Let us learn the lessons of this painful experience. Itis essential for us to acquire the means to avoid therepetition of such a conflict  and to ensure  without waitingfor future progress in the construction of a united Europe that preventive diplomacy  military openness and respect forthe rule of law prevail wherever latent tensions remain. Thisis the intent of the proposed pact on European stabilitywhich France has submitted to its European partners and towhich it would like to associate Russia  as well as its alliesacross the Atlantic  Canada and the United States.Europe is  of course  far from being the sole horizon ofFrance’s action. My country has long-standing  closerelations with many parts of the world. For the long-termorganization of the international scene in the aftermath of thecold war  France naturally turns to the United Nations.Because it believes in the mission of the UnitedNations  France wants a strong and effective Organization.This goal involves  first of all  the reforming of theSecurity Council. Its enlargement  which has becomenecessary today in the light of the world’s evolution  mustbe envisioned as the way to increase its effectiveness.France understands and supports the aspirations of someof its partners to exercise their international responsibilitiesmore actively  provided that they are ready to committhemselves in the field. However  the expansion of theCouncil should not be achieved at the expense of one oranother group of States; in particular  it must preserve thecapacity of the developing countries to make their voicesheard. In our view  this is an essential requirement.In their wisdom  those who drafted the Charterrecognized that only a group of limited size could takeprompt measures to restore peace when confronted with anurgent crisis. We should therefore take care that theprojected enlargement does not lead to a paralysis of theCouncil.France hopes that at its present session the GeneralAssembly will decide to open discussions on ways to reformthe Security Council. A solution will have to be found thatreconciles the will to reform with the desire foreffectiveness. This is why enlargement  in our view  willhave to be decided according to a formula combining newpermanent members and additional non-permanent members.The Secretary-General is a key institution of the UnitedNations. France would like him to be given the means tocarry through the innovative action he has undertaken.Allow me to pay a tribute to the energy  authority andcourage with which our Secretary-General is carrying out hismissions.France approves not only of his political initiatives butalso of his tireless efforts to rationalize the functioning ofour Organization. We must combat the proliferation ofinstitutions  which consumes our resources and threatens thecoherence of our efforts. We must improve the coordinationof activities linked to development and restore to theEconomic and Social Council its role as a provider ofstimulus and organization. We must combat administrativewaste wherever it exists  without hesitating to punish anyabuses that may be uncovered. Lastly  we must have moresupervision and greater transparency in peace-keepingoperations.The Secretary-General still does not have all the meansto exercise his responsibility to the full. France calls on theMember States to provide him with those means withoutdelay. Strengthening the Department of Peace-keepingOperations  establishing a mechanism for a true generalinspection  and setting up a court for budgetary disciplineare  in our eyes  indispensable measures.24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe third requirement for strengthening theOrganization is a clean-up of its finances.Perhaps I should have begun with this point.According to an old French saying  money is ""the sinew ofwar"". It is also the sinew of peace. Our projects for thisOrganization will be no more than empty words unless wehave the courage to adopt the new measures that its financialbankruptcy requires.First  Member States which do not pay theircontributions within 30 days following theSecretary-General’s call for contributions should bepenalized. France proposes that market-rate interest shouldbe imposed on all late payments. This firm stance seemsparticularly necessary because the payment of accumulatedarrears alone would suffice to resolve the financial crisis. Itis also consistent with considerations of fairness and politicalmorality. One cannot simultaneously speak of UnitedNations reform  justice and international development andexempt oneself from the primary financial obligationresulting from adherence to our Charter. It is high time tomeasure the generosity of words against the yardstick ofarrears due our Organization.The establishment of a mechanism for a true generalinspection will  as I have said  make it possible to rationalizethe functioning and costs of the United Nations. France willsupport all initiatives to supplement the existing proceduresof internal assessment  which have already shown theirlimitations despite the judicious reorganization recentlyintroduced by the Secretary-General.Lastly  we must adopt an exemplary budget for the1994-1995 period. We must not hesitate to reduceexpenditures for obsolete activities. We will also have toprovide sufficient funding for the new mandates entrusted tothe Organization. If  from that  it is necessary to consider areasonable increase in the ordinary budget  France  whichhas never espoused a dogmatic idea of zero growth  willreadily accept this.These are concrete measures. They require a collectiveeffort on the part of Member States. But France isconvinced that we can no longer be satisfied  as in previousyears  with marginal adjustments. The very ability of theUnited Nations to carry out its mandate is at stake.France  as you will have realized  is ambitious for theUnited Nations. With the support of renovated institutionsand reorganized financing  the United Nations will be ableto meet the great responsibilities incumbent on it: to preservepeace and collective security  to promote development andto address global problems whose international scaleremoves them from the individual action of States.Peace is of course the first of our responsibilities.The present instability in several parts of the worldcompels the United Nations to intervene more and morefrequently in order to check the spread of conflicts and allowa negotiated solution to be sought. France  for its part  haswished to participate fully in this effort and is today in thefront rank of States participating in peace-keepingoperations.This commitment obviously does not confer anyprivilege on us. But our experience enables us to cast a lucideye over the operations in which we have participated andencourages us to reaffirm certain principles and to proposecertain common-sense measures that might help increase thefuture effectiveness of our action.First  greater political control is needed over operationsthat have become increasingly complex. Purely militaryconsiderations should never thwart - or even obscure -political ends. Naturally  regional or defence organizationsmay make useful contributions in terms of expertise personnel or matériel. But the use of force presupposes thatthe guardian of the law - that is  the Security Council -exercises its authority in the name of the internationalcommunity. This it cannot relinquish. That is why Franceinsisted that the Secretary-General’s Special Representativeto the former Yugoslavia should have authority over alloperations under international mandate. It is important  itseems to me  that we should maintain this requirement at alltimes. By the same token  France insists that the politicalends of the operation in Somalia should not be lost sight of.Next  we should systematically consider the question ofthe timetable of operations.As a matter of principle  time-frames should beexplicitly assigned to each operation in the actual resolutionthat institutes it. It is also important to know when toterminate operations that go on and on  needlessly dippinginto the means of the Organization and its Member States.France fully supports the Secretary-General’s efforts on thisscore.Lastly  we must expand the capacity of theOrganization to react. The time that elapses between ourdecision to create a force and the implementation of thatdecision is far too long. How many weeks did we have toForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 25wait before the air power authorized by resolution836 (1993) on Bosnia was eventually deployed? And howmany weeks for the ground reinforcements that had beenannounced to reach Sarajevo?We cannot but note that the current procedures do notmeet the criteria for rapid reaction and flexible use whichare called for in this area.France does not  however  believe that the Organizationshould have its own force. On the other hand  it hasparticipated in discussions organized by theSecretariat-General on the concept of stand-by units. Thesediscussions have resulted in original proposals for ""tailormade"" forces for the United Nations. In this way  theOrganization could have at its disposal support  transport andcommunications capabilities which it currently lacks forcarrying out military actions speedily.France  which has already offered  in a statement madeby the President of the French Republic  to make availableto the Secretary-General a 1 000-strong contingent for peacekeeping operations at 48 hours’ notice  will take part in thiseffort.These measures will have another advantage. They willadd an extra degree of effectiveness to preventive diplomacy which has to be central to the ambitions we have for theOrganization. This policy requires us to develop and put inplace mechanisms for crisis alert  evaluation and prevention.Several ideas were put forward in the ""Agenda forPeace"" - they included use of fact-finding missions and theeffective deployment of United Nations forces - and havealready been applied to certain difficult situations in Africa Central Asia and the Balkans.In this spirit  the United Kingdom and France are readyto submit to the Secretary-General proposals for compilinga list of prominent individuals who could intervene promptlyat his request  in liaison with appropriate regionalorganizations  and provide them with equipment -specifically in the communications field - necessary forcarrying out their mission completely.It is through concrete initiatives of this sort  which mayseem modest at first  that preventive diplomacy willgradually assume its rightful place in the maintenance ofpeace.The effort made in relation to disarmament in the pastfew years  finally  should continue.Considerable progress has already been made with thereduction of stockpiles from the cold-war era. But a newpriority is becoming evident: the struggle against theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. To attain thisgoal  we must be extremely vigilant in the threefold domainof nuclear weapons  chemical weapons and ballistictechnologies.In this light  France welcomes the signing in Paris bynearly 150 States of the Convention banning chemicalweapons  the first real multilateral disarmament pact ofgeneral scope  and calls on the States which have not yetratified this Convention to do so. It supports the effortsbeing made by several groups of countries to institutesystems of control of missile technology  nuclear exports andthe sale of so-called sensitive products.France asks  finally  that the non-proliferation regimesbe strengthened. It reaffirms in particular its desire to seethe Non-Proliferation Treaty prolonged indefinitely andunconditionally. It continues to believe that it is only theSecurity Council that can decide on sanctions againstirresponsible behaviour. This would be the case if NorthKorea were to fail to respect its commitments to theInternational Atomic Energy Agency.What guarantees can be given for collective securityand peace if nothing is done to try to resolve the economicand social disparities that are so often the source of conflict?We know that there can be no lasting peace without lastingeconomic development. That is why the ""Agenda for Peace""unquestionably requires also an ""agenda for development"".France  as is known  has consistently spoken for theinterests of the developing countries  particularly the leastdeveloped  in discussion with its industrialized partners. Ithas tirelessly pleaded - sometimes as a voice crying in thewilderness - for a substantial increase in the level of officialdevelopment assistance in order to permit these countries toenjoy trade advantages without reciprocity  to ease their debtburden and stabilize raw-material prices. Our resolve in thismatter will not weaken: how can we accept  for example  asituation in which every year the African countries pay theWorld Bank more than they receive from it?Nor can we accept the persistence  and sometimes theworsening  of the most glaring situations of distress. Francehas not forgotten the depth of the crisis in sub-SaharanAfrica  with which it has so many ties. It believes it is26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionessential that the basic achievements of cooperation betweenthe European Community and the African  Caribbean andPacific countries  should be maintained  especially withregard to trade.Lastly  our third ambition for the United Nationsconcerns the vast issue of societal questions  linked naturallyto the requirements of development but distinct from it.The protection of human rights  the preservation of theenvironment  aid to refugees  the struggle against full-scaleepidemics  organized crime and drug trafficking all have aworldwide dimension. The Organization must address theseproblems with the same energy it expends in the search forpeace and the promotion of development.Several important dates lie ahead of us. Let us applywithout delay the recommendations unanimously adopted atthe Vienna Conference on Human Rights  particularly thecreation of a post of high commissioner for human rights.Let us prepare for the conferences in Cairo and Beijing andthe social development summit in Copenhagen with all thenecessary determination  so as to reinforce the cooperationrequired in addressing demographic problems  the promotionof women’s rights and the demands for social development.Great epidemics have always been a threat to theworld’s nations. But the need for full-scale internationalmobilization is becoming particularly acute in the case ofAIDS in view of the havoc of all kinds caused by the spreadof this malady. I earnestly hope that  as we approach thesecond decade of this struggle  the coherence of UnitedNations action  and that of its specialized agencies and of allStates and interested organizations  will be equal to this newchallenge. In this context  France proposes the convening ofa conference next year to bring together the main contributorcountries in the war against this scourge in order to improvecoordination of their efforts and give them a new impetus.In most cases  these phenomena are not new. However the challenge they pose to our societies  in the North and inthe South  is of unprecedented seriousness. They affectunderdevelopment as much as they do the excesses of theconsumer society  and our traditional responses are provingto be inadequate or ineffective. We need new ideas in thisarea. The Secretary-General should have broad power totake initiatives and make proposals in this matter. Francetherefore suggests the formation of a group of prominentfigures chosen for their intellectual and scientific abilitiesand moral influence to assist him in this vital task at the endof our century.Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 27Setting forth such ambitions for the United Nationsmight have made the sceptics smile a few years ago. Withthe end of the cold war the international community has ahistoric opportunity: no longer to dismiss problems butperhaps to solve them; no longer to limit conflicts butperhaps to settle them.Let us remain clear-sighted. This period could bemerely a brief interlude. If we were to hesitate  would it belong before peoples succumbed to their basest inclinations cast off the rules of international law or put themselves - inthe best of cases - under the sole protection of regional competing and potentially hostile solidarities?We do not have unlimited time. It is therefore our dutyto undertake without delay the reforms required to strengthenour Organization and to realize its new objectives.I should like to assure the Assembly that in the pursuitof these twin goals  the United Nations can count onFrance’s firm resolve."
"58",2446,"FSM",48,1993,"Onbehalf of the Federated States of Micronesia  I am honouredthis morning to address the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session  and I bring the warm greetings of ourPresident and our people.Given the many challenges facing the Organization andthe entire world in the coming year  we are pleased by yourelection  Mr. President. You have our confidence andsupport as you assume this high office  so ably dischargedby your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev  whoenjoyed our respect and gratitude.Special recognition must also be given to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  under whoseleadership the United Nations has taken difficult steps in aprocess of redefinition and reorganization  which isnecessary if we are to take advantage of the opportunitiespresented by the new world order and work together in theinterests of all mankind.During the past year we have seen the membership ofthe United Nations draw ever closer to the goal ofuniversality. We thus congratulate the Czech Republic  theSlovak Republic  The Former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia  Eritrea  Monaco and Andorra  and to each ofthem we extend a welcome and pledge cooperation andfriendship.Our people are deeply saddened by the loss of life andthe suffering caused by the earthquake in India last month and we express to the Indian people our sincere sympathyand pledge to them that we will participate in any effortundertaken by this Organization.Not many years ago  the appropriate role of the""micro-States"" within the world community was to be seenbut seldom heard  and even to be excluded from manyforums. In our own small island developing State  we  asthe body politic of a classic ""micro-State""  hesitated to assertour views on international affairs  thinking that a smallnation could not make a difference in or have an impactupon the resolution of global issues.Today I draw attention to a significant but lessnoticeable feature of the new order. Throughout history international relations have been conducted on a competitivebasis  where power and size made a difference. But I amhappy to note that things have changed for the better  that achange has begun to take place; and I think it is one that hasgathered increased momentum even within the past fewyears. Nations large and small  in the process of workingtogether under the Charter  have begun to focus theirattention and direct their efforts along the lines ofcommonality of interests and problems - and not merely topay lip-service. Indeed there is a growing  genuinephenomenon  which is seen partly in the unfolding of eventsin New York  but even more clearly in the impressiveoutcomes of the Rio Conference on Environment andDevelopment and the recent World Conference on HumanRights. Another sign is the entire world community’s keenanticipation of the upcoming Conference on Population andDevelopment and the World Summit for SocialDevelopment.I do not mean to suggest a disappearance of nationalinterests; but  across a wide spectrum of social  developmentand even security matters  there is a growing recognition thatcommon interests give strength to new alliances on aninclusive rather than exclusive basis. Thus  there is goodreason for continued progress towards self-determinationamong peoples  since they can now be confident that theywill not be alone in addressing the great difficulties ofstarting out. For similar reasons  many of the ""micro-States""have concluded recently that membership in thisOrganization is imperative  despite the burdens andresponsibilities involved.As this session of the General Assembly proceeds  weare becoming aware of the changes in the Organization interms of organization  administration and policy. There maybe some who doubt that Members have the will orcommitment to achieve consensus on these changes and tore-establish the proper financial basis for a United Nationsthat can be responsive to the present. I submit  however that any such doubts must be dispelled during our work herein the coming months  for we simply cannot afford to fail.The United Nations is no longer an optional feature of theinternational community. The common concerns of mankindin the great issues to which I alluded earlier cannot beaddressed from behind national fences. And so  I appeal toall Members to commit themselves fully to reaching at thissession the goal of preparing the United Nations to becomethe central instrument through which we can work to securethe future well-being of our peoples.I believe that the direct experience of my countrywithin our brief time as a Member provides unmistakableevidence of the strength of concerted  international action.Only a few years ago  having emerged from colonialism  ourbest hopes for development lay in dependence for anindefinite period on the generosity of a few friends  chiefamong them the United States. Moreover  as inhabitants ofsmall  low-lying islands  we were helpless in the face of thelooming threat of sea-level rise and other natural disasterscaused by human-induced climate change.Today  through the work of this body and with ourparticipation  the special development needs andenvironmental concerns of all small island developing Statesare being carefully addressed in a number of settings including the Conventions on climate change andbiodiversity and the follow-up activities of the UnitedNations Conference on Environment and Development(UNCED). The early work of the Commission onSustainable Development promises attention to our problems as can be seen in the upcoming first Global Conference onthe Sustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates.All this is not happening because of an outburst ofcharitable sympathy by the developed countries  but ratherin the context of addressing a complex of issues in whichpeoples everywhere have a stake. Herein  I think  lies thereal strength and value of the United Nations - to us and toall.During the past year  my Government has foundencouragement in the ways in which this Organization as awhole recognizes the difficulties that small States encounteras they try to participate fully in its work. We deeplyappreciate the opportunities afforded to us through thecontribution of Members to voluntary funds that haveenabled our participation in important functions. We alsoacknowledge the instances where calls by small States forthe holding of meetings here in New York to make ourpresence possible have been heard. Furthermore  weappreciate that  whenever possible  special measures for ourbenefit - such as limiting the number of simultaneousmeetings - are being taken.For our part  small States are now more often comingtogether on common issues to speak with one voice forgreater effectiveness and efficiency. Here  I cite theAlliance of Small Island States as a successful example onthe issue of climate change and other UNCED-relatedmatters. In a more general sense  the regional groupsoperate to the benefit of small States  affording usopportunities of access to elected positions by virtue ofallocations and the principle of rotation. I am sure there areother factors favourable to us that I have failed to mentionhere.Yet  even with all this  I must state that we are veryhard pressed to participate in the broad range of UnitedNations activities  both financially and owing to the sheervolume and complexity of those activities. For this reason and because so many other Members are in similarsituations  I propose that the United Nations  as part of itsreorganization efforts  undertake a comprehensiveexamination of the obstacles that exist to the fullparticipation of small States with a view towards identifyinginstitutional rather than ad hoc solutions. After all achieving universality in the United Nations would be ahollow accomplishment so long as a significant number ofForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 3Members remain incapable of reaching their effectivepotential within the Organization. We look forward toaddressing this issue during the course of the forty-eighthsession of the General Assembly.My country is a member of the South Pacific Forum an organization of Governments of Pacific island countrieswhich  each year prior to this date  meets to address mattersof concern to our region and to provide an expression of ourjoint views on many issues before this body. I wish to stateour complete solidarity with that expression  contained in thecommuniqué from our recent meeting in the Republic ofNauru  which will be presented for incorporation in therecords of this Assembly.The Forum members have been outspoken in opposingthe testing of nuclear weapons and other weapons of massdestruction. Our optimism ran very high at the Naurumeeting because it seemed that at last the nuclear Powershad found the resolve to bring this dangerous chapter ofhistory to an end. Now  with reports of a recent test by oneof them  the Federated States of Micronesia is deeplyconcerned that the great progress made towards achieving acomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty will be reversed. Wecall on all nuclear Powers not to treat this recent aberrationas an incentive to turn backwards  but rather to restore andhold to their collective discipline.The issue of fundamental human rights is interwoveninto every aspect of the activities undertaken by this body.For too long many Governments have been content to avoidconfronting it directly as a matter of multilateralresponsibility. I am glad to say that we sense someimprovement in the situation despite continuing occurrencesof the most repugnant kinds of human rights violations.In this decade  we have witnessed unprecedentedchanges in world conditions  brought about in part by agrowing unanimity of resolve among peoples to express andexercise their fundamental human rights. Recently prominent States have been dismantled  leading to theformation of other States that afford broader opportunitiesfor the expression of these rights. Sadly  at the same time other States continue to go to great lengths to suppress them.The world finds itself rejoicing in newly establishedfreedoms but also feeling deep revulsion over atrocities andrepression of shocking magnitude. If any lesson emergesfrom this dichotomy  it must be that isolated progress is notenough and that fundamental human rights issues can nolonger be relegated to the background in a set of supposedlyhigher multilateral priorities. Rather  human rights must bethe cornerstone of our work  which must be guided by theprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights.Accordingly  my Government expresses its support forthe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action agreedupon at the World Conference on Human Rights in Viennain June this year. We support the adoption of thatDeclaration by the General Assembly at its forty-eighthsession.In keeping with the principles of that Declaration  Iwish to affirm my Government’s strong and unconditionalsupport for the universality of human rights and for theeffective multilateral instruments that give meaning anddefinition to the concept.As an early priority  our new nation has undertaken aclose examination of the existing instruments with a view tofreely assuming obligations under them  as is consistent withour Constitution. As a first step  we have acceded to theConvention on the Rights of the Child  and we anticipatefurther action on other instruments as well.One of the very important concerns that is interlinkedwith all our Government’s hopes for a better future is therights of women. We fully support the development ofeffective new instruments in the cause of women’s rights inorder to secure their protection against discrimination andabuse.As a nation comprised entirely of indigenous peoples my Government also expresses its solidarity with allindigenous peoples of the world and particularly thosesubjected to deprivation of their fundamental human rightswithin their own homelands.In this the International Decade for the Eradication ofColonialism it is important that this body redouble its effortsto ensure that the peoples of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories are given every opportunity to exercisetheir right to self-determination and self-government. Whilethe obstacles to self-determination for the remainingTerritories are minor compared to those that are beingconfronted so dramatically in Eastern Europe and inPalestine  it remains our moral responsibility to support theright to self-determination for all peoples under colonialadministration.Today  the enlarged membership of the United Nationsis in itself strong testimony to the success of decolonization;let us hark back to our own earlier struggles and recommitourselves to the complete elimination of colonialism.4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionMy Government welcomes the establishment of theInternational Tribunal  and the recent election of itsmembers  to try perpetrators of war crimes in the formerRepublic of Yugoslavia. Still  we would support theestablishment of a permanent international human rightstribunal. The independent  juridical composition of any suchbody should place it above concerns regarding politicalintervention while denying human rights violators any refugefrom defined international responsibility.The Government of the Federated States of Micronesiaattaches great importance to the issue of fundamental humanrights  and will continue to participate in the work of thisbody towards a world community in which all peoples livewithout threat of encroachment upon these fundamentalrights.It has been well established by actions of this body thatthe right to development is itself a fundamental human right.But to recognize a right is one thing: to secure the exerciseof that right is much more difficult. A great deal is said anddone here at the United Nations every year to address theneeds of developing countries and peoples  not to mentionthe considerable resources that are mobilized bilaterallytowards that end. Yet we continue to see wide variations inthe degree of effectiveness of that assistance and in theresults of efforts by developing countries themselves.This has led an increasing number of us to questionwhether there might not exist a number of identifiablefactors that prevent development efforts from achievingsuccess. If those factors could be defined with precision andrecognized where they are present  it might well be possibleto attain significant increases in economies and outcomes.On Papua New Guinea’s welcome suggestion  and with itswelcome leadership - and after considerable discussion andextensive exchanges of views between eminent leaders in thedeveloping world - this matter has been placed before theAssembly as agenda item 151  entitled ""United Nationsinitiative on opportunity and participation"". We shall joinothers in sponsoring a draft resolution to be presented underthis item and calling for a comprehensive  systematic andthorough study of the encumbrances to full opportunity andparticipation in development  with particular reference to theeconomies of developing countries. If properly supportedand carried out  this initiative would make possiblesignificant breakthroughs in the effort to secure thisimportant and fundamental human right  with equality andequity for all.The Federated States of Micronesia pays a tribute to theenlightened men and women who gave life to the UnitedNations Conference on Environment and Development(UNCED) process and focused the world’s attention on theneed to begin replacing wasteful and polluting practices withsustainable development. This movement is especiallywell-timed for my country  since our development planningis still in the early stages and  as a consequence  and withthe encouragement and support of the world community  wenow have in place a national environmental managementstrategy that provides an essential complement to ourdevelopment-planning efforts.We intend for our country to become a model ofeffective partnership with other nations  and with this body demonstrating the application of new  clean technologies inorder to accommodate sustainable development within asmall  pristine environment.Of course  as a nation of remote and widely dispersedsmall islands  many of which are low-lying atolls  weexperience all the difficulties recognized in section G ofchapter 17 of Agenda 21 as inhibiting the development ofsmall island countries. Thus  we are thankful for theopportunity now before us to enhance general understandingof those difficulties through the Global Conference on theSustainable Development of Small Island States.As a member of the Alliance of Small Island States  weare participating fully in that process. It was mostencouraging to note  at the recent preparatory conference  thestrong participation by developed countries and also the solidsupport from our colleagues in the Group of 77. We shallfully reciprocate that support in all appropriate settingsbecause  despite our awareness of our own problems  weknow that virtually all developing countries exhibit one ormore disabling characteristics that distinguish them from theothers. While we are part of a relatively large grouping ofcountries that share similar characteristics and disabilities  alldeveloping countries deserve to have attention paid to theirparticular obstacles to development.In that light  we perceive the Barbados Conference nextyear as an important early milestone in the post-Rio process not only for small island developing States but for allnations  developed and developing  that believe as we do inthe Rio Declaration and in Agenda 21. The BarbadosConference is  in our view  the first real test of Agenda 21.It may seem at times that we of the region of thePacific islands are overly-preoccupied about ourenvironment  and that we take too broad a view of thepotential impact resulting from the actions of others. Weraise our voices loudly and often on the subject ofForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 5human-induced climate change and sea-level rise  but manysay that it may not happen. We speak out against nucleartesting  especially in and among our islands  but those whoare more powerful say that it probably is not harmful. Westrongly urge that lethal toxic substances such as plutoniumand chemical weapons not be transported through or storedwithin our region  but even some of our closest friends do soregardless  insisting that in all likelihood there is no danger.Are we too concerned? Are we naive? I believe that we arenot  because the Pacific region appears to be a vast  thinlypopulated ocean area and thus a prime location for the dirtybusiness of others - but that region is our home and ourresponsibility.Not only must we provide for ourselves from itsbounty  but we are also stewards of what is coming to berecognized in scientific circles as the last remaining greatunspoiled natural resource of the planet. Our fisheries areplentiful  but they could be threatened if experienceselsewhere in the world are repeated. Our air is still clean but we now know we are vulnerable to occurrenceselsewhere. Our water is still pure  but we have seen otherseas contaminated by unsustainable practices. We must  andwill continue to  speak out.Our region is not simply the victim of the callousdisregard of the powerful for the consequences visited uponthe poor or the weak. Rather  we recognize that forcenturies mankind has regarded the vast oceans as freespace  open to all passage and exploitation. Althoughexclusive economic zones and multilateral treaties have hadmajor impact  the fact remains that the Pacific Ocean istoday the world’s ultimate ""back yard"".My country’s plea  then  is quite simple andstraightforward. We call on all members of the worldcommunity to join us  in the spirit of Rio  in a truepartnership for the sustainable development  not just of oneor more Pacific island countries  but of our ocean and allthat is in it. One important focus must  of course  be uponthe land and coastal areas within our region  in order toaccommodate appropriate development without degradingeither the land or its surrounding marine space. But another broader  focus must be on the ocean itself - to respect andbuild upon the growing scientific knowledge of its complexecological systems.It is well known that the Federated States ofMicronesia  along with other low-lying island countries ofthe World  is literally frightened that its scarce land spacemay be made uninhabitable and ultimately disappear if eventhe moderate predictions of global warming and sea-levelrise come to pass. But if this were the only concern withregard to human-induced climate change  loss of biodiversityand unsustainable development  we would be hard put to callupon the world at large to make fundamental changes in theway it lives. Ours  however  is by no means an isolatedconcern. As the South Pacific Forum Heads of Governmenthave stressed for some years  the fate of the islands is anadvance warning of things to come  as we have predicted.Thanks to the trends that I discussed earlier in respectof the modern realignment of motivations for internationalcooperation  I have tremendous confidence that we  and ourchildren and their children  will succeed not only inpreserving the environment but also in maintaining the pacetowards the ultimate goals of peace  enjoyment of humanrights and social enrichment  as enshrined in the Charter.My country pledges its efforts within this great Organization during this forty-eighth session of the General Assembly andafterwards  towards the attainment of these ends."
"59",2488,"GAB",48,1993,"I should like first to take this opportunity to extend to thedelegation of India the sincerest condolences of thedelegation of Gabon on the earthquake that has just hit theregion of Sholapur.The present session of the General Assembly isconvened at a crucial juncture in the history of internationalrelations. A number of significant events have occurred onthe world stage in the past few years.In that context the election of AmbassadorSamuel Insanally as President of the General Assembly isparticularly significant. It is a tribute not only to hisqualities as an enlightened diplomatic  well versed ininternational questions  but to the tireless work of Guyana his country  on behalf of peace. On behalf of the delegationof Gabon  I extend to him our warmest congratulations onhis election to preside over this session.Our congratulations also go to the outgoing President Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria  who discharged his duties sohonourably and ably.To our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali I repeat our firm support for his many efforts on behalf ofworld peace and security.Lastly  we should like to welcome the new countriesthat have just joined the great family of the United Nationsand to assure them of our friendship and readiness to workwith them to achieve the noble purposes for the attainmentof which the Organization was founded.The end of the cold war has made it possible toestablish new kinds of relations between States and to openthe way to a new era of hope  peace and solidarity promoting conflict prevention  better ways of dealing withacute problems and the settlement of many of the conflictsthreatening international peace and security.It is from that perspective that we should view therecent initiatives which the Organization and theinternational community have undertaken.Gabon welcomes with great interest the most recentpolitical developments in South Africa. We welcome thecreation of a Transitional Executive Council  which willallow South Africans for the first time to take part inbuilding a new  democratic  non-racial and united SouthAfrica. In that spirit  we urge all other parties to accede tothe agreement creating the Council and hope they will worktowards its full implementation. Gabon believes that thechanges taking place in South Africa will have a definiteimpact on the democratization process in Africa and on thecontinent’s development. We therefore hope that the appealmade here on 24 September 1993 by President NelsonMandela for the lifting of economic sanctions and theestablishment of diplomatic relations with South Africa willbe heard and acted upon.In Somalia too many innocent victims continue to paythe heavy daily price of violence. While praising the effortsof the United Nations to bring peace and nationalreconciliation to the country  we believe that the time hasperhaps come for the international community to givepriority to the path of dialogue and negotiation.The situation in Liberia remains a source of concern despite the hopes raised by the signing of the CotonouAgreement on 25 July 1993. We call on the partiesconcerned to begin strict implementation of that Agreement.We make a similar appeal to the parties to the conflicts inMozambique  Rwanda and Angola.Turning specifically to Angola  I note that the optimismprevailing after the Bicesse Peace Accords soon gave way todisappointment born of the resumption of hostilities. In thatbrother country  so close to my own  the perpetuation of thesituation leads me to praise the tireless efforts of the UnitedNations and all other initiatives aimed at restoring peace andsecurity. As in the past  Gabon will spare no efforts to helpachieve a lasting settlement of that conflict.In the Middle East the mutual recognition of Israel andthe PLO  as well as the recent signing of the interim40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionarrangements for the autonomy of Gaza and Jericho  werewelcomed with relief and deep satisfaction by my country.We dare hope that this historic agreement will promotereconciliation between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples andthe establishment of a climate of peace and cooperation inthe region.In that regard  my country supports all United Nationsinitiatives  particularly Security Council resolution833 (1993)  aimed at ensuring respect for the inviolability ofthe international boundary between Iraq and Kuwait  inaccordance with the terms of the 1963 arrangements.In South-East Asia we welcome the decisive roleplayed by the United Nations in the restoration of peace inCambodia. The holding of free and fair elections inMay 1993  the creation of the Constituent Assembly  and thereturn to the throne of His Royal HighnessPrince Norodom Sihanouk all illustrate the United Nationscommitment and the confirmed solidarity of the internationalcommunity.The tragedy unfolding in Bosnia and Herzegovina andthe serious threat of the conflict’s spreading to the entiresubregion are a source of concern for my country. We makean urgent appeal to the parties concerned to return to thenegotiating table and lay down their arms.The Conferences recently held in Vienna and Genevaon human rights and the protection of the victims of war respectively  were opportunities for our Organization toreaffirm its commitment to defending human rights. Gabon which has always given these questions their dueconsideration  encourages all United Nations efforts toprotect human rights. It would thus be appropriate tostrengthen existing structures with additional human andfinancial resources so as to promote the efficiency sought byour Organization in this area.Never has our Organization been called on to such adegree by the international community as in the past fewyears. If it is to meet all the expectations  it must adapt itsmain organs to the demands of the times. We welcome theongoing reform and revitalization process and hope that itwill include consideration of equitable representation in theSecurity Council and an increase in the number of itsmembers.One area which our Organization must explore furtheris that of preventive diplomacy  as set forth by the Secretary-General in his ""An Agenda for Peace"". Reflecting thattrend  the Organization of African Unity has just createdmachinery to prevent  manage and settle conflicts. If it is tobe effective  this new machinery must be integrated into theframework of global disarmament.The progress made by last 13 January  when thechemical-weapons Convention was signed  shows theinternational community’s determination to ban weapons ofmass destruction  particularly chemical weapons  and itsreadiness to work for general and complete disarmament.For its part  my country is working towards that end  just asit is promoting confidence-building measures in centralAfrica. It was in keeping with this involvement that wehosted the third meeting of the Permanent ConsultativeCommittee on security questions in our subregion. Thismeeting was notable for bringing together  for the first time all States members of the Economic Community of CentralAfrican States (ECCAS).In the course of its work the Committee stressed theadvantages for all States of the subregion of ratifyinginternational legal instruments on disarmament matters. Itrecommended that its Bureau play a more committedpolitical role in seeking solutions to crises and conflictslikely to disturb the peace of a member State. It encouragedStates in the subregion to pursue and strengthen thedemocratization process already under way  while respectingand promoting human rights.Regarding the creation of a permanent inter-State crisismanagement headquarters  with a view to establishing asubregional peace-keeping force  the Committeerecommended transitional measures  including theinvolvement of ECCAS in the field of security; a study offeatures and types of crises and conflicts; and the creation ofa non-permanent committee of subregional staff offices. Itfurther recommended that the United Nations be asked forassistance to carry out a study on a balanced and gradualreduction of the armed forces  equipment and militarybudgets of member States. Finally  the Committee adopteda draft non-aggression pact between the ECCAS memberStates and decided to submit it to Heads of State orGovernment of the subregion for signature. Asrepresentative of the host country at these importantmeetings  and on behalf of the States of the subregion  it ismy honour and privilege to invite the General Assembly indue course to endorse the draft resolution  which will besubmitted to it for consideration.What is truly at stake for Africa is essentially theeconomy. It will determine to a great extent the preservationof unity  peace and security on our continent. In that regard the marginalization of Africa in the world economy - as aForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 41result of the decline of its commodity prices  the reversal offinancial resource flows from our countries to theinternational financial institutions  and the debt burden - hasonly grown during the past five years.Already experiencing such a restrictive economicenvironment  how can we in my country welcome the ideaof an energy tax and not deplore the threat of a boycott ofour forest products by ecological groups in the industrializedcountries? As to the forest  the Gabon authorities havealways favoured the long-term management of our forests through a logical policy of reforestation conforming with therecommendations of the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development.My country stresses the need to maintain every aspectof the Rio spirit aimed at managing world problems in aglobal manner  and to promote the emergence of a newpartnership in international economic and financial relations.Gabon considers this new approach to be a possible avenuefor the development of our countries.In this connection  we would like to congratulate theJapanese authorities on their initiative in organizing theInternational Conference on African Development  scheduledto be held in Tokyo in October. We hope that Conferencewill serve as the basis for a real and lasting partnership.In this context  the proposal made by the President ofthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session in hisopening address that we create an agenda for developmentshould enjoy the full support of our Organization.In conclusion  turning to our country’s developmentproblems  I feel that I must draw the attention of theAssembly to the decisive role to be played by women. OurOrganization has adopted resolutions and declarations on thissubject. The political commitment has been made  but itmust be associated with consistent follow-up measures toimplement these provisions. This is a struggle that we mustall of us become involved in.Anxious to take into account the role of women in thepolitical  economic  social and cultural fields  the GaboneseGovernment  through the Ministry responsible for the statusof women  is working towards making this commitment areality.The sessions of the General Assembly are for MemberStates an excellent opportunity to seek together ways andmeans of attaining the noble objectives of the Charter. Isnot one of its most important goals""To achieve international cooperation in solvinginternational problems of an economic  social  cultural or humanitarian character""?"
"60",2535,"GBR",48,1993,"Mr. President  may Ifirst of all congratulate you on your election  and on thedignified and effective way in which you are alreadypresiding over this Assembly. You have a burdensome joband we wish you all good fortune as you discharge it.I have sometimes heard speakers from this rostrumpatrol the world in their speeches in the general debate dealing at length with one continent after another. Indeed I have done so myself in past years. There is much todescribe: events in the Middle East and South Africa areparticularly encouraging  and developments in Russia  as wehave just heard from Mr. Kozirev  are particularly important.But today it seems to me that in the time available  the focusof interest should not only be on distant events or distanttragedies  but here  in this building  on this institution.Never has there been a time when the United Nations hasbeen so discussed  so misunderstood  so needed.The international task of this decade is managingdisorder. I believe it is possible. But it demands coolheads  low voices  and an understanding of what we can andcannot do. It demands concertation between all countriesthat take on part of the responsibility for steering the worldthrough channels which are certainly strewn with rocks.This concertation takes place in many forums  but nowherewith greater legal and political authority than here at theUnited Nations.We can now see the events of 1989 in their trueperspective. They did not usher in a new world order. Ithink we have to be sober about this. What happened in1989 was not the birth of a new world order  it was thecollapse of one super-Power and the end of communism asa threat to world peace.The tragedies of the world have continued. Indeed they have probably increased since 1989. ""Tragedy"" is abetter description than the usual  and overworked  term""crisis""  because ""crisis"" implies a threat to world peace.Now that the cold war is over and super-Powers no longerexert themselves on behalf of clients  it is no longer a crisisin that sense - a threat to world peace - if Sudan  Bosnia Angola  Liberia  Georgia  Afghanistan  Rwanda  Somalia Tajikistan  Azerbaijan and others are racked by civil war.But these are appalling tragedies for those who are killed ordriven from their homes  and indeed for all of us  becausewe are all diminished when the bell tolls.18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionSome of these tragedies are illuminated by thehaphazard light of television. In those cases  millions of ourcitizens  in all our countries  share feelings of sympathy indignation and horror. But other tragedies equally foul areplayed in a darkened theatre: no television  no audience little pressure. But all these tragedies are a reproach to thoseof us who are convinced that it is possible slowly andpainstakingly to construct a more decent world.How do we do that? Not  it is clear  by the remainingsuper-Power using its superiority to impose its own solutionsby force. In the 10 tragedies that I listed  the United Stateshas intervened with troops only in one  Somalia - and thatnow on a reduced scale and under the United Nations -because the United States  quite rightly in my view  is notprepared to send its troops all over the world  as Rome oncesent its legions all over Europe  to fight  to pacify and torule. There are British  French  Spanish and other Europeantroops in Bosnia today under the command of the UnitedNations. But their role is to save Bosnian lives - they dothat daily - implementing United Nations decisions.Likewise  they are not imposing a European imperium onthat country.If America and its allies are not to exert themselves asa joint imperial Power  imposing on other countries andsustaining laws and rulers of their choice  then the answercan only lie in reforming and making much better use of theinternational institutions to which we belong. They weremostly built after the Second World War for one purposeand are now  after the end of the cold war  being hurriedlyadapted for another. The British architect Norman Fosterhas just been given the responsibility of designing in Berlinthe new parliament house for a united Germany. If his plansare accepted  he intends to include the old Reichstagbuilding alongside the line of the Berlin Wall in a splendidnew structure reaching across the old Wall into East Berlin.There is a parable here for us as well as for Germany.Inevitably  we have to cope as best we can with whatwe have. A man  after all  may take some shelter in anunfinished building. I do not believe that an internationalorganization like ours  which is not a colonizing Power  willever be able to guarantee solutions to civil wars or even tothat pernicious variant of a civil war which we see today inBosnia. But if there are no guarantees of success  theUnited Nations can be helped greatly to improve on itsrecord. With greater experience  greater resources forpreventive action and effectively coordinated humanitarianefforts  it can act before the situation gets out of control andthe demand grows for the implementation of sanctions andfor peace enforcement.I hope that within the next few weeks the EuropeanCommunity will move into a new phase of working togetheron a common foreign and security policy once the Treaty ofMaastricht is ratified by all 12 member States. OurPresident  Willy Claes  the Foreign Minister and DeputyPrime Minister of Belgium  has just illustrated that point.But one of our main aims as European partners must be tosupport and strengthen the role and the work of the UnitedNations  for the United Nations is not ""them""; it is us  all ofus. We have to take responsibility for it and its failures.If we want the United Nations to work better  it is upto us to give the Secretary-General the support he needs inthoughts  words  deeds and money. I suppose there are fewmore lonely or more demanding jobs than that of theSecretary-General of the United Nations  and the presentSecretary-General certainly has the misfortune to hold hisoffice in interesting times. He has already given andcontinues to give a firm and effective lead. He needs anddeserves our support.The United Nations is unique. It alone conveys theword of the international community. Only the UnitedNations has the legal powers to translate those words intoaction for the maintenance of world peace. We need  asPresident Clinton said yesterday  to look at tasks closely  toensure that they are properly defined and that the resourcesare there to meet them. We may on occasion have to acceptthat a mandate should not be given because in reality itcannot be fulfilled.Let me follow that by looking briefly at the way wecarry out peace-keeping operations  the way we deploypreventive diplomacy and the way we run our finances.Peace-keeping: United Nations blue-helmets aredeployed on nearly every continent. We can reel off thestatistics  but actually we hear too little of individual soldiersand small detachments. Who knows  for example  of thesingle military observer in a remote part of Cambodia whofound himself not only acting as the local arbiter of familydisputes but also providing a local  much appreciated medical service using a handbook called When There is NoDoctor  who kept on securing supplies from his wife inGermany and the field hospital in Phnomh Penh for hisKhmer community? Or the United Nations military observerwho spent his leave in Bangkok fund-raising for a waterfilter for a remote Cambodian village? Now  they happen tobe British  but such servants of the world come from manycountries.Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 19We in Britain are committed to our peace-keepingcontribution. We now have over 3 300 men and women inblue berets around the world.In June the Secretary-General asked Member States toidentify for him those areas of United Nations peace-keepingoperations which needed strengthening and for our ideas onpositive steps we could take. I look forward to his reportdrawing all those responses together.Useful steps have certainly been taken. There is nowa 24-hour operations room  improving the ability of thosehere in New York to oversee operations around the world.The standby force planning project has been started. A newDepartment of Peace-keeping Operations is responsible forall United Nations field missions. We can build on theseimprovements.Good organization involves clarity and sobriety insetting out our objectives. That means that any operationmust have clear and achievable objectives linked to apolitical process which offers reasonable hope of a solution and to which all parties should be committed. The mandateshould be precise and finite. That means adequate supportat Headquarters for planning and reconnaissance missions.It means that the Security Council must resist the temptationto become involved in the detailed conduct of operations. Itmeans the mandate must not create impossible obligationsfor a force commander on the ground. Once an operation isagreed  command and control relationships could be moreclearly defined.Unity of command at the highest level is essential.Where the United Nations is charged with executing as wellas authorizing a peace-keeping operation  all aspects of itshould be handled by a single department in New York.That is why we have suggested the creation of an expandedplanning and operations staff. This in effect is a generalstaff for peace-keeping. These men and women  civilian andmilitary  would be able together to provide the necessarycore of the United Nations strategic-planning chain. Theywould operate mainly here in New York  but also in thefield. They would provide the United Nations with thenervous system for which its present staff is neitherstructured nor resourced.We are not proposing here some new and heavybureaucracy. On the contrary  we are talking about corestaff: trained staff officers  United Nations civil affairs and increasingly  humanitarian advisers  and chief administrativeofficers. The example of the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  of a specialenvoy for all humanitarian and refugee aspects of anoperation  is good.Then  there must be flexibility in running peace-keepingoperations. The more comprehensive a bureaucracybecomes  the harder it is for it to stay nimble on its feet.Doctrinal and administrative difficulties in working withother international organizations can be overcome. Forexample  the United Nations is already building valuablelinks with the Conference on Security and Cooperation inEurope (CSCE) and with the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO). Many peace-keeping andpeacemaking operations can be run more effectively byregional organizations or single countries on behalf of theUnited Nations. That depends on the nature of the problemand on the proposed action agreed by the United Nations.I am thinking  for example  of the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS) in Liberia  the Organizationof African Unity (OAU) in Rwanda  and the EuropeanCommunity and NATO in the former Yugoslavia.Regional organizations can also be asked to help withtraining. We might look at getting certain nations with well-trained  equipped and available forces to provide the firstwave of a peace-keeping force  allowing other nations thetime to train and equip their forces to the required standard.A commitment to deploy early would of course need to bematched by a United Nations commitment to agree a firmend-date for the deployment  because exits can be asimportant as entrances.What we cannot do  we should not pretend to do. Ifwe play a game of bluff  we can deceive and disappointothers  and sometimes we deceive and disappoint ourselves.Rarely can we attain our ends that way. It is empty topretend that we can impose peace with justice on everydisorder  every dispute  outside our national borders.But what the United Nations can do  it should do well.Cambodia  for example  is a success story. So was Namibia.Our peace-keepers have been able to limit  though not stop conflict and to assuage  though not bring to and end suffering in Bosnia and Somalia. But the authority of theUnited Nations will suffer if it fails to approach newchallenges realistically and flexibly.However important peace-keeping may be  successfulpreventive diplomacy would be better. I have just beenreading the book published this week by our Australiancolleague  the Australian Foreign Minister  Senator GarethEvans. His new book  Cooperating for Peace  brings thispoint out well and is full of fruitful ideas. Defusing trouble20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioncosts a great deal less than a military operation. You canfield plenty of emissaries for the price of a battalion. But tobe useful  of course  an emissary has to set about his workbefore the excitement of violence has taken hold.The Secretary-General has been energetic here. He hassent missions to several areas of tension - to Tajikistan andother regions of the former Soviet Union  to Macedonia  toSouth Africa and elsewhere.But in this as in other parts of the United Nationssystem money is tight. Many missions create an acute needfor additional international staff with the necessary skills. Iam thinking not just of eminent people  of retired ministersor distinguished ambassadors who can head such missions.The Secretary-General will find them when he needs them.What he needs from Member States is personnel at a morejunior level with local experience and negotiating skills.Now  we have discussed this problem in particular withthe French Government  and as an Anglo-French initiativewe stand ready to provide the Secretariat with a list of suchpeople  people who have experience in Government service -sometimes outside Government service - and whom wewould be prepared to make available for particular missions.We would also be prepared to provide a certain amount ofequipment where personnel provided by the United Kingdomwere involved. We are ready to respond to the invitation ofthe Secretary-General in ""Agenda for Peace"" to provideinformation crucial to the task of preventive diplomacy. TheBritish and French Governments are both committed tosupport him in this way  and we hope that others may joinin a similar enterprise.All this work means a financial burden. Of course weshould all pay our assessed contribution in full and promptly.We do so. So do most of our European partners  the Nordiccountries and those with a long tradition of peace-keepinglike Australia and Canada. But others  not entirely oralways through their own fault  others who share the heavyburden of international responsibility  do not.The fact is  the United Nations will always be shortof money. Even if everybody pays up in full and on time the United Nations will still have to choose priorities withinthe resources available to it. That means - and will alwaysmean - turning down some good causes  and reappraisingand sometimes bringing to an end existing commitments.The United Nations needs to conduct a rigorousscrutiny of what it needs and what it spends. Obviously  itwould be able to afford more operations if it ran the existingones more economically. Without thrift  without financialprobity  the authority of the United Nations will weaken andvanish. So we welcome the Secretary-General’s recentadditional senior appointments at the level of AssistantSecretary-General  covering administrative and financialaffairs. We support proposals for a system of inspectionwith teeth  which can match more delegated financialauthority to the field.I mention these three areas - peace-keeping  preventivediplomacy and finance. If we can tackle these three areasconstructively and vigorously  there is no reason why evenunder present strains the authority of the United Nationsshould not grow as strikingly as the burden of expectationsnow placed upon it. People will always continue to turn tothe United Nations  even if they will always expect more ofus than is conceivable.We are discussing  in that context  reform  and we inBritain welcome the debate on Security Council reform. Weare discussing positively the enlargement of the Council.This will be complex  as our debate already makes clear because there are many currents and cross-currents of view.I do not doubt that if there were to be consensus onenlarging the Security Council there are some countrieswhich  because of their global interests  their contribution tointernational security  their contribution to United Nationspeace-keeping  could undertake the full range ofresponsibilities of a permanent member and can certainly beexpected to do so.I have concentrated simply on this Organization for thereason which I gave. Few tasks are more important thanimproving the way the United Nations works if we are tosecure a more stable world. We have lived through theevents of these last few years. They have been dramatic andexhilarating  they have changed the political and strategiclandscape  but they have not removed from us ourresponsibility to work constructively for a better UnitedNations. This better world order will not happen because wemake a few speeches or pass a few resolutions. It will beconstructed steadily  brick by brick  learning always the rightlessons from the past  developing steadily our internationalinstitutions and our international relations.It is fair to say that in the last four years  with its upsand downs  we have come a long way  and I believe that together  we have the will and the wisdom to continue alongthat road."
"61",2606,"GHA",48,1993,"It is with pleasure that  onbehalf of the Ghana delegation  I convey to Mr. Insanally ofGuyana our congratulations on his election  by acclamation as President of the General Assembly at its forty-eighthsession. He assumes this high office at a momentous timein the history of mankind  as we endeavour to establish anew world order based on freedom and justice. The skillsand experience that he brings to his office assure us ofsuccess during his tenure. The cordial relations that happilyexist between the President’s country and mine increase oursatisfaction  hopes and expectations. We pledge to him andto the Bureau our full cooperation and support.Let me place on record also our appreciation of theeffective leadership that the President’s predecessor Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria  gave to our Organizationduring his stewardship. His ability to navigate the GeneralAssembly through the turbulence of a contradictory contextin international relations was admirable.Once again  the Secretary-General has shown  througha display of his remarkable skills as a thinker  anadministrator and an accomplished diplomat  that he is ontop of his job. The credit is no doubt shared by the staff whose dedication and commitment have been maintained.The universality of the General Assembly  which makesit the most representative organ of the Organization  hasagain been reaffirmed with the admission of five newMember States since August 1992. We take this opportunityto welcome them and to extend to them the cooperation ofthe Ghana delegation.The search for enduring peace is still the greatestchallenge of the Organization  in spite of the end of the coldwar. The collapse of the Union of Soviet SocialistRepublics and the accession to independence of itsconstituent parts  the freedom and independence of theForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 21countries of Eastern Europe  German reunification  and thecold-war relics of trouble spots have brought to the fore""Simmering disputes  violent conflicts  aggression andforeign occupation  interference in the internal affairs ofStates  policies of hegemony and domination  ethnicstrife  religious intolerance  new forms of racism andnarrowly conceived nationalism""  (A/47/675  annex para. 3)as the Jakarta Message of 1992 of the Non-AlignedMovement so aptly stated.At the same time  our world is faced with an economicand a social situation similar to that which preceded the twoworld wars. All these developments  aggravated by globalrecession  threaten to undermine the purposes of the UnitedNations.We must continue to pursue the goal of totaldisarmament. We should like the proposed United NationsRegister of Conventional Arms to include nations’production of arms and all other weapons of massdestruction.The goal of complete and total disarmament wouldobviously be easier to pursue in an environment of peacebased on mutual confidence. It is in this context that wewelcome the efforts of the United Nations to shoulder theincreasing burden of peace-keeping and peacemaking. InCambodia  Mozambique  Angola  South Africa  the formerYugoslavia  Somalia  the Middle East  Cyprus  andelsewhere  the efforts of the United Nations have served asa positive check on the threat to international peace andsecurity. There are  however  lessons to be drawn forcurrent and future operations. The holding of elections inAngola and in Cambodia without the fulfilment of certainconditions  such as the disarming and cantonment of troops was tactically unhelpful  in spite of the circumstances thatled to the elections - a mistake which  thankfully  the UnitedNations does not intend to repeat in Mozambique. Weshould also remind ourselves that peacemaking may be aslow and painful process. The need to retain the confidenceof all parties and their support for  and participation in  theprocess is fundamental and crucial to the success of suchoperations.We are disappointed at the instability that continues toengulf the former Yugoslavia. Whilst we still regret theinitial reaction of the international community - in particular the regional institutions - to developments there  we wish toreiterate that unrestrained nationalism that seeks justificationin the much-cherished principle of self- determination isunacceptable. Furthermore  the expression of suchnationalism in ""ethnic cleansing"" is as barbaric and revoltingas it is reprehensible and totally at variance with civilizedbehaviour. The readiness of the United Nations to actdecisively in Somalia contrasts sharply with the timidity andhesitation that have marked our presence in the formerYugoslavia and threaten to erode the credibility of theOrganization. It is for these reasons that we welcomeSecurity Council resolution 859 (1993)  in which theCouncil  acting under Chapter VII of the Charter  calls forthe immediate cease-fire and cessation of hostilitiesthroughout the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that areessential if a just and equitable political solution to theconflict is to be achieved through peaceful negotiations. Weexpect the Security Council to monitor the implementationof the resolution.My Government warmly welcomes the historicagreements on limited autonomy for Palestine and on mutualrecognition between Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization. These accords are a tribute to the courage foresight  determination and outstanding statesmanship ofChairman Yasser Arafat and of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. They usher in the beginning of theend of decades of war  mistrust  violence  destruction andwanton killing and suffering that the Arab-Israeli conflict hasbrought to the people of the Middle East. They lay a solidfoundation for a just  comprehensive and lasting peace in theMiddle East. We therefore urge the entire internationalcommunity to support them.From the new dawn of relations in the Middle Eastemerges a powerful  compelling and inspiring truth - thatthere is no conflict that is not capable of solution. That iswhy we consider that the ""no war  no peace"" situation inCyprus should not be permitted to lure this Organization intocomplacency. The search for a settlement should beaccelerated. To this end  the recent decision to maintain theUnited Nations presence in Cyprus should encourage all theparties involved.The situation in Sudan  equally  cries out for a peacefulsolution and for greater United Nations involvement as acontribution to the search for an enduring settlement to anessentially political problem that has brought such sufferingto the people and has created an unbearable refugee problemfor neighbouring States.Our Organization has recorded laudable success in itsimplementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)on the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionColonial Countries and Peoples. The independence ofNamibia is the latest of the success stories of decolonization.However  the Territories and peoples that remain undercolonial rule demand our active and sustained attention andrender premature any conclusion that the decolonizationprocess has been completed.We welcome the progress that has been made in thenegotiations in South Africa. However  the internationalcommunity needs to remind itself that apartheid is far frombeing completely eradicated. The process of democratizationin that country must be completed so that all its citizens maybe enabled to exercise their voting rights. The worldcommunity has a responsibility to maintain its vigilanceregarding South Africa until the election on 27 April 1994 which will put in place an acceptable constitutionalprogramme for a transitional Government based  for the firsttime in the history of that country  on universal adultsuffrage.Of equal concern is the impasse over Western Sahara.The United Nations peace plan must be allowed to work and the timetable set for the holding of elections must berespected by all. In the light of the call for a more prudentuse of the resources available to the United Nations  it isimperative that the task of the United Nations Mission forthe Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) becompleted rapidly  to the full satisfaction of all concerned particularly the Sahraoui people.The new impetus for peacemaking and peace-keepingrepresents a major advance in our collective engagement inthe task of seeking and creating a peaceful and safe world.In this Assembly it has been suggested that the UnitedNations should limit its commitments  that it should not takeon every conflict. But which conflicts must it address  andwhich ones should it decline to get involved in? That is thecrucial question. The unity of the purposes of the Charterand the universality of our Organization compel us torecognize that a threat to peace anywhere is a threat to peaceeverywhere.But even if the suggestions have merit  either on thegrounds of lack of funds  constraints in logistics or theUnited Nations inability to heal all the world’s wounds  mydelegation wants to stress the need for the United Nations tosee all the peace-keeping assignments it is engaged inthrough to their logical conclusion. The United Nationscannot  at this juncture  turn its back on South Africa Liberia  Rwanda  Angola  Mozambique  Haiti  Somalia orthe former Yugoslavia. It would be a sad day indeed if allthese laudable initiatives were abandoned on the grounds ofwell-reasoned arguments pleading lack of funds or of thewill to help these nations enjoy the peace that has eludedthem for years.In recognition of the fact that the United Nations cannotundertake too many initiatives  it should devise mechanismsfor shoring up regional efforts at conflict resolution  such asin Liberia. We also wish to stress that the internal parties tothe various conflicts which the United Nations is striving sohard to resolve have a moral responsibility to play their partin accelerating the process towards peace. Human decencyand the sanctity of human life impose this duty on them. Inthis respect  we must encourage the Inkatha Freedom Partyand other right-wing groups to join the process ofnegotiations in South Africa  and we should condemn in nouncertain terms the treachery of UNITA and the attitude ofsome of the Somali warlords.Whatever mistakes the United Nations Operation inSomalia (UNOSOM) may have made  it is grotesque for anySomali leader to seek to be a hero by engaging the UnitedNations in combat. Such a show of ingratitude may havelong-term damaging consequences in terms of thewillingness of Member States to undertake humanitarianmissions. And what would be the consequences for theSomali people should the United Nations decide to abortUNOSOM? Any leader who has the interest of his people atheart needs to reflect on that.It is noteworthy that many of the conflicts plaguing usare in the developing countries. We hope the call forlimiting the peace-keeping role of the United Nations is notan attempt to shirk the burden of engaging in solving thepolitical problems in these countries in the same way as thefundamental economic concerns of these countries have beenmarginalized.As we concern ourselves with the resolution of thesesometimes malignant conflicts  let us not forget to addressthe fundamental factors that generate many of them. Weknow that a great proportion of these problems can be tracedto economic deprivation and underdevelopment. Mydelegation has stressed time and again in this Assembly andelsewhere that underdevelopment and conflicts have a link.It is often the poorest countries or countries where economicdecline has been steep that relapse into savage violence. Wehave also said that the source of the condition ofunderdevelopment can be largely traced to a global economicsystem that has been inimical to the interests of developingand poor countries.Forty-eighth session - 30 September l993 23It is time the United Nations  in its effort to constructpeace and keep the peace  addressed some of thefundamental economic issues that hamper all efforts toeradicate global poverty. In this connection  the perennialproblems that plague the economies of the South must nowbe fully tackled as part of the energetic search for worldpeace. We have said in almost all United Nations forums including the Assembly  that the debt burden cripples oureconomies. We have spoken regularly about theunacceptable levels of resource flow from the poor nationsto the rich. We have drawn regular attention to the unequalterms of trade  protectionist barriers and a disastrous globalpricing system that does not pay us adequately for the fruitsof our labour  whether we produce coffee  cocoa or copper.It is time the United Nations placed development andthe crucial need for restructuring the world economy on itspriority list side-by-side with  if not above  its peace-keepingand peacemaking agenda. The United Nations must defendeach nation’s right to earn its way by being an equalparticipant in the global market place. Many of us haveundertaken structural adjustments. Yet the returns of thegreat sacrifices we have made remain low. So many of uscannot provide adequate social services in the form ofschools  clinics or clean water for our people. In manyinstances  bowing to the conditions set for the loans wecontract to expand our export base  we have to lay offworkers and thus consign thousands or even millions offamilies to indigence as the small pay check that puts a mealon the table  buys medicine when the child is sick  orprovides the uniform for the new school-goer in the family is no longer forthcoming.The United Nations has been advised  correctly in ourview  to run efficient peace-keeping operations  to refurbishitself administratively and to upgrade its skills in all thespheres of its endeavours. We wish to add that the UnitedNations must now also place upon its active agenda thequestion of development and tackle it with the seriousnessit deserves. We have striven in this Organization to link theenvironment  human rights  democracy and humanitarianrelief with development. It is time we realized thatpeace-keeping and peacemaking can be carried outefficiently  and the problems that generate conflicts can beresolved  only if we promote the issue of development withvigour. And this can be done if the United Nations insistson a more just  equitable and transparent world economicsystem that will confer the means for development on allnations. The task of eradicating global poverty must receivethe same attention  concentration and energetic action as aregiven to peace-keeping and peacemaking.The democratization process  which is part of the effortto promote and uphold human rights  should not be limitedto the national level. The full implementation of theprinciples of democracy within the family of nations shouldalso be one of our central concerns. It is in this context thatwe seek the revitalization of the General Assembly  wherethe sovereign equality of Member States finds fullexpression. We look forward to the General Assembly’splaying its full role in the maintenance of international peaceand security as required by the Charter. We also welcomethe initiative of the Security Council to make its work including its decision-making process  more transparent.Such transparency will obviously enhance the legitimacy ofits decisions and  equally importantly  reflect the fact that itis the Members of the Organization which  under Article 24 confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for themaintenance of international peace and security  and that indischarging its functions the Security Council acts on theirbehalf.My delegation sees no need to go over the case  whichhas already been well established  for the reform of theSecurity Council. Suffice it to say that  whatever the finalform of a restructured Security Council  it is clear that itsreform should be based on the principle of the sovereignequality of Member States and the clear24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionrecognition that the Security Council acts on behalf of theMembers of the Organization and should reflect theuniversality of our Organization. The Ghana delegation isready to participate in the search for a more legitimate andeffective Security Council.We welcome the commitment made byPresident Clinton to ensure the payment of contributions duefrom the United States in respect of peace-keepingoperations. It is to be hoped that in the years to come theUnited States  which pays a substantial portion of the UnitedNations budget  regular and peace-keeping  will continue toabide by this commitment and also address the question ofoutstanding contributions to the regular budget.It is the hope of Ghana that this session will mark thebeginning of the renaissance of the United Nations  ready tocollectively commit itself to the pursuit of the objectives ofour Organization as reflected in the principles and purposesof the Charter."
"62",2652,"GIN",48,1993," Iam delighted to be addressing the General Assembly as thepeople of Guinea commemorate a historic date: 28September 1958  the day on which Guinea  by a unanimousvote  chose national independence and sovereignty  thusaccelerating the process of liberation of the African peoples.It will be easy  then  to understand the pride andpleasure I take on this anniversary in conveying a messageof peace and friendship from the people of Guinea and fromtheir President  General Lansana Conté.I join previous speakers in congratulating AmbassadorInsanally on his dazzling election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I wish also to assurehim of my delegation’s complete support as he carries outhis responsible tasks. His personal qualities  his wealth ofexperience and the valuable assistance of his fellow-officers -whom I also congratulate - bode well for the success of ourwork.I wish also to convey to the President of the Assemblyat its forty-seventh session  His Excellency Mr. StoyanGanev of Bulgaria  my great appreciation for the skill anddedication with which he guided the work of that session.Finally  my delegation highly appreciates thepraiseworthy efforts made by the Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who has workedtirelessly to build and maintain peace in the face of all theobstacles in his way.The independence of the sister republic of Eritrea andits admission to membership of the Organization were asource of great relief for its people and of genuinesatisfaction for the international community. I welcomeEritrea and wish it great success in its difficult task ofnational reconstruction.I welcome the admission of Eritrea  and that of theCzech Republic  Slovakia and the Principalities of Monacoand Andorra; this confirms the increasingly universalcharacter of our Organization.The end of the cold war radically changed worldgeopolitics through a rapid series of often unforeseeableevents. While it is possible to believe that the threat of aglobal conflagration has been lifted  we note with dismay theproliferation and exacerbation of armed conflicts that arecausing immense loss of life  great destruction ofinfrastructure and property  and severe suffering amongcivilians suffering the agony of exile  famine and sickness.What a paradox! On the one hand  the internationalcommunity is making intense efforts to prevent or containarmed conflicts  and on the other hand international actionis not being provided with the resources it needs to eliminatethe causes and the manifestations of those conflicts. That isa salient feature of today’s international relations.Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 33In short  more resources are needed to restore worldpeace.None the less  it is reassuring that recent history hasfavoured the renaissance of the United Nations; thanks tochanged attitudes and perceptions  the Organization has trulybecome the guarantor of peace at a difficult moment ininternational relations.The positive trends that we have seen here and there infinding solutions to political problems ought to havepromoted an improvement in the economic and socialsituation in many countries. However  in most developingcountries  that situation has instead deteriorated seriously.The increase in the number of international forums debatingdevelopment programmes has unfortunately not made itpossible to reverse the trend towards the imbalances that Ihave mentioned.Today  world savings are under severe pressure. Whatis happening is that the supply of capital for development isinadequate relative to the ever-increasing demand from theAfrican countries  especially if we take into account the newneeds of the Eastern countries  which are in the throes oftransition. The world economic crisis is still going on; it isaggravating the disparities and the already precariousconditions for development being experience by the thirdworld countries.For Africa  this crisis has been heightened by droughtand desertification  by the stagnation - for which  readreduction - in official development assistance  by thedeterioration in terms of trade and its corollary  the markeddrop in export earnings  by the counter-productive effects ofstructural adjustment programmes and by the external debtburden.Allow me to place a particular emphasis on this lastissue. Members will recall that the seriousness of theindebtedness problem led the African Heads of State orGovernment to propose holding a special summit on Africandebt. This problem is today still as widespread and as acuteas it was before  despite the relief measures undertaken bysome creditors. The international community must bepersuaded of the fact that so long as the question ofindebtedness is not studied in a global  concerted manner the socio-economic development programmes of the thirdworld will be put in jeopardy as a result.The lack of resources for development has as itscorollary the mass exodus from the countries of the South tothe countries of the North; indeed  the only viable solutionto this migratory phenomenon lies in economic recovery inthe countries of the South.Environmental problems - the relationship between manand his environment - have in recent years quite rightly beena major concern of the international community. Do I needto stress the fact that man  through his nature-destroyingactivities  has heightened the progressive degradation of ourworld to the point where the alarm bells we hear today aresounding?In the past  man was essentially a passive spectator ofthe natural wear and tear on the ecological system. Todayhe has become the main player in the destruction of thenatural environment through the combined effects of theinappropriate design and implementation of a number ofprogrammes  through the improper use of science andtechnology and as a result of runaway population growth.In contrast  real development must also embraceprotection of the environment and the ecological balance.This is precisely why my delegation is emphasizing the needfor follow-up to the decisions in the Rio Declaration andAgenda 21. Environmental protection is a commonresponsibility; all nations must contribute to it.Environmental damage  whether man-made or from naturalcauses  spares no region on Earth.My country  which used to enjoy good rainfall and wascalled the watershed of Western Africa  is concerned to seeits rainfall and the rate of flow of its natural watercoursesdiminish. This is why my Government is interested - inmore than one sense - in the negotiations that are takingplace within the high-level Commission on SustainableDevelopment on drafting an international convention tocombat desertification and drought in the countries that arebeing seriously affected.The persistence of a number of political crises including those in southern Africa  Somalia  Liberia  Bosniaand Herzegovina and elsewhere  is a threat to the peace andsecurity of mankind.Fortunately  there is positive progress in South Africa where a clear awareness appears to have taken holdconcerning the vital need to build a democratic and multi-racial society. The establishment of a Transitional ExecutiveCouncil  as well as the demonstrations for peace by civiliansociety and a certain degree of political awareness  are causefor optimism  despite some reluctance.34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThis remarkable improvement in the political climate which has been achieved  inter alia  as a result of the spiritof compromise shown by the various political players  makesit possible  in my delegation’s opinion  for the economicsanctions against South Africa to be lifted  as presidentNelson Mandela of the African National Congress himselfhas requested.That being the case  there is reason for greatsatisfaction in the activities of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) which  through its observer missions and itsAd Hoc Committee on Southern Africa  has contributedgreatly  in collaboration with the United Nations  to thepeaceful change that has taken place in South Africa.In Angola  after lighting a glimmer of hope  the processof national reconciliation seems to be blocked by theincreased fighting resulting from UNITA’s intransigence.But only observance by the parties of the Bicesse Accordsand of the election results will allow the Angolan people toregain peace and security. The Security Council’s decisionon 15 September 1993 recommending the application ofsanctions against UNITA must be strengthened andimplemented strictly  because only constant firmness withUNITA and its leader will make it possible to put an end tothis painful civil war that is sowing death and destruction.With regard to the Western Sahara  the partiesconcerned must cooperate with the Secretary-General andwith all willing parties in order to implement the peace plan which is vital for there to be a happy ending to this crisis.For almost four years now  Liberia has been the theatrefor one of the bloodiest civil wars on our continent. Therefusal by some of the parties to the conflict to compromisehas caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of peopleand considerable material destruction  not to mention themassive outpouring of refugees and displaced persons  inparticular into neighbouring countries  including my own which is at present harbouring some 600 000.However  it is a source of comfort to note that thenegotiations held in July 1993 in Geneva  under the jointauspices of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) and the United Nations  with the supportof OAU  have made it possible to involve the various partiesto the conflict in constructive dialogue  the only way offinding a lasting solution to this dreadful crisis.The signing by the parties concerned of the GenevaAccord under the auspices of ECOWAS on 25 July 1993 atCotonou means  I hope  that conditions have now beencreated for a definitive return of peace and stability to thiscountry and to the subregion. But let there be no mistake:to achieve lasting peace  the expansion of the ECOWASMonitoring Group to include African troops from outsideECOWAS  strengthened by the presence of internationalobservers  is one of the guarantees to bring about the processof assembling troops  disarming the belligerents and holdingdemocratic elections in order to achieve a return to normalconstitutional life.The Somali conflict is becoming ever more tragic. Theinternational community must undertake joint  effectiveaction. In order to achieve a rapid political solution  it isessential to halt the sudden escalations that are complicatingthe situation in Somalia. The United Nations must resumeits peaceful calling in the face of the many acts of violencethat are trying both the Blue Helmets and the Somalipopulation.The Security Council must decide on a new strategy ifthe last obstacles in the way of pacification are to beovercome and if the mission entrusted to the United NationsOperation in Somalia is to succeed. My Government callson all parties to the conflict in Somalia to make theircontribution to the success of the political process now underway towards the restoration of peace and security in fraternalSomalia.In the Middle East  after a period of hatred  turbulenceand hesitation  the parties to the conflict are movingprogressively towards lasting peace.The signing on 13 September in Washington of theagreement on autonomy for Jericho and Gaza  marking themutual recognition of the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO) and Israel  resulted from the courageand political realism of the two parties. Guinea  as amember of the Committee on the Exercise of the InalienableRights of the Palestinian People  welcomes this happy turnof events.For my country peaceful coexistence between the Stateof Israel and the Palestinian State  under the leadership ofthe PLO  must be a constant. After Jericho and Gaza  theliberation of all the other territories would then promote theconsolidation of relations between the two communities.The march towards global peace in this very sensitiveregion is to be encouraged and supported by assistance fromthe international community  with a view to the socio-economic development of the Palestinian State.Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 35In the Gulf  in order to prevent a new confrontation theinternational community must ensure that Kuwait and Iraqrespect the conclusions of the Boundary DemarcationCommission  which by Security Council resolution 833(1993) laid down definitively secure and inviolable bordersbetween these two countries.The relaxation of tension in Cambodia resulting fromthe success of the elections is putting an end to the longyears of martyrdom endured by the Cambodian people.There is reason to be happy over the positive results of theefforts by the international community in this area. Respectfor the Paris Agreements will be the guarantee of lastingpeace and will facilitate the work of national reconstructionin that country.With regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina  the scale oforganized killings for irrational reasons  such as ""ethniccleansing"" and religion  and the prolongation of the conflicthighlight the divisions in this nation - which until recentlywas strong and united - caused by the end of the cold war.After many efforts  the three communities involved inthe conflict have still not achieved a stable peace.Unfortunately  the law of the jungle continues to prevail inthe face of the impotence of some and the indifference ofothers. There will be true security and lasting peace inBosnia and Herzegovina only after serious negotiationsguaranteed by the international community in general and bythe States of the subregion in particular.With regard to the Korean peninsula  the internationalcommunity must support the peaceful reunification of thetwo States there.Africa  like other parts of the world  is at an importantmoment in its history  a time of the democratization of itssociety and its institutions. The success of this process ofqualitative change requires  none the less  taking into accountthe historic  social and cultural realities of States in order togenerate harmonious and lasting development.The Republic of Guinea has taken important steps alongthis road. Its achievements include ratification of themajority of the African and international Conventions onhuman rights and humanitarian law; the adoption of the basiclaw in our country which calls for a presidential regime separation of powers  the primacy of law  political pluralismand decentralization; the establishment of a Supreme Courtto ensure  among other matters  that there are noirregularities in balloting; the entry into operation of theNational Communication Council  whose job it is to ensurethe freedom of the press and free and equal access by allpolitical parties to State communications media; and thedetermination of the Government to organize just and openelections. The presidential balloting will take place on5 December next  to be followed by elections to thelegislature.In our view  these efforts at democratization in Guinea as in most other African countries  should have increasedsupport from development partners to guarantee theirsuccess.The convening of a series of international conferencesin 1994 and 1995  particularly those regarding population women and social development  confirm the interest of theinternational community in improving the economic andsocial situation of the most vulnerable sectors of ourpopulations. The same is true of their participation indevelopment.The year 1993 has seen the international communitytake a more active interest in the emergence of an era ofpeace and universal respect for human rights.Two conferences testify to that. Last June in Vienna and more recently in Geneva  we gathered together to think to evaluate what has been done  to consider prospects for thefuture  in order to eliminate the causes of suffering  and toreaffirm our faith in the dignity of the human being.None the less  the absence of international machineryfor the prevention and punishment of serious violations ofhuman rights makes any protection measures ineffective.My Government therefore considers that the creation of apermanent international court with penal powers would be animportant step in the protection and promotion of humanrights.Such a jurisdiction  by making inevitable thepunishment of the perpetrators of such violations  wouldmake existing international law more effective.However  we must eliminate from international affairsany tendency to be selective with regard to human rights  inthe form of discrimination over which cases should bedenounced or over the sanctions that should be applied.Moreover  the existing link between human rights andother aspects of social development requires the elaborationof national programmes capable of promoting: protection ofthe family  which is considered to be the basic unit of36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionsociety; the integration of women into development and theirparticipation in the management of public affairs; theprotection of vulnerable categories of people - children  theaged and the handicapped - by establishing conditionsfavourable to the development of their personalities; andefforts to combat the production  consumption and illicittrafficking in drugs and psychotropic substances throughinternational cooperation  harmonization of nationallegislation and ratification of existing internationalConventions.Along with these measures  effective strategies must beevolved to combat the pandemic of AIDS  which  because ofits ravages  is a great scourge and a threat to mankind’ssurvival.The progress achieved in disarmament must be pursuedin the hope that the resources thus released will contributeto the recovery of the world economy.In his report on the work of the United Nations and invarious communications the Secretary-General has describedthe Organization’s financial situation as being a matter ofgreat concern. The situation is paradoxical. At a time whenthe United Nations is entrusted with new tasks to be carriedout in the service of peace and development the vitalresources needed for those tasks are diminishing. We paytribute to the Secretary-General and to encourage him inapplying austerity measures and in restructuring to increasethe effectiveness of the United Nations system.My delegation strongly urges Member States to honourtheir financial obligations by paying regularly and on timetheir assessed contributions in order to ensure thefunctioning of the United Nations and allow it to play itsrole effectively.I hope that the message I have just delivered is one ofpersistence and hope. This message  based on the realitiesof the changes in the post-cold-war world and the divisionsthose changes have caused in some parts of the world  urgesthe Organization to implement new and dynamic strategieswith a view to establishing a new world order based onequality  justice  peace  cooperation and respect fordemocratic values.This persistence demands sustained efforts todemocratize international relations. The mode of operationand structure of some bodies in the United Nations systemmust be revised; the decision-making bodies must bestreamlined and have an equitable representation of Statesand regions.This persistence is the basis of our hope  a hope ofmastering our collective future on the threshold of thetwenty-first century  a hope that all people will movetogether towards peace  the development of nations and thepromotion of human rights. Our collective survival dependson our solidarity and the effectiveness of our actions totransform that hope into a reality in international relations."
"63",2691,"GMB",48,1993,"May I at the outset congratulateAmbassador Insanally on his unanimous election asPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.His long and rich experience makes him suitably qualifiedto preside over this session.

I should like to extend  on behalf of the Gambia andon my own behalf  sincere congratulations to Eritrea  thePrincipality of Andorra and the Principality of Monaco ontheir admission as Members of the United Nations. It is ourfervent hope that they will not only be able to realize theirnational aspirations but also contribute to the positivefulfilment of mankind’s hope for a better world.It was with deep shock and sorrow that we learned ofthe devastating earthquake in parts of India. In thisconnection  I should like to convey the heartfelt condolencesof the Government of the Gambia to the Government ofIndia and the members of the bereaved families on theoccasion of this catastrophe. We also commend the laudableefforts of the Government of India in coping with thismassive disaster.We are meeting this year against the background ofrenewed hope  following the significant developments in theMiddle East and South Africa. Until recently  the Middle -East crisis and the situation in South Africa posed a realthreat to international peace and security. Today  however it can be said with a high degree of certainty that in bothcases the peace process is irreversible.The other notable event of major internationalsignificance has been the World Conference on HumanRights held in Vienna last June. Coming soon after the endof the cold war and 25 years after the first InternationalConference on Human Rights  this year’s World Conference16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionon Human Rights reflected the hopes and aspirations ofteeming millions of human beings seeking new solutions readjustments  changes and improvements to their conditions.In many ways  the World Conference on Human Rightssymbolized the end of one era and the beginning of a newone with regard to the promotion and consolidation of astrong human-rights culture world-wide.For us in the Gambia  the convening of the WorldConference on Human Rights was a refreshing experience given our long-established tradition in the protection andpromotion of human rights. The Conference enabled us tostrengthen our resolve to continue to uphold these much-cherished values.In reviewing the outcome of the World Conference onHuman Rights  my delegation is pleased with the adoptionof the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action  whichwill serve as a human-rights blueprint for the next century.I would urge the Assembly to consider and approve thedocument. We regret  however  the failure of theConference to agree on the setting up of the office of highcommissioner for human rights. My Government continuesto give its strong support to this proposal  as we areconvinced that the office  if created  would facilitate greatercoordination of United Nations efforts and provide a moreprompt and effective response to critical cases of grossviolations.The issue of human rights  however  needs to beaddressed fully in all its composite parts. Political and civilrights go hand in hand with economic  social and culturalrights. Such problems as poverty  hunger  and illiteracy thathave characterized developing countries constitute a seriousthreat to stability and respect for political rights in thesecountries. As my President  Sir Dawda Jawara stated at theConference in Vienna in respect of political rights and theright to development ""We need to remind ourselves of the indivisibility andthe interdependence of both rights and the necessity ofgiving equal attention and urgent consideration to both"".It is saddening to note that at a time when suchinternationally recognized values as democracy  human rightsand rule of law are becoming the order of the day almosteverywhere  some seemingly intractable conflicts in otherparts of the world threaten to turn back the hands of time.The situation in Somalia  which appeared to haveimproved only about a year ago  has suddenly deteriorated generating cause for serious concern. My delegation isparticularly alarmed by the dramatic turn of events resultingin the deaths of some members of the United Nations peace-keeping force and also of some Somalis. To the families ofall these fallen servicemen and those of other innocentvictims of the Somali conflict  we extend our heartfeltcondolences. We very much regret these unfortunateincidents  but they should  no matter how tragic  neitherdampen the enthusiasm nor weaken the resolve of theinternational community to assist the Somalis in their searchfor lasting peace and stability. Let us not forget now  in theheat of the moment  the very positive achievements of theintervention  which has made it possible to distribute foodamong a population that was suffering from one of the mosthorrendous forms of famine.In the present circumstances the need for general andcomplete disarmament of all factions cannot beoveremphasized  and this must be pursued with renewedvigour. I should like to appeal to the United Nations and  inparticular  to the United States of America and all thoseother countries that have agreed to send troops to Somalia tocontinue their assistance so that peace and security canreturn to this troubled land.We call on all the parties to the conflict to cooperatefully  to respect all the relevant Security Council resolutionsand to implement without any further delay the Addis Ababaaccord aimed at achieving national reconciliation.The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina alsoconstitutes a major preoccupation of the internationalcommunity. Recent efforts to establish a credible and lastingpeace in the country have yet to bear fruit. The failure  sofar  to resolve the conflict and the persistent disregard ofSecurity Council resolutions - in particular  resolution 713 (1991) -make the situation even more desperate. The Gambiadeplores the continued Serbian aggression against theRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It deplores theacquisition of territory by force  by means of the heinouspractice of ""ethnic cleansing"" and other war crimes. Mydelegation is firmly of the view that if the internationalcommunity is unwilling or unable to protect the defencelessMuslim population against Serbian aggression  it must begiven the opportunity to defend itself in accordance withArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter  which recognizesthat peoples must be able to exercise their right ofself-defence. We welcome the establishment of aninternational war crimes tribunal as a fitting response to theatrocities perpetrated in Bosnia and Herzegovina.In Angola  the fighting continues with unprecedentedintensity and ferocity. We condemn the naked and brutalForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 17aggression by UNITA against the Government and people ofAngola. The people of Angola  through the democraticprocess - whose principles are the very ones we have beenproclaiming in this Hall - have given their verdict. Theirdecision must be respected  and the international communityshould provide all necessary support for action against anyforce that seeks to disregard or overturn it. We thereforewelcome the recent decision of the Security Council toimpose sanctions on UNITA.This year - 1993 - has not been one just of conflict turmoil and bloodshed. Very notable successes have beenachieved in mankind’s search for peace  and these augurwell for the future.With the conclusion of the Cotonou Peace Accord andthe installation of a five-man Council of State to lead Liberiato democratic elections after six months  there is renewedhope of a peaceful and lasting solution to the Liberianconflict. We welcome the contribution of the Governmentof the United States of America to the United Nations TrustFund  and we call on all other donor countries to contributesimilarly so that additional peace-keeping forces may bespeedily deployed in Liberia to ensure full implementationof the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) peace agreement.With respect to South Africa  there are now clearindications that the peace process is on track and that changeis irreversible. My delegation welcomes the agreementreached in the multi-party negotiating forum to set up aTransitional Executive Council  following agreement on thedate of the first non-racial  democratic elections.In this connection  we fully support the recent appeal ofthe President of the African National Congress (ANC) Mr. Nelson Mandela  that sanctions be lifted. The removalof sanctions would send to all parties a strong  positivesignal that the rest of the international community will notbe found wanting in support and encouragement for thedifficult transition to a non-racial and democratic society.However  we regret the recurrence of violence  which  if itis not addressed satisfactorily  may have seriousrepercussions for the transitional arrangements. Wetherefore call on the South African authorities to redoubletheir efforts to stem the rising tide of political violence.The recent breakthrough in the Middle East talks evidenced by the deal between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) granting limited autonomy tothe Palestinians in Gaza and in the city of Jericho  is a mostwelcome development. It constitutes a major step in thequest for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. Weextend our heartfelt congratulations to those in the leadershipof the two parties for their courage and foresight in makingeven this limited success possible in a land oftencharacterized by hate  mistrust and destruction. It is truethat much remains to be done  but we are optimistic that themomentum generated by the Israeli-PLO agreement will besustained and expanded to enable all parties to the conflictto strengthen their resolve in the search for a comprehensiveand durable solution in accordance with Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).While the recent developments between Israel and itsArab neighbours provide ground for much optimism  thesituation between Kuwait and Iraq has failed to registersimilar progress. I call on the Government of Iraq tocomply fully with United Nations resolutions and  inparticular  to ensure the early release of Kuwaiti and otherprisoners.We have followed with keen interest the successfulconduct by the United Nations of elections in Cambodia.We congratulate the Secretary-General and his staff  as wellas all the countries that helped to bring stability back toCambodia. We hope that the lessons of this exercise will beconsolidated and will be applied to other trouble spots thatmay require the assistance of the United Nations.The threat to world peace and stability emanates notonly from armed conflicts but also from socio-economicfactors. The global economic recession has led to worseningeconomic and social problems. Among the pressingeconomic difficulties that continue to face the developingcountries is the problem of external debt servicing  which isone of the major obstacles to development. In sub-SaharanAfrica  the debt stock has increased to $185 billion -equivalent to 110 per cent of that region’s gross domesticproduct. As of today  one third of Africa’s total exportearning is paid to the developed countries in the North toservice its debts. This situation cannot be allowed tocontinue. More than ever before  there is a need for aconcerted and innovative international effort to find apermanent solution to the problem. It is our view that theinternational community - particularly the industrializedcountries - has not given this problem the level of attentionit deserves.While Africa’s indebtedness has continued unabated  itsproduction output  in both agriculture and industry  hascontinued to decline. The combined negative effect isaggravated by serious inflation  which has contributed to asteep decline in domestic savings and investment.18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe international community’s commitment tosustainable development in Africa can best be enhanced byencouraging increased direct foreign investment  as well asan increased international transfer of financial resources tothe region. This is crucial to any long-term improvement inAfrica’s economic situation.I should add that the removal of unfair trade practiceswould go a long way towards eliminating the need for aid.This is why we are anxious to see an early conclusion of theUruguay Round  which we hope will address the thornyissue of market access  as this is of major concern todeveloping countries.Finally on this issue we call on the United Nations toprovide the necessary support for the successful implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Developmentof Africa in the 1990s and the work of the United NationsInter-Agency Task Force on African Economic Recoveryand Development.We welcome the initiative of the Japanese Governmentin convening the Tokyo International Conference on AfricanDevelopment and hope it will contribute to the mobilizationof financial and technological resources much needed toensure Africa’s development.In translating the spirit of Rio de Janeiro into action the Gambia has already launched its Environmental ActionPlan in order to address the serious environmental problemsfacing the country. Coming from a Sahelian country weremain particularly concerned about the continuous threatposed by drought and human actions to our fragileecosystem. We welcome the setting up of theIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee and thecommencement of the negotiation process for the drawing upof an international convention to combat drought anddesertification particularly in Africa. The Gambia willcontinue to give full support to this Committee.The success of our efforts to implement Agenda 21 andother programmes approved in Rio and adopted by theGeneral Assembly will depend to a very large extent on theavailability of funds and the commitment of our partners toshare resources and encourage technology transfer to forgea truly global partnership between developed and developingcountries in sustainable development.In this connection we share the view that the GlobalEnvironment Facility (GEF) should be restructured to allowfor the increased participation of developing countries in allits activities as well as for inclusion of desertification as oneof the areas eligible for GEF funding. It is hoped that inphase II of the GEF there will be an expanded financial baseto allow for greater and more rational disbursements.It has now become established practice to convenesummit meetings on issues of major concern to humanity.These summits provide an opportunity to arrive at acollective decision at the highest level on ways and meansof resolving these difficulties. It is in this light that wewelcome the World Conference on Population andDevelopment and the World Summit for Social Developmentto be convened in 1995.As we move closer to the end of this century  so is theUnited Nations moving closer to its fiftieth anniversary signalling the maturity of our thoughts and the wisdom ofour actions in seeking global peace and security. As theprimary role of the United Nations is the maintenance ofworld peace and security  it becomes imperative in thispost-cold-war era to prepare the world body to carry out itsmandate as stipulated in its Charter  taking into account theprevailing international political climate.In this connection my delegation notes with keeninterest the restructuring and revitalization of the UnitedNations. We welcome efforts to streamline and rationalizethe work of the General Assembly at the level of both theplenary Assembly and the Main Committees. These efforts it is hoped  will strengthen the decision-making role of theGeneral Assembly and enhance its effectiveness andefficiency as the largest and most important organ of theUnited Nations system. Furthermore  the relationshipbetween the General Assembly and the Security Councilshould be redefined and better coordinated.As regards the reorganization of the Security Council efforts should be made to ensure transparency in its workand activities. The Gambia would support any proposals forthe reorganization of the Security Council on the basis ofequitable geographical representation.I wish to conclude by again expressing our faith in thecapacity of the United Nations  strengthened in its authorityand credibility  to face the many challenges that lie ahead."
"64",2731,"GNB",48,1993,"Allow me at the outset  Sir  to offer you my warmestcongratulations on your well-deserved election to thepresidency of the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations. Your presence at the headof this Assembly clearly attests to the commitment of yourcountry - Guyana - to the defence of peace and thepromotion of multilateral diplomacy. Your skills and yourexperience on the international scene  acquired over manyyears  will  we are certain  ensure the successful conclusionof our deliberations. My country  Guinea-Bissau  wishes toassure you of our fullest readiness to cooperate with you.Our congratulations and thanks go to your predecessor His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev  for the remarkable andconstructive job he did in steering the work of the forty-seventh session. We wish also to express our gratitude toHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  for the way in which he isdirecting the work of the Organization in this new context.We hail the advent of new Members to the great familyof the United Nations: Andorra  Monaco  Eritrea  the CzechRepublic  Slovakia and The Former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia.I am particularly honoured to have the privilege ofspeaking on behalf of my country  Guinea-Bissau  at theforty-eighth session of the General Assembly at a time whenan increased worldwide consensus seems to be emerging  inthat significant and encouraging changes are taking place inthe global political and economic landscape.How many questions  expectations and  indeed  howmuch skepticism underlie that assertion?The end of the bipolar domination of internationalrelations and the cessation of the cold war  which affectedall continents  constitute an event that is of manifest politicalsignificance and of great historical impact - first  because ithas led to the dismantling of an international order thatprevailed for half a century and divided the world intohostile blocs; secondly  because it has cleared a space for thedevelopment of certain processes whose free evolution wasimpeded because of the political discipline imposed  withineach bloc  by the demands of the conflicts between the twosuper-Powers.The world power pattern has changed. This has led toa shift in certain countries’ relative positions in the economicand political hierarchy. The very nature of the relationsbetween these countries is changing. However  the rules andpractices that will constitute the basis of the newinternational order have not yet been defined.As happens in periods of history marked by greatchanges - especially unpredictable changes - we are nowwitnessing the emergence of factors that give rise to bothintegration and disintegration  to the order and disorder thatare alternating in international behaviour and in the conductof international affairs. The new and old orders are fightingfor primacy in the development of an international system and it is no longer easy to distinguish between the past andthe future.The new international context gives rise to considerableanxiety  especially as it poses several questions that have notyet been answered. For example  it is not clear howpolitical hegemony can be exercised in a system that hasbecome multipolar; strong tendencies towards globalizationand towards regionalization are emerging on the internationalscene  and one wonders how these can be reconciled; thenation State’s decision-making capacity is limited bytransnational players  and its prerogatives of sovereignty arebeing ceded in order that it may be incorporated into broaderpolitical and economic entities  even as ancient ethnic groupsare claiming the right to be regarded as nation States; onesees increasing capitalist competition in a situation in whicheconomic interdependence imposes new parameters for thesettlement of conflicts of interest; one is witnessing a world-wide heightening of awareness of the responsibility of us allwith regard to ecological matters  and  at the same time  onehas to deal with the means of sharing responsibility betweenthe various countries.This is hardly an exhaustive list  but it is sufficient todemonstrate the extent to which the international agenda isbeing broadened and made more complicated. The future ofmany countries will depend on the items on that agenda andon our capacity to organize our approach to them.Given this situation  it is absolutely vital that the closestpossible contact between nations be maintained by means ofthe exchange of information  joint thinking and discussion so that awareness of the changes that are under way and oftheir possible impact on a continent such as Africa may bedeepened.At the beginning of my statement  I mentioned theemergence of a universal consensus that has stemmed formthe changes in the international system. The wide prospectsthat have opened up  in terms of the peaceful settlement ofconflicts and the elimination of tension in regions such assouthern Africa  western Africa  the Maghreb  CentralEurope  Eastern Europe and Asia  lead us to believe that thisprocess  which is marked by the strong resolve of theinternational community to achieve lasting peace  will notturn out to be a short-term symptom of a world in upheaval.The situation prevailing in Angola is still a matter ofmajor concern to Guinea-Bissau. My Government welcomesthe unanimous adoption  by the Security Council of theUnited Nations  of resolution 864 (1993)  which is a logicalfollow-up to earlier resolutions that aim at the restoration ofpeace to Angola. We are convinced that only dialogue canlead to a lasting solution that will result in the return ofpeace to that country. The parties to the conflict shouldcomply in full with the obligations resulting from theagreements that have been signed and from the SecurityCouncil resolutions. This is the only possible way to endthe suffering of the Angolan people and to respond to theirlegitimate desire for peace and democracy.With regard to Mozambique  we should like to expressour concern at the slowness with which the PeaceAgreement is being implemented. We encourage the partiesconcerned to continue their efforts to strengthen peace andnational unity. Further  we exhort the internationalcommunity to continue its support for that process.In South Africa  the abolition of the legislative pillarsof apartheid is a positive step. It is now important that thelast obstacles  including those caused by the climate ofviolence  be removed to make possible negotiations towardsthe creation of a non-racial and democratic South Africa.We have welcomed with satisfaction President Nelson Mandela’s appeal concerning the lifting ofsanctions against South Africa.The tragedy that  daily  besets the Somali people givesus reason for great anxiety. We urge all the partiesconcerned to end the hostilities and to commit themselves tonegotiation. We are convinced that the peace-keepingactivities in Somalia  within the framework of the UnitedNations Operation in Somalia (UNISOM II)  should  aboveall  serve the interests of the Somali people and strengthenthe fragile process of national reconciliation that is underway.We happily welcome the positive developments inLiberia - in particular  the signing  at Cotonou  of the PeaceAgreement  including the provision for the establishment ofa central transitional Government. However  we regret thewidespread adverse effects the Liberian war has had on theterritory of neighbouring countries. We express the hopethat all the protagonists on the Liberian political scene willpersevere in the consolidation of peace by making everyeffort towards reconstruction of their country.In the Maghreb  the constructive position taken by theKingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front makes itpossible to be optimistic about developments in the situationForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 3in Western Sahara and about the prospects for organizing areferendum under United Nations auspices.Guinea-Bissau watches with concern the conflict that islaying waste the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Webelieve that only an agreement acceptable to all partiesinvolved in the conflict will put an end to this bloodyepisode. My Government regrets that the latest Geneva talkson peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina did not yield theexpected results. We hope that the parties will adopt moreflexible positions with a view to bringing about the signingof a peace agreement.Guinea-Bissau believes that the solution to thisfratricidal conflict must be sought by peaceful means. Thatis why we continue to support the United Nations and theEuropean Community’s negotiating effort and welcome theSecurity Council’s adoption of resolution 827 (1993) on theestablishment of an International Tribunal.In the case of East Timor  we urge the Secretary-General to continue his efforts with the parties concernedaimed at finding a peaceful  negotiated solution to this issue.In the Middle East  peace is now possible thanks to therapprochement between Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization. We greet the Washington agreement withsatisfaction and renewed hope. We encourage the parties tocontinue negotiations with a view to establishing a lastingpeace throughout the region.The reunification of China is in essence the soleconcern of the Chinese people. In our opinion  theinternational community should turn its attention to the needto recognize the fundamental rights of the 21 millioninhabitants of the Republic of China.The poverty and social injustice that are the sorry lot ofa large portion of humankind are amongst the underlyingcauses of the conflicts that constantly threaten the world’speace and stability. The ideological tensions of the cold warseem likely to be replaced by new tensions  this timeeconomic in origin  if adequate precautions are not taken.The United Nations must of course strengthen its structurefor maintaining world peace and security  but it must alsoplay a leading role in helping to build a stable economicsystem and promoting the development of the developingcountries  particularly that of the least developed countries.This is without question the best and most effective form ofpreventive diplomacy.The economic situation in Africa is becoming more andmore worrying. Today  on the eve of the twenty-firstcentury  incomes in sub-Saharan Africa average $490 perperson per year  in other words  they are the lowest in theworld. The average figure masks great disparities betweencountries: Africa is the only region in the world where thenumber of people living in poverty is likely to increasemarkedly before the year 2000. Trends in the worldeconomy lead us to predict that the situation will get worse.Black Africa’s share of world trade has plummetedfrom 3.8 per cent in 1970 to 1 per cent now  which hasentailed Africa’s being relegated to the sidelines ininternational relations. Despite plentiful labour andinvestment opportunities  direct investment from the mostindustrialized countries is in flight from the least developedcountries towards the advanced economies. Sub-SaharanAfrica receives about 6 per cent of direct investment  whichis profitable essentially for those few countries with oiland/or strategically important minerals.Restrictions on international trade as a result of variousprotectionist practices and of subsidy policies for theindustrialized countries’ agricultural products are imposingsevere limitations on the underdeveloped countries’ exportopportunities. In this regard  can we hope that the UruguayRound negotiations  if they succeed  will spare humankindthe possible unpleasant aftermath of discriminatory practiceson the part of the trading blocs?We wish to make an appeal that the next round ofnegotiations be planned to have all the relevance that thesituation requires. In the meanwhile  it is painful for us tosee how those who recommend to us that we shouldliberalize trade if we want to get our economies movingagain can  in the blink of an eye  become fervent defendersof protectionism when they are convinced that they aredefending their own interests that way. Liberal policies inthe countries of the South have not a hope of succeedingunless the countries of the North systematically dismantletheir protectionist barriers and open up their markets.The transition to effective and lasting market economiesrequires further buttressing from the internationalcommunity. Most of the underdeveloped countries particularly in Africa  have recognized the errors that werecommitted in their post-colonial economic management.They have therefore embarked  with the assistance of theinternational financial organizations and other partnersabroad  on radical economic reforms aimed at laying thefoundations for economic growth and development.Enormous political and social costs have had to be borne in4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioncarrying out these reforms  but the will to succeed is stillthere despite all the odds against it.Unfortunately  these efforts have been overwhelmed bythe massive reductions in financial assistance from theindustrialized countries and the multilateral organizations.The target set by the United Nations for official developmentassistance (ODA)  0.7 per cent of gross national product(GNP)  has scarcely been complied with at all. At themoment  only an infinitesimal fraction of ODA is beingallocated to the poorest countries and even less than that tothe priority sectors that are most likely to triggerdevelopment. ODA must be restructured if the problem ofpoverty and lasting development is to be tackled. We musttake the risk and have faith in a renewed Africa with a neweconomic management mind-set.Judging by the number of international conferences andmeetings on Africa that are held each year and the feebleway they make available finance to root out the evils theydeplore so much  we could be right in saying that we live ina real consumer society for intellectual products  that is.People are at last beginning to wake up to the fact that theseinternational meetings  although they sometimes do succeedin making world public opinion aware of one or anotheraspect of underdevelopment  have not contributed very muchat all towards eliminating the great scourge ofunderdevelopment itself.Not only does the way economic and financialopportunities are being distributed throughout the worldprovide the less developed countries with piffling amountsof resources  even worse than that is the way colossalamounts are being clawed back from them  particularlythrough those notorious debt-servicing costs. Total debt asa percentage of GNP stands at over 100 per cent  and debt-servicing costs are over 20 per cent and even 50 per cent insome cases. As a result  several African countries areunable to maintain the infrastructures for production or thesocial services that are vital to development.Traditional approaches to solving the debt problem while they have granted some countries a few months’breathing space  would none the less appear to haveexacerbated the problem  since Africa’s debt burden hasgone on growing  by about 10 per cent over the last decade.This is extremely worrying.How can we allot more financial resources todeveloping our human resources  involving women indevelopment and protecting the environment if at the sametime the donors are mounting pressures to have the debt paidback  operate unfavourable trade policies and cut back theirassistance? My country believes that major steps absolutelymust be taken if we want the low-income countries not tomiss the boat for economic modernization and development.The Trinidad conclusions  which propose canceling twothirds of the eligible debt coupled with a rescheduling of theremainder over 25 years and an additional five-year graceperiod  offer a promising and encouraging approach toeasing the debt burden. However  the Trinidad conclusionsshould also be applied to multilateral debt  which nowaccounts for one third of debt servicing costs.If our planet is to have lasting security  there must bea collective effort to combat the endogenous and exogenousfactors that nowadays condemn the majority of the world’spopulation to absolute poverty. If this poverty persists  itsconsequences will ultimately spill over borders in the formof migration  terrorism  drugs and crime of all kinds.Africa’s economy is worsening to such an extent thatwe must break with routine thinking and devise newinstruments and methods in order to understand and properlyrespond to the needs of a continent which is economically inanguish. Unfortunately  it is clear that technologicaladvances  which should contribute to improving the humanlot everywhere  are actually creating an increasingly greatergulf between those who have mastered that technology andthose who are trying to enter into the technological age. Thedevelopment of science and technology ill-suited to ourneeds is contributing to a reduction in the demand forcommodities and is consequently further worsening the termsof trade.Given all these issues  does this Organization not havea role to play in mitigating the negative effects on the least-developed countries of the rapid globalization of productionand sophisticated technological systems? This is the veryfoundation of the preventive diplomacy that the UnitedNations has advocated.The prospects for development are also threatened bythe staggering pace of the degradation of the environment.The degradation of natural resources and ecosystems posesa major threat to humankind.For Africa  which still depends on natural resources forits survival  this situation involves grave consequences likelyto hamper medium-term economic recovery programmes ifurgent measures are not taken and the appropriate meansmobilized. With national budgets already truncated  Africancountries will find it very difficult to face these challengesunaided in the absence of an increase in internationalForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 5assistance  properly programmed and managed so as toensure the rational development and regulation of theenvironment.The economic difficulties faced by most of thecountries of the South have markedly diminished their abilityto act together and in a coordinated manner. Domesticeconomic challenges  instead of promoting the mobilizationof forces and resources in a regional or subregional context often lead to a tendency by these countries to turn inward.This tendency has been compounded by structural adjustmentprogrammes designed and executed in a strictly nationalcontext  with the aim of upgrading short-term indicators ofmacroeconomic and financial performance. The chances forsustainable development in the developing countries andparticularly in the least-developed countries could beincreased by strengthened programmes of regional andsubregional integration and cooperation.In this respect  we welcome the efforts of the EuropeanEconomic Community  in the framework of the Lomé IVConvention  to lay the foundation for closer economiccooperation between the five Portuguese-speaking countriesof Africa  despite the fact that they are not geographicallycontiguous. In this context  strengthening the ties offriendship and cooperation with Portugal and Brazil willmake it possible to develop a special kind of relationshipbetween these countries  all of which use the Portugueselanguage.It has now been clearly acknowledged that the activeparticipation of peoples in political  economic and social lifeis an essential prerequisite for releasing creative energy andenriching cultural values and people’s ability to take controlof its own destiny. Mindful of this fact  Guinea-Bissau  likeother countries of our continent  has opted for democracy asone of the means to mobilize its full human and physicalpotential in the struggle against underdevelopment. In thisrespect  the appropriate legal and institutional machinery hasbeen established  with a view to promoting a political systembased on consensus and the rule of the majority and on atransparent and effective public administration.The democratic process  to be credible  must mesh withthe socio-cultural heritage of a region or a country.Virtually everywhere in Africa  we are witnessing theemergence of new forces for change which are in thevanguard of democracy: civilian societies  especially free-association and cooperative movements; non-governmentalorganizations; and civic associations.Despite some short-term obstacles  political pluralismin Guinea-Bissau is  without the shadow of a doubt  anirreversible process. One of its stages will culminate in theholding of the first multi-party elections  scheduled for 27March 1994. To ensure the greatest possible transparency inthese elections  the Government is taking all the stepsnecessary to prepare for them  with the support of its foreignpartners. In this context  international observers will beinvited to assist in the organization of the elections  and welook forward to receiving increased support from theinternational community at the appropriate time.Sustained support for these new forces of change isabsolutely vital if we wish to bolster new democracies andexplicitly affirm our commitment to the protection of humanrights.The challenges facing the United Nations in terms ofmaintaining international peace and stability while at thesame time promoting economic and social development in arapidly changing world require that profound changes bemade in its structure. These changes should take intoaccount the interests of all the components. More than ever international cooperation has become an opportunity tocreate lasting peace  to strengthen protection for the dignityof human beings everywhere  and to safeguard the rights profound aspirations and well-being of present and futuregenerations.For its part  Guinea-Bissau  faithful to the principlesenshrined in the United Nations Charter and determined tomake its contribution to the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  solemnly reaffirms its firm commitmentto pursue this course. We are convinced that the task ofmaintaining international peace and security is aresponsibility incumbent on the whole of the internationalcommunity  on all countries large and small  in conformitywith the principle of the sovereign equality of States.It is against this backdrop that my country haspresented its candidacy as a non-permanent member of theSecurity Council  and we ask all Member States to supportus.Guinea-Bissau is admittedly a small country  but itsfirm resolve to contribute to the attainment of the objectivesof this Organization is widely known. Our presence at thistime - in the framework of United Nations Missions - inAngola  Mozambique  Liberia  Cambodia  Haiti and in theformer Yugoslavia  in both the civilian and the militaryspheres  is a clear illustration of this assertion.6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session"
"65",2770,"GNQ",48,1993,"Mr. President  allow me first of all to express  onbehalf of the delegation  Government and people ofEquatorial Guinea  our most sincere congratulations on yourwell-deserved election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session.

Their presence herestrengthens the United Nations vocation towards universality and should contribute to the efforts of the internationalcommunity to maintain peace and promote progress andjustice for all nations.My presence in this world forum should be interpretedas a clear demonstration of the importance that we attach tothe United Nations  its principles and its noble task ofconstantly strengthening the safeguards over the maintenanceof peace and social and economic progress for all peoples.This task is of singular importance to Equatorial Guinea which is engaged in overcoming underdevelopment andachieving dignified standards of living for its people.The common denominator of the many statements thathave been made has been the vast changes that have takenplace in the world since the mid-1980s  a trend towardstransformation the pace of which  far from decreasing  hasaccelerated considerably.With the disappearance of the East-West bipolarstructure  which has been replaced by dialogue andcooperation  we find ourselves - and this is no exaggeration -faced with a new configuration in international relationscharacterized by a certain degree of progress indisarmament  at the global and regional levels  and an easingof some regional conflicts.Equatorial Guinea firmly supports the intensification ofthe work of the United Nations through preventivediplomacy. Measures such as the sending of missions ofinquiry  the use of early-warning systems and thestrengthening of the role of regional and subregionalorganizations can be effective in avoiding conflicts which once they break out  could require subsequent  much morecostly intervention for peace to be restored.Peace-keeping operations have also undergonequalitative change and now cover increasingly variedactivities transcending the traditional sphere. In this respectI should like to underscore the efforts of the United Nationsin many parts of the world in the humanitarian field  inproviding aid to refugees and in monitoring elections.Progress and efforts at the subregional level arecommendable. Hence we support General Assemblyresolution 46/37 B  establishing the Standing AdvisoryCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa  whichis working for peace and confidence-building among theStates of our subregion. As a popular saying goes: ""Anounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."" With thatCommittee we are trying to prevent the emergence ofconflicts in the subregion by developing measures toalleviate situations of conflict.None the less  despite these positive steps andendeavours  at the global level we look to the future with acertain degree of concern because we still see certainpositions that prevent equitable economic relations andimpede developing countries from exercising internationalfree trade. The sound of the machine-gun and the cannon isstill dashing the hopes of many innocent peoples to live inpeace and tranquillity. The present international situation we might say  fluctuates between uneasiness and hope. Wehope that the global changes and the end of the cold warwill bring renewed life to countries of the third world.The industrialized countries must understand the needto resolve  on mutually agreed terms  the external debtproblem of underdeveloped countries. The weight of thatdebt is another serious difficulty standing in the way of theirachieving a better standard of living.My country hopes that the new world scene will beconducive to the implementation of procedures for sincereinternational cooperation for those nations that most needsuch cooperation  countries that are now struggling not justfor a standard of living but for their very survival. Poverty the sad fate of many States in our world  requires that unitedaction be taken by the other States in order to remedy thesituation. The gap between rich and poor is widening at analarming pace; that disparity can not leave the internationalcommunity indifferent. Hence it is necessary to strengthenthe Economic and Social Council and the United NationsConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in orderto meet the new realities.The problem of preserving the environment and thestruggle against illicit drug-trafficking are questions thatrequire our reflection. With the 1992 Stockholm Declarationwe laid the foundations of certain universal principles topreserve the global environment and made efforts to stempollution  desertification and deforestation. But the situationrequired new initiatives  and these culminated in theConference on Environment and Development  held in Riode Janeiro.We hope that these results will have positive effectsoverall and that it will be possible to ensure sustainabledevelopment and the future well-being of mankind.None the less  I wish to emphasize the obligation of thedeveloped countries  which bear the greatest responsibilityfor the deterioration of the global ecosystem  towards thoseother countries that are today being asked to make enormoussacrifices by limiting their legitimate right to use the assetsgiven them by nature. There is a need to seek the necessarycompensation for this situation  in particular by the financingof alternative projects and through technological cooperation.Within its modest economic means my Government hasalways been  and remains  prepared to take action in orderto improve its national environment as a contribution to thetask of preserving the global environment.We condemn the illicit traffic in drugs and are preparedto support any international initiative aimed at itssuppression.The Government of Equatorial Guinea is unflagging inits struggle against the acquired immune deficiencysyndrome (AIDS) pandemic  and it will spare no effort forits effective control  thanks to the deep awareness of ourpeople and the assistance we receive in this connection frominternational organizations.To reflect the noble ideals of peace and justice of thepeople of Equatorial Guinea  my Government has embarkedForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 3on a progressive democratic process that guarantees to everycitizen of the country the exercise of fundamental rights andfreedoms.The firm democratic process begun in the country hasbeen well-received by the people of Equatorial Guinea andby those countries that set aside mere rhetoric and concealedpolitical interests  love Equatorial Guinea and hope that itwill progress. The aspiration of the people and theGovernment of Equatorial Guinea is that our process will becarried through in a climate of national concord withoutupheaval  without disturbances that could threaten the peaceand stability prevailing in the country.That is why  following the massive adoption of the newfundamental law which enshrined our multiparty system  inthe context of Law No. 3 1992 on political parties  thefollowing political organizations have been made legal.First  the Popular Union submitted its application on24 April 1992 and was recognized on 17 October 1992.Second  the Liberal Democratic Convention submittedits application on 1 April 1992 and was recognized on 17October 1992.Third  the Social Democrat Party submitted itsapplication on 8 June 1992 and was recognized on 17October 1992.Fourth  the Progressive Democratic Alliance submittedits application on 9 July 1992 and was recognized on 4September 1992.Fifth  the Social Democratic Union submitted itsapplication on 8 June 1992 and was recognized on 17October 1992.Sixth  the Progress Party submitted its application on18 May 1992 and was recognized on 17 October 1992.Seventh  the Social Democratic and PopularConvergence submitted its application on 18 May 1992 andwas recognized on 5 February 1993.Eighth  the Social Democratic Coalition Party ofEquatorial Guinea submitted its application on 4 November1992 and was recognized on 5 February 1993.Ninth  Convergence for Social Democracy submitted itsapplication on 7 November 1992 and was recognized on5 February 1993.Tenth  the Equatorial Guinea Popular Action submittedits application on 28 December 1992 and was recognized on5 February 1993.Eleventh  the National Democratic Union submitted itsapplication on 29 March 1993 and was recognized on 10May 1993.Twelfth  the Socialist Party of Equatorial Guineasubmitted its application on 23 March 1993 and wasrecognized on 10 May 1993.Thirteenth  the Liberal Party submitted its applicationon 23 March 1993 and was recognized on 12 July 1993.In addition to other provisions  such as the lawguaranteeing freedom of association and freedom todemonstrate  and the law on the right to protest and topetition  the determination of the Government to establishdemocracy peacefully in the country has taken concreteshape in the signing of a document - called the NationalPact - between the Government and the opposition  whichreflects the combined aspirations of all the political forcesand is a channel for ensuring the success of thedemocratization process.Out of our constant desire to give greater politicaltransparency to the process  we have postponed until 21November 1993 the legislative elections originally plannedfor 12 September 1993. We have done so in order to takeinto account and meet the wishes of certain political groups.The political spectrum for the forthcoming generallegislative elections now looks like this: there are politicalparties that have decided to participate in the legislativeelections  political parties that intend to participate in thelegislative elections  and political parties that have not yetdecided whether to participate in the legislative elections.The political parties that have decided to participate inthe legislative elections are: the Democratic Party ofEquatorial Guinea  the Liberal Democratic Convention  theSocial Democratic Union  the Liberal Party and the SocialDemocratic Party. This very morning  my Governmentinformed me that the Party of the Convergence for Socialand People’s Democracy has also decided to participate inthe legislative elections.4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe political parties that have expressed their intentionto participate in the legislative elections are: the ProgressParty  Tomás Boi Cheky Division; and the Social DemocratCoalition Party  Massoko Division.With regard to the political parties that have notdecided whether to participate in the legislative elections  theGovernment of Equatorial Guinea has received no officialnotification of a decision to participate in the legislativeelections of 21 November from the following politicalparties: the Progress Party  Severo Moto Division; theSocial Democratic Convergence; the Progressive DemocraticAlliance; the Social Democrat Coalition Party  BuenaventuraMonsuy Division; People’s Action of Equatorial Guinea; theNational Democratic Union; and the Socialist Party ofEquatorial Guinea.In connection with the revision of the electoral lawproposed by the opposition political parties  on 19 Octoberand 13 and 18 November the Government extended aninvitation to these parties to participate in some meetings but they did not come to the meetings or give any reason fornot doing so.In view of the opposition parties’ inexplicable refusalto participate  and in order to avoid any stagnation in thepolitical democratization process  the Government used itslegislative initiative  under our Basic Law  to adopt a draftlaw  which was sent to the House of Representatives andapproved with amendments by that legislative body. Thetext of the law was approved and promulgated by our Headof State in January 1993.It should be pointed out that the electoral law now inforce is based on comparative law - mainly the electorallegislation of Spain  France and Gabon. For that reason  theGovernment is firmly convinced that the rejection of theelectoral law by the opposition political parties that have notexpressed their intention to participate in the legislativeelections of 21 November 1993 is nothing but a pretext fordelaying or blocking the process that has been set in motion.There is no doubt that the implementation of the democraticprocess in Equatorial Guinea has been made possible by theselflessness and determination of His Excellency ObiangNguema Mbasogo  who  after freedom had triumphed on3 August 1979  overthrew the dictatorship and began the realmarch of the country towards democracy in a climate ofpeace and harmony  which the advocates of violence wish todestroy with their provocations and their contemptible plots.We in Equatorial Guinea totally reject the views of theapologists violence and their attempts to undermine nationalpeace and stability. We reject those who do nothing butdefame our country and our Government  denigrating theactions that have been undertaken thus far in the country.A democracy imposed by foreign interests becomescorrupt and falls apart. A democracy that denies thegenuine  traditional and sacred values of a people not onlyhurts the feelings  the pride and the honour of that peoplebut is also doomed to failure. ""Man is what circumstancesdictate""  affirmed the great Spanish philosopher Balmes.That is why only a democracy that can respond to the sacredinterests of the people of Equatorial Guinea will be viable inthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea. In documents A/48/307of 12 August 1993  A/48/330 of 19 August 1993  andA/48/357 of 31 August 1993  our Government presentedinformation on the interference of certain foreign interests inmy country’s internal affairs. From this rostrum  we areholding the countries responsible for that interferenceresponsible for the consequences.We reaffirm that only in an atmosphere of peace is itpossible to achieve the progress and well-being to which allpeoples aspire. To the governmental and non-governmentalorganizations and friendly countries that  with their support have contributed to the efforts of our Government  weexpress our deepest appreciation  and we urge them tocontinue to lend their support and cooperation at thisdecisive stage in our democratic process.Intelligent action in this new global society must bebased on the exercise of the firmest solidarity. If that isdone  we shall be able to say with pride  ""We the peoples for a better world."""
"66",2816,"GRC",48,1993,"Mr. President allow me at the outset to extend to you the warmestcongratulations of the Greek Government on your electionto the presidency of the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. Your distinguished personal qualities anddiplomatic skills augur well for the progress of work of thecurrent session.I should be remiss if I did not express the deepappreciation of the Greek Government to theSecretary-General of the United Nations  16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the most distinguished wayin which he has been discharging his high duties. Hisdynamism  energy  perseverance  political will andleadership  together with a determined vision of the newworld structure  constitute invaluable and solid foundationsfor a more efficient and creative United Nations response tothe challenges of the close of the twentieth century. He hasour full support.Let me also join previous speakers in welcoming  fromthis rostrum  the new Members that have been admitted tothe United Nations this year.We were deeply shocked by the tragic news of thedevastating earthquake in India  which has resulted in theloss of tens of thousands of lives. I express  on behalf ofthe Greek Government and of the Greek people  our sinceresympathy for the families of victims and for the friendlypeople of India.Earlier this week  the Foreign Minister of Belgium  inhis capacity as President of the Council of the EuropeanCommunity  delivered a statement on behalf of the EuropeanCommunity and its 12 member States. My Governmentfully subscribes to its content.An unprecedented and historic event has enhancedhopes for the peoples living in the Middle East. Israelis andPalestinians have made a courageous step  in Washington towards peace. Greece  together with its EuropeanCommunity partners  offers its full support for keeping thepresent momentum so that the parties involved may soonreach comprehensive and lasting agreements. We havealways taken the stand that peace in the Middle East couldbe achieved through direct dialogue between all the parties.The Prime Minister of Greece  Mr. Mitsotakis  addressingthe General Assembly in 1981 in his capacity as ForeignMinister stressed  inter alia  that:""The prolongation of the Arab-Israeli conflict andthe failure of all unilateral attempts to resolve itdemonstrate that only dialogue among the parties including the Palestine Liberation Organization  canlead to a just and lasting solution."" (A/36/PV.16  p. 17)We are extremely satisfied that these historic  direct talkshave paved the way to peace.In today’s global political landscape  the internationalcommunity must address many challenges that are neitherfamiliar nor simple. Troubling developments in areas withvarying political and economic conditions are affectingmillions of people who are caught in a circle of violence andsuffering. Millions face starvation. We must take heart however  from the determination of peoples in all parts ofthe world to sustain freedom and human rights  and tochoose their futures even in the face of declining output rising unemployment and inflation. In the quest for a betterworld  for a better future  man is striving to improve hissocial  economic and political institutions.The future of mankind is inextricably linked to the wayin which we have lived and acted during the twentiethcentury and  in particular  during the last four decades.During this period the international community had rested itshopes on the United Nations system in order to address thechallenges of modern society. Our Organization has stoodthe test of time. It has offered us a valuable service in thefields of peace and security. It has also helped us  to a greatextent  in our common endeavours towards eliminatinginjustice  economic imbalances and social disparities  and insafeguarding the environment.We firmly believe that all Members of the UnitedNations  together  have a moral obligation to act in order toensure a better future for mankind. Previous speakers haveduly stressed the need to react jointly to the challenges.In this respect  allow me to announce that theGovernment of Greece  eager to contribute towards this end has the honour to propose the convening in Greece  inJanuary of the year 2000  of an international United Nationssummit aimed at adopting a global agenda for the twenty-first century. The general topic of this summit conferencecould be ""Partners for a Better World: on the Threshold ofthe Twenty-first Century"". An ad hoc preparatory committeeor an open-ended working group of the whole could beestablished by this body to cope with the substance and theorganizational aspects of the summit. Greece expresses itswillingness and readiness to work bilaterally and collectivelytowards the realization of this United Nations summitconference. I might add that  after all  Greece was thecradle of the democracy that humanity as a whole nowenjoys. It is the right place to hold the summit proposed bythe Greek Government.We are living through a period of radical changes especially in Europe. Former adversaries are nowcooperating on the basis of common values and principles.Historical agreements have been reached in arms control andarms reduction  both regionally and globally.These changes have also brought new risks anduncertainties: the proliferation of new States; theForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 17reappearance of claims of numerous national minoritiessuppressed under communism  and with them the danger ofdisputed borders; and  on top of these  the economic collapseand heavy transition costs in the former communistcountries  as well as the re-emergence of nationalism national antagonisms  religious fanaticism and populisttendencies. All of these issues have set the stage for a newapproach to the question of security and stability in Europe which has emerged as the major issue of political importancein the old continent. Let me also emphasize that security inEurope is linked to the economic development and maturityof the democratic process and institutions in Eastern Europe the Balkan peninsula and the Maghreb. Uncontrolled andunlimited migration resulting from political turmoil andeconomic hardship in these countries could cause social andeconomic problems affecting even the more prosperouscountries in Western Europe.The significance of the United Nations in maintainingpeace has grown dramatically. It is enough to compare the13 peace-keeping operations undertaken during the first42 years of its existence with the same number of operationsestablished between 1991 and 1992. Only last week theSecurity Council decided to establish two new peace-keepingoperations in Haiti and in Liberia.The prestige  credibility and power of the UnitedNations have been enhanced by the positive outcome of thepeace-keeping operations. However  the United Nationssystem was not ready to cope with such an extendedchallenge  and there seems to be a consensus that UnitedNations methods and capabilities need to be adjusted andimproved. More effective ways to prevent and containconflicts have been considered by the United Nations  worldleaders and respected think-tanks. The Secretary-General’s""An Agenda for Peace"" has stimulated the ongoingdiscussions and has already resulted in the adoption of aseries of measures.Greece strongly supports the United Nationspeace-keeping operations  as well as peace-building andpeacemaking activities. Our presence in Somalia  Iraq Kuwait and Western Sahara indicates our increasinginvolvement in peace-keeping. In this context  I should alsomention our contribution to the United Nations pollingofficers unit in Cambodia and in other parts of the world.Cyprus  a member of the United Nations  still remainsoccupied and divided. Thirty thousand Turkish troopsoccupy 38 per cent of the Republic. What is more thousands of settlers from the mainland have upset thedemographic balance of the population. We note with deepconcern a complete lack of progress towards a solution ofthe Cyprus problem during this year. In spite of the effortsof the Secretary-General and his representatives  talks inNew York and in Cyprus came to a standstill because of theunwillingness of the Turkish Cypriot leadership to engage inmeaningful negotiations either on the overall agreement oron confidence-building measures. We join theSecretary-General’s call to Turkey to fully assume itsresponsibilities and exercise its decisive influence with theTurkish-Cypriot leaders in order to achieve progress.The recent breakthrough in the Middle East has provedthat there are no intractable problems  if there is a politicalwill. This genuine will is required from Ankara in order tore-establish the sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity ofCyprus  while guaranteeing and protecting the rights of allits citizens. Here  I would remind the Assembly that thequestion of the missing persons has not been resolved.Greece will maintain its constructive attitude in the hope thatit will be reciprocated. My Government this year increasedits contribution to the United Nations Peace-keeping Forcein Cyprus to $6.5 million  as evidence of our strongcommitment to achieving a political settlement whilesafeguarding peace in Cyprus.We follow with particular attention the tireless effortsof the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to achievedecisive reforms to consolidate the democratic institutionsand establish an open market economy. We sympathize withtheir calls for assistance. We participate in all initiatives topromote a smooth integration of the newly established Statesinto international institutions. The consolidation ofdemocratic institutions and processes in Russia is of theutmost importance for Europe and for my country inparticular.An eloquent example of the upheaval brought about bythe dramatic changes in Europe is the situation in the formerYugoslavia. Here  and especially in Bosnia  the upheavalhas turned into a tragedy of unprecedented proportions. Nomatter how much we contribute to prevent and ease thesuffering of the people  there is no remedy unless and untila political solution has been agreed upon by all parties.Their leaders should understand that continued fightingincreases hatred and decreases the chances of a compromise and should seize any acceptable opportunity for peace forthe sake of their people. The Co-Chairmen of theInternational Conference on the Former Yugoslavia haveexercised all their ingenuity to convince those leaders ofthese simple truths. They have consistently tried to guidenegotiations towards the principles of the LondonConference. Cyrus Vance  Thorvald Stoltenberg and18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionLord Owen deserve our gratitude for their tremendousefforts.Greece  along with its European Community partners plays a constructive role in the search for a negotiatedoverall settlement. We were close to an agreement last Mayafter the Athens meeting  for which the Greek Governmentand particularly the Prime Minister  Mr. Mitsotakis  workedhard. Let us hope that the present chance will not bemissed.When an agreement is reached in Bosnia  we must takean active part in the huge task of the reconstruction of theformer Yugoslavia. We propose to start planning for thistask right now. The main responsibility lies with theEuropean Community. Greece expresses its readiness tohost an international meeting for the rehabilitation andreconstruction of the former Yugoslavia  with theparticipation of donors  as well as of neighbouring countries.Substantial economic and financial assistance is theprerequisite for achieving social harmony and consolidatingdemocracy. Let us hope that peace will be achieved soonerrather than later. Serious consideration should be given nowto planning for the day after peace is achieved.May I remind the Assembly that the agreement betweenthe Israelis and the Palestinians came very suddenly. Onlynow is the international community thinking of ways toassist the region to recover and achieve economicreconstruction and rehabilitation. Let us not be late in thecase of the former Yugoslavia. If we act right now  we acton time. The day after should be taken into seriousconsideration by all concerned  and especially by theEuropean Community and the neighbouring States.My Government deeply appreciates the efforts of theCo-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the InternationalConference on the Former Yugoslavia in accordance withSecurity Council resolution 817 (1993). We thankMr. Vance for agreeing to continue these efforts inaccordance with Security Council resolution 845 (1993).The resolution of this problem will enhance stability in theBalkan region. Greece’s position is clear: we are strivingto eradicate a potential point of friction in the Balkans friction which may lead to tension with unpredictable andperhaps grave consequences.On this occasion I reiterate our earnest desire tostrengthen  as far as possible  our relations with all ourneighbours. We have pursued this policy consistently. Tothis purpose  we will continue our efforts to enable ournorthern neighbours to accomplish the difficult task ofreconstructing their economies. The Balkan economies areinextricably interdependent; we need the cooperation of ournorthern neighbours in order to link further our economieswith those of the Central  Northern and Western EuropeanStates. So our neighbours need the cooperation of Greece inorder to integrate their economies with the EuropeanCommunity as well as to have access to the trade routes ofthe Mediterranean and the Middle East.Greece is fully aware of the need to assist  and hasalready enormously assisted  Albania in overcoming itsconsiderable economic difficulties and consolidating itsdemocratic institutions. At the same time  we again urge theAlbanian Government to grant in practice the fundamentalminority rights established within the process of theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe particularly in the fields of education and religion. Religiousfreedom and the right to education should not be denied tothe Greek minority nor to any minority anywhere in theglobe. Albania cannot deny to the minorities within itsborders what it itself asks for its minorities abroad.The elimination of weapons of mass destruction including in particular nuclear  chemical and biologicalweapons  is a goal towards which  despite progress achieved we must persevere. The signing of the chemical-weaponsConvention on 12 January 1993 was an important step. Welook forward to the Conference of 1995 for an unconditionaland indefinite renewal of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Wealso note with satisfaction the progress made towards thenegotiation of a comprehensive test-ban treaty.The World Conference on Human Rights  held inVienna last June  has led to the emergence of common viewsand strategies involving large sectors of our societies and toprospects for better cooperation between the institutions andorganizations active in this area.We hope that the vicious circle of violence in SouthAfrica will end soon  with the cooperation of all SouthAfrican leaders  and that a new political system will be born.Greece  along with its European Community partners intends to play a constructive role in assisting that countryin its transition to majority rule.In Somalia  the United Nations embarked upon the firstpeace enforcement operation to secure a safe environmentfor humanitarian operations  disarm militia and pursue thedifficult task of political recovery. Pacification has beenaccomplished to a large extentForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 19though serious problems remain. As a troop contributor tothe United Nations Operation in Somalia  Greece firmlybelieves that this operation should not be allowed to fail.Greece and its European Community partners maintaina fruitful dialogue in both political and economic matterswith the countries of Latin America. This dialogue will becontinued with great interest at the San Jose and Rioministerial meetings  which will take place next year underthe Greek presidency of the European Community and inGreece.In many of the poorest developing countries  standardsof living continue to decline  while in other developingcountries the results of economic performance are  to say theleast  mixed. Thus  some economies in Asia are vibrant.Latin America  with the debt crisis behind it  has pursuedsuccessful structural adjustment programmes. On the otherhand  in half of the developing world the picture remainsbleak. It is particularly so in Africa. The needs arecompelling.We share the view that growth should be sustainable inthat it creates more employment  less poverty and greaterequality of opportunity  and also in that it promotes humanfreedom and the preservation of the environment. Successfulnational policies are necessary to bring about greaterparticipation by the people in economic  social and politicallife.In concluding my statement  I appeal to every Member not only in my capacity as Foreign Minister of Greece  butalso as a man who wants to see his grandchildren live in adifferent  better world - a world of tolerance  peace andsolidarity. Let us join our efforts and share our experiencefor a better tomorrow. Let us be tolerant of each other inorder to ensure a better life for our children and for theirchildren. Let us ensure that solidarity and partnershipprevail over sterile antagonism  micronationalism andtotalitarian ideologies and regimes. Let us work together toeliminate war  famine  genocide  ""ethnic cleansing"" holocaust  xenophobia  racism and aggression."
"67",2857,"GRD",48,1993,"It is with profound pleasurethat my delegation conveys greetings and best wishes fromthe Government and the people of Grenada to the UnitedNations General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.My delegation is pleased to extend sincerecongratulations to you  Mr. President  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly during this forty-eighthsession. We are especially pleased because you createhistory by being the first person from the region to whichGrenada belongs to hold the prestigious post of GeneralAssembly Presidency  coming as you do from our sisterCaribbean Community (CARICOM) country  the Republicof Guyana.My delegation takes this opportunity also to commendMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria for the excellent manner inwhich he conducted the Assembly’s proceedings at its forty-seventh session. My Government also wishes to extend itscommendations to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his indefatigable efforts inthe service of the Organization.The Grenadian delegation is pleased to extend a warmwelcome to the six new Members of the United Nations:the Czech Republic; the Republic of Slovakia  Eritrea Monaco  the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  andAndorra.Forty-eighth session - 12 October l993 15The problems of developing countries are still daunting.Every country must try to help itself. My Governmentcontinues to pursue its own economic structural adjustmentprogramme  with which the people of Grenada have showngreat understanding and cooperation. But prolongeddifficulties in the economic sector can give rise to attitudesand conditions that can adversely impact upon socialdevelopment and administrative capacities  and so mydelegation calls on the international community to showgreater flexibility in assisting the adjustment process ofGrenada and other countries experiencing economicconditions similar to Grenada’s.Poverty  debt  inadequate resources  marginalization andthe lack of secure markets for our products deal seriousblows to social  economic and political stability. Further  theimpact on small  undiversified economies from liberalizingtrade regimes and regional trading blocs has been shocking.The fact is that free trade is not always synonymous withfair trade: factors of size  resource endowment and levels ofdevelopment must be duly considered in settling traderelations. This is particularly so with small  open  primary-producing economies  where one serious natural disaster such as a hurricane  can devastate all the fruits of ournational labour invested in bananas  cocoa and nutmeg.In this scenario  concessioned trade is very muchneeded to produce anything like a level playing field.Developing countries will not progress on sympathy; theyrequire equity. Small countries such as Grenada cannot doit all alone. We need assistance for diversification  fordevelopment of our human resources and for theimplementation of sustainable development.The United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment (UNCED) has placed before the world a widerange of challenges for managing the environment in asustainable way. Developing countries  in particular smallisland nation States  like Grenada  are anxious that allGovernments should move faster to effect the programmelaid out by UNCED’s plan of work on sustainabledevelopment  Agenda 21.Greater emphasis needs to be placed by donor agencieson training  as well as on technical and financial assistanceto developing countries to aid in sustainable forestry andagricultural practices. My delegation is convinced that theproblems of the environment cannot wait. Grenada isparticularly pleased with Agenda 21’s special recognition ofthe peculiar difficulties confronting the development of smallisland developing States and with the Global Conference onthe Sustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates (SIDS)  arising from that recognition  that will be heldin Barbados in April and May 1994.It is Grenada’s sincere hope that that Conference willserve to generate a better understanding of the challengesand predicaments confronting small island developing States and that it will produce the necessary partnership andestablish a sound path to their sustainable development.Much of the important negotiations preparatory to theConference remains incomplete. My delegation is concernedthat the success of the Barbados Conference may bejeopardized unless an intercessional mechanism is arrangedto provide for the advancement of the negotiations prior toApril 1994.Grenada joins the rest of the world in rejoicing over thesuccess of diplomatic perseverance in Afghanistan  ElSalvador  Nicaragua  Cambodia and Haiti. Grenada is however  highly disturbed by the renewal of politicallymotivated violence in Haiti. Grenada will continue to rallybehind the United Nations and the Organization of AmericanStates in their efforts to restore democracy and stability toHaiti. Grenada welcomes the Governors Island negotiatedsettlement aimed at restoring to Haiti the legitimateGovernment of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Wesupport the establishment of an international constabularyforce in that country. We call on all in Haitian society togive democracy and peace a chance.Grenada wishes to record its satisfaction over thehistoric attainment of formal recognition between Israel andthe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). We furtherapplaud the signing of the Palestinian autonomy agreementbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Itis a long-awaited peace initiative which will pave the wayfor the continued peaceful negotiation of tougher issues.Such a step will  in the long term  contribute to making theMiddle East and the world a more peaceful place.Grenada welcomes the peace agreements initialledbetween Israel and Morocco and between Israel and Jordanas steps in the right direction.Grenada welcomes the finalization of the demarcationof the boundary between Kuwait and Iraq  which wasaccomplished by the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary DemarcationCommission on 20 May 1993. We also welcome theadoption by the Security Council of itsresolution 833 (1993)  in which it guaranteed theinviolability of the boundary between the two States andcalled for respect for that resolution.16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionMy Government is  on the other hand  perturbed by thecontinuing wars in other parts of the world  such as theformer Yugoslavia  Liberia  Somalia and Angola. We arealarmed at the lack of respect for United Nations peace--keepers and aid workers  and call upon all sides in suchconflicts to turn to peaceful negotiation and respect forhuman lives.The promotion of democracy and the enhancement ofhuman rights must be vigorously pursued. The process ofdemocratization has to be entrenched. My delegation moreover  looks forward to welcoming to the UnitedNations  in the near future  the Republic of China onTaiwan. With its 21 million people  the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan  has  over the past 20 years  progressedeconomically  socially and democratically to the point whereit can no longer properly be kept out of the United Nations.The Republic of China on Taiwan has established diplomaticrelations with a number of countries and has significantlycontributed to the uplifting of the struggling economies of agreat number of countries and the development of theirpeoples. Surely  these impressive achievements eminentlyqualify the Republic of China on Taiwan for admission tothis Organization.Peace and democracy reaching areas new to them hasnoticeably been resulting in the deflection of aid to them  atthe expense of traditional stable democracies. That newlyemerging democracies have to be given due attention cannotbe denied  but this cannot be wholly at the expense of theold democracies. The peace dividend accruing from the endof the cold war and the halting of the arms race should beexpansive enough to nurture new democracies withoutabandoning old ones to unnecessary and far-reaching socialand societal conflicts. After all  the issue of development isno less important than the issue of peace.International peace presupposes domestic quietude inthe States making up the community of nations. Thisrequires continuing emphasis on human-resourcedevelopment and the enhancement of cultural and socialamenities in such areas as education  health and housing. Inthis regard  Grenada insists on the protection of the rights ofthe child  enhancement of the rights of women and thestrengthening of the family unit. The pursuit of the humanrace must be the nurturing of peace by the ending ofdiscrimination and the enhancement of equality  whetherbetween sexes or races  or with regard to social origins religion or whatever other differences might have beencreated through ignorance or arrogance. As we in Grenadasay ""A child is a child"".My delegation welcomes the establishment of acriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. It is with greatconcern that the world has witnessed men  women andchildren being massacred in that region in the name ofethnicity and religion. Grenada takes this opportunity toencourage the establishment of similar tribunals in areaswhere they may be necessary.Such cooperation as the world is seeing today inrestoring democracy and civil and political rights to citizensof warring countries ought to be extended to the field ofinternational criminal activities. Grenada stands ready tocollaborate with other countries in putting a halt to suchactivities as illicit drug production  trafficking andconsumption and money-laundering and their associated ills.These tend to decay the moral fibre of a society and drainalready scant resources in efforts to combat the menace  thusfrustrating national development processes. Grenada hasaccordingly enacted legislation giving effect to the UnitedNations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugsand Psychotropic Substances  of 1988  providing for theforfeiture and confiscation of the proceeds of crime outlawing moneylaundering and promoting bilateral andmultilateral cooperation in the fight against these menaces.Grenada is very pleased that the South AfricanParliament has agreed to establish a Transitional ExecutiveCouncil  which is expected to allow the black majority toparticipate in the governing of their country. We receivedwith joy the news that 27 April 1994 has been set as thedate for the election of a Government in South Africa inwhich South Africans of all races  colours  beliefs andgenders will participate. We applaud the efforts that havebeen made by the Government of President De Klerk andthe African National Congress of Nelson Mandela to usherin genuine democracy in South Africa. We encourage allSouth Africans to give full support to that progress.Throughout the world  people are looking towards theUnited Nations for solutions to their political  economic ethnic and social problems. The freeing of the UnitedNations from ideological tensions has made this possible; butwe are aware that the United Nations must now berestructured  the better to meet these ends. The compositionof the Security Council should be re-examined  with newpermanent seats on that Council being allotted to suchcountries as Japan  without current permanent membershipbeing affected. Also  additional seats should be added.Further  an appropriate mechanism is needed to establishadequate oversight and accountability in the United Nations.The capability of the United Nations to conductpeace-keeping should be enhanced and rationalized.Forty-eighth session - 12 October l993 17World security requires all of us  nations great as wellas small  to make extra efforts to attain and maintain peaceand democracy for development. As a community ofnations  let us therefore work diligently and tirelessly toattain these goals."
"68",2904,"GTM",48,1993,"Allow me  AmbassadorSamuel Insanally  to congratulate you sincerely  on behalf ofmy delegation  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations at its forty-eighth session.At the same time  I would express to you our satisfactionthat this post has gone to such a distinguished representativeof the Latin American and Caribbean region. You maycount on our cooperation in the important work that liesahead of you.I would also like to express our gratitude toAmbassador Stoyan Ganev for the efficiency with which he8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionserved as President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session.I would give a special greeting to Andorra  the CzechRepublic  Eritrea  Monaco  Slovakia  and The FormerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and bid them a cordialwelcome to our Organization. Guatemala wishes to extendto them its friendship  respect  solidarity and understanding.The increase in its membership is further proof of the faiththe international community places in the United Nations asa multilateral forum par excellence for seeking together thesolution to the problems that beset the world today.I would also like to extend my greetings toMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  whose dynamic leadership has allowed us toprogress towards the common objective of strengthening ourOrganization and adapting it to the new world situation. Wehope that his efforts to ensure fulfilment of the Charter andof its purposes and principles will be successful. We needa strengthened Organization to maintain international peaceand security and to promote social progress and betterstandards of life for human beings within the widest conceptof freedom.We believe that the continuous dialogue between theSecretariat and the Member States should be based onmutual respect  confidence and understanding  and shouldtake into account cultural  political  economic and socialrealities. The Secretary-General’s role as a facilitator ofpeace processes  as an adviser on human rights and as amediator in international conflicts may be strengthened bythe contribution of distinguished statesmen and experts whoshare with him their experience and prestige.The events which have taken place in my country since25 May of this year have marked a fundamental change inthe political and institutional life of Guatemala.The breaking-off and subsequent restoration ofconstitutional order created a situation in which the peopleof Guatemala  as the country’s only sovereigns  exercisedlegitimate resistance in order to protect and defend theirrights and guarantees enshrined in the political Constitutionof the Republic.As one of the principal consequences of these events with a view to consolidating the restoration of constitutionalorder so as to reinstall the Congress of the Republic  thepolitical parties formally pledged in writing to purge themembership of that body.Since this commitment has not yet been fulfilled President Ramiro de León Carpio  as Head of State and therepresentative of national unity and the interests of thepeople of Guatemala  in accordance with the Constitution requested the supreme electoral tribunal to hold a vote sothat the citizens could express their will with regard to thepolitical decision of calling for the resignation of the sittingmembers of the Congress and the judges of the SupremeCourt. This vote  in conformity with the resolution of thetribunal  will be held on 28 November this year.This process has no precedent in our political history.We wish to stress that all the actions taken by theGovernment of the Republic fall strictly within theframework of the Constitution  and  though the people ofGuatemala may have opted for a slower path  throughlegality  to consolidate their democratic institutions  we aresure that this will be the best solution for the reconciliationof the Guatemalan family and the political stability of theState. Guatemala is charting its own course  and its politicalprocess cannot be compared with other realities.Yesterday  President Ramirio de León Carpio presentedthe National Peace Plan and the Official Declaration onHuman Rights to the Guatemalan people  as he does today through me  to the international community. President Leónde Carpio’s Plan seeks a firm peace  based on far-reachingreconciliation through dialogue  so that we Guatemalans canfind unity in the diversity of our cultural  ethnic  religious social  political  economic and ecological values.It seeks lasting peace  achieved by putting an end toarmed internal confrontation and seeing to it that the rootsof hatred  resentment and distrust that have divided us areextirpated through negotiation and never again by violence.It seeks a peace with the power to transform  achievedby consensus and national compromise  which will lead tothe strengthening of the capacity of the Government and thesociety as a whole to respond promptly and effectively tosocial requirements  with particular attention to the sectorsof the population most affected by the armed internalconfrontation.The first component is reconciliation. The Planconsiders it essential to establish and promote thefunctioning in Guatemala of the permanent forum for peace.This forum will help to facilitate dialogue and ensure theparticipation of all Guatemalans in the solution of nationalproblems. This reconciliation process will be promoted atthe national  regional  departmental  municipal andcommunal levels. Thus  consensus and agreements willForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 9express needs that are truly felt by the people and will at thesame time provide guidelines for joint action by the peopleand the Government to solve these problems. In thisdecentralization strategy  we shall make use of allmechanisms for making the community’s voice heard including urban and rural development councils.In those councils national problems will be discussed inorder to arrive at conclusions that will lead to the perfectingof our democracy  the strengthening of a State based on therule of law  the full exercise of individual freedoms  respectfor human rights  integrated  self-reliant and self-sustainingdevelopment with equality and justice and the solution toproblems deriving from our cultural diversity.We must link this permanent forum to previousachievements of the peace process. To this end  accountshould be taken  inter alia  of the contributions made to thegreat national dialogue and to the meetings that varioussectors of the Guatemalan population had with theGuatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG).When that group integrates itself legally it will be able through the national reconciliation commission  to present itsideas and proposals for subjects to be dealt with in theforum.The matter of social requirements calls for honest efficient and immediate actions by the Government tostrengthen the protection and defence of human rights actions that will reduce poverty indicators and promotedevelopment in the areas worst affected by violence and thatwill succeed in perfecting our democratic system. At thesame time  the Government will promote and supportresponsible action in these fields by all sectors of society.We hope the valuable support of the internationalcommunity will be added to this effort of the people and theGovernment  which will contribute to a prompt and effectiveresponse to the needs and requirements of the population.We cannot postpone the end of the armed confrontation which requires the restoration of the negotiation process tobring about a definitive cease-fire; the return of the URNGto legality by means of amnesty; the defining of theconditions necessary for its integration into the country’spolitical life; and  in consequence  its direct participation inthe permanent peace forum.We shall also define the international verificationmachinery which will make possible the concentration disarmament and demobilization of URNG personnel. Toachieve this  there must be an end to acts of terrorism  actsof destruction against the infrastructure and actions that harmthe environment.The process also requires  first  that there be a revisionof the Oslo and Mexico City accords and  secondly  that atimetable for negotiations be set.On the question of human rights  the Government hasdeclared that it will act firmly against violations of theserights  with no distinction as to social or economic status.The necessary measures will be taken to protect and supportpersons and entities that are working in accordance with thelaw to promote and safeguard human rights. We thereforecall upon the United Nations  the Organization of AmericanStates (OAS) and the States members of these organizationsto increase their presence and technical contributions toactions that the State of Guatemala and its institutionsundertake to strengthen  enable and perfect the machinery forprotecting and defending human rights.On behalf of my Government  I request the Secretary-General of the United Nations to seek a meeting with theURNG to undertake a review of the Oslo and Mexico Cityaccords and to set a timetable for negotiations. TheGovernment of Guatemala is proposing this Peace Plan aware as it is of the imperative necessity for putting an endonce and for all to armed confrontation  which has cost mycountry so many human lives over the course of more than30 years. Only a sturdy  lasting peace with power totransform can serve as a basis to strengthen democraticinstitutions  guarantee respect for human rights and promotepolitical  economic and social development.For all of the above reasons we most warmly welcomethe peace process that has been attained in the sisterRepublic of El Salvador and the one recently initiatedbetween the State of Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization.Guatemala reaffirms its faith and conviction regardingthe guiding principles set out in the Charter of the UnitedNations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights outstanding among which are the principle of the peacefulsolution of disputes  the right to self-determination  thesovereign equality of States and  fundamentally  the respectfor human rights and the principle of democraticGovernment.In keeping with the principle of universality prevailingin the current international context  our country considersthat cases like that of the Republic of China in Taiwan10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionshould be thoroughly studied and considered in the light ofthe United Nations Charter. Guatemala renews its faith andhope in multilateralism  and particularly in the UnitedNations. It wishes to stress its tradition of peace  dialogueand negotiation and the non-use of force in internationalrelations.The security of nations is no longer an exclusivelygeopolitical matter falling within the framework of bipolarconfrontation. It is a global problem within which we musttackle the problems that afflict today’s world. The conceptof security should include new elements that are fundamentalfor the peoples of the world: democracy  development  thepreservation of the environment  combating drug trafficking food security  population trends and so on.The Secretariat should be in the service of MemberStates and in that role should facilitate instruments that willmake it possible to maintain international peace and securityand promote economic cooperation and social development which will guarantee the full exercise of human rights andfundamental freedoms throughout the world.Guatemala believes that  within the process ofrestructuring and reorganizing the United Nations that iscurrently under way  the efficiency of the system and the fulland democratic participation of all its Members should besecured. Democratization  as a fundamental element in thedevelopment of peoples  must coexist with development ofthe international community and its multilateral system.We support the initiative to expand the membership ofthe Security Council from a regional perspective.Operations designed to contain or solve conflicts shouldbe matters for priority action by the United Nations as partof the Organization’s efforts to forge a new world order.Among the problems of development are to be foundmany of the causes of regional  national and internationaltension. Development must be the central focus of theefforts of the Organization. We therefore support theholding of a World Summit for Social Development  and wehope that the Secretary-General will submit the proposedagenda for development  embracing economic affairs thathave traditionally been assigned to the Organization  as wellas social  political  environmental and cultural matters  whichwe are beginning to realize are fundamental elements in thewelfare of peoples.The well-being of mankind depends in large measureon the rational use of available natural resources. Withregard to ecology  we need a global perspective  as theenvironment is the heritage of all mankind. If the benefitsare enjoyed by all  the effort should be shared. Thedeveloped world must work more closely and moreeffectively in financing the various programmes to preservethe environment of the developing countries and musthonour the commitments given in Rio de Janeiro.National and international security are threatenedprimarily by differences between the levels of developmentof countries. Effective action must be taken against poverty hunger  disease and illiteracy. These scourges are worseningwhere there are concentrations of refugees or displacedpersons. Cooperation must not be delayed. For this reason Guatemala hopes that the initiative of reactivating the North-South dialogue to strengthen international economiccooperation for development and to revitalize globaleconomic growth  as formulated by the Non-AlignedMovement and the Group of 77  will be agreed to and willlead to the creation of a better world.The developing countries must refine the machinery forpolitical and economic coordination to enable us to get thisdialogue going seriously and constructively. It is thereforeessential that international economic cooperation bestrengthened to revitalize global economic growth and toensure that the technological revolution that is under waywill be one more factor in the promotion of a just andequitable world order.We must not overlook the fact that the problems ofnational development are to be found also in the CentralAmerican region. International cooperation is necessary forthe consolidation of peace and to encourage the developmentof the region. Meetings of Presidents of Central AmericanStates continue to be held regularly. Due note has beentaken of regional political advances  and proposals forfurther improvement in this field have been put forward. Asummit meeting of Central American Presidents will be heldin Guatemala at the end of this month for the purpose ofadopting the Protocol to the General Treaty on CentralAmerican Economic Integration  whose aim is to encouragesocial development - a priority when it comes toconsolidating peace in Central America.The Central American effort at integration has beenintensified. The Central American Integration System which coordinates efforts at regional integration and istherefore a fundamental instrument in the process of regionaldevelopment  now has a Secretary-General.Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 11It has been proposed that a coordinated CentralAmerican fund to fight poverty be set up. This proposal willbe studied at the next Summit of Central AmericanPresidents.Guatemala supports economic openness so that itseconomy may be integrated effectively into the sphere ofworld trade. Along with the other Central Americancountries  we have made progress in establishing anintegrated economic space  and we are negotiating withcountries and groups of countries with a view to concludingagreements on the liberalization of trade.The Government that I represent has embarked upon aprocess of restructuring and consolidating its democraticinstitutions. Keeping faith with the Constitution of theRepublic  it has today  with the greatest good will and goodfaith  presented its plan for peace. This is designed to savemany lives and to bring to our country the longed-for peace which cannot be achieved without the wholehearted supportof the international community."
"69",2947,"GUY",48,1993,"As I stand today at this rostrum  aflood of memories rushes to my mind. I recall appearing asPremier before the United Nations Committee ondecolonization in 1961 to plead the case of my country’sindependence. Like so many other colonies after the SecondWorld War  Guyana was anxious to secure its freedom andexercise its right to self-determination.The road  however  was far from easy. Along the waythere were many stumbling-blocks and casualties. It was notuntil 1966  long after most subject peoples had been set free that we became independent and took our place in the familyof nations.The world today is radically different from what it wasthen. The total membership of the United Nations hasgrown significantly. The cold war  which had bedevilledinternational relations since 1947  has ended  with a promiseof a new and more democratic world order. With thecollapse of the Soviet Union  one of the two super-Powers there are severe difficulties for the new structures whichhave been established. Nevertheless  hope is alive for theconstruction of an era of peace  based on respect for allpeoples and the promotion of their general welfare. It is anexciting moment in world history  and for the UnitedNations there is a defining role.Guyana has been honoured by the unanimous electionof its representative to the presidency of this forty-eighthsession of the General Assembly. This session willundoubtedly be a challenging one. I wish to thank the entiremembership for its vote of confidence in our ability toundertake this lofty responsibility. It is  after all  anacknowledgement that all States  irrespective of their size can play an important role in the Organization’s work. I amespecially grateful to the Caribbean Community(CARICOM) group and the wider Latin American andCaribbean Group for their full endorsement of ourcandidacy. I must also pay a tribute to His Excellency Mr.Stoyan Ganev for his capable direction of the forty-seventhsession and to our distinguished Secretary-General for hisefforts to promote the continuing success of our worldOrganization.Success in these volatile times is often tempered. For notwithstanding its important accomplishments  the UnitedNations cannot be said to have fulfilled the highestaspirations of its creators. The scourge of war is stillrampant in many places. Colonialism is certainly not extinct and today it threatens to survive in different forms. Manyaspects of colonialism are evident in the ever-widening gapbetween the developed and the developing countries and thedependence of impoverished millions on the largesse of afew. This prevailing economic and social disparity providesa breeding ground for hunger  disease and poverty andultimately constitutes a threat to international peace andsecurity.As the focal point of multilateralism  the UnitedNations must continue to explore the full limits ofinternational cooperation in order to eliminate  or at leastalleviate  the problems of the disadvantaged. I should liketo think that there is now agreement that the grave situationrequires collective action. Whatever its limitations  it is stillthe best forum available to States for diplomacy  dialogueand negotiation  and thus for the avoidance of conflict. Weshould seek  therefore  to enhance its ability to address ourcommon goals.As a small developing State  Guyana is fully committedto the ethos of multilateral cooperation which is embodiedin the United Nations. We have come here to renewpublicly our faith in the Organization and to urge allMembers to pledge to deepen and strengthen multilateralismas a foundation for inter-State relations. Experience hasshown that no nation  however powerful  can exist inisolation. Its borders are not impervious to encroachment byuniversal ills. Ultimately  it must come together with therest of the world to find common solutions to commonproblems. AIDS  narcotic drugs  poverty and pollution arestriking examples of the pandemic which affects us all.Control of these scourges requires concerted action by theUnited Nations as a whole. Added to these are naturaldisasters  such as the recent earthquake in India. Ourdeepest sympathy goes out to the Indian people andGovernment.We note with some disappointment that internationalconflicts continue to undermine the capacity of theOrganization to promote the cooperation which is deemedessential for reaching solutions to current global problems.The real value of the United Nations in this period willdepend on its collective ability to respond effectively to thiswave of international conflicts  and to find acceptable meansof peace-keeping and peacemaking which will not be aburden on its membership.Such a development will inspire confidence amongmember nations to refer issues to the United Nations body and to restore their reliance on the Organization’s ability toresolve disputes before they resort to the battlefield.Our first effort at constructing a framework forinternational peace and security through the League ofNations ended in failure. The reason can be found in theinherent weakness of the League  in the resultant inability tocontain rampant nationalism  particularism and insularity andin the lack of respect for its fundamental principles. TheUnited Nations is a second experiment  prompted by thedisasters consequent upon the failure of the League. At SanFrancisco we vowed to spare succeeding generations fromthe scourge of war. We have before us today anotheropportunity to secure an era of real peace and stability  todeploy fully the resources of the Organization in the serviceof humanity  and to reach for a broad-based  sustainabledevelopment and some measure of prosperity and fulfilmentfor the peoples of this planet.In our efforts to bolster international peace and security the report  ""An Agenda for Peace""  which was prepared bythe Secretary-General in response to the Security Council’srequest  sets out a number of proposals which merit seriousconsideration. While recognizing the need to provide theCouncil with enforcement capacity under Chapter VII of theCharter  we place special importance on preventivediplomacy  which would obviate recourse to physicalintervention. As the experience of some recent peacemakingand peace-keeping operations has shown  these measures arefraught with uncertain political consequences. Moreover they have proved extremely costly  particularly to smallStates such as ours which can ill afford such expenditures.So diverse are the origins of conflict that each situationmust be examined in depth to determine the mostappropriate means of peaceful solution. In some cases thedispute may have legal implications and may therefore bebest handled by a suitable judicial body. More often thannot  however  the roots of conflict are embedded in a historyof complicated political  economic and social factors. Insuch instances the ground must be carefully prepared for thecultivation of peace and stability. Fortunately  theadvantages of the diplomatic approach are not lost in theUnited Nations  which increasingly is using the good officesof the Secretary-General and his representatives to inducesolutions to long-standing conflicts.We believe that these examples reaffirm the virtue ofdialogue and negotiation. However  although promising forthe future  other situations remain tenuous and requireconstant monitoring. Somalia and Sudan must be carefullynurtured back to normalcy. In Europe  Bosnia andHerzegovina stands out as an horrific example of man’sinhumanity to man  and compels us to search for a quick endto the wanton killing of innocent thousands. Indeed  theForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 3United Nations must hasten to devise new strategies to dealwith these persistent convulsions in the global body politic.The Middle East has been embroiled in conflict formuch too long. With the recent signing of the declaration ofprinciples for Palestinian self-rule  the road ahead isencouraging. Peace and stability throughout the region nowseem to be within our grasp. We hope also that theterritorial problems between Iraq and Kuwait can beamicably settled.As far as South Africa is concerned  the announcementof a date for elections  coupled with supporting structures gives rise to the hope that majority rule is not far off and wemay in the near future welcome that country back into thefold of the international community. We urge the peoples ofSouth Africa to eschew further violence and to cometogether for their common good.I wish to record with satisfaction the view that a returnto democratic traditions and respect for good governance andhuman rights has helped to further promote peace. Guyanawill support any confidence-building mechanism whichfavours dialogue over confrontation as the means of choicefor the pacific settlement of disputes. Because of theinherent correlation between peace and development itbehoves each member of the international community tocontinue the search  where needed  for creative ways tosettle disputes that could otherwise imperil not onlyinternational peace and security but also nationaldevelopment.In this hemisphere  of which Guyana forms part  we areconcerned that  despite the end of the cold war  Cubaremains outside the inter-American family. We truly believethat this is a serious anomaly in the context of theOrganization’s efforts to build a new world order based onmutual understanding and respect among all States in aunited international community. We appeal to the UnitedStates and Cuba to demonstrate their good will and seekurgently to reconcile their long-standing differences. TheCaribbean Community (CARICOM)  which has a vestedinterest in the early rapprochement between these two majorpartners  stands ready to play a role in this process.We are particularly pleased that the Central Americanregion  which for far too long has been entrapped byanachronistic economic and social structures  has emergedfrom a vicious cycle of internecine violence. CARICOMwelcomes the opportunity which this development offers forcloser cooperation between two neighbouring regions. Weare equally pleased that  after being held hostage by amilitary dictatorship unwilling to heed the popular will  Haitiis once again free to pursue a democratic path. We offer toPresident Aristide and his government our ready cooperationin the urgent task of reconstruction for social progress.Guyana has itself only recently emerged from a difficultelectoral process that  under international vigilance  provedto be free and fair. We are particularly grateful for the rolethe United Nations played in ensuring that the democraticwill of our people was fully respected. After all  the rightto choose one’s government is a fundamental human right which should never be denied. We commend the UnitedNations for providing electoral assistance at the request ofthose who seek it  and with due respect for the principle ofnational sovereignty. Elections alone  however  do notguarantee the preservation of democracy: they must beaccompanied by the establishment of machinery that protectsevery individual in our societies. I am pleased to report thatone of the first steps my Government took upon assumingoffice was to accede to the Optional Protocol to the UnitedNations Human Rights Covenants. We followed that withthe establishment of an Inter-Agency High-Level Committeeon Human Rights  whose function it is to ensure that Guyanacomplies with its reporting responsibilities under the HumanRights Conventions.It is not enough  however  to satisfy the civic andpolitical rights of our citizens: their fundamental economicand social entitlements to food  clothing  shelter and so onmust also be provided. Human rights are indivisible  and toprefer one above the other is to deny their essentialinterrelatedness. The Vienna Conference appears to haverecognized this fact and to have confirmed the need for aholistic approach. My own Government is dedicated to theproposition that human development must be comprehensiveif our society’s welfare is to be secured. Our stated policy therefore  is to create an environment in which democracywill work to fulfil our people’s spiritual and material needs.To implement our development programme  however  weshall require the cooperation of the international communityto supplement our own limited resources.As I observed earlier this year at a Conference entitled""Poverty in Guyana - Finding Solutions""  we are in asituation of crisis. For  while we have recently begun toexperience high growth rates  the economy continues to beweak: unemployment is high; human and financial resourcesare scarce; and basic infrastructure has deteriorated  leavingthe social sectors vulnerable to all the ills of poverty. Wehave been somewhat successful in raising production andproductivity levels  but are seriously limited by a heavy debtburden. Some 90 cents of each dollar earned now go4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessiontowards the repayment of the national debt. And theproportion of our external commercial earnings for paymentof our foreign debt is nearly three times the average of the47 least developed countries - an unbearably heavy burden.Even though we attempt to manage expenditure judiciously through good governance - efficient management  a cleanand lean administration and fullest respect for human rights -we cannot perform miracles. At the end of the day  we mustlook for assistance to buttress our domestic efforts and topreserve our tender democracy. With nearly 80 per cent ofour people below the poverty line  we shall succeed inconsolidating democracy only through economicdevelopment with social justice.At the present time  however  the prospects for suchsupport appear rather bleak. There has been a noticeablecontraction in development aid as the economies of somedonor countries experience difficulties. Their ownelectorates appear increasingly concerned with domesticproblems  such as unemployment and falling livingstandards. Whatever limited resources are available areallocated by the developed nations largely on the basis ofstrategic concerns. The international agenda is thereforebeing set more and more at the sacrifice of the developingworld. There is consequently an urgent need to reorder ourpriorities and to place development at the top of our agenda.At best  however  development aid is no more than apalliative. Significant economic and social progress willcome to the developing countries only when inequitable andunjust economic and trade practices in the global system areremoved. As the 1992 human development report pointedout  we are denied some $500 billion in market opportunitiesannually  10 times what we receive as foreign assistance primarily because of protectionist policies still being pursuedby the developed countries. We call  therefore  on thosecountries to open up their markets to our goods at prices thatcompensate us fairly for our labour and production. In thiscontext  we urge the industrial nations to expedite theconclusion of trade negotiations  taking fully into account theinterests of our small  developing economies. We wouldalso wish and ask that the formation of large regionaleconomic groupings - the megablocs as they are called -guard against the further marginalization of our economiesand our countries.Additionally  a definite solution must be found  duringthe current decade  to the third world’s crushing externaldebt problem. In Latin America and the Caribbean  with181 million out of 441 million people living below thepoverty line  in the mire of destitution  how can humandevelopment take place when  despite onerous debtpayments  the stock of debt continues to grow? Aprospective Economic Commission for Latin America andthe Caribbean (ECLAC) study for the region over the1985-1995 period shows a serious aggravation in terms ofpoverty  unemployment and foreign debt during the decade.Between 1981 and 1990  the region’s foreign debt paymentswere $503 billion  of which $313 billion were interestpayments. However  in the same period  the region’sconsolidated foreign debt increased from $297 billion in1981 to $428 billion in 1991. Little wonder that the UnitedNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) publication entitled""Children of the Americas"" commented that this mechanism whereby the more you pay the more you owe  is perverseand must be stopped.Debt relief in the form of debt cancellation  grants  softloans and rescheduling is urgent if the developing countriesare to eradicate poverty  protect the environment and play ameaningful role in expanding world trade and endingstagnation and recession in the industrially developedcountries. Debt relief must be seen as an investment notonly in the development of poor countries but also in thesecurity of the rich nations.Recognizing the link that exists between poverty  trade population  development and the environment  we musthasten to implement the Rio programme of action outlinedin Agenda 21. The developing countries urgently require theresources - both financial and technological - necessary tofulfil their obligations under that compact. As proof of itscommitment to protect the environment  Guyana has setaside nearly 1 million acres of its tropical forests forresearch  management and development of our richbiodiversity. With the welcome of entities such as theCommonwealth Secretariat  the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme and the Global Environment Facility  theIwokrama project  as it is now known  has been fullylaunched. At the commissioning ceremony held on WorldEnvironment Day this year  I dedicated the enterprise to ourindigenous peoples  who are not only the principalinhabitants but also the custodians of our forests. It isfitting  especially in this  the International Year of theWorld’s Indigenous People  that full recognition be given tothe important role they play in harmonizing man’srelationship with the Earth on which he lives.We also urge full support for the Global Conference onthe Sustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates  scheduled to commence in Barbados in April 1994.We trust that there will be adequate preparation and thewidest participation in that Conference.Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 5In a spirit of genuine cooperation  therefore  let usproceed to address the proposed agenda for development which we have accepted as a natural concomitant to ""AnAgenda for Peace"". Indeed  peace cannot prevail in theabsence of development. Our attempts at peacemaking andconflict resolution in general will not succeed if inequitableand unjust economic and social conditions are allowed topersist. Of late  many of the organs and agencies engagedin the development process have had cause to lament thegrowing diminution of resources available to them  aproblem now aggravated by continuing diversion of fundingto a multiplicity of peace-keeping operations. Obviously one recognizes the importance of maintaining global peace.However  it should not be at the cost of a disproportionatesacrifice of development  which leads to peace-keepingbecoming an end in itself instead of a means of encouragingeconomic and social welfare.The United Nations  whose universal membershipencompasses both developed and developing nations remains the ideal forum for forging a consensus on themajor issues of peace and development. It is evident however  that  as currently conceived and structured  itcannot adequately perform the role expected of it. Thatrealization has led us to undertake the exercise of reformingand restructuring the Organization. To this end  we mustensure that the changes we make are not simply cosmeticbut serve effectively to enhance the Organization’s capacityto deal with the challenges of the post-cold-war period. Ourreforms must therefore seek to establish the United Nationsas the principal forum in which macro-political  economicand social policies are collectively and consensually devised.If truth be told  the United Nations is still largelyperceived  notwithstanding its recent successes in thepolitical field  as a ""talk shop"". Like the old Congress ofVienna  which was described as a ""perpetual dance""  it isviewed in the eyes of our peoples - particularly the poor andthe suffering - as an endless round of dilatory debate whichproduces fine resolutions but precious little by way ofconcrete action. To survive and succeed  therefore  theUnited Nations must become relevant to the lives of men women and children everywhere.Urgent action is required at this explosive period ofmounting external debt  falling economic growth  fallingthird-world commodity prices  increasing unemployment environmental destruction  underdevelopment and thepersistence of poverty. Our troubled planet calls forstatesmanship  political will and cooperation for meaningfulchange. Market forces alone are not providing the peoplewith adequate opportunities to participate in and benefit fromeconomic growth and development. We have a paradox ofgrowing poverty in the midst of potential plenty. Scienceand technology have the capacity to eradicate poverty in thenot too distant future and to halve it by the end of thecentury. Instead  we have today  both in the developed andin the developing countries  only about half the growth rateof a decade ago and the catastrophic phenomenon of ""joblessgrowth"" - fewer and fewer jobs and more and more povertyand inequality.It is necessary to ascertain the root causes of globalpoverty and to develop an integrated strategy for itseradication. This necessitates a comprehensive world viewand a recognition of the major contradiction of our time: thetremendous growth of the means of production and theanachronistic relations of production and the collective willto resolve this contradiction.In the intense competition in a shrinking globalmarket - owing in large part to the increasing poverty andthe widening gap between the rich and poor in both theNorth and South  and between the North and the South - thethree centres of the industrialized world - North America Western Europe and Japan - are resorting to even morecapital-intensive growth and the use of more and moresophisticated technology: computers and robots  cyberneticsand automation. How can the poor and unsophisticated inthe third-world countries survive in the ""global village""  inthe ""borderless world"" when collectively these countries havenot attained the target projected long ago of 25 per cent inthe production of industrialized goods and with the greatmajority light-years behind in human-resource developmentand burdened by the dead weight of unconscionable andimmoral debt payments? The rapid advance to robots andautomation in the North also poses a threat to theadvantageous position of competitive wage rates in manycountries of the South. And the industrialized countries withbudget deficits  growing numbers of jobless and retirees andinadequate welfare funds cannot afford the Keynesian luxuryof pump-priming and ""workfare"".In a situation of confusion and uncertainty  and with nosolution in sight  the reactionary ultra-rightists andneo-fascists are getting stronger politically and becomingmore vocal and strident. There is no answer to thehopelessness and despair of the more than 30 millionunemployed in the countries of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development. Despair is leadingto alcoholism  narcotics use  crime and suicide. Meanwhilenationalism  xenophobia and neo-fascism are on the rise leading to racial and ethnic tensions and growing civil strife.6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe North-South dialogue has been languishing and hasbecome a dialogue of the deaf. In the South  risingunemployment and abject poverty are interacting with rapidpopulation growth  urbanization  overcrowding  disease  theproduction and use of narcotic drugs  increased flows ofrefugees across international frontiers and irreversibledamage to the environment. Whereas it was said previouslythat the Berlin Wall prevented peoples in the Soviet Unionand Eastern Europe from travelling to the West  now newwalls are being erected to prevent people from entering thedeveloped  industrialized countries.It is not enough to treat the symptoms of the globalmalaise. Radical reforms are urgently needed. Structuraladjustment is as necessary for the developed countries as forthe developing countries  but reforms must be predicated onsocial justice and have a human face. Human needs andhuman security should be the object of development. In thisregard  greater emphasis must be placed on human capitaland natural capital  and much more must be done to speedup disarmament so that the despairing and hungry of theworld can benefit from greatly enhanced savings.The development agenda must include a critical analysisof possible options and must deal with the internationalcompetitiveness of the third world  the basis of newmodalities of international cooperation for development andthe financing of development. It must also address coreproblems: alleviation of poverty  expansion of productiveemployment and enhancement of social integration particularly of the more disadvantaged and marginal groups.To attain these objectives  the people - I repeat  thepeople - must play a central role. They must be fullyinvolved in all aspects of life to take advantage of theirinitiatives and creativity in the fashioning of a better futureand a peaceful and prosperous world.As the leader of a small nation which continues tobelieve in the vast potential of this Organization for makingthe world a better place in which to live  I appeal to theAssembly to devote itself to this urgent task. Let us worktogether to advance the cause of global peace anddevelopment."
"70",2993,"HND",48,1993,"First of all  I take great pleasure in expressing tothe President of the General Assembly the sincerestcongratulations of the people and the Government ofHonduras on his well-deserved election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.In entrusting this very delicate role to him  theinternational community is recognizing his personal meritsand those of our sister nation of Guyana. We are convincedthat with his experience and proven capacity he will conductthe work of this Assembly with great success.My delegation also extends a warm welcome to thenew Members of our Organization: the Czech Republic  theSlovak Republic  The Former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia  Eritrea  Andorra and the Principality of Monaco.We do so fully convinced that within the framework of theUnited Nations we will establish and strengthen strong bondsof friendship and cooperation with them  and that theirparticipation will contribute effectively to the full realizationof the principles and purposes enshrined in the UnitedNations Charter.Pursuant to those same principles  the Republic ofHonduras calls  as it did at the previous session of theGeneral Assembly  for greater support and resources to beaccorded to the universal organs for the legal settlement ofdisputes  such as the International Court of Justice  whoserulings contribute to the peaceful settlement of disputesbrought before it. We are pleased to state that a year agoHonduras and El Salvador were handed down a ruling by theInternational Court of Justice on their border dispute; we arenow complying with that ruling and the border populationsare living in complete harmony.On the question of disarmament  in taking note of thevital discussion of the destructive power of nuclear weapons we urge the nuclear-weapon States to arrive at sound verifiable agreements on the reduction and destruction ofsuch weapons and their means of delivery  taking intoaccount the great danger the use of these and other weaponsof mass destruction represents for humanity  and ensuringthat the growing financial resources released from the armsrace are transferred to the needs arising from internationalcooperation for development.It is only natural that  in activities in the field ofgeneral disarmament  priority should have been given tonuclear disarmament  but this must not impede renewedefforts in the field of conventional disarmament  particularlyon a regional basis.Honduras has observed with great concern the tragicsituation still prevailing in Bosnia and Herzegovina: theescalation of hostilities  massive violations of human rightsand attempts to enshrine in legal instruments territorialconquests obtained by aggression.My country therefore unreservedly supports the SecurityCouncil’s efforts to protect the displace populations  toprovide them with food  medicine and protection  and to46 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionobtain a cease-fire and a solution to the various problemsthat stand in the way of restoring peace to the region.In Somalia  there is no national government to ensurethat the United Nations intervention in that country will notonly mitigate the hunger which unfortunately afflicts itsinhabitants but also make it possible  with the fullparticipation of the Somalis  to follow the path to peace coexistence and the restoration of normalcy.That path of hope has already been taken with greatdetermination in South Africa  and the internationalcommunity is rejoicing at the end of the last vestiges ofapartheid and the beginning of national reconciliation andreconstruction.It was with rekindled hope that the entire world learnedof the outcome of the negotiations which  under the inspiredmediation of the Government of Norway  led to the recentlysigned historic agreement on mutual recognition between theState of Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization.This is one more step towards the normalization of good-neighbourly relations in the Middle East with respect to theright to self-determination of peoples.The Honduran Government  which has followed withinterest and concern the fierce struggle that for decades haspitted Israelis and Arabs against each other  welcomes thispositive development and hopes it will be accompanied bypeace agreements between Israel and its Arab neighbours.Similarly  our country has followed with great attentionthe course of events in Haiti  where we have welcomed theagreement reached between President Jean-Bertrand Aristideand the head of the country’s armed forces  through themediation of Mr. Dante Caputo  the Special Envoy of theSecretaries-General of the United Nations and theOrganization of American States (OAS).The text of this agreement  in addition to contemplatinga series of basic provisions for the solution of the crisis calls for the return of Haiti’s legitimate President  and forcompliance with all commitments undertaken both in theUnited Nations and in the OAS. Our country expresses itsresolute support for all measures that may be taken tocomply with the timetable established in the GovernorsIsland Agreement  which led to the parliamentary ratificationof Prime Minister Robert Malval  which in turn has made itpossible to suspend the embargo on Haiti.In Central America  the Tegucigalpa Protocol of13 December 1991 has entered into force. It adapts the legalframework of the former Organization of Central AmericanStates to the new realities of the region by establishing asystem of Central American Integration which  acting underthe impetus of the regional summits  is strengthening andfostering a new system of economic  social  cultural andpolitical integration for the benefit of all Central Americans.In accordance with this basic objective  my countryaspires  with increasing determination and political will  tosee our region established as a region of peace  freedom democracy and development which is more actively involvedin the new reordering of the international community.However  in spite of the progress in the regional peaceprocess  many of the root causes of the Central Americancrisis persist  and the advances that have been made are onlya starting-point in confronting the underlying causes of thearmed conflict which threaten to destroy all that has beenaccomplished.Peace and development will be securely establishedonly if a broad and participatory commitment is achieved involving both the Governments and the organized sectors ofcivilian society of each of our nations.It is a fact that the difficulties of any one CentralAmerican country have an effect on all other countries of theregion. Concerted action within a regional framework istherefore necessary  to allow internal processes to bestrengthened while fully respecting the particularcircumstances of each country.The Government of Honduras therefore appeals to ourfellow Central Americans to meet in the near future in orderto give a new thrust to coordination of the efforts whichbenefit from international support and to make it possible forus to view with hope the economic integration now underway.The challenge of establishing peace in Central Americarequires that we give priority to the geographical areas mostaffected by poverty. This in turn requires us to promotegreater social participation by deepening the process ofdecentralization through a concept of human development atthe local level and expressing that social development inrealistic macroeconomic policies which encourage bothdomestic and foreign investment.In Honduras this year we will be holding our fifthconsecutive general election since the restoration ofdemocracy in 1980  and it is our policy to give firm supportto the economic integration of the Central American isthmusForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 47in order to consolidate the results of growth with greatersocial well-being.A revitalized Central America with sustainableeconomic growth  while respecting the natural environmentand continually acting to rapidly improve the quality of lifeof its inhabitants  is the best guarantee of permanent securityfor the region bathed by the Caribbean Sea  within whichCentral America  in harmony with the principles of themember countries of the ""Community of the Caribbean""  canconsolidate an era of peace and cooperation by the end ofthis century.The third Ibero-American summit  held at San Salvadorde Bahia  Brazil  examined with concern the subject ofdevelopment  with emphasis on social development. In sodoing  it reaffirmed in that community of nations thecommitment to representative democracy  the promotion ofthe observance and defence of human rights  and thepromotion of the economic and social development of ourpeoples  which are united by language  tradition and by ashared future.To follow up on what was decided in this new forumfor cooperation  we Ibero-Americans must strengthen ourcommitment to the successful convening of the WorldSummit for Social Development  an initiative of the ChileanGovernment supported enthusiastically by Honduras  andwhich we hope will be given a final impetus by this GeneralAssembly.There can be no doubt that all of these attempts toachieve prosperity for our nations must inevitably involve awillingness on the part of the industrialized States to includeus in trying to establish an open  multilateral trade systemthat gives our products greater access to competitive marketsso that more and more countries can reach satisfactory levelsof growth and trade.Unfortunately  the Uruguay Round of Multilateral TradeNegotiations has not yet been concluded  and this is a sourceof grave concern to the less developed States whoseexpectations are affected along with the programmes ofstructural adjustment they are carrying out with greatsacrifice  as an effective contribution to a better ordering ofthe world economy. Protectionist measures imposed bycertain States on exports from our region not only cause adecline in the prices of those products but also impedeaccess to international markets  thus helping to plunge oureconomies into a climate of uncertainty by restricting thepossibilities of investment and continued growth.The need to achieve greater global economic stabilitywithout regard to the economic and political might of anyindividual nation should be examined along with the growingconvergence of opinions concerning global priorities withregard to the environment; this was demonstrated in a clearand positive way at the Earth Summit held at Rio de Janeirolast year.The deterioration of nature must be avoided. Togetherwe can design preservation strategies that also make itpossible to make rational use of our natural resources inorder to meet our countries’ requirements for employmentneeds and economic growth. In Honduras  we haveestablished a Ministry of the Environment charged withdesigning policies and strategies aimed at creatingmechanisms to protect and preserve our ecosystem and itsendangered species of flora and fauna.Lastly  as regards the restructuring of the UnitedNations  Honduras supports the proposal that the SecurityCouncil be expanded to include new permanent and non-permanent members so as to reflect the realities of today’sworld  allowing for the rotation of membership and anequitable geographical distribution in the composition of theCouncil.We are also in favour of the revitalization of the UnitedNations in the economic  social  cultural and related spheres.It is essential that the necessary measures be adopted as soonas possible to strengthen the capacity of those organsconcerned in order to discharge the functions conferred uponthem by the Charter of the United Nations in the sphere ofinternational cooperation.We welcome the steps that have already been taken toachieve the objectives we have set  but we believe that weneed to arrive at a more effective and more economicalUnited Nations system  one which is at the same time lesspassive in executing the programmes adopted here.The emergence of new conflicts and the persistence ofold ones in different parts of the world reconfirm  if such athing is necessary  the proven wisdom of trying to achieve as we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  an integral structure of harmonization and peacefulcooperation for the international community. Let us pledgeto achieve this with our votes and our actions."
"71",3017,"HRV",48,1993,"Throughout the half century ofits history the United Nations has never rallied a greaternumber of Member States and has never played a moreprominent role in global and regional international relations than it does today  and it has never borne the brunt of suchproblems as it bears today. This  the forty-eighth session ofthe United Nations General Assembly  is being held in anatmosphere of great hope and of even greater commitmentsfacing the Organization which  in this post-cold-war time following the historical collapse of communism andmultinational State communities in Europe  is becoming thecardinal guardian of global peace and security.The fall of Soviet and other European Communist andtotalitarian systems has reinforced hope and provided theprerequisites for the comprehensive democratization of theworld while simultaneously raising the question of what kindof multilateralism is required and possible in thecontemporary world. Of no lesser importance is the questionof the new role of the United Nations at a time when manynew States are coming into being and when thestrengthening of global peace is becoming the fundamentalideology of mankind. The United Nations must shoulder theresponsibility for a more equitable global order to take holdin every corner of the world. But  in order to achieve thisgoal  one must thoroughly review multilateral mechanismsas well as the activity of international organizations underconditions of the emergence of many new States  the end ofbipolarity and the strengthening of the polycentric foundationof the world.The process of disintegration of the Soviet communistsystem  which began with the fall of the Berlin Wall  ledtowards a fundamental shift in relations  not only withinEurope  but also on a global scale. It has redirected anddrafted new American-Russian and American-Europeanrelations. The competitive wars of the great Powers bent ongaining influence and predominance in the Third World havealmost died away  but the focus of regional crises has nowmoved to Eastern and South-Eastern Europe and to the areaof the former Soviet Union  because of the profoundpolitical  national  social and economic changes sweepingthose areas. International factors  primarily West Europeanand North American countries  were taken unawares by thedepth and speed of these historical changes. Their initialdisorientation turned  subsequently  into a renewal ofdormant traditional competition for spheres of influence inchanging circumstances. On the international scene  theultimate result has been disunity and the inefficiency of themost responsible international factors in dealing with volatileregional crises  but such developments have also jeopardizedthe European integration processes already under way. Thefundamental values and goals of European regionalorganizations now face a serious test and a radical review oftheir mission. The new system of European collectivesecurity is yet to take hold  and the same holds true for thesystem of general  global security. This is a matter of thegreatest importance because the security of small countrieshas become the key to the stability of each region and of theoverall international system.The world has been slow to accept  and slower tounderstand  the changes involving the national and Stateemancipation of old and new European and Asian nations and it has recognized their international identity withreluctance. The world has found it hard to grasp the at-firstuntenable contradiction implied in the fact that we haveentered a period  in the development of human society andinternational relations  of the broadest nationalindividualization based on a most comprehensivecivilizational integration. Even worse  the world has notbeen ready to face the difficulties and the temporarilydestabilizing consequences of such changes  which willultimately lead to the full democratization of internationalrelations.The view that the collapse of communist systems andof Soviet domination over nations in the Soviet Union andEastern Europe had resolved the problem of regional andinternational stability was wrong. There was a similar lackof understanding of the fact that the process of internal andinternational democratization cannot stop at the meredemocratization of political systems  and that it alsoinevitably leads to the disintegration of multinational Stateformations. This was the logical sequence of politicaldemocratization and national emancipation.There can no longer be any doubt today about the factthat the ever-increasing functional integration of the worldwas the very prerequisite of national independence andinternal sociopolitical and international democratization.Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 7This has only seemingly been a contradictory process.Specifically  because of their endangered position  smallnations and their States are anxious to preserve their ownState  cultural and economic identity  and this sustains notonly the variety but also the very development of the world.It should be remembered that positive nationalism  that is the national-democratic movement of oppressed nations inEastern Europe and of oppressed stateless nations in otherparts of the world  deserves the greatest credit for thecollapse of the communist systems.Having achieved their national sovereignty and theindependence of their State  small nations  in their owninterest  became supporters of ""civilizational"" integration anddemocratization. This is the reason why one of the mostimportant goals of the international community today shouldbe the successful resolution of problems affecting completeregional and international integration of States havingemerged after the disintegration of communist systems informer multinational States such as the Soviet Union Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.The new world order which is being created solaboriously  but also of necessity  can no longer be basedonly on the ascendancy of the anti-fascist coalition or of thenuclear Power club. Half a century after the historic victoryover fascism  new economic and political realities have comeinto being  and the countries against which the anti-fascistalliance was directed cannot bear the liability of the pastindefinitely. Germany  Japan  Italy and the countries withintheir international political spheres during the Second WorldWar are today democratic countries with huge developmentalpower  which is also obviously beneficial to the world.Similarly  the fundamental political and other eventfulchanges taking place in Russia are transforming that country currently in the throes of dramatic upheaval  from a formerStalinist threat to international peace and order into  wehope  a constructive component of global order built on newfoundations of equality and partnership of nations and Statesfor the sake of mutual benefit and the stability of peace.The balance of military blocs  weapons and ideologiesestablished during the cold war was only seemingly a stablesystem  because it was actually founded on repression ordependency  first of all at the expense of small States orstateless nations. Today  to quote Secretary-General BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  ""Multilateralism is the democracy ofinternational society."" (The New York Times 20 August 1993  p. A29  ""Don’t Make the U.N.’s Hard JobHarder"")Multilateralism  certainly! But of what kind? We musttend towards a multilateralism that will help us - after a goryhistory of strife  first between dynasties  then between Statesand  finally  between imperialist or ideological-military blocs- to avoid war between incompatible civilizations. A brutalentanglement of these civilizational contrasts is taking placeprecisely in the area of the former Yugoslavia  threateningto polarize greater areas along the lines of separation andconflict between civilizational-religious blocs. We shouldtend  instead  to internal  regional and global relations inwhich these civilizational spheres will blend productivelyand reinforce their identity through peaceful competition instead of wasting their precious potential on mutualconfrontation and annihilation.A new multilateralism capable of coping with theepoch-making changes of our time also calls for a thoroughreform of the United Nations. This implies  primarily  thestrengthening of international law  but also the developmentof mechanisms which will help the United Nations and itsagencies to function more effectively and to be depoliticized less costly and more receptive to ideas  influences andsupervision.In particular  the role and responsibility of the SecurityCouncil in dealing with questions concerning internationalpeace and stability should be given greater emphasis. Overpast years there has been considerable progress in theoperation of the Security Council  and the use of the vetohas almost become obsolete. Nevertheless  certain SecurityCouncil decisions are still excessively influenced by thenational interests of its members  the permanent ones inparticular. Accordingly  we need a climate of cooperationin the Security Council that will prevent its being used as anextended instrument of the foreign policy of individualSecurity Council members.Croatia supports extension of the permanentmembership of the Security Council  which will reflect theeconomic and political realities of the present-day world andassure a balanced regional representation in the Council.Croatia also endorses the limitation of the right and practiceof veto. The major crises of our time  such as the one in thearea of the former Yugoslavia  should be used as preciouslessons for more effective and concerted action by theSecurity Council.We also believe that a high degree of responsibility andauthority in decisions concerning the major directions ofglobal economic and social development should also bevested in the Economic and Social Council  so that its8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessiondecisions  in specific areas of decision-making  would haveexecutive force similar to that of Security Council decisions.Although it would be difficult to envisage the GeneralAssembly assuming the role of a global parliament to thedetriment of the sovereignty of Member States  a clearerdelimitation of authority among the General Assembly  theSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Councilwould nevertheless be required. A more articulated linkwith United Nations agencies  which ought to improve theirefficiency and prevent the political blocking of certainprocesses  is also necessary. However  the enhanced role ofthe Security Council  which we are advocating  should notaffect the authority of the General Assembly  which is aforum for the manifestation of the views of the vast majorityof small countries Members of the United Nations. As aform of present-day democracy  multilateralism shouldprovide the foundation for the stability of the new and  inevery respect  democratic world order. However  whilestriving to turn our global Organization into a mostconsonant orchestra which will provide for the fullexpression of the voices of all differences and contrasts natural-permanent and secondary-provisional ones alike  wemust never lose sight of uncontroverted historicalexperience - namely  that the role and  hence  theresponsibility  of the small and the greatest components andlines of force in international life are not and cannot beidentical throughout all events  times and circumstances.Because of this we should continue to build globalorganization on the efficient activity of the Security Counciland  within it  on the role and responsibility of its permanentmembers.The central point with reference to the efficient role ofthe Security Council  and of the entire United Nations  is theneed to develop a new foundation for peace mediation.Established in cold-war times  the mechanism was adjustedto the need to prevent the outbreak and spread of conflictbetween the blocs  or between their dependants in the thirdworld  with long-term freezing of conflict as the goal.Today peace mediation requires a much more active andflexible approach  first of all because of the need andpossibility of preventive action  but also because of aselective use of force in the implementation of peaceagreements and Security Council decisions. The example ofmy country  the Republic of Croatia  and that of theneighbouring Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovinapinpointed most exactly the two fundamental weaknesses ofthe existing peace-keeping-force model and mandate. First the classic mandate  the freezing of the conflict by sustaininga cease-fire  does not resolve the conflict but  rather  createsfurther complications. Second  as has become manifest certain countries whose forces are engaged in theimplementation of the multilateral peace mandate are trying through the members of their peace-keeping units andnegotiation mediators  to pursue their national policies andnot the policy of the Security Council.The reform of the overall peace-operation mechanismrequires  first and foremost  a more efficient use ofcoordinated instruments of diplomatic  economic  politicaland military pressure and consistency in the implementationof the peace-keeping-force mandate. Such an approach which also implies the selective use of force  not only couldhave prevented the escalation of the conflict in the formerYugoslavia but also reduced peace-keeping-forces’ casualtiesto fewer than have actually been the case with the presentstatic mandate  which does not offer adequate protectioneven to the peace-keeping force itself.In recent years extensive positive  but also negative experience has been acquired in the conduct ofpeace-keeping operations in Croatia  Bosnia andHerzegovina  Somalia and Cambodia. It has been found thatpeace-keeping forces should be more qualified and bettertrained and equipped for special missions in each peace-keeping operation. The United Nations should also havegreater authority in the sensitive conduct of peace-keepingoperations. This suggests the need for the establishment ofalready well-trained and prepared national militarycontingents to be available  with all their facilities  to theglobal community. Under the current system  in the best ofcases several months are required for unit selection and theprovision of necessary facilities for the deployment ofpeace-keeping forces in specific areas  which results indelayed action and substantially affects the conditions ofpeace-keeping-mandate implementation. It has also becomeevident that regional organizations  regional militaryalliances and systems in particular  can in the majority ofcases be the main and most efficient mechanism toimplement peace-keeping operations. Peace-keepingoperations are being used at an ever-increasing rate toprevent disastrous humanitarian situations or to alleviate theirconsequences  but they will still have a role to play inpolitical mediation and organization of the basic Stateinstitutions  as well as in supervising political and economicreconstruction in the initial period. Such United Nationsoperations of an increasingly more comprehensive scope callfor the cooperation of the entire international community inthe implementation of regularly highly complex missions.The international community must act through the SecurityCouncil whenever there is obvious aggression against aMember State  as well as in cases where internationalsecurity is seriously threatened. Selective interventionismForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 9mainly has an adverse effect on the reputation and credibilityof the United Nations.Economic sanctions are becoming  at an ever-increasingrate  an instrument of international pressure in the absenceof political will to use stronger means to implement SecurityCouncil resolutions or to protect basic interests of MemberStates and promote international law standards. In our view sanctions can have an effect only if combined with otherinstruments of international pressure and isolation.However  what is also required is a more efficient system ofcompensating those countries which subsequently have tobear  with no guilt on their part  the burden of sanctionsagainst specific regimes. A more effective system is alsoneeded to supervise the implementation of sanctions throughthe enforcement of ""sanctions imposed for violations ofsanctions"". In the opposite case  the sanctions  to be sure will have a long-term effect  but before the ultimateobjective is achieved the highest price will be paid by theinnocent population of the affected country  by people whocannot deal by themselves with the internationally censuredregime.The democratization of international relations and a newmultilateralism also imply a greater commitment of theinternational community to the safeguarding and respect ofhuman rights  the punishment of the violators ofhumanitarian and war law and the protection of theecological balance of the planet. Although we uphold theview that the defence of cardinal rights and international lawstandards cannot take precedence over the sovereignty ofUnited Nations Member States  regimes and individuals thatviolate such rights and standards may not be allowed to hidebehind the principle of ""non-interference with internalmatters of countries"". Balance should be sought inreconciling the two approaches  and the ways in which  andconditions under which  international mechanisms can be setin motion ought to be codified in the safeguarding ofuniversal human rights and interests in order to preservepeace and the international order.Because of its own experience - the orchestrated militaryrevolt of part of the Serbian population organized fromBelgrade  resulting in the occupation of one quarter ofCroatia’s territory - the Republic of Croatia supportscooperation with the international community in theidentification and incorporation of the highest standards ofprotection of the Serbian minority into Croatian legislation.We accept international supervision of their implementationin the interest of inter-ethnic reconciliation confidence-building and the future stability of the countryand the greater area.Of course  the responsibility which the United Nationsshould assume at an ever-increasing rate in crisis areas relief operations  protection of the environment andassurance of balanced development  as well as in otherissues of general interest  requires vast financial resources.It is not surprising  therefore  that the regular budget and thefinancing of peace-keeping operations have assumed suchkey importance among the matters to be discussed at this the forty-eighth  session of the General Assembly. Part ofthese outlays can be reduced by a more economical use ofexisting resources and by improving the efficiency of theUnited Nations system itself. We should prevent UnitedNations actions from becoming an end in themselves  andavenues should also be explored towards greaterprogramming coordination with other organizations andinitiatives within the international system. Greater careought to be exercised in preventing all instances of abuseand corruption within the United Nations system  becausethey not only increase the cost but also undermine thereputation of the global Organization.The global community is saddled with many adversitiesand crises  but the international order is neverthelessbecoming more and more settled. We are encouraged by thefact that  after half a century of Israeli-Arab conflict  theway has finally been paved towards more stable peace in theMiddle East. This example can also be instructive withregard to the solution of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.It demonstrates the practical use and advantage of carefullyworded agreements which are possible especially when theirresolution actively involves the leading world power as well.Such cases call on both sides for statesmanship and couragein making concessions for the sake of peace and requirerealism in the assessment of national interests with regard toobjective international circumstances and the particularhistorical moment. The statesmen involved  and theresponsible officers of the global Organization  are expectedto be reasonable and principled  determined but alsomoderate  in a way allowing for no narrow-mindedradicalism  but tending rather to seek the most favourablesolution for the protection of peace and the internationalorder.We are also encouraged to see that conditions are beingestablished for the withdrawal of the peace-keeping forcesfrom Cambodia early next year. This gives us hope that asimilar process will also be completed in the Republic ofCroatia in the immediate future  and in Bosnia andHerzegovina in the nearest possible future.We welcome the evident progress attained in thetransfer of power to the black majority in the South African10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionRepublic. We hope that the sporadic cases of racial andpolitical violence in that country are only aftershocksfollowing the major political shifts towards racial toleranceand democratization of political life in that country. We areconvinced that the international community will also find themeans to succeed in the already initiated and then haltedprocess of political stabilization in Angola and Mozambique.We also believe that resoluteness of the United Nations isalso required in the area of the former Yugoslavia  just as ithas been in Somalia  in terms of selective use of force protection of the peace force and assurance of relief. But inSomalia as well  the international community must alsoassume broader responsibilities in the restoration of the basicfunctions of the State and in the establishment of law andorder in that country. It is obvious that differences in theapproach to the solution of problems which frustrate theefficiency of the peace-keeping forces stem not fromoperative but from political reasons.The Republic of Croatia welcomes the efforts of theConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  theEuropean Community and the United Nations to mediatepeace in the conflicts between or within the former Sovietrepublics  and we express our readiness to take part in thesepeace efforts. Fortified by its own experience  Croatia willbe ready  especially after the end of the war in the Republic to contribute even more to the new mission of peace-keepingoperations throughout the world.As a country of outstanding natural attractions  but alsoof a very vulnerable environmental system  the Republic ofCroatia will consistently implement the commitments of theAction Plan - Agenda 21 - the conclusions of the Conferenceon the Environment and Development and the Riodeclarations.Croatia believes that support of the programme ofsustainable development is the proper way towards thegradual bridging of the growing developmental gap betweenthe North and the South  which is a permanent source ofpolitical and social instability and ecological imbalance inspecific areas and in the world as a whole.The crisis in the area of the former Yugoslavia is themost difficult crisis in the world today  and it cannot beresolved without a more determined role on the part of theinternational community. Past mediation efforts have beenshown to be insufficient because they were limited by amandate lacking firmness  but also rendered more difficultby the diverse political interests of individual external forces.It has not been sufficient to try to freeze the conflict  sendin humanitarian aid and engage in empty threats  thusallowing the crisis to deteriorate to the point where""everybody would get tired of waging war"" and then agreeto a political settlement. The initial aggression of theYugoslav communist army  Serbia and Montenegro  for theconquest of Croat and Muslim territories was not counteredby determined steps  and the consequences of such a policyhave been disastrous. They have included first and foremostthe terrible destruction and ""ethnic cleansing"" in areasconquered by the Serbs  and then the extension of theconflict to the Muslim and Croat sides as well  the strugglefor the remaining territory  the incessant growth of the deathtoll  and the ever swelling tide of refugees  which has nowexceeded the figure of one million agonized men  womenand children.In the Republic of Croatia the United NationsProtection Force (UNPROFOR) mandate achieved certaininitial results in putting a stop to fighting and providing forthe withdrawal of the Yugoslav army. However  themandate has been misused by the Serbian extremistinsurgents and their promoters  the Belgrade expansionists to freeze territorial gains  continue ""ethnic cleansing "" andconsolidate occupation which has assumed forms ofterrorism even at the expense of the local Serbianpopulation. The international community has allowed theSerbian side to completely ignore all Security Councilresolutions and other agreements  in spite of the fact that themodalities of resolving the conflict have been clearly andwell defined: complete cease-fire and the disarmament ofSerbian paramilitary units; the return of all refugees anddisplaced persons to their homes; the normalization of trafficand supply; the guarantee of extensive ethnic rights to theSerbian minority within the scope of the territorial integrityand sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia; the gradualreinstatement of Croatian authorities and of law and order inthe occupied areas; confidence-building measures; schedulingof elections for local self-government authorities; andgeneral amnesty for all persons not found guilty of warcrimes.Owing to the lack of determination on the part of theinternational community in the implementation of theUNPROFOR mandate  the Republic of Croatia has founditself  through no fault of its own  in a position wherepressure is being brought to bear on it  including eventhreats of sanctions  because it is trying to deal with its vitalcommunications problems  or prevent Croatian towns frombeing shelled from areas under the protection of thepeace-keeping forces. Thus  Croatia is being taken to taskfor reinstating civilian traffic across the Maslenica Strait  onwhich a million people in southern Croatia and parts ofBosnia and Herzegovina depend. Croatia is first urged toForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 11negotiate and normalize relations with Belgrade  and thenaccused of doing so. Meanwhile  nothing efficient is beingdone to disarm Serbian paramilitary units and to preventSerbian extremism and terrorism in the United Nationsprotected areas.One of the basic concepts of our policy has been theguarantee of the most comprehensive rights for allminorities - including of course the Serbian minority as awhole  and particularly in the areas of Croatia in which theSerbs constituted a majority before the war - in the interestof the future permanent stability of the Croatian State and ofits role within the international order. However  at the sametime the Serbian insurgents must provide for the return ofhundreds of thousands of displaced Croats and othernon-Serbian citizens to their homes in the areas under theprotection of the peace-keeping forces. Belgrade mustfinally recognize the Republic of Croatia and its borders  asthe whole world has already done. Croatia cannot toleratea situation in which the Serbian minority abuses its rights inorder to break up the Croatian State or to create the legalframework for the secession of territories under localself-government and their annexation to the ""federation ofSerbian lands"". This would mean the realization of theGreater Serbia idea  which was precisely the underlyingmotive of the present war against Croatia and Bosnia andHerzegovina. The sanctions against Serbia and Montenegromust remain in force until peace is achieved in Croatia  too and not only in Bosnia and Herzegovina  as is also providedfor by the respective Security Council resolutions. Croatiaresolutely urges the consistent and effective implementationof all Security Council resolutions - no more  but no lesseither.Croatia has shown extreme patience within the scope ofendeavours for a peaceful settlement of the conflict with theSerbian minority  orchestrated during the time the formersocialist Yugoslavia was disintegrating and the democraticState of Croatia was being established. However  Croatiacannot tolerate indefinitely the occupation of its territories the pressure of the hundreds of thousands of displacedpersons from Croatian areas  and a situation in which theState is split. Croatia can no longer be forced to accept thefourth extension of the UNPROFOR mandate if the missionof the peace-keeping forces is not specified in more resoluteterms  and if the Serbs are not given an ultimatum toimplement the Vance Plan and all relevant Security Councilresolutions. The means used to bring about Serbianwithdrawal from Igman and Bjelasnica - military strikes -must also be applied in Croatia.The Republic of Croatia is not pleased with the latestreport of the United Nations Secretary-General  whichsuggests the extension of the UNPROFOR mandate inCroatia by six months  with no essential changes in respectof the present mandate. If the UNPROFOR mandate is notamended within the next 48 hours to ensure energeticimplementation of the relevant resolutions and otherdocuments of the Security Council  the Republic of Croatiawill be forced to renounce the United Nations peace-keepingoperation on its territory and to request units to abandonCroatia not later than 30 November 1993. Maintenance ofthe status quo  which is nothing but the occupation of partof Croatian territory  and the inefficiency of UNPROFORare detrimental to the sovereignty of the Republic of Croatiaand to the normalization of its economic and overall life.Croatia is prepared to resolve the key problem of itsexistence by all necessary means and at any cost - bynegotiated agreement and settlement if possible  but  ifnecessary  by resort to legitimate means of restoring law andorder  with full observance of laws governing war andhumanitarian affairs  in areas currently suffering the anarchyof Serbian terrorist and paramilitary troops.With its involvement in the area of the formerYugoslavia  UNPROFOR has borne a great burden and hassuffered considerable casualties  operating in extremelydifficult circumstances. Croatia is grateful to allUNPROFOR members who have performed their dutybravely and honourably  risking their personal safety andtheir lives  and helping thousands of suffering people.Croatia does not oppose UNPROFOR  but it can no longertolerate the consequences of the Force’s inefficiency and itspersistent circumventing of relevant Security Councilresolutions. The implementation of these provisions willaffect not only the existence of the Republic of Croatia butalso the basic credibility of the United Nations.By renouncing the UNPROFOR mandate  Croatia doesnot close its doors to any humanitarian action or to thepossibility of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)operation in the former Yugoslavia. On the contrary Croatia welcomes the readiness of NATO to assume the roleof principal guarantor of peace and stability in this part ofEurope  and will actively support its units in theimplementation of the peace settlement. We also lookforward to seeing NATO involved in the implementation ofthe Vance plan. At the same time  Croatia’s door is beingopened wide to all relief and human rights organizations European Community monitors and UNPROFOR civilianlogistic personnel engaged in the provision of relief to theRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionInternational factors - I refer to the EuropeanCommunity and the United Nations - have brought thenegotiations on resolutions of the crisis in Bosnia andHerzegovina to the settlement currently proposed. It shouldbe remembered that the Republic of Croatia and the Croatsin Bosnia and Herzegovina were the first to support allserious peace plans put forward by the internationalcommunity. However  the indecision and inconsistency ofthe international community have allowed both the Serbianand the Muslim representatives to reject or to flout theseplans. Even the proclamation of independence of theRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina would have beenimpossible without the agreement of the Croats  expressedthrough the 1992 referendum. Without the resistance put upby the Croats  no part of Bosnia and Herzegovina wouldhave been defended  in the beginning  from Serbianaggression. We were the first to recognize the Republic ofBosnia and Herzegovina  and the first to send an ambassadorto Sarajevo. The Republic of Croatia has contributed moreto the defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina  and to the care ofBosnian refugees  than have all other countries combined and that situation continues despite the aggression waged bythe Muslim army against Croatian populated areas in centralBosnia and against territory envisaged for the CroatianRepublic within the Union of Republics of Bosnia andHerzegovina.In view of past developments  there are no longer anycompletely equitable and clear-cut solutions to the complexBosnian crisis. If peace is to be achieved  all the partiesmust accept political and territorial compromise. The Croatsin Bosnia have made major concessions for the sake ofpeace. They have lost the most  especially in Posavina andCentral Bosnia  where the majority of the Croatianpopulation used to live. They have agreed to accept18 per cent of territory although the previous Vance-Owenplan envisaged a share of about 27 per cent. Indeed  forstrategic  political and psychological reasons  the Croatianside cannot agree to any further concessions.It should be remembered that in 1948 the Croatsaccounted for 23.9 per cent of the Bosnian population. Thatproportion declined as a result of the pressure of thehegemonistic policies of the Serbs and then of the Muslims.In the search for a solution  the same principles must beapplied throughout. One might ask  for instance  whyMostar  along with Sarajevo  is being singled out forEuropean Community supervision. Why not Banja Luka andZenica or Vare  where the Croatian population is strugglingfor survival?What about the fact that  as a result of Serbian and thenMuslim aggression  two thirds of Catholic parishes in Bosniaand Herzegovina have been occupied or completely cleansedof the Croats who lived there for centuries? Theinternational community must face facts and problems intheir entirety. It must identify ways of halting Serbianaggression  but also means of protecting the Croatian peoplefrom the attempts of extremists to set up a Bosnian Islamicstate  mostly at the expense of the Croats.Nevertheless  I am pleased to report  here and now  thathostilities between the Croat and Serbian sides in Bosnia andHerzegovina have stopped and  in particular  that  on myinitiative and with the good offices of Turkey  politicalagreement has been reached between the Croats and theMuslims concerning the cessation of hostilities and theprovision of the prerequisites for permanent peace andcooperation.We believe that the purpose of peace would be servedby NATO’s energetic assumption of the chief role inimplementing the peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovinaand in solving the problem of the United Nations protectedareas in Croatia  with the United Nations assumingresponsibility for implementation of the peace settlement.For geopolitical  historical and economic reasons  aswell as for the sake of transport links  the Republic ofCroatia is interested in the closest future cooperation withthe Union of Republics of Bosnia and Herzegovina. By thesame token  the Republic of Croatia supports thenormalization of relations with all States that emergedfollowing the disintegration of Communist Yugoslavia  onthe basis of mutual recognition. This is not only in theinterests of the peoples of these States; it is also aprerequisite for the establishment of peace and for thecreation of a stable international order in this part of theworld."
"72",3062,"HTI",48,1993,"For the Haitian delegation  the assumption of the presidencyof the General Assembly by  for the first time ever  arepresentative of the Caribbean is a source of pride andsatisfaction. I should like to convey to you  Mr. President the warm congratulations of the President  the Governmentand the people of the Republic of Haiti on your unanimouselection and their best wishes for success in yourendeavours. Your selection is undoubtedly a manifestationof the well-founded acknowledgement of your eminentpersonal qualities and rich diplomatic experience  and alsoattests to the growing role of your country  the Republic ofGuyana  in international relations.I wish also to congratulate your predecessor  Mr.Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria  who successfully directed theAssembly’s work at its forty-seventh session.This is also an opportunity for me to express ourprofound appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for his remarkable efforts in the cause ofpeace and for the new dynamics that he has stamped on theOrganization.As the century draws to a close  history is being madeat a remarkable pace. Every day there are important eventsthat put international life on a new course because of theprofound impact they have on the destiny of peoples. Itseems to us that  at the dawn of the third millennium  theworld is seeking new direction. Respect for the person  theneed for democracy and fundamental freedoms and theclimate of peace to which peoples throughout the worldaspire: these concepts are taking concrete form in majorevents that attract our attention today. In the search for anew dimension to give to peace  leaders in various parts ofthe world have begun a dialogue that  in the past  wasthought impossible.This is the case in the Middle East  where  afterdecades of hostility  Israelis and Palestinians have embarkedon the path to a historic rapprochement  which we hope willbe of benefit to the two peoples and the entire region.Forty-eighth session - 11 October l993 9Likewise  recent developments in South Africa -notably the establishment of the Transitional ExecutiveCouncil and the announcement that free elections are to beheld on 27 April 1994 on the basis of universal suffrage -signal the long-awaited building of a multi-racial  democraticand united society.Following two decades of civil war  Cambodia is at lastexperiencing a period of peace. This has made possible theholding of democratic general elections and theestablishment of a legitimate Government.After 12 years of armed conflict  El Salvador  with thesigning of the Mexico Agreements  is moving towards theconsolidation of peace.We must note that  in all continents  considerableprogress is being made in the search for peace  although theexistence of hotbeds of tension of all types - fuelled by among other factors  racial  ethnic  tribal or clandifferences - indicates that dialogue  which alone can ensureharmonious human coexistence  is not always achievedspontaneously.The United Nations has played a decisive role in themediation aimed at securing a negotiated settlement of thesecrises. We support the Secretary-General’s sustained effortsto contribute to the process of bringing peace to thesepeoples  whose pain  privation and distress resonate deeplyin the hearts of the Haitian people. There is no doubt thatthe concepts of preventive diplomacy  maintenance of peace restoration of peace and peace building that are developed inthe Secretary-General’s ""Agenda for Peace"" are guidingprinciples for this Organization in its action to guaranteeinternational peace and security.But  in order to meet the diverse challenges confrontingit and to respond to the expectations placed in it  the UnitedNations must adapt to a new reality and must have adequatemeans to do so. In this context  the Haitian delegationsupports the process of reform and restructuring aimed atincreasing the Organization’s effectiveness. We believe thatUnited Nations activities in the field of economic and socialdevelopment should be given at least as much attention asthat accorded to peace-keeping operations.Unquestionably  the ""Agenda for Peace"" provides theOrganization with a point of reference  which enables us toapproach the problems of peace in a global environment thatis in a state of change and compels us to reflect on thequestion of what constitutes the very foundations of peace.Some say that peace is indissociably related to democracyand development. We share this view. Without peace  therecan be no development  and  without development andrespect for human rights  one cannot expect social peace.My Government  which was established as a result ofthe Governors Island Agreements  believes that thefundamental principles proclaimed in the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights and in the Haitian Constitutionshould be constantly in our minds  motivating us to provideall the better for the well-being of our people.For two years the Haitian people has been waging anearnest and constant struggle for the restoration ofdemocracy in Haiti and of the fundamental rights that werestolen from it in the coup d’état of 30 September 1991.Today  thanks to the constant support of the internationalcommunity  we are on the eve of turning this painful pagein the history of our country. In this respect  we should liketo express warm thanks to the Special Envoy of the UnitedNations Secretary-General and the Organization of AmericanStates for his inestimable achievement. We hope that weshall be able to continue to cooperate with him towardssecuring a definitive settlement of the Haitian crisis.As members know  the Governors Island Agreementwas signed on 3 July 1993. That instrument sets themodalities for the restoration of constitutional order anddemocracy in Haiti.On 30 August a Prime Minister  chosen in accordancewith our Constitution  took office  and a consensusGovernment was established. The economic measures thathad been adopted by the Security Council were suspended and they will be lifted definitively at the end of thetransitional process. Technical assistance  to strengthen theinstitutions and to consolidate democracy  is taking shapethrough the United Nations Mission in Haiti  which isalready beginning to be deployed.With a view to fostering national reconciliation t h ePresident of the Republic has granted an amnesty in respectof political offences committed during the period of the coupd’état.Other steps remain to be taken before October 30  whenHis Excellency Mr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide  thedemocratically elected President  returns to Haiti to take upagain the mandate conferred upon him by the Haitian people.None the less  recent events  characterized by anupsurge of violence  greatly discredit the political will of theother party to respect scrupulously all the terms of theGovernors Island Agreement and the New York Pact. Justa few hours ago  armed groups demonstrated at Port-au-10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionPrince to oppose the arrival of the members of the technicalmission of the United Nations. The national radio stationwas under assault by armed individuals manifestly opposedto a peaceful settlement of the crisis. Such behaviour clearlyjeopardizes the success of the Governors Island Agreement.The setting up of such institutionalized mechanisms ofviolence and intimidation by factions opposing theestablishment of democracy and the growing number ofhuman-rights violations worry us  because they reveal thedeliberate bad faith of institutions whose function it isprecisely to safeguard security and our citizens’ exercise oftheir rights.Aware that this situation cannot go on  we send outfrom this rostrum a sincere appeal to all those who wish ingood will to build a better life today and a better future forthe children of Haiti and to give to our country anopportunity to renew its path of progress. We also appeal tothe international community to maintain its pressure so thatthe minority forces opposing the democratic aspirations ofthe Haitian people will find themselves completely isolatedand so that they will have no choice other than dialogue andreconciliation.The return of constitutional order in Haiti is part of thegenuine international political plan for which we havefought  and it symbolizes at the same time an effort for ademocratization process in Haiti and  at the world level  thetriumph of law  supported by the moral solidarity of theinternational community.The free and honest elections of 16 December 1990 which brought President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power represent the country’s first democratic experience since itsindependence  the first application of the HaitianConstitution of 1987 and  above all  the first step towardsguaranteeing the rights of the citizen. Our experiences overthe past two years have convinced us that the protection ofdemocracy and fundamental rights is a cause that transcendsour national borders and takes on an international dimension.The return of constitutional order in Haiti will be avictory of the State and the rule of law over totalitarianismand imposture  an ongoing struggle that unites us all andmakes it possible for us to confront those who jeopardizepeace.We know that in the absence of democracy and therefore  in the absence of the institutions and structures ofthe rule of law  the protection of human rights would bequixotic and ineffectual  especially in my country. Thisdemocracy requires real participation  pluralistic andtransparent. This democracy  in our view  cannot mean onlythe holding of periodic elections; it means  rather  acollective way of life in an adapted economy.The invaluable support of the international communitywill make possible the return of constitutional order in mycountry  and we shall apply all our national resources to theconstruction of a State where the rule of law genuinelyprevails  a State that does not content itself merely withguaranteeing public freedoms  but that also seeks to promoteequality and solidarity. This is the challenge we shall try tomeet  because we firmly believe that a State in which all itschildren cannot live because of dictatorship and barbarism isunacceptable at the dawning of the twenty-first century.The political stakes the international community mustface are compounded by economic  social and culturalchallenges. Poverty  ignorance and the scourge of diseaseare still negative factors threatening the very cohesion ofStates and continuing to cause gross imbalances in thecountries of the South  especially the least developed amongthem. An unbridled imitation of Western models has ledsome countries to ignore almost completely the value oftheir heritage of creativity and wisdom and their enterprisingspirit. The result is the absence of a cultural dimension ofdevelopment and a lack of participation by an importantsector of their societies: the most impoverished sector which is unable to protest  or to protect its own interests  asector made up especially of women  children and themasses of disenfranchised poor.Efforts have been made at the national  regional andinternational levels. A certain amount of progress has beenachieved. In spite of all that  the values proposed -entrepreneurship  growth  profit and so on - remaininaccessible to the great majority of people living in thecountries of the South. This poses a grave threat to one ofthe very cornerstones of human rights: the right todevelopment.Day by day the world is becoming increasinglyinterdependent and  in a sense  increasingly integrated. Weare confronting a profound transition that promises to becomplex and hazardous. We must do our best so that thisglobalization  this world economy  will not further widen thegap between North and South. The absence of an equitablesystem is being felt increasingly. The South remains in aposition of subordination and dependence which prevents itfrom managing this new world order well. Global initiativesare indeed necessary. As we approach the twenty-firstcentury a profound reform of the international system particularly in the fields of trade  finance and technology has become vitally important. I do mean profound reform Forty-eighth session - 11 October l993 11a reform that will bring about a restructured dialoguebetween North and South; a reform that will lead to viableand sustainable economic growth for the countries of bothNorth and South  a growth which will be measured not onlyby growth in gross national product but also by certain socialand political achievements; the access by all without anydiscrimination to fundamental services such as food  health-care  housing and appropriate education; and access to ademocratic form of government and effective system ofjustice to protect all the people.Lasting  bold and courageous solutions must be foundif we truly want to lift the barriers that prevent the economicdevelopment of the group of countries to which we belong.The questions of debt  delays in the flow of technology of capital  and of direct investment to the countries of theSouth  the constant decline in the prices of commodities worsening access to markets and deterioration in the termsof trade are all questions that need to be discussed seriouslyby the international community if we are to arrive at a betterbalanced  new international economic order.The Republic of Haiti  which over the past two yearshas experienced a situation that the Security Councildescribed as unique and exceptional  is now at a crossroads.In order to restore the process of democracy and the rule oflaw in the country the population of Haiti and its legitimateGovernment have made enormous sacrifices. Thesesacrifices  together with a long history of corruption  denialof rights  and plundering  have led to disaster at theeconomic  social and environmental levels. Whole sectorsof national production have been destructured and theenvironment has been dramatically affected. The social costof a return to democracy is extremely high and has thereforein advance jeopardized all future endogenous developmentefforts.That is why we ask for the unfailing support andbacking of the international community  which  we feel should in the short-  medium- and long-term involvesubstantial  increased and strengthened technical andfinancial cooperation.The time has come to transform the vast upsurge ofsolidarity which we have seen in the course of the past twoyears  into a powerful  concerted effort at open  fruitful andsubstantially enhanced cooperation.The Organization  better than anyone  is aware of thebreadth of the challenges today confronting the Governmentof Haiti. It would be futile to hope for a strengthening ofthe rule of law  which remains our priority objective  if weare not able rapidly to alleviate the enormous distress facingthe overwhelming majority of the Haitian people.We want to be assured that today as in the past theOrganization will continue to stand by us at this crucialstage  as a result of which socio-economic conditions shouldbe substantially improved in a Haiti that is reconciled withitself and in which rights and freedoms flourish.While we recognize that no price can be placed onpeace we do believe that it requires dialogue andreconciliation  without which the process of transition cannotlead to lasting democracy.The fashioning of a new world has been the sharedresponsibility of us all since the founding of theOrganization in 1945. At the San Francisco Conference theHaitian delegation  imbued with the historic responsibility ofbeing the first black republic in the world  had understood above and beyond the inspiration of the day which led to theestablishment of the United Nations  that the Organizationrepresented an opportunity not only for our island nation butalso for all responsible countries that would join thiscommunity of nations.We want to take this opportunity to extend a warmwelcome to the new Member States and we hope that the adhoc committee which is to study the question of Taiwan willfind a solution that is satisfactory to all the partiesconcerned  in keeping with the fundamental principles ofinternational law.Let us take the tremendous opportunity being given tous today to build the new world that generations of men andwomen are awaiting; let us take this opportunity to help eachother by establishing a continuous dialogue between Northand South in order to find urgent responses and solutions tothe problem of underdevelopment and poverty  that ailmentof our century which has shaken mankind. May dialoguebecome our password."
"73",3108,"HUN",48,1993,"Allow me to expressmy warmest congratulations to Ambassador Insanally  on hiselection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. I should also like to welcome into our midstAndorra  the Czech Republic  Eritrea  the former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia  Monaco and Slovakia  whose recentadmissions have brought the United Nations even closer tobecoming truly universal.During the last year  the international communitycontinued to face extremely grave challenges. This periodhas seen  along with certain positive achievements  morealarming failures and disappointments. The questions towhich we have to respond take us back once again to thebasic problem of multilateralism  that is to say  to definingin our complex world the values that can ensure a cohesionwhich is necessary for our common will to be translated intojoint action.The fall of communist dictatorships in Central andEastern Europe and the end of super-Power confrontationhave brought about an international political climate inwhich new approaches can be found in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and the resolution of globalproblems. They are based on greater opportunities for closerinteraction and the participation of each and every UnitedNations Member State in managing and influencing thecourse of events. These opportunities and the ability of theinternational community to turn them into tangible results aremanifest in the conflict-resolution processes in CentralAmerica and South-East Asia  in the resolute reversal ofbrutal aggression in the Gulf  in the fundamentaltransformation we are witnessing in South Africa and in thehistoric agreement in the Middle East. These evolutionsclearly demonstrate that with political courage far-sightedness and readiness for compromise  even the mostintractable problems can be untangled and resolved. Theyshow us an example that ought to be emulated in all regionsof the world.The convulsions of the new era of world history arestrongly felt in a country like Hungary which  as it has sooften in its history  finds itself again close to conflict-riddenareas. Despite the difficulties that inevitably accompany thehistoric transition processes of the region  the HungarianGovernment  ever since it took office in 1990  has beenstriving consistently and successfully to maintain thecountry’s internal stability and to ensure that it remains amainstay of stability in our troubled region. Stability shouldbe omnipresent and universal  and we have to find theappropriate ways and means to achieve it.As regards the old continent  Hungary wants to seedemocracy  prosperity  security and the institutions  such asthe Council of Europe  the European Community and theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) that lie at itsfoundation  gradually expand eastward.For some time now the world has been living in theshadow of events that ominously remind us of the darkestperiods in the history of mankind. The conflict in theformer Yugoslavia has been raging for more than two years.But most regrettably  not even the worst cases of disregardfor the norms of international law and the principlesenshrined in the Charter  not even the gravest crimes againsthumanity and the most brutal mass violations of fundamentalhuman and minority rights  have proven to be sufficient topersuade the world  when there was still time  to counteraggression promptly and effectively  to prevent theacquisition of territory by use of force and to take a firmstand against the abhorrent policy of ""ethnic cleansing"".The end result of such policies of passivity appeasement and complacency  of the striking lack of anability to learn from past experiences and of the absence ofthe necessary political will to act  is well documented righthere  in this building  in a shocking and soul-stirring photoexhibition about the horrors of war in the former Yugoslavia.It brings home a painful awareness of the practicalconsequences of unbridled extreme nationalism and thecompelling message not to relax and relent in our national regional and international efforts to uphold in anuncompromising manner the purposes and principles of theCharter.Forty-eighth session - 30 September l993 19The renewal of Central and Eastern Europe and theeconomic and social processes there have thrown to thesurface tendencies of political and ethnic fundamentalismwhich  having been elevated to the level of official Statepolicy  have unleashed or could lead to conflicts threateningthe security of the whole of Europe. In our interdependentworld  every nation on Earth  irrespective of where it issituated  should realize the danger of this venomouscontagion if it were allowed to spread across our planet.The people and the Government of Hungary continueto follow the developments of the crisis in the formerYugoslavia with utmost concern. As a country immediatelyadjacent to the crisis area  Hungary has sought to avoidbeing dragged into this conflict  while continuing at the sametime to voice its principled position on the crisis and abidingby the relevant decisions of the international community.One has to reckon with the fact that this crisis is notlimited to the war-torn areas of Bosnia and Croatia. Itfesters in Serbia proper  where there is growing pressure onthe different ethnic communities inhabiting the country including the Hungarian community in Vojvodina. In thisformerly autonomous province  the successive waves ofintimidation and discrimination have already significantlyreduced both the size and the proportion of the Hungarianminority. There continues to be a constant threat of afurther massive influx of refugees into Hungary  I am afraid.In the conditions prevailing in Serbia and Montenegro  justas in other parts of the former Yugoslavia  it is of utmostimportance to seek adequate international protection for theseethnic communities and national minorities. Indeed  one ofthe key issues in settling the crisis is to ensure their rightswithout any discrimination  whether they have majority orminority status  with the same norms and standards applyingto each and every one of them.Because of its geographical situation  Hungary findsitself confronted with special economic problems arisingfrom the implementation of sanctions imposed by theSecurity Council against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia(Serbia and Montenegro). Our economic and financial lossesdirectly attributable to the effects of implementing thesanctions are constantly growing  and have now reached $1billion. We highly appreciate the steps taken so far by theSecurity Council vis-à-vis those countries that have sufferedeconomic losses and have made use of their right to consultthe Security Council under Article 50 of the Charter. Wetrust that the international organizations and institutionsconcerned will find early solutions to help alleviate thosepressing problems. It is clear from the experience gained inconnection with the various sanctions regimes in place thatattention from the international community commensuratewith the scale of the problems caused to third countries isrequired in order to examine how best we can establish aneffective mechanism for the implementation of Article 50.Without such a mechanism  the burden placed on anever-growing number of countries fulfilling theirinternational obligations will remain disproportionately andunjustly heavy.In this connection  it is totally unacceptable to takeretaliatory measures in response to actions by any State infulfilment of its obligations under the Charter. Therefore illegal measures such as attempts to block free and safenavigation on the Danube river  which is an internationalwaterway vital for many countries of Europe  warrantinternational action  and the States concerned rightly expectthe international organizations to provide effective assistancein this matter.In the light of recent bitter experiences  we havebecome more acutely aware that the world cannot be madea safer place unless there are international organizations ableand willing to take resolute and timely action. Multilateraldiplomacy must be at its best if it is to offer remedies whereother possibilities for preventing or settling conflicts havebeen exhausted. We consider it especially important that thevarious tools of preventive diplomacy and crisis managementshould be constantly at the disposal of the internationalcommunity.Hungary is highly interested in the ongoing work aimedat a comprehensive review and enhancement of the UnitedNations peace-keeping  peacemaking and peace- buildingactivities. Many substantive proposals have been made anduseful observations put forward in this regard. We hope thatthey will assist in our endeavours to carry out genuine andpurpose-oriented reform measures in the world Organization.We expect that the present session of the General Assemblywill move us ahead in the debate on how to bring certainprovisions of the Charter into line with the changing realitiesof our world. Conditions seem ripe today for giving mostserious consideration to questions relating to the review ofthe Charter. The fundamental aim of such a review is tomake the United Nations function better. At the same time it should in no way undermine the effectiveness of thedecision-making processes at the United Nations. In thiscontext  Hungary fully understands the pressing financialsituation of the world Organization and  as its contributionto redressing this state of affairs  has  as of this year eliminated all its arrears to the regular budget.20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionIn our view  there are  inter alia  two particular areaswhere a review of the provisions of the Charter is needed.First  there is a long-overdue need for a review of thoseCharter provisions that imply a distinction between UnitedNations Member States on the basis of their status ofsignatory or enemy State. On the eve of the fiftiethanniversary of the birth of the United Nations  theelimination of this obsolete distinction would be more thana gesture towards a number of countries that have  over theyears  fully proved their commitment to the purposes andprinciples enshrined in the Charter. Secondly  the roleplayed in today’s world politics by some States and theircontribution to the realization of the purposes and principlesof the Charter justify their more intimate involvement in themaintenance of international peace and security. We areaware that the issue of the enlargement of the permanentmembership of the Security Council will be the subject offurther discussions. However  we believe that two countries- Germany and Japan - already qualify to play the enhancedrole that would stem from permanent membership in theSecurity Council.My Government continues to believe that the UnitedNations provides a most fitting framework for translatinginto reality our global responsibility for the internationalprotection of human rights. It is our deep conviction that theSecurity Council should pay appropriate attention  and actresolutely and promptly  as part of its preventive actions  tomass infringements of human and minority rights  since theyconstitute threats to regional and international peace andsecurity.We should pursue an effective integration of humanrights elements into the workings of the whole UnitedNations system. Hungary supports the early establishmentof a post of high commissioner for human rights. Anappropriate mandate from this session of the GeneralAssembly could ensure  through this new institution  anadequate presence for human rights elements  particularly inthe various fields of early warning  conflict management peace-keeping and peace-making  electoral assistance andpost-conflict peace-building. The high commissioner couldmake the human rights activities of the United Nations moretransparent to world public opinion. We intend to lend ourfull support to a mandate for the high commissioner thatwould also cover the protection and promotion of minorityrights. In our view  the high commissioner could also playa major role in raising public awareness of the positivemodels of multinational coexistence and minority protectionsystems that are functioning well in various democraticcountries of the world. Here I can refer to the previousspeaker  whose country  I believe  is a good example of this.We believe that this task is of major importance and hasnever been higher on the agenda than it is today. Theapplication or adaptation of these successful solutions to thespecific circumstances prevailing in other parts of the worldcould greatly contribute to a more satisfactory human rightssituation in our world at the end of this turbulent century.I have obviously not exhausted all the problemsbesetting the world. Our Governments today have anenormous responsibility to find answers to the newchallenges. If we fail to act now  we risk losing all theachievements won with the ending of the cold war."
"74",3155,"IDN",48,1993,"Let me first offer mydelegation’s congratulations to Ambassador Insanally ofGuyana on his election as President of the General Assemblyat its forty-eighth session. His elevation to this high officeis a fitting tribute to his personal qualities and record ofdistinguished service to his Government and to theinternational community. We are confident that under hisable guidance we will achieve substantive results in ourwork.I also wish to express our deep appreciation to hispredecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria  for the dedicatedmanner in which he presided over our deliberations duringthe last session.24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionOn behalf of the Government and people ofIndonesia  I extend a warm welcome to the Czech Republicand the Slovak Republic as well as to Macedonia  Eritrea Monaco and Andorra upon their accession to membership ofthe United Nations. We look forward to closely cooperatingwith them.Before proceeding  I should like to convey Indonesia’sprofound sympathy and solidarity with the Government andpeople of India in the wake of the massive human sufferingand destruction visited upon them by the recent devastatingearthquake.This forty-eighth session of the General Assembly isconvened at a time of sweeping global change and transitionsuch as has rarely been experienced in modern history. Ithas given rise to revived hopes and new opportunities aswell as to new risks and uncertainties. As the rigidities ofthe bipolar world have dissolved  earlier expectations for theemergence of a new world order have now given way to thesober realization that  instead  a new world disorder will bewith us for quite some time - a disorder characterized bycontinuing turbulence  instability and unpredictability andoffering an often perplexing panorama of mutuallycontradictory phenomena and processes.The end of the cold war has led to a new climate ininternational relations and a number of encouraging trendsand developments. Renewed confidence in multilateralismas a viable approach to the resolution of the crucial issues ofour time has opened up vast new opportunities for theUnited Nations and a more positive phase in internationalcooperation. Better prospects have emerged for substantiveprogress towards solutions to many regional problems longconsidered to be intractable. In this context  fruitfulcooperation has been established between the United Nationsand various regional organizations  which have acted aspartners in facilitating the peaceful resolution of conflicts.I therefore wholeheartedly agreed with our Secretary-Generalwhen he recently observed that multilateralism today isworking more effectively than ever  as it should  for inessence""Multilateralism is the democracy of internationalsociety."" (The New York Times  20 August 1993 p. A 29  ""Don’t Make the U.N.’s Job Harder"")In South Africa the new round of negotiations whichbegan last April has now yielded agreement on theestablishment of a multiracial Transitional Executive Counciland is progressing towards democratic elections early nextyear. Elsewhere in Africa  despite formidable difficultiesand obstacles  practical frameworks for the resolution ofissues have begun to take shape. In Latin America we aregratified to see an end to conflicts and the strengthening ofsecurity as well as political  economic and socialdevelopment. In the Middle East a historic breakthrough hasbeen achieved in the Arab-Israeli peace process. And in theGulf region  there has been demarcation of the land borderbetween Iraq and Kuwait  under the auspices of the UnitedNations  which we hope will be a further contribution to theimprovement of the political and security environment in thatregion.Recent developments have brought about a distinctimprovement in the overall political climate in theAsia-Pacific region as well. Relations between countries thatwere once at odds with each other have normalized and arebeing continually enhanced. In Cambodia the final phase ofthe peace process based on the Paris Agreements has beenconsummated and has led to the rebirth of a revitalized anddemocratic Cambodia.With the dissipation of the East-West confrontation questions relating to disarmament and security have acquireda totally new dimension. Scenarios of deterrence havebecome irrelevant  while strategic premises that once guidednuclear-arms control and disarmament efforts have lost theirvalidity. This quantum change has occasioned otherencouraging developments. The successful conclusion ofSTART II between the United States and the RussianFederation has significantly reduced the world’s two biggestnuclear arsenals. Last January more than 130 countriessigned the Convention for the elimination of chemicalweapons  thus proscribing the military use of theseinstruments of death and mass destruction.Last month  as we observed the thirtieth anniversary ofthe signing of the partial test-ban Treaty  I was privileged topreside over the special meeting of the States Parties to theTreaty in the context of the Treaty’s AmendmentConference. There it was resolved that the pursuit of acomprehensive nuclear-test ban now taking place in theAmendment Conference and the Conference on Disarmamentshould be mutually supportive and complementary. We havealso welcomed recent positive developments concerningnuclear testing  particularly the de facto moratoriums onnuclear tests observed by the nuclear-weapon States andtheir renewed commitment to work towards a comprehensivetest ban. Especially laudable were the decision of the UnitedStates to extend the moratorium on nuclear tests until 1994 the commitment of France not to be the first to resumetesting  and the declaration by the Russian Federation of itsForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 25refusal to resume testing even if others did. We hope andexpect that China will wish to do likewise.It is indeed of critical importance that steps be takentowards the expeditious conclusion of a comprehensivetest-ban treaty  for without it our efforts to extend theNon-Proliferation Treaty at its forthcoming 1995 ReviewConference may well be in jeopardy.As the threat of nuclear confrontation between themajor nuclear Powers has receded  the dangers of nuclearproliferation now appear to be their major preoccupation.But  surely  the issue of non-proliferation should beaddressed in both its horizontal and vertical aspects. It is forthis reason that Indonesia has unceasingly stressed the urgentneed for a comprehensive nuclear-test ban as the litmus testof our sincerity in securing non-proliferation  apart from thenecessity for States to submit themselves to the safeguardsof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).Another heartening development is the growingprominence of regional dialogues on security. The RegionalForum of the Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN)  for one  will afford the ASEAN member Statesand other South-East Asian nations  as well as theextra-regional Powers  a regular opportunity to exchangeviews and consult on security issues of common concern.Asis pointed out in the Secretary-General’s report  ""An Agendafor Peace""  such regional action for peace and security  as amatter of decentralization  delegation and cooperation withthe United Nations could contribute to a deeper sense ofparticipation consensus and democratization in international affairs.These encouraging trends and developments offerunprecedented opportunities for enhanced internationalcooperation for peace and development. But we shouldrealize that these opportunities are fragile and fleeting innature and  if not resolutely grasped  may soon beoverwhelmed by the plethora of new problems and adversetrends simultaneously emerging on the world scene.Persistent conflict and violence  both between and withinStates; the virulent resurgence of ethnic strife  both ancientand recent; the menacing rise in religious intolerance; newforms of racism and narrowly conceived nationalism; and thealarming resort to terrorism and blatant aggression: all thesecombine to obstruct the building of a more peaceful  secure just and tolerant world. These problems and trends havealso caused the disintegration of States and societies  whichstands in poignant contrast to the integrative trends  based ongrowing interdependence  which at the same time have ledto the coalescence of States into larger groupings forcommon economic and political benefits. Moreover  peaceand security cannot be sustained unless the very concept ofsecurity itself is expanded to embrace such non-militarythreats as structural underdevelopment and mass poverty acute resource scarcity and severe environmentaldegradation  which together with prolonged natural disastersconjure up the looming spectre of massive anduncontrollable cross-border migrations.It is a matter of grave concern that while the UnitedNations is called upon to shoulder ever-expandingresponsibilities in the face of these new challenges  it is atthe same time shackled by a deepening financial crisis. Ifthis perennial financial crisis is not quickly resolved  theconsequences could be catastrophic for the internationalcommunity and all its aspirations to peace and development.It is Indonesia’s ardent desire that the United Nationsshould become fully effective as the central instrument fora new and revitalized international order. Steps musttherefore be taken to ensure not only the financial viabilityof our Organization  but also its fidelity to the dynamics ofdemocracy which demand the fullest participation andengagement of all Members in the work of the Organization.Along with all the non-aligned countries  Indonesia holdsthat balance is essential in the relationship between theGeneral Assembly  the Security Council and theSecretary-General  in conformity with their respectivemandates as enshrined in the Charter. Indonesia and theother non-aligned countries have therefore done their utmostto contribute to the consultations leading to the adoption ofGeneral Assembly resolutions 47/120 A and 47/120 B on""An Agenda for Peace"". The Non-Aligned Movement willcontinue to contribute to the ongoing consultations on theother aspects of the ""Agenda for Peace"" and on therationalization of the Committee structures of the GeneralAssembly in order to enhance its efficiency andeffectiveness.Furthermore  Indonesia believes that restructuring andreform of the Security Council have become imperative inthe light of the profound changes that have taken place onthe international scene. We realize  however  that such aprocess should be carried out with caution andcircumspection as it impinges upon some of the fundamentalaspects of the Organization’s purposes and functions. In1946  the United Nations had 51 Members  six of whichwere non-permanent members of the Security Council. In1965  when the membership had grown to 113  there was acorresponding increase in the non-permanent membership to10. But despite the fact that more than a quarter of acentury has elapsed  during which the membership of the26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionUnited Nations has increased to 183  there has been noproportionate increase in the Council’s membership. Aserious review and reappraisal of the Council’s membershipis necessary to ensure a more equitable and balancedrepresentation. An expansion of the Council wouldstrengthen it  making it more responsive and relevant toprevailing geopolitical realities and more open to theparticipation of small and medium-sized States  whichconstitute the majority in our Organization.Indonesia is also firmly of the view that an increase inmembership of the Council should allow for new memberswhich  if they are not to be given the veto power  should atleast serve as permanent members. They should join theCouncil on the basis of a combination of appropriate criteriathat would adequately reflect the political  economic anddemographic realities of the world today in Asia  Africa andLatin America. Such a judicious approach  in addition toone based solely on equitable geographic distribution  wouldenhance not only the Council’s representative character butalso its moral authority and practical effectiveness.The peace process in the Middle East has finallyovercome the paralysis that has gripped it over the past 10negotiating sessions. Indonesia has welcomed the signing ofthe Declaration of Principles on Palestinian interimself-government arrangements in the occupied territories asa historic breakthrough in efforts to put an end to decades ofarmed conflict and confrontation and to achieve a just lasting and comprehensive settlement. My Government hasequally welcomed the agreement on a common agenda in thecontext of the Jordan-Israeli peace negotiations  as well asthe act of mutual recognition by the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO) and Israel. It is also clearly understoodthat these first steps on the Palestinian question are anintegral and non-prejudicial part of the entire peace process which envisages a transitional period not to exceed fiveyears and continuing negotiations leading to a permanentsettlement based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)and 338 (1973) in particular.We applaud the fact that  with the implementation ofthese arrangements  almost half a century of Arab-Israeliconfrontation and Israeli occupation of Palestine will finallybe coming to an end  and that the national and politicalidentity of the Palestinians will at last be universally andirrevocably recognized.Although the significance of these developments cannotbe overemphasized  we in Indonesia are aware that obstaclesand ambiguities still abound on the long and arduous roadtowards a just and comprehensive settlement. Above all  thescrupulous implementation of everything that has beenagreed upon will be of crucial importance. Hence  there isan obvious need for the United Nations to play an active andeffective role throughout the ongoing peace process.Indonesia reiterates its unflinching support for the struggleof the Palestinian people  under the leadership of the PLO to secure their inalienable rights to self-determination  fullsovereignty and independence in their own homeland.Equally  we call upon Israel to withdraw from all illegallyoccupied Palestinian and Arab lands  including Jerusalem the Syrian Golan Heights and southern Lebanon.In the tragedy that has engulfed Bosnia andHerzegovina  the international community is faced with theabysmally disturbing prospect of the forcible dismantling ofa multi-ethnic  multi-cultural and multi-religious society  thebrutal decimation of its people and the gradual diminution ofthe territory of an independent and sovereign Member Stateof the United Nations. The Security Council failed to stopaggression and the abhorrent practice of ""ethnic cleansing""because it was unable to defend Bosnia’s sovereignty andterritorial integrity while preventing the Bosnians fromdefending themselves by refusing to lift an ill-conceivedarms embargo; as a result  two-thirds of Bosnian territoryhas now come under Serbian and Croatian occupation. Thisrefusal to allow Bosnia to defend itself and to protect itspeople from being slaughtered cannot but be regarded as adenial of the right to self-defence under the Charter.Under threat of a continuation of the unequal war Bosnia today is being coerced into accepting a settlementthat would partition its territory along ethnic lines and wouldpractically reduce Bosnia to a cluster of small  incontiguous landlocked and perpetually vulnerable Muslim enclaveswithin a so-called union of the republics of Bosnia andHerzegovina. Having initially steadfastly opposed this ethnicpartition  its Government under President Izetbegovic hasnow reluctantly agreed to such a division. However President Izetbegovic has done so conditionally  as part of acomprehensive agreement that would ensure the legitimateinterests of Bosnia and Herzegovina in terms of its basicterritorial  economic and security needs  as well as withregard to secure access to the sea and between theRepublic’s component parts.We cannot but view these developments as representinga blatant case of negotiation under duress and of enforcingpeace without justice that may well lead to continuingviolence  human suffering and a lack of security. The forceof law should not be surrendered to the law of force.""Ethnic cleansing"" should not be rewarded  and we shouldbeware of establishing dangerous precedents that will hauntForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 27the international community in the future and in otherregions of the world. My Government  therefore  willcontinue to give its full support to the Government and thepeople of Bosnia and Herzegovina in their legitimatestruggle to attain a just and viable settlement  with adequateinternational guarantees as to the political and territorialintegrity of the country.In Somalia  it is gratifying to note that normalcy hasbeen restored in the greater part of the country and that theoverall situation has undergone a major transformation. Butchaos and anarchy continue to persist  especially inMogadishu; this has imperiled the success of concertedinternational efforts to establish a stable and secureenvironment. We therefore sincerely hope that the leadersof Somalia will expeditiously seek to agree on viabletransitional arrangements leading to political reconciliationand to the establishment of a broad-based government.In South Africa  it is heartening to note the determinedefforts by the leaders of the majority to engage in peacefuldialogue and negotiations with the minority Government. Ina historic step towards ending decades of oppression and theevil of apartheid  the multi-party negotiating forum hasscheduled 27 April 1994 as the date for the nation’s firstdemocratic elections leading towards the establishment of aunified  democratic and non-racial South Africa.In Cambodia  in spite of the myriad difficulties itencountered  the peace process has now successfullycompleted the final stage of implementation of the ParisAgreements. We have wholeheartedly welcomed andendorsed the outcome of the elections conducted under theauspices of the United Nations Transitional Authority inCambodia (UNTAC). We have also welcomed thecompletion of the work of the elected Constituent Assemblywith the promulgation of a new democratic constitutionestablishing a constitutional monarchy. And just a few daysago  the Government and people of Indonesia shared thesense of joy and deep satisfaction at the official inaugurationof His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varman as Head ofState  and the formation of the new Government ofCambodia.We all realize  however  that even after the expiry ofUNTAC’s mandate and the installation of the newCambodian Government  the United Nations and theinternational community should continue to support thepeople of Cambodia in the reconstruction of their country.Indonesia  together with the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN)  stands ready to contribute its share to thiseffort.Indonesia wishes to pay a tribute to His MajestyKing Norodom Sihanouk for his visionary leadership inachieving this historic watershed in Cambodia’s history  inunifying the Cambodian people and in bringing aboutnational reconciliation. My delegation would like to expressits gratitude to the Secretary-General and his SpecialRepresentative  Mr. Yasushi Akashi  for their contributionsto a just and comprehensive settlement of the Cambodianquestion. We also pay special homage to all UNTACpersonnel and volunteers who sacrificed their lives in theperformance of their mission to bring peace to Cambodia.Increasingly  the international community has come torecognize that  in a world dramatically transformed since theend of the cold-war era  lasting peace and security can neverbe assured in the absence of economic growth anddevelopment. Yet despite the profound and positive changeswrought in the political sphere  no correspondingimprovements have been registered in the world economy orin international economic relations. It is therefore imperativethat international economic cooperation and development areaccorded top priority on the international agenda. Thecrucial development challenges for the 1990s continue to bethe reinvigoration of world economic growth  theacceleration of the socio-economic development of thedeveloping countries on a sustainable basis and  above all the eradication of poverty from the face of the earth.By all accounts  the world economy has failed toachieve substantial improvement over the past year. Belyingalmost all official forecasts  recession in the developedcountries and stagnation in the developing countries havepersisted. According to the 1993 World Economic Survey world output will be outpaced by world population growthrates for the third year in a row. These negativemacroeconomic developments have exacted an enormous tollon the developing countries. Consequently  poverty andunderdevelopment remain the distinguishing features of themajority of the developing countries. In the most vulnerableeconomies  these have reached crisis proportions. Ofespecially grave concern is the prolonged critical situation inAfrica  where tens of millions of people remain trapped inabject poverty and social deprivation.In this era of increasing interdependence among nationsand escalating globalization  issues and problems  especiallythose relating to growth and development  have becomeglobal in nature and therefore cannot be solved throughshort-term relief measures or through piecemeal reforms.Therefore  all nations  both in the North and in the South should forge a new compact on development and  through ademocratic partnership  fashion global solutions to these28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionproblems. Only in that way can we hope to restructure theinternational economic system  redress its imbalances  andrender international economic cooperation more equitableand thus more viable and more mutually beneficial.The non-aligned and other developing countriestherefore call for the reactivation of a constructive dialoguebetween the North and South. But this time  such a dialogueshould be based on genuine interdependence  mutuality ofinterests and of benefits and shared responsibility. Thedeveloping countries have expressed their readiness  both atthe non-aligned summit in Jakarta last September and in theStanding Ministerial Committee for Economic Cooperationin Bali last May  to engage the developed countries activelyin a dialogue on the key issues of the world economy. Inthis context  President Soeharto of Indonesia  as Chairmanof the Non-Aligned Movement  in his meeting with thenPrime Minister Miyazawa of Japan as Chairman of theGroup of Seven on the eve of the G-7 Summit last July seized the opportunity to convey the non-aligned message entitled ""An Invitation to Dialogue""  to the developedcountries.At that meeting  the Chairman of the Group of Sevenand the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement concurredon the need to pursue a comprehensive approach to theintegrated issues of trade  investment and debt strategies including the review of the latter through the Paris Club. Inthis encouraging first step the initiative by the Non-AlignedMovement to establish a more constructive approach onissues of mutual concern and interest was welcomed by theGroup of Seven  a fact that was subsequently reflected in theTokyo summit economic declaration.Indonesia strongly believes that these positivedevelopments have bolstered the spirit of partnership alreadyarticulated and demonstrated at such meetings as the eighthsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD VIII) and the United NationsConference on Environment and Development (UNCED).This evolving spirit of partnership should now be furtherfostered and built upon during this session of the Assembly.Obviously  both developed and developing countries have ashared interest in jointly promoting this process across awide spectrum of key economic issues of common concern.It is important that we in the Assembly carry the processforward in concrete terms  and for this purpose thenon-aligned and other developing countries intend to submita draft resolution aimed at the reactivation of dialoguebetween the developed and the developing countries. In thiscontext  the Secretary-General should be requested to preparea report on the modalities and ways and means ofreactivating such a dialogue. We believe that this wouldcomplement his forthcoming report on an agenda fordevelopment  which will contain an analysis and substantiverecommendations on ways to enhance the role of the UnitedNations in the promotion of international cooperation fordevelopment.Such a spirit of partnership  lamentably  is conspicuousby its absence from some other forums  particularly theUruguay Round negotiations  which are still mired in anobdurate impasse. In this regard we sincerely hope that thecommitment made by the major developed countries at theirrecent summit in Tokyo will translate into effective actionthat will break the stalemate and bring about an equitableand balanced conclusion to the Round.Among the most urgent issues on the global economicagenda is the external debt crisis of the developing countrieswhich  contrary to perception in some quarters  is still farfrom being resolved and indeed continues to be exacerbatedby volatile exchange rate fluctuations in the majorcurrencies. Here too there is an obvious need for acoordinated approach  in the spirit of partnership  involvingdebtor and creditor nations as well as the internationalfinancial institutions. Such an approach should aim atdecisive reductions in the bilateral  multilateral andcommercial debt burdens  especially of the least developedand other severely indebted developing countries  in a waythat would at the same time allow sustained recovery andgrowth.Regrettably  all too often there has been a one-sidedview of the causes of the debt crisis which tends to fault thedeveloping countries for excessive and imprudent borrowingand for the misuse of the resources thus obtained. This viewtends to ignore the link between the debt crisis  the paucityof resource flows on appropriate terms  and the adverse turntaken by the world economy since the early 1980s. This inturn explains the insistence on domestic policy reforms onthe part of the debtor countries as the principal remedialinstrument.The truth is that the debt crisis of the developingcountries is a manifestation of the shortcomings of theinternational system in providing access to adequate longterm resources on satisfactory terms. The gap was filled byprivate banks  lending on inappropriate terms. The crisiswas triggered by deflationary policies introduced by thedeveloped countries. Debt-servicing became an oppressiveburden on the borrower countries when export earningsdeclined following the collapse of commodity prices andgrowing restrictions on market access to developed countries.Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 29It is true that for a few middle-income countries thedebt crisis may be largely over. The same can be said forthe international commercial banks which in the pastprovided these countries with huge amounts of loans.However  for many low-income countries as well as lowermiddle-income countries the debt crisis is far from over.Thus around 50 severely indebted countries continue toexperience great difficulties in servicing their debt  at aterrible cost to their economies striving for recovery anddevelopment.Urgent action is needed and debt relief for thesecountries should receive the highest priority  in particular forthose among the 50 countries which are the least developedcountries. To avoid any misunderstanding  Indonesia doesnot regard itself as being among those 50 countries. TheNon-Aligned Movement has made this issue one of itspriorities in South-South cooperation and a programme is atpresent being developed to extend concrete assistance tothese countries to augment their efforts at debt management.The debt crisis must be considered as one of the factorsthat led to the social crisis of the 1990s  for the latter isclearly a function of poverty and underdevelopment whichin turn have given rise to internal political instability inmany countries.In the efforts of the United Nations system and variouscountries to address the social crisis  new and valuableinsights have recently been gained. It is irrefutable that indeveloping countries structural changes have exacted anexorbitant human cost. The developed countries too havenot been spared from this crisis  as the prolonged recessionhas greatly strained their social security systems. Clearly therefore  the social crisis also calls for a global approach and indeed a consensus is growing that development andinternational cooperation ""should put people first"".Indonesia shares this view and fully commits itself tothe active participation of the people in the decision-makingprocesses involved in development  and to the protection andpromotion of human rights in all their manifestations including the right to development. We therefore lookforward to participating actively in such forthcomingconferences as the World Summit for Social Development in1995 and the World Conference on Women in the sameyear. The World Conference on Population andDevelopment to be held in Cairo early next year shouldprovide an occasion for the international community tocooperate on the basis of the essential linkages betweendevelopment  population and environmental protection. Theproposal to convene an international conference on financingfor development should be given serious consideration. Weanticipate the forthcoming report by the Secretary-Generalon an agenda for development will mark an importantmilestone in international cooperation for development.With this report we hope that development will finally beaccorded as much emphasis as that given to the politicalagenda.A short time ago  the World Conference on HumanRights was convened in Vienna. Surpassing mostexpectations  the Conference adopted a Declaration andProgramme of Action which affirmed  among other things the principles of universality  indivisibility andnon-selectivity in the promotion and protection of humanrights. We are heartened by the fact that the ViennaConference recognized that in the promotion of human rightsand fundamental freedoms  the significance of national andregional particularities and the various historical  cultural andreligious backgrounds of States must be taken into account.Approved by consensus  the Vienna Declaration andProgramme of Action represents a new paradigm from whichto promote human rights in a non-selective  cooperative andbalanced manner. That being the case  the use of humanrights as political conditionalities for economic cooperationis entirely against the agreements reached in Vienna.This session of the General Assembly has been askedto consider the establishment of a post of high commissionerfor human rights. It is Indonesia’s considered view that suchconsideration should lay emphasis on the practical feasibilityof establishing this post and on whether such action wouldin reality and practice enhance the promotion and protectionof human rights as called for in the United Nations Charter.For it may be more beneficial to direct our attention toenhancing the authority and efficacy of the existingmechanisms and bodies  particularly the Centre for HumanRights in Geneva.The end of the cold war has opened a new chapter inthe history of humankind  a chapter full of portents as wellas bright promise. The essential text of this chapter is yetto be written  in this Assembly and in the variousinternational forums where crucial issues are taken up. Asthe principal international institution for multilateralcooperation and negotiation  the United Nations has a centralrole in the shaping and fulfilment of that promise. Allnations  developed and developing alike  can and shouldhave a part in realizing that promise through constructivedialogue and democratic cooperation. In the course of this30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionendeavour  the vision and aspirations of the developed andthe developing countries can be forged into a broad anddynamic partnership that would effectively address theproblems of today and successfully confront the challengesof tomorrow. We hope that this process has now made amodest but significant beginning."
"75",3202,"IND",48,1993,"Mr. President  yourunanimous election as President augurs well for the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I extend myheartiest congratulations to you and best wishes for success.Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General  hasgiven a new vision and a new impetus to the United Nationsat a crucial time in its history. We wish him well in hisefforts.My Government is deeply touched by the sympathy andcompassion expressed by the leaders of several delegationson the devastating earthquake in India on30 September 1993  and  with your permission Mr. President  I shall have to go back to India immediately.The United Nations will soon be 50 years old. It hashad many achievements to its credit: decolonization; effortsto alleviate poverty; peace-keeping; disarmament; devisingan accepted code of international law; respect for humanrights and concern for the environment. I would like toreiterate India’s faith in and consistent support for the UnitedNations and its efforts to establish peace and the well-beingof peoples. We take note that the United Nations is tryingto evolve so as to better serve the principles and purposes ofthe Charter. We support the Secretary-General’s efforts tomake what he has called a transition from the old to the newUnited Nations  which would be particularly useful andfruitful for the less developed and less fortunate States.The euphoria generated by the end of the cold war hasin the past two years given way to concerns about thedifficulties of achieving a new global equilibrium andstability. Essentially  we can see these difficulties arisingfrom the contradictory pulls and pressures exerted by theforces of positive integration and harmony on the one handand fragmentation and discord on the other.The end of the divisions of the cold war and the effortsto halt and reverse the arms race have generated some of theintegrative forces. Some forces of integration have also beenat work in the global economy  which has been characterizedby the globalization and interdependence of countries’factors of production and of issues of trade  money  finance technology  environment  population and development. Thedesire of the developing countries to participate moreactively in the growth of the world economy and thebuilding-up of free-market  liberalized economies forthemselves adds another positive dimension. Issues ofcommon concern and global survival - economicdevelopment and regeneration  environmental sustainability demographic management  technological dynamism andhealth for all - have provided a sense of common destiny.The communications revolution has resulted in greatercultural intermingling and openness around the world.These forces of integration are  unfortunately  opposedby those of fragmentation. Represented by sectarian andsubnational aggression  racism  religious fundamentalism bigotry  terrorism  drug trafficking and arms smuggling  theypose a threat to peace  global security  democracy  humanrights and economic and social development. We are alsowitnessing strife  conflicts and cruel  unceasing and irrationalcivil wars in many parts of the world. Bosnia andHerzegovina  Somalia and Afghanistan cause us anxiety andconcern. The proliferation of such local conflicts and theever-increasing flow of refugees across national frontiers re-affirm the truism that peace  like freedom  is indivisible andthat the disruption of peace anywhere is a danger to peaceeverywhere.These divisive forces have caused not only politicalinstability but also economic collapse in several instances.Conversely  economic sluggishness and lack of developmentin several cases have led to political upheavals. Inward-looking  exclusivist and narrowly self-centred globaleconomic policy-making has been in evidence at a timewhen the global economy is overshadowed by recession andlack of dynamism. Macroeconomic coordination is at itsweakest. Protectionist tendencies are strong. The potentialof developing countries to act as vigorous engines of growthfor revitalizing the world economy stands largely ignored.In developing countries  absolute and deepening poverty hunger and malnutrition  disease  illiteracy and the lack ofshelter and sanitation for a large portion of the populationhave caused political and social tensions. The structuralimbalances and flaws of the post-Second-World-Warinternational economic order persist and prevent themaximization of the benefits of interdependence andglobalization.Against this backdrop  the task of the United Nationsshould be to construct a new global equilibrium by fosteringpositive integrative forces and discouraging  if notcounteracting  the forces of fragmentation and discord. Forthis  the new United Nations will have to reiterate thefundamental and immutable principles on which it was built:respect for the national sovereignty  territorial integrity andsovereign equality of nation States. I am glad that the12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionSecretary-General stated in his report to the forty-eighthsession:""National sovereignty is the art of renderingunequal power equal. Without State sovereignty  thevery instrument of international cooperation might bedestroyed and international organization might itselfbecome impossible."" (A/48/1  para. 16)The United Nations will have to set an example for theconduct of relations amongst nation States on the basis ofrespect for the rule of law  democracy and pluralism. Anyinternational framework  whether it be associated with peaceor development  must be transparent and must deal withissues of global concerns on a non-selective and non--discriminatory basis.In the final analysis  the institutions  concepts andagencies that represent the new world order will be judgedby their ability to harness and channel the beneficial andcreative forces of integration for the benefit of peace anddevelopment for all and by the ability of the United Nationsto ensure that the interests of its weaker Member States arefully reflected therein. In these still perilous times  theywould have to promote development cooperation andeffectively arrest the plunge into insecurity  strife and chaos particularly when these threaten the very foundation ofMember States  where ultimately the United Nations isrooted.There have been references in this Assembly to allthese conflicts  big or small  local or with internationaldimensions  describing them in the generic terms of ethnic religious and civil wars. The plurality and complexity of ourpost-cold-war world do not permit such generic labelling.Nor are these conflicts amenable to generic and instantremedies. A number of instances of strife or aberrations arepart of the historical legacies inherited by Member States.Each is posited in a different socio-economic and culturalmatrix of causation; each is caught up in a different cycle ofcircumstance and violence. The imposition of peace throughunilateral external intervention will only perpetuate situationsembodying the Orwellian logic of ""peace is war"" that we seein many parts of the world today.Wisdom lies in overcoming conflict situations with apositive vision animated by peace and amity and in creatingthe necessary confidence and will for peace among countriesand peoples. It is in this spirit that India is ready to initiatea dialogue with Pakistan to build mutual confidence and topromote a climate of stability in our region. I can only hopethat Pakistan will respond to this  and have a dialogue withus  instead of trying to go around the world accentuatingdifferences that will be difficult to resolve later.We welcome the recently concluded peace accordbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization(PLO)  and earnestly hope that this will be a true harbingerof further positive developments aimed at establishing lastingpeace and prosperity in West Asia. We also welcome theannouncement by Mr. Nelson Mandela that irreversibleprogress towards a non-racial  democratic South Africa hasbeen made. In response to his suggestion  India  which hadimposed trade sanctions against South Africa as early as1946  has initiated action to lift those sanctions and tonormalize relations with South Africa.We trust that the recognition by the Security Council ofthe international boundary between Iraq and Kuwait willcontribute to the stabilization of the situation in the Gulfregion. We hope that the faithful implementation of therelevant Security Council resolutions will lead to thealleviation of the present difficulties of the peoples of theregion.In Somalia  a whole population has gone through aprotracted civil war and famine with hardly anygovernmental machinery to tackle the situation. This madeit imperative for the United Nations to act. As anunprecedented humanitarian mission  the multilateral actionin Somalia enjoyed the support of the entire world  includingthe factional Somali leaders themselves. India  for its part has contributed one of the largest contingents to this mission.Now that the situation has improved and starvation has beenaverted  the United Nations operation faces new problems.It is necessary for the United Nations to reassure all sectorsof the people of Somalia about its role in the country intensify the process of political reconciliation and adherestrictly to the original objectives of the mission.The phenomenal increase in peace-keeping operationsin the post-cold-war period and their inclusion as an elementof the new agenda for peace is at once a matter of comfortand concern. It is a matter of comfort because the UnitedNations at long last has started playing its Charter role in thearea of peace and security. In the altered internationalpolitical environment  we would like the United Nations torealize its full potential. At the same time  the involvementof the United Nations on an unprecedented scale with peace-keeping operations causes us concern because operationallythe United Nations is not fully prepared and equipped todischarge this role effectively. And  legally andconceptually  the limits  procedures and rules of theinvolvement of the United Nations are not clearly defined.Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 13For peace-keeping operations to be successful  it isnecessary to follow certain guidelines and criteria. Allavenues of pacific settlement of disputes  as laid down inChapter VI of the Charter  should be fully explored andexhausted before resorting to peace-keeping operations underChapter VII. Decisions on such operations should be takenin a democratic and broad-based manner  and after thoroughconsideration of all aspects. To command universalendorsement and maintain their non-partisan character United Nations peace-keeping operations must be based onthe consent of all the States parties to a dispute. Theyshould be undertaken with a specific mandate and a cleartime-frame. Greater efficiency should be achieved in bothplanning and execution of peace-keeping operations. TheForeign Minister of the Russian Federation  in his address tothe General Assembly a few days ago  put forward a fewproposals in this respect which merit consideration by theGeneral Assembly. The concept of invoking humanitarianrelief as a basis for peace-keeping operations may have to beapproached with a great deal of caution and circumspection.Any new United Nations operation for providinghumanitarian relief must be completely non-partisan - in factand in the perception of the parties involved.That consideration must also guide any discussion ordecision on preventive deployment. The United Nationsmust not allow itself to be burdened indefinitely withobsolete and ineffective peace-keeping operations. Everypossible measure should be taken to ensure the safety ofpeace-keeping personnel.Another aspect of the agenda for peace which wewould like to underline is the particular importance weattach to Article 50  which enjoins the Security Council tofind solutions to the special economic problems faced bythird States on account of the implementation of sanctionsimposed by the Security Council. We call for an automaticmechanism that would put remedial action in placesimultaneously with the imposition of sanctions.An integral element of any agenda for peace in ourtime is the achievement of disarmament  particularly nucleardisarmament. Having endorsed the Chemical WeaponsConvention  the United Nations should move on to considersimilar steps in other areas of disarmament.We welcome the unilateral decision of the United Statesto extend its moratorium on nuclear testing until the endof 1994. The focus of the nuclear-weapon Powers shouldnow be on the early conclusion of a universal  verifiable andcomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty leading to theelimination of all nuclear weapons.India’s commitment to non-proliferation is completeand unequivocal. India has an unblemished track record.India’s proposal made in 1988 for an action plan for nucleardisarmament within a specific time-frame is of continuingrelevance in our bid to rid the world of the global scourgeof nuclear weapons. We believe that a new  just anduniformly applicable regime for non-proliferation which doesnot discriminate between the nuclear-weapon and thenon-nuclear-weapon States should be considered at an earlydate. Such a treaty should place equal obligations on allStates. For a non-proliferation regime to be trulymeaningful  it must also address the questions of aconvention on the non-use of nuclear weapons  a verifiablefreeze on the production of fissionable material  a total banon nuclear-weapon tests and negotiations on general andcomplete disarmament. The global spread and reach ofnuclear weapons reduce to a travesty the objective ofachieving genuine peace and security within a narrowregional framework. It is our hope that the United Nationswill take firm action in this direction to achieve this in thesense I have mentioned.One area of concern for developing countries is thequestion of ad hoc and unilateral export controls and otherrestrictions being placed on the transfer of dual-use and hightechnology with the ostensible purpose of curbingproliferation. Non-proliferation concerns must not be madea pretext for denying developing countries access totechnologies critical for their development. There is therefore  need to evolve multilateral  non-discriminatory andtransparent arrangements to regulate the transfer of suchtechnologies so that peaceful uses and dissemination of somekey technologies are not denied to the developing world.There is perhaps merit in convening a special sessionon disarmament to examine the whole gamut ofdisarmament-related issues that arise in the new context oftoday. The question of a peace dividend arising fromdisarmament in the form of financial and technical resourcesfor the enhancement of international developmentcooperation in the context of the United Nations could beone of the issues that special session could address.It is obvious that there can be no global security unlessdevelopment is ensured  and we therefore attach as muchimportance to an agenda for development as to the ""Agendafor Peace"". Agenda 21 of the Rio Declaration  outlining theplan and programme for global cooperation in ensuringsustainable development; the outcome of the Final Act of theeighth session of the United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development (UNCTAD VIII)  on the partnership fordevelopment between the North and the South; and the14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionforthcoming Conference on Population and Development  aswell as the World Summit on Social Development  providethe international community enough opportunity to promoteeconomic and social development and environmentalsustainability  particularly in developing countries. The workon an agenda for development should build on all thesedevelopment-related action programmes and provide a newimpetus to development cooperation  both under UnitedNations auspices and in bilateral and other multilateralcontexts. Enhancement of the role  resources andcapabilities of the organs and agencies dealing withdevelopment in the United Nations system should bestressed. The United Nations should also be enabled to havea more interactive relationship with the Bretton Woodsinstitutions in a spirit of finding considered and innovativesolutions to global economic problems and pooling allavailable resources for that purpose.Comprehensive and constructive dialogue between theNorth and the South and the strengthening of a globalpartnership for development are the needs of our times if weare to avoid the replacement of the East-West divide by aNorth-South one. India has always participated in theongoing North-South dialogue through the Group of 77 andthe Non-Aligned Movement and in keeping with therequirements of a more focused dialogue. India has becomepart of the new group of 15 developing countries forSouth-South consultation and cooperation  the G-15. We areacting as host to the fourth summit meeting of that group atNew Delhi in December. Representing the developingcountries  we have had a promising start through an informaldialogue with the G-7 and we hope to build on thosebeginnings in a spirit of ""global partnership for globalbenefit""  as was stated by my Prime Minister Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao in his message to theG-7 Chairman.Some key issues where there is an ongoing dialogue butwhich none the less need further consideration andimplementation include: participation of developingcountries in global macroeconomic coordination anddecision-making; reciprocation by the North of the efforts ofthe South at restructuring and economic liberalizationthrough the pursuit of expansionist policies conducive tolong-term growth and opening them up to global competitionin goods  services and manpower through reduction andelimination of protectionist barriers; increased capital flows both official and private  bilateral and multilateral  todeveloping countries to offset the crippling effects of thedebt burden and to accelerate growth and development; anda balanced  successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round which should ensure substantial enhancement of marketaccess for developing-country exports and of their access tothe tool of competitiveness.The profoundly humanistic traditions of the Indiancivilization  with its emphasis on tolerance  harmony non-violence and the inviolability of the individual  havefound their modern expression in the setting up of ademocratic  secular and egalitarian polity and society in freeIndia.Being the largest practising democracy and effecting asynthesis between a multiplicity of ethnic  religious andlinguistic groups and peoples has been no easy task  as somein the West are themselves realizing even in the context oftheir relatively lesser diversities. The Constitution of freeIndia consolidated this humanistic tradition and is indeed averitable bill of human rights. A strong and independentjudiciary and a totally free press have also been watchdogsof democracy and human rights in India.India’s commitment to the effective protection ofhuman rights has now received another institutional impetuswith the establishment of a National Human RightsCommission comprised of a retired Chief Justice of theSupreme Court of India  a retired judge of the SupremeCourt of India  a former Chief Justice of the State HighCourt and other eminent persons as well as the chairmen ofthe three separate national commissions which already existto protect the interests of scheduled castes and scheduledtribes  women and minorities. The Commission has beenmandated to inquire into allegations of violations of humanrights and has been invested with wide-ranging powers including the power to establish special investigation teamsto carry out effective investigations. The findings of theCommission are to be published from time to time besidesbeing reflected in its annual report  which will also be laidbefore Parliament. The law also provides for theestablishment of human rights commissions by the StateGovernments  on the pattern of the national Commission  asalso special courts for the speedy trial of cases involvinghuman rights violations.I am confident that members of the Assembly willaccept that India has established the most appropriate humanrights commission to ensure that there will be full humanrights protection in the country.Our commitment to universally acceptablenon-discriminatory norms of human rights and theirprotection and promotion cannot be questioned. It was inthat spirit that we participated actively in the WorldConference on Human Rights  which recognized theForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 15importance of this issue. We are however pained that notenough emphasis is put on a major threat and impediment tothe realization of human rights  namely  terrorism  especiallythe kind that is aided and abetted by one State againstanother. Why is it that a few so-called human rightsadvocates and Member States of the United Nations chooseto focus on the human rights of terrorists - those whoindulge in senseless murder  destruction  pillage  thedisruption of civilized existence and the undermining ofdemocratic institutions? Why do they virtually turn a blindeye to the violation of the human rights of the victims ofsuch terrorism - innocent civilians or those upholding lawand order and the territorial integrity of States? Can they intrue conscience allow terrorists and their supporters to usurpthe moral high ground on human rights?The United Nations will have to take strong actionagainst terrorists because terrorists engage in all kinds ofviolence. They try to upset democratically taken decisionsin a country by using force and killing people. This must betotally condemned by the United Nations and stoppedcompletely so that people can live in peace and indemocracy and express their views in accordance with theconstitution of their country.In sum  we believe that international cooperation in theprotection of human rights can succeed only if it is withinthe framework of respect for the sovereignty and integrity ofStates and of a vigorous global programme for anti-terroristaction. We would  however  like to point out that anyunilateral use of human rights as an instrument of politicalpressure or intervention  or as an obstacle to trade or acondition for development cooperation and aid  in fact servesthe opposite purpose and impedes the full realization of thehuman rights of people of affected countries.The enhanced role of the United Nations ininternational affairs calls for the restructuring and redefiningof the functions of its principal organs.The responsibilities of the Security Council have growndramatically in the past few years  requiring a greater degreeof participation by the overall membership of the UnitedNations in the Council’s decision-making process. We mustrecognize that the membership of the United Nations hasgrown enormously over the years. A more balanced andexpanded representation for Member States in the Council istherefore inevitable. Unity of purpose among its membersrather than size determines the efficiency of anyorganization. The expansion should not be done selectivelyor in a piecemeal manner. The principles or criteria ofexpansion of the permanent and non-permanent membershipshould be agreed upon by consensus. For the selection ofadditional States in an expanded Council  the population -which represents the principle of democracy and an elementof power - the size of the economy and the future potentialof the countries concerned should be taken into account along with equitable geographical distribution and thecontribution to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. There is virtual unanimity among those who haveresponded to the Secretary-General that an expansion of theCouncil is imperative. Interesting suggestions have been putforward by several countries. The logical next step wouldbe to start a process of consultations to arrive at a suitableand fair formula that commands universal support.The permanent members should be responsive to theaspirations of developing countries represented in theGeneral Assembly on the basis of equality. It is thereforeessential also to revive the role of the General Assembly  aswas originally envisaged in the Charter.We stand on a decisive threshold incomparable to anyin history  a moment in time when we must bring to bear alarger vision and foster the forces of positive integration democracy and cooperation at national and internationallevels.My Prime Minister has  in characterizing the 1990s aswatershed years in global affairs in the realm of political economic and environmental challenges and changes conveyed an unequivocal message:""We cannot go wrong if we make coexistenceand peace our watchword  and common universalgood our objective"".It is my Government’s belief that this quest for the commongood  jointly undertaken  will be central to the success ofour endeavour and for the achievement of the Charter’sobjective of harmonizing the actions of nations in theattainment of these common ends."
"76",3248,"IRL",48,1993,"I should like to congratulateMr. Insanally on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session. While opening oursession  he rightly reminded us of the hopes now placed inthis universal forum - to which we welcome six newMembers - and of the growing need for what he describedas a collective vision of our future.Allow me to convey to the Government and the peopleof India the deepest sympathy of the Irish people for thevictims of the earthquake.We meet here at a time of great hope for the peoples ofthe Middle East. Years of bitter antagonism and conflicthave yielded to agreement and  we hope  reconciliationbetween the two great historical traditions in an area that hasseen far too much bloodshed. The signature of theagreement in Washington was an act of the higheststatesmanship and courage. It deserves a commensurateresponse from the other countries of the region and from theinternational community.I welcome President Clinton’s speedy initiative inconvening today a conference on aid to Palestine. We inIreland stand ready to play our part  together with ourpartners in the European Community. We will increasesubstantially our aid to the West Bank and Gaza  and wewill take steps to strengthen and develop our good relationswith Israel and with the Palestinian people.It is also a time of great hope for the people of SouthAfrica. When the prisoner of Robben Island  NelsonMandela  states  in Afrikaans to an Afrikaner audience  thatwhat is done  is done  and looks to a shared future for allSouth Africans  it sends a powerful message to all of us.A new South Africa is in the making. We have waitedand striven long for this day. I am happy to announce thatwe in Ireland have decided to establish diplomatic relationswith that new South Africa.It is a time of hope  but also of apprehension particularly for the people of Russia. The course of reformis not yet complete. I am confident that the way forwardidentified by President Yeltsin will continue to be endorsedby the people so that Russia may continue on the path tostable democracy and sustained economic development.The recent changes in international life have broughtgreat and lasting benefits to many: to those who enduredauthoritarian forms of government for decades and have nowgained the freedom to exercise their basic human and civilrights; to peoples released from the super-Power competitionthat enabled dictatorial and repressive regimes to act withimpunity; to the wider international community that nolonger lives under the threat of global nuclear conflagration.Yet the optimism that characterized the early days of thepost-cold-war period has been tempered by the realizationthat for every advance in the Middle East or in South Africa there is an Angola  or a Yugoslavia  a Somalia  a Sudan.For all our progress  thousands continue to die in brutalwars  thousands more suffer from gross abuses of humanrights and millions are denied their basic right to food  waterand shelter. There is still a great distance to be travelled toa world of justice  equality and true respect for theindividual.People look here  to the United Nations  to help themtravel that distance. Faced with this hope  this expectation -this demand - our Organization today must meet challengesof a kind that it has not had to cope with in the past challenges qualitatively different from the international andregional disputes that have traditionally absorbed so much ofthe United Nations energies.We are coming to understand better the interrelatednature of these tasks: the struggle to end war; to advancedemocracy; to promote economic development; to protect thedignity of the individual; to ensure freedom and the rule oflaw; to protect the environment; to deal with the problemsof population - all are part of the same effort. Success inone requires progress in others.We are coming to understand too that the activities ofStates and Governments require the broader cooperativecontext of the United Nations. As our problems aretransnational  so too must be our response.The fact is that we need a United Nations whoseorganization and decisions truly represent the will of theinternational community. We need a United Nations whoseactivities truly address the great contemporary challenges and we need a United Nations that is not hindered by lackof resources in personnel and finance.At no time in its history has the need to re-examine andstrengthen the United Nations system been greater or moreForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 31widely felt  and these themes of representation  relevanceand resources are at the heart of the debate about the reformof the United Nations.As the body charged with the primary responsibility forinternational peace and security  it is imperative that theSecurity Council should function well and with authority.The Council’s response to the huge demands that have beenmade of it in recent years has been impressive. The numberand scope of its decisions are greater than ever before  andthe import of those decisions for States and for peopleseverywhere is more far-reaching.And yet  we must ask if the Council truly represents thealmost universal membership of the Organization andreflects fully the great changes that have taken place ineconomic and political relations. These are questions of thedeepest significance for international cooperation  but Ibelieve that unless they are addressed now  the politicalauthority of the Security Council and its capacity to actdecisively and with confidence will be eroded.Ireland therefore supports the case for an increase in themembership of the Security Council. I hope that decisionson this can be taken before the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations in two years’ time.There is a need also for greater transparency in SecurityCouncil decision-making. The general membership  thoughit takes no part in the Council’s decisions  is bound by them and we are frequently called on to supply personnel andfinance to implement the Council’s expanded andincreasingly complex mandates. We must work for a moreinteractive relationship between the Council and the GeneralAssembly  and for more frequent and substantive reportingby the Council to the general membership. And we mustlook for ways to make the Assembly itself more effective.It is ironic that for most of its existence  when theUnited Nations was not always deemed to be the appropriateforum for the resolution of major disputes  the Organizationwas for the most part adequately resourced. Yet today when the demands for action by the United Nations havereached unprecedented levels  when ideological division nolonger inhibits an effective United Nations role and when theapproach to problem-solving at Security Council level isessentially cooperative  the Organization finds itselfburdened with a grave and crippling financial crisis.The Secretary-General has told us that the Organizationis living from hand to mouth. He warns us that the financialsituation could soon prevent the United Nations fromdischarging its essential responsibilities and undermine itspolitical will and practical capacity to undertake any newactivities. And yet the simple truth is this: for every dollarthat the United Nations spends on the instruments of peace the world spends almost $2 000 on the weapons of war.It is simply not acceptable to call on the United Nationsto undertake new responsibilities while declining or failingto provide the necessary resources. A significantimprovement in the Organization’s finances is now an urgentpriority. I appeal to all Member States in arrears  andespecially those on the Security Council  to comply withtheir financial obligations under the Charter. This is a moralas well as a practical imperative.The impact of change is particularly apparent in thearea of peace-keeping. In almost every crisis  on everycontinent  United Nations forces are deployed onincreasingly varied and complex tasks. By the end of thisyear the numbers in the field may total 100 000. Andindividual operations are now very large: nearly 20 000each in Cambodia and Somalia; almost 25 000 in formerYugoslavia. Ireland now participates in 10 of the 14 UnitedNations peace-keeping operations in the field. A significantproportion of our armed forces is at present engaged inUnited Nations peace-keeping duties.But  beyond the scale of the operations  the nature ofthe tasks undertaken by United Nations forces has changedalso. The initial decision to intervene militarily in Somaliafor humanitarian purposes and the subsequent decision tomandate the United Nations Operation in Somalia(UNOSOM) to take enforcement action are new departuresfor the Organization. And they present new challenges fortroop-contributing countries. In Ireland’s case we had tochange our law to enable our forces to take part in theChapter VII operation in Somalia.It is important for all of us - the United Nations  thetroop contributors  and those whom we seek to help - toreflect carefully on our experiences and draw the lessonsfrom the new large-scale operations in Cambodia  Somaliaand Yugoslavia.It is evident that existing structures both at UnitedNations Headquarters and in the field have come under veryconsiderable strain. The mandates of major United Nationsoperations are now multi-faceted. We need mechanisms thatwill allow such mandates to be carried through in a mannerthat is effective  transparent and humane. I want to mentiontwo points in particular here today.32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe first is the imperative need to maintain peace -keeping and peace-enforcement operations within an overallpolitical framework and to exploit every opportunity forreconciliation. Enforcement action  when it is undertaken -and I accept that it may be necessary - should be theminimum required and it should be carefully directed toachieving the political aims of the operation. For thisreason  I believe that at the time the Security Council takesa decision to establish an operation  particularly oneinvolving peace enforcement  it should pay special attentionto the issues of command and control.Secondly  there is a need to improve military planningat United Nations Headquarters and to ensure that the bestmilitary advice and information is available to theSecretary-General in his conduct of peace-keepingoperations. To this end  an effective planning unit isrequired. Thought should also be given to whether theMilitary Staff Committee  which is provided for in theCharter but which has never functioned effectively  couldhave a contribution to make.In Somalia  the overriding objective of the UnitedNations operation must be political reconciliation andnational reconstruction.There have been outstanding successes. One year ago several hundreds were dying each day from hunger andmalnutrition. Today  as a result of the work of the UnifiedTask Force (UNITAF)  UNOSOM and the non-governmentalorganizations  people are no longer dying from man-madefamine. A year ago violence was widespread. Today almostall of Somalia is calm.The exception is south Mogadishu  where the efforts ofUNOSOM have been continually frustrated and many including 60 United Nations peace-keepers  have lost theirlives. In pursuance of its overall aim of politicalreconciliation  the United Nations must continue its searchfor a peaceful resolution in Mogadishu  learning from andbuilding on its success elsewhere in Somalia.Most of the conflicts that this Assembly will address inthe coming weeks are marked by massive abuses of humanrights - summary executions  torture  detention  rape mutilation. And even outside of these open conflicts thedignity of the individual is frequently violated byauthoritarian and repressive regimes. At Vienna in June  theWorld Conference on Human Rights sought to strengthen theprotection of human rights worldwide. Most of us whoattended that meeting came away feeling that progress hadindeed been made. It is essential that the agreed Programmeof Action be given the highest priority and acted on by thisAssembly. A United Nations commissioner for human rightsshould be appointed. The resources devoted to human rightsactivities in the United Nations system should be doubled.The United Nations human rights machinery  especially inrelation to the protection of women  should be strengthened.And we must make decisive progress on the establishmentof an international criminal tribunal to prosecute personsresponsible for violations of humanitarian law wherever theyoccur.The abuses of human rights in Yugoslavia haveprovoked a profound determination in the internationalcommunity that those responsible must be brought to justice.The ad hoc approach  unavoidable in the case of Yugoslavia points to the need for a permanent international criminaltribunal with an established jurisdiction and an identifiedbody of applicable law. The General Assembly at thissession should examine the valuable work done on this topicby the International Law Commission.We can take advantage of the changed internationalsituation to pursue our work on disarmament and armscontrol. We must intensify our efforts to halt the spread ofnuclear weapons. I am heartened by the decision of somenuclear States to maintain a moratorium on nuclear testingand I call on others to do the same. Our objective must bea comprehensive treaty banning nuclear testing forever.Ireland has proposed that the United Nations shouldelaborate a code of conduct for conventional arms transferswhich would encourage States to exercise responsibility andrestraint in their arms transfers and which would set outcommon principles to be observed in this area. We believethat  as the international community moves towards a closerunderstanding of its shared responsibility for internationalsecurity in the framework of the United Nations  such a codewould represent an important step forward in the area ofarms control.Last year Ireland called for an agenda for developmentthat would complement and stand alongside theSecretary-General’s ""Agenda for Peace"". We are pleasedthat such a report is now in preparation. Our vision of thefuture cannot ignore the images of deprivation and need wesee every day from all too many parts of the world. Thereality of this suffering is a test for all of us. The IrishGovernment is committed to doubling the percentage ofgross national product devoted to official development aid inthe period 1993 to 1997. Peace and development are notseparable.Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 33We must recognize what the Secretary-General hascalled the humanitarian imperative. The internationalcommunity must be assured that the United Nations and itsdevelopment agencies will respond quickly to emergenciesas they occur. The creation within the Secretariat of a newDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs has been a useful steptowards that end.The international community must look squarely atcertain incontrovertible features of our shared existence onthis planet: climate change  a possible doubling of theworld’s population by the middle of the next century pressures imposed by our patterns of production andconsumption  great imbalances in the availability oftechnology and resources. In many of these areas  the RioConference and its Agenda 21 have identified the wayahead. I am pleased that the Commission on SustainableDevelopment and other organs provided for in Rio are off toa promising start.We must acknowledge that the issues we address underthe auspices of this Assembly and those which arise in theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and theBretton Woods institutions cannot be separated. In all ofthese areas  our aim must be a peaceful  integratedinternational society in which our sense of the common goodincreasingly qualifies considerations of national power andimmediate expediency.As the dramatic developments in the Israeli-Palestinianrelationship and the equally historic changes in South Africahave shown  progress is possible even in the most obdurateof conflicts if the protagonists are willing to look towards acommon future.Northern Ireland represents a challenge of similardimensions to the British and Irish Governments and to thepeoples of both islands. Some would say that the conflict isfundamentally incapable of resolution. I do not accept that and I will not accept it. Like the vast majority of mycompatriots  I yearn for peace on our island.I want to see a comprehensive settlement which willenable men  women and children to go about their dailylives in peace and without fear. All of us in both islands arepaying the price of past political failures. We should not askfuture generations to bear the cost of further failure.I have no illusions about the complexity of the issues.I know that there are no easy or quick solutions - no singlestep that can remove the necessity for a long and painstakingjourney. But I believe that  with sufficient good will anddetermination  the Irish and British Governments and theleaders of the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland canlead the people they represent out of the stalemate whichexists at present towards a peaceful and secure future. AsI have said elsewhere  the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle are allto hand if only we can find the right way to fit themtogether.The Irish Government is ready to play its full part inthis. We will bring to any resumed talks the resources ofgood will  flexibility and imagination which we believe allparticipants must display if a new agreement is to beachieved.It is painfully obvious that all traditional approacheshave failed and that new thinking is urgently required. Forour part  we are willing to look afresh at our own traditionalassumptions and at our relationships with others to see ifthere are new approaches which can open a way forward.We are ready to accept the need for radical and innovativecompromise as part of a new accommodation which willbring lasting peace and reconciliation to the island ofIreland.Compromise does not mean asking either of the twotraditions in Northern Ireland to modify its fundamentalbeliefs or  indeed  to suppress its objectives. It does meanasking each tradition to recognize that the other deservesequal respect and must be accommodated on equal terms.It means accepting that diversity can be enriching rather thanthreatening and that both traditions in Ireland must find away to share the island on a basis of partnership and trust.Peace and stability will not be found in any politicalsystem which is imposed  or which is rejected by asubstantial part of the population who live within it.What we need in the island of Ireland is a collectivewill to rise above traditional suspicions and animosities anda readiness to look beyond areas of disagreement to areaswhere we can work together to mutual advantage.Peace is now the imperative  and the continuation ofviolence is the single greatest obstacle to the realization ofour hopes. An end to violence would open up newpossibilities and allow all of us to emerge from the shadowof a very troubled history.It would  at last  help to clear the way for compromiseand negotiation  leading to an agreement which wouldachieve a fair and lasting accommodation betweennationalism and unionism in Ireland. We must lift our sights34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionto the new horizons of possibility which developments in theMiddle East and South Africa have opened for us. This isthe objective of the Government which I represent. I believewe can have no higher objective."
"77",3295,"IRN",48,1993,"I shouldlike  before making my statement  to express the deepestcondolences of the people and the Government of theIslamic Republic of Iran to the people and the Governmentof India on the catastrophic earthquake that has causeduntold human suffering.Allow me  at the outset  to express sincerecongratulations to Ambassador Insanally of Guyana on hiswell-deserved election as President of the General Assemblyat its forty-eighth session. His personal qualifications anddiplomatic experience are valuable assets  which must beutilized fully and seriously to further the purposes of theUnited Nations. I wish to assure the President of mydelegation’s unreserved cooperation in this commonendeavour.I should like also to welcome the new Members of theOrganization and to express the hope that their participationin this body will enhance its universality and strengthen thespirit of universality and international cooperation. Asinternational relations are currently undergoing tumultuousand decisive change  the presence here of representatives ofthe overwhelming majority of nation States provides theGeneral Assembly at this session with a unique opportunity20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionto shape a better future and an international environmentmore in keeping with the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations.Of course  such a rare opportunity is accompanied bya grave and historic responsibility for every one of us. Wemust acquire a full understanding of the transitional natureof international relations in the world of today  and  relyingon our vast collective resources and potential  we mustprevent the resurgence and prevalence of the crises  wars injustices and human misery that have marred the first50 years of the United Nations.If  on the eve of its fiftieth anniversary  we are toensure a more dynamic and successful future for theOrganization  we must undertake a sober reassessment of ourrecord and identify our achievements as well as ourshortcomings and obstacles. Regrettably  five years after theend of the cold war  some of that era’s most negativecharacteristics are still evident in international relations.Expansionism and the urge to dominate  disregard forthe material  cultural and moral values of nations  thesuppression of democracy and of democratic institutions  andthe triumph of the short-sighted interests of the dominantfew over the interests and aspirations of the majority andover human rights and the United Nations Charter andinternational law continue to impede international affairsand  most regrettably  international organizations. This haspresented the United Nations with a historic challenge: tomaintain and enhance its perceived role and its credibilityfollowing the Persian Gulf crisis. Moreover  despite thecessation of military rivalry between major Powers  manycomplex and grave threats - including those arising fromethnic tensions  the lack of development  poverty  economicand social inequality and degradation of the environment -have taken humanity to the edge of the abyss.During the era of the cold war  relations between Eastand West - and  consequently  international relations ingeneral - were founded on misconceptions  mutual mistrustand a total lack of confidence. These factors played acentral role in the creation of an unsafe world  in which theUnited Nations was deprived of any opportunity to realize itsvast potential for the maintenance of international peace andsecurity.Therefore  our first and foremost obligation is toidentify and root out the causes of crisis and mistrustinherited from the cold war and to take appropriate steps tocreate the conditions necessary to the promotion ofunderstanding and the fostering of mutual confidence at theinternational level.This should begin with an all-out campaign of steps torestore world confidence in the United Nations. A balanced objective and far-sighted approach to various internationalpolitical  economic and cultural crises and challenges  basedon justice and on the common principles and objectivesenshrined in the Charter  is the most fundamentalrequirement for the restoration and enhancement of thecredibility of the Organization  and can also play asignificant role in securing long-term stability and trust. Inthis context  the identification  definition and deepening ofshared values and common interests will facilitateunderstanding and ensure international cooperation.Should we fail in adopting such an approach  countrieswill be forced into a security dilemma created byunacceptable survival options: namely  either to strengthentheir military capabilities and thus precipitate an arms raceor to succumb to expansionist Powers and their whims. Ineither case  the world will plunge into a new era ofinsecurity and turbulence.The Security Council plays a determining role in eitherheightening such a dilemma or reversing it. In other words the Council may either exacerbate tension and distrust orencourage understanding  confidence and respect for the ruleof law in inter-State relations.If the behaviour of the Security Council signifies anunequivocal commitment to uphold justice and the principlesof the Charter  to combat aggression and to come to the helpof the victims  and if the Council exhibits the political willto cease the application of double standards  then we canhope that potential aggressors will be deterred  internationalinstability and insecurity will be curtailed  and the immensehuman cost of wars and hostilities will be avoided.On the other hand  when  owing to politicalcalculations  some aggressions and international crimes meetwith the indifference and acquiescence of the SecurityCouncil; when the criteria for resort to forcible measuresenvisaged in Chapter VII of the Charter are the short-livedpolitical interests of Powers; when aggressions and attemptsto annihilate an entire nation do not receive a forcible resolute response  while in other cases there is a rush toresort to force before attempting to understand and deal withthe root causes of a conflict; and  finally  when somedecisions of the Council are enforced with vigour anddetermination while others remain dead letters for years;then no one can expect potential aggressors or possibleForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 21victims of foreign expansionism to form a reliableexpectation with regard to the reaction of the SecurityCouncil. Thus  having removed the credibility of thedeterrence factor  we should expect nothing but thepersistence of aggression and expansionism and theexacerbation of the ensuing horrific human tragedies inevitably leading to undesirable implications for theauthority and credibility of the United Nations.The failure of the Security Council squarely to face thePalestinian crisis and the constant aggressions against thePalestinian people  Lebanon and Syria  not to mention itsintentional failure to enforce its own resolutions  are a sadillustration of the prevailing preference of political interestsover peace  security  international law and equity. Relyingon the support of a number of powerful States  Israel haswith impunity totally disregarded pertinent Security Councilresolutions  unabatedly pursued a militaristic policy  persistedin aggression and expansionism and avoided anycommitment to international nuclear non-proliferationregimes. It is the only possessor of nuclear weapons in theregion. It has systematically and grossly violated the mostelemental human rights of the Palestinian people andemployed terrorism in all its forms as an official policy.These are facts  borne out by history and solidly based onobjective international observations and internationallydocumented evidence. Israel’s well orchestratedmisinformation campaign against others and its attempts tofan the flames of discord  distrust and division among Statesin the region cannot conceal these facts  nor should theylegitimize the unrealistic  short-sighted and imposed plans assolutions or mechanisms to return peace and stability to theregion.In our view  peace  stability and mutual confidence canreturn to the Middle East and to the Holy Land of Peace andRevelation only through a serious and even-handed treatmentof these realities and the full restoration of the inalienablerights of the Palestinian people. Based on these objectivehistorical realities  the recent accord  notwithstanding theinternational fanfare  does not present a realistic solution tothe root causes of the conflict  does not promise restorationof Palestinian rights  and thus cannot establish justice  whichis the only foundation of a lasting peace. And no one cancede Palestine on behalf of the Palestinian people orAl-Quds Al-Sharif on behalf of the Muslims. We considerthe signing of this accord as a conspiracy against Islam andPalestine  and we disagree with it.The unfolding human tragedy in Bosnia andHerzegovina is yet further disturbing evidence of theconsequences of the Security Council’s acquiescence inaggression  and failure resolutely to tackle the causes of theabhorrent attempt to annihilate an entire nation. In the faceof aggression  genocide  rape and indiscriminate murder inBosnia and Herzegovina  the Security Council  ignoringrepeated calls by the General Assembly  has failed to fulfilits international responsibility and has even deprived thevictims of the means to defend themselves. The Council prevented from action by the illusions and imaginaryinterests of a number of its permanent members  cancertainly not justify this approach by hiding behind theconvenient excuse of the existence of civil war. That excuseis unacceptable  at the least because of the fact that the verysame Council  in a much more complex situation of civilstrife in Somalia - where the identification of victim andculprit is far more difficult - has not only acted but haspractically given total management of a United Nationsoperation to a single country  which  motivated by its ownperceived interests  has undertaken massive operations whosemain victims are  ironically  the same innocent and deprivedpeople for whose help and protection the operationostensibly started.Now that  owing to the lack of serious action by theinternational community  the Bosnian Muslims have beenforced into unbalanced negotiations under military and unfortunately  diplomatic duress  it is imperative for theAssembly and the Security Council to take appropriatemeasures to guarantee the viability of the Government andMuslim people of Bosnia. The lifting of the arms embargoagainst the Bosnian Government and strengthening thedefensive capabilities of the Bosnian Muslims are  in ourview  the most effective guarantees for the durability of anypeaceful settlement and the prevention of future aggressions.Furthermore  reiteration of the principles which shouldunderlie any peaceful settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovinais necessary to induce or  if necessary  to compel theaggressors to participate seriously in negotiations for alasting and acceptable solution. They include  mostparticularly  the establishment of a durable cease-fire; thelifting of the siege of cities; unhindered access tohumanitarian assistance; the rejection of acquisition ofterritory by force or ethnic cleansing; the necessity for theevacuation of territories thus occupied; the recognition of theright of the people and Government of Bosnia to seek andreceive compensation and reparations; the honourable andsafe repatriation of refugees; and individual responsibility forwar crimes.In the light of these recent unfortunate experiences andin order to enhance the credibility of the United Nations particularly in the crucial area of peace and security  it isimperative to review and reconsider the behaviour 22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionoperational framework and rules of procedure of the SecurityCouncil. There should be no room for undemocraticpractices  hidden agendas  a lack of transparency orindifference to the views of the international community  asreflected in the General Assembly. It should never beforgotten that it is the entire membership - represented onlyin the General Assembly - which  to quote Article 24 of theCharter ""In order to ensure prompt and effective action bythe United Nations ... [has conferred] on the SecurityCouncil primary responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security"".The Council acts  in the words of Article 24  on""behalf"" of the membership. Its powers emanate from thatrole and not from any inherent right. Therefore  it isaccountable to the entire membership gathered in theGeneral Assembly. In today’s international climate  theprimacy of political interests and their tendency toovershadow the interests of the public has generated graveconcerns about the Council’s ability to take ""prompt andeffective action"". The General Assembly must thereforefully and deliberately exercise its prerogatives in this regardas the highest organ of the United Nations.Confidence-building measures by the United Nationsshould not be limited only to the realm of international peaceand security. Indeed  a multi-dimensional approach isnecessary to root out the seeds of tension and mistrust sownin the previous era. In this context  it is most important totake positive  comprehensive and objective steps forinternational promotion and protection of human rights anddemocratic institutions  for controlling and reducingarmaments  for combating the drug menace  for protectingthe environment  for eradicating poverty  for improving thedeteriorating economic plight of the South and forengendering sustainable development. Success in these areaswould not only enhance the credibility and authority of theOrganization  but would also remove the most tangiblecauses of mistrust and tension in the world at large.In spite of significant achievements in the internationalcampaign to promote respect for the exalted worth of thehuman person and the realization and attainment of themoral and material rights of that masterpiece of creation formidable challenges continue to persist in the task ofensuring respect for the most basic rights of millions ofhuman beings: the right to life and the right to a minimumof moral and material welfare. The World Conference onHuman Rights  recently held in Vienna  provided a valuableopportunity for the world community to take stock of itsachievements and shortcomings in the quarter of a centuryfollowing the first such conference  held in Tehran in 1968.The Conference addressed vital issues  such as respect forthe moral  cultural and religious values of all nations  theindivisibility of all human rights  and the rejection ofselectivity  application of double-standards and the politicalmanipulation of human rights. While not ideal  the work ofthe Conference can play a constructive role in enhancinginternational protection and promotion of human rights andthe progressive development of human-rights norms.In the logic of the divine religions - and particularlyIslam  which pioneered the campaign to respect and valuethe exalted worth of the human being as God’s Vice-Regenton Earth - human rights are vested in the human naturebestowed upon mankind by the Almighty Creator. Hence not only are they universal and independent of geographicaland temporal boundaries  but they do not have their originin conventions. Therefore  their definition  codification implementation and international promotion and protectioncannot be considered the private domain of the few whoenjoy temporary political and military superiority. That isparticularly true as those States do not have a shining recordin internal or external protection of human rights and do notoffer in their own social experience a suitable moral andmaterial environment for the welfare of human beings. Ifviolence and crime  which deprive the most vulnerablesegments of society of their right to life and dignity - I referhere to the drug menace  prostitution  pornography  rape violence and other forms of abuse of women  thedisintegration of families  profanity and vulgarity as well asdebasing of social relations - are at least the byproducts ofthe human-rights model advocated  or indeed imposed  bythat group  then others certainly have the right to examinethe prototype critically before importing it.The universality of human rights is the very opposite ofarrogating to oneself the task of setting the standards forhuman rights and of judging their observance by others particularly since even these standards are not promoteduniversally and across the board  but are  rather  resorted towhen and if the exigencies of foreign policy and economicand security interests require it.Human rights and the inherent worth of the humanperson are too important to be subjugated to short-livedpolitical considerations and interests or used as a lever forpolitical or cultural pressure or for maintaining the inequitybetween the South and the North. That can only erode theircredibility and universal acceptance. We hope that politicalwill and responsible behaviour by all countries  specificallythe countries of the North  will preclude a selective approachForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 23to the Vienna Declaration and enable the internationalcommunity to employ its collective potential to reachcommon understanding in this area and initiate a trulyuniversal campaign for the promotion and protection ofhuman rights.Another vestige of the cold-war era  which constitutesan elemental cause of international mistrust and a generallack of confidence  is the arms race and the development production  build-up and use of weapons  particularlyweapons of mass destruction - all in the misplaced hope ofenhancing national security.The conclusion of the comprehensive Convention onchemical weapons  notwithstanding its shortcomings  was ahistoric achievement. Iran  the most recent victim of thelarge-scale use of chemical weapons  actively contributed inthe drafting process  was among the sponsors of the relevantresolution in the General Assembly  and was among the firstsignatories of this important international instrument. Theeffectiveness and universality of the Convention will be afunction of the way in which it is implemented and of thedegree of commitment of its signatories.Naturally  with the conclusion of this Convention  theexisting informal regimes which impose discriminatorybarriers on free trade in the chemical industry have lost theirraison d’être and must be dismantled. The lingering ofthese regimes not only violates the spirit of the Conventionand the understandings reached during the process of itsfinalization  but also nullifies the positive incentives foracceding to that instrument. The same applies to unilateraland illegal measures such as the disruption of the freenavigation of the Chinese vessel Yinhe  in the Persian Gulf on the pretext - subsequently proven false - that it wascarrying prohibited chemical substances. Such actions canonly lead to the erosion of the authority and credibility ofthe Convention.International efforts to prevent the proliferation ofnuclear weapons face a similar danger. Politically motivatedand unfounded accusations against signatory States which arecommitted to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons simply undermine that important instrument andlead to international mistrust and the escalation of the armsrace. Before any decision on the extension of the NonProliferation Treaty in 1995  the process leading to theReview Conference should be fully utilized in orderseriously to assess the Treaty’s record during the past twodecades in the light of its overall objective of totallyeliminating nuclear weapons. The shortcomings andobstacles hindering progress towards this goal should beidentified and dealt with during the Conference in 1995.Among the most essential and useful strategies forattaining global disarmament and strengthening thenon-proliferation regime is the creation of zones free fromnuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in variousparts of the world. In the light of the constant support of theUnited Nations for the establishment of a nuclear-free zonein the Middle East  an idea initiated by Iran in 1974  it isnecessary to take constructive and practical measurestowards establishing such a zone. The institutionalization ofregional confidence-building measures  including placementof all facilities and installations under the safeguardsmechanism of the International Atomic Energy Agency andaccession by all regional States to all internationaldisarmament instruments  particularly the Non-ProliferationTreaty and the chemical weapons Convention  constitute themost important elements for the establishment of a zone freefrom nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in theMiddle East.Furthermore  the reckless build-up of conventionalweapons has not only devoured much needed resources  butalso reinforced the atmosphere of mistrust and anxiety.Different areas have  as a result  become fair ground forpolitical  economic and commercial exploitation by countriesand companies that manufacture weapons. The decision ofthe General Assembly to establish a Register ofConventional Arms Transfers constitutes a positive first stepwhich should be strengthened and further refined.However  it is evident that transparency in armamentscannot by itself control horizontal or vertical proliferation ofconventional weapons in the world. Therefore  what isreally necessary  globally and particularly in the MiddleEast  is serious and genuine international cooperation for thecomprehensive  non-selective  non-discriminatory  balancedand effective reduction of conventional arms. This may berealized  inter alia  through the reduction of military budgets of weapons procurement and of the presence of foreignforces in different regions. The Islamic Republic of Iran hasbeen cited by impartial international sources as the countrywith the lowest defence budget in the region and the fewestweapons purchases. As such  Iran is naturally prepared toengage constructively in any serious  practical andnon-sensational collective effort in this regard.Above and beyond all these steps  it is most essentialto generate the necessary political will to formulate anddirect national policies geared towards fostering aninternational atmosphere of mutual confidence. This can be24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionrealized only by basing national policies on a commitmentto the rules and principles of international law  particularlyrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of others;the inviolability of internationally recognized boundaries;rejection of the threat or use of force for the settlement ofdisputes; non-interference in the internal affairs of others;and refraining from advancing unfounded claims against theterritory of other States. The positive impact of such anapproach on promoting good-neighbourly relations encouraging regional cooperation and the enhancement ofsecurity is self-evident.Consistent with its national and strategic interests  andcognizant of its heavy responsibility in this region  theIslamic Republic of Iran has historically acted as the forcefor stability in the Persian Gulf region. Domestically  thegreatest part of the national budget has been allocated toeconomic  social and cultural development projects andreconstruction. The policy of converting military industriesto civilian use and employing the armed forces in thereconstruction sector has been vigorously pursued. Thus despite serious obstacles  fundamental progress has beenachieved in across-the-board development of the country andreconstruction of war-damaged property. Similarly  in orderto help foster regional confidence and trust  and in spite ofsensitive regional conditions and the bitter experience of arecent foreign aggression against the Islamic Republic ofIran  we have allocated a mere 1.5 per cent of the nationalbudget for defence and have had the lowest militarypurchases in the entire region.Externally  Iran has formulated its policy with a viewto encouraging and promoting security and stability in theregion  as well as expanding political  economic  cultural andscientific cooperation between the countries of the area. Theposition of principle adopted by Iran in the course of thePersian Gulf crisis; our constant effort to prevent the spreadof violence in the region; our even-handed and consistentemphasis on international understanding and compromise inAfghanistan and Tajikistan; our attempts to secure a peacefulsettlement in the Caucasus; our being host to the highestnumber of refugees in the world; and the humanitarianassistance extended by Iran to victims of crisis in the region;these are all consistent with our policy of strengtheningstability  preventing tension and mitigating the humansuffering of the crisis victims in the region. We firmlybelieve that the pursuit of these efforts  along withconsultations and cooperation between concerned States andinternational organizations  is required to contain and settlethese conflicts and alleviate their ensuing human tragedies.To ensure peace and stability in Central Asia and theTranscaucasus  it is necessary to encourage trade with thecountries of Central Asia and the Caucasus  create the rightconditions for economic development in each country reinforce regional commonalities and complementarities  andimprove the opportunities for these countries to participatemore profitably in world trade. The efforts of the membersof the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) to achievethese goals and to overcome obstacles to regionaldevelopment by consolidating mutual cooperation andfostering cooperation with other countries and internationalorganizations will contribute positively to regional andinternational peace and security. Formal collaborationbetween ECO and the United Nations  which requiresapproval by the Assembly of ECO’s request for observerstatus  will also expedite the realization of these objectives.The vital importance of the Persian Gulf for thesecurity and economic development of the Islamic Republicof Iran is self-evident. Iran  with the longest coast on thePersian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman  has historically equatedits own national security and economic prosperity withsecurity  stability  tranquillity and the free flow of oil andinternational commerce in the Persian Gulf area. It hasthereby acted as a force for stability. In this context  wehave also proposed the establishment of regional securityand cooperation arrangements in the Persian Gulf  whoseoutline I presented to the forty-fifth session of the GeneralAssembly. The experience of two devastating wars in thePersian Gulf region within one decade clearly illustrates thefact that baseless territorial claims lead to the erosion ofunderstanding and confidence  only furthering the interest offoreign Powers.Forty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 25The common religious  cultural  historical andcommercial heritage of the countries of this region providea good and solid foundation on which initiatives to reinforcemutual trust and develop multilateral cooperation betweenthese States can be founded. The Islamic Republic of Iranhas taken the initiative by manifesting its political will andadopting practical measures in order to strengthen politicalties and further develop and consolidate commercial economic and cultural cooperation with our neighbours inthe Persian Gulf. In turn  we would welcome and respondaccordingly to any positive step from our neighbours.Let me conclude by reiterating that recent internationaldevelopments and emerging challenges have placed theUnited Nations at a critical and historic crossroads. Success in our view  will depend on a sober understanding of thecauses of tension and mistrust during the cold war  followedby resolute steps to root them out. Joint effort is alsoneeded to develop and put into motion multidimensionalconfidence-building measures and techniques  consolidateand expand international cooperation  and bring aboutconditions conducive to the attainment of commonaspirations of humanity  particularly justice  security andbalanced development. The Islamic Republic of Iran is fullyprepared to intensify its efforts in cooperation with otherStates in this Assembly and in other bilateral and multilateralenvironments for the attainment of these objectives."
"78",3342,"IRQ",48,1993,"Allow me to begin by extending to you  Sir  my sincerecongratulations on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I am confident thatyour solid diplomatic background and rich experience willeffectively contribute to the success of the work of thissession.More than ever before  our Organization today needscooperation between its Member States if it is to save itselffrom attempts to divert its course from the spirit andprinciples of its Charter and thereby turn it into a tool forserving the selfish interests of certain dominant Powers  firstamong which is the United States of America.The world has attached great importance to the end ofthe bipolarity that overshadowed the international situation20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionuntil recently and restricted the ability of the United Nationsto address and resolve international problems. The new era however  has failed to provide the United Nations with theopportunity to apply the principles  objectives andmechanisms of the Charter. A single Power - the UnitedStates of America - has sought to control the manner inwhich the United Nations addresses international issues andto steer it in accordance with United States interests.The selectivity and double standard that characterize therole currently played by the United Nations make it crystalclear that the United Nations and the Security Council inparticular have become tools that execute the policies of thePowers that dominate the Organization. The United Nationsis no longer a world Organization capable of resolving theproblems and addressing the crises which beset manycountries and peoples of the world in a manner that isconsonant with the objectives and principles of its ownCharter.What did the Security Council ever do to implement itsresolution 487 (1981)  on the military aggression perpetratedby Israel against an Iraqi nuclear reactor devoted to peacefulpurposes? That resolution was adopted 12 years ago and theSecurity Council has done absolutely nothing to implementit. Indeed  we have reached the point today at which theIsraeli Deputy Defence Minister  Mordechai Gur  canarrogantly declare  as he did on 6 June 1993  that Israel doespossess nuclear weapons and that it has the capacity to bombthe Arab States with those devices. At the same time  Israelcontinues to adamantly refuse to sign the non-proliferationTreaty and the United Nations and the Security Council havedone absolutely nothing to halt the Israeli programmes ofmass destruction weapons  which include the production andstockpiling of nuclear  biological and chemical weaponstogether with the means of their delivery  regardless of thefact that those programmes constitute a grave threat to thesecurity and stability of the region and the whole world.While the United Nations is being forced to engage ina military operation in Somalia under the pretext ofproviding humanitarian assistance  the United Nations standshelpless and incapable of taking any appropriate action toput an end to the carnage or to alleviate the bitter humansuffering in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other parts offormer Yugoslavia. This paralysis takes place against thebackdrop of the shifting tides of the positions of thedominant Powers in line with their own selfish interests andschemes and their backing away from any measure thatwould help in reaching a solution or put an end to thistragedy.Because of the climate prevailing in the internationalcommunity - a climate of selectivity and double standards -the gap between North and South continues to widen at theexpense of the interests of the developing countries and Iraqfinds itself in a situation that has never been witnessedbefore by any other founding State Member of the UnitedNations. This is due to the complications and unfairtreatment meted to Iraq by the resolutions of the SecurityCouncil under pressure exerted by the United States ofAmerica and its hegemonistic policies towards others.The most telling example of the hegemony exercised bythe United States of America over the United Nations and ofUnited States monopoly of the interpretation andimplementation of the provisions of the Charter  and use ofthe mechanisms related thereto in the service of purelyAmerican rather than common international interests  is whathas been done and continues to be done to Iraq at a timewhen it has declared its commitment to the resolutions of theSecurity Council which it fully implements. In return  Iraqcontinues to be subjected to acts of aggression whichthreaten its security and territorial integrity and infringe uponits sovereignty.Iraq also remains deprived of its natural right to obtainits needs  including those described in international legalterms as basic human and civilian needs. Those needs areessential for the people of Iraq if they are to continue to leada normal life. Iraq also remains deprived of the right toexport its natural resources while its assets remain frozen.Iraq continues to be denied the right to use its civil aircraftand ships and continues to be subjected to flagrant militaryintervention in its internal affairs  to daily acts of violationof its airspace  and to the perpetration of a declaredconspiracy against its political system.Iraq has endeavoured  despite all these adversecircumstances and difficulties  to contain the crises whichcertain powers have so skilfully orchestrated in order toperpetrate further aggression against Iraq and create pretextsfor continuing to impose the iniquitous comprehensiveblockade against it. Within the framework of Iraq’s serious continuous attempts to reveal the truth  close the door on theforces of ill-intent and expose their objectives  and driven byits desire to find solutions to the outstanding issues througha serious responsible dialogue based on justice and fairnessand consistent with international law and the United NationsCharter  Iraq has called  in a letter dated 30 May 1993 fromthe Foreign Minister of Iraq to the President of the SecurityForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 21Council  for constructive and comprehensive dialogue withthe Security Council within the framework of the legal andpractical interrelationship between Iraq’s implementation ofits obligations and the text of resolution 687 (1991) on theone hand  and the Security Council’s implementation of itsown obligations towards Iraq according to the provisions ofthe said resolution  particularly paragraphs 21 and 22  on theother.Iraq calls for the Security Council to adopt fair and justpositions which would reflect the Council’s respect for itsown obligations and commitments as enshrined in the UnitedNations Charter  and thereby to respect the sovereignty independence  internal security and territorial integrity ofIraq  lift the unjust blockade that has been imposed upon thepeople of Iraq for three years now  and which has inflicted and continues to inflict  untold suffering upon them and tolift all the restrictions that are still imposed withoutjustification on normal  legitimate Iraqi activities.Iraq has cooperated objectively with all the inspectionteams and missions dispatched by the United Nations  inorder to fulfil its obligations according to the resolutions ofthe Security Council  regardless of how unjust and indeedhow extremely iniquitous those resolutions are. In fact manyof the officials of those teams and missions have confirmedthat Iraq has honoured its obligations in implementation ofthe Security Council resolutions.May I refer here  by way of example  to the statementmade by the United Nations Special Commission(UNSCOM) Executive Chairman  Mr. Rolf Ekeus  on13 January 1993  in which he said  ""Iraq’s compliance hasbeen a success so far  and it would be tragic if the last 5 percent of implementation could not to be carried out."" Earlier on 2 September 1992  Mr. Maurizio Zifferero  the head ofthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectionteam  said  ""Iraq’s nuclear programme stands at zero now.""Convinced that Iraq has met all its obligations underresolution 687 (1991)  we called upon the Security Council both as a collective body and as individual Member States just as we had long been calling upon the SpecialCommission  to conduct a technical  professional and legaldialogue with Iraq in order to specify the extent to whichresolution 687 (1991) in general  and section C thereof inparticular  have been implemented  so that the Council mayconsider implementing paragraphs 21 and 22 of theresolution  which pertain to the lifting of the economicsanctions imposed on Iraq. The dialogue proposed by Iraqwas also meant to strip away all the pretexts that havecontinued to be used to mask the illegal and aggressivemeasures unilaterally taken by certain individual Statesagainst Iraq and its territorial integrity. The most flagrant ofthose measures are the so-called ""no-fly zones"" imposed onnorthern and southern Iraq and the military acts ofaggression perpetrated by the United States against Iraq on17 January 1993 and 27 June 1993.When the Security Council responded  in July 1993  toour call for dialogue and sent the Executive Chairman of theSpecial Commission to Baghdad to conduct talks with theIraqi side  we welcomed the visit and held intensive  frankand constructive discussions with Mr. Ekeus  through whichwe reached an agreement to resolve a number of issues andto continue our dialogue in earnest on grounds that are just fair  logical and consistent with international law and theUnited Nations Charter.We presented to Mr. Ekeus  and through him to theSecurity Council  a position paper clearly expressing the wayin which Iraq envisages the relationship between Iraq’sresponsibilities towards the Security Council and itsresolutions  on the one hand  and the responsibilities of theSecurity Council  both as a body and as Member States towards Iraq’s firm rights and legitimate demands  foremostamong which are the following: to respect the sovereignty internal security and dignity of the people and State of Iraq;to guarantee Iraq’s right to development and to industrial scientific and technological progress; to implementparagraph 22 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991) pertaining to the lifting of the embargo on Iraq now that Iraqhas accomplished what is required of it under the provisionsof section C of that resolution; to work in earnest towardsthe implementation of paragraph 14 of resolution 687 (1991) pertaining to the establishment in the Middle East of a zonefree of weapons of mass destruction and the means of theirdelivery and to bring to an immediate end the so-called""no-fly zones"" imposed on northern and southern Iraq  whichconstitute an illegal use of armed force by three permanentmember States of the Security Council  aimed at interferingin the internal affairs of a Member State of the UnitedNations.Iraq reiterated its positive positions and its desire fordialogue during the meetings held last month here in NewYork by the Iraqi high-level technical delegation. We havealso endeavoured to ensure that this positive spirit prevailsin the current round of meetings which started in Baghdadon 2 October 1993. We look forward to seeing this round22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionsucceed in solving all outstanding issues in a complete andfinal manner so that the Security Council may begin inearnest to implement paragraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991)which states that the Security Council:""Decides that upon the approval by the SecurityCouncil of the programme called for in paragraph 19above and upon Council agreement that Iraq hascompleted all actions contemplated in paragraphs 8  9 10  11  12 and 13 above  the prohibitions against theimport of commodities and products originating in Iraqand the prohibitions against financial transactionsrelated thereto contained in resolution 661 (1990) shallhave no further force or effect"".In view of these developments  and in order for theprinciples of justice and equity and of the mutuality of rightsand obligations between Iraq and the Security Council toprevail  we hereby call upon all countries of the world tosupport our initiative for dialogue and understanding betweenthe Council and Iraq so that such dialogue may lead withoutdelay to the lifting of the unjust and iniquitous blockadeimposed on our country  and thereby to put an end to themethods of coercion  threats and aggression being usedagainst our country.We also call upon the countries of the world to urge theSecurity Council  both as a collective body and as individualMember States  to consider Iraq’s legitimate demands asexpressed in the Iraqi position paper submitted to theSecurity Council in July 1993. The paper deals with themost important issues  especially respect for Iraq’ssovereignty  internal security and territorial integrity  thelifting of the iniquitous blockade  the removal of the ""no-flyzones"" illegally imposed on parts of Iraq and abstaining fromany further aggression against Iraq.The people of Iraq are being subjected to inhumanepolicies and practices that have further aggravated theirsuffering which increases from one day to the next. Thedomination by the United States and its allies over theactivities of the Sanctions Committee  which was set up inaccordance with Security Council resolution 661 (1990)  hasmade that Committee hostage to premeditated politicalobjectives and ill intentions against Iraq and its people. TheCommittee has ignored the basic civilian and human needsof the Iraqi people to the extent that it has refused to allowIraq to obtain much needed medical supplies as well asequipment and educational supplies for its schools. TheCommittee has gone as far as to consider paint for schooldesks and blackboards as well as ink as proscribed materialsthat the Iraqi people should not be permitted to obtain.In refusing to grant the permission to obtain any ofthose essential civilian requirements  it resorts to flimsypretexts and unacceptable justifications. For instance  theCommittee has refused to allow pencils and notebooks to besupplied to Iraq’s schoolchildren  claiming that the quantityrequested was too large. The Committee has also rejecteda request for the supply of medical equipment  beds andair-conditioning systems for Iraqi hospitals. The reasongiven for that refusal was that the end user was not known.What irony! The Sanctions Committee has refused to allowwater purification materials to be supplied to Iraq  rejecteda request submitted by a company for the reconstruction ofa factory producing medical syringes in Iraq and refused toallow the importation of spare parts for a baby-food factoryin Iraq under the pretext that such spare parts wouldcontribute to the expansion of the country’s industrialcapability.The practices of a limited number of Member States inthe Sanctions Committee which seems to have inherited theveto privilege under the cover of general consensus  havedemonstrated beyond all doubt that the embargo is gearedtowards destroying Iraqi society with premeditatedpersistence and through organized and calculated effortsdriven by political motives that are contrary to all values laws and norms acceptable to the international communitynow or in the past.The war of destruction launched against Iraq by theUnited States and its allies  the continued imposition of thecomprehensive blockade and the denial of Iraq’s right toexport its oil and use its frozen assets in foreign banks haveall combined to make Iraq unable to provide even the mostelementary of its people’s basic humanitarian needs  such asfood and medication. The result has been a huge increase inmortality among children and the elderly  due to the graveshortage of medicines. On top of all its other difficulties invarious fields  Iraq suffers from  for example  an acuteshortage of medicines for the treatment of cancer  kidneyproblems  heart disease  diabetes  blood pressure disorders eye diseases  diarrhoea  tuberculosis and other seriousdiseases. Over the months that have elapsed in 1993 tuberculosis-related fatalities among children have risen by81 times over the figure registered for the correspondingperiod in 1989; and this is but one example.I do not wish to elaborate on the difficult humanitarianconditions of the Iraqi people. The reports by the variousmissions and agencies of the United Nations have warnedagainst the dangerous results of the deteriorating food andhealth situation brought upon the Iraqi people as a result ofthe blockade.Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 23The most recent of those reports is Food andAgriculture Organization (FAO) document 237  issued inJuly 1993 under the title ""Special Warning"". This documentdepicts the deterioration of Iraq’s food situation as a resultof the difficulties facing the agricultural sector because ofacute shortages of equipment and pesticides and the spreadof agricultural epidemics. The FAO report also points outthat the economic sanctions imposed upon Iraq have led tothe spread of deprivation on a massive scale  thus exposingthe vast majority of the Iraqi population to acute foodshortages and malnutrition  particularly children under fiveyears of age. The report also states that the economicblockade has practically paralysed the country’s economyand led to continued deprivation and the spread of massivehuman suffering.Not content with its military aggression against Iraq on17 January 1991 or with all the inhuman practices it haspursued against the Iraqi people  the United States ofAmerica has continued to perpetuate direct and unilateralacts of military aggression against Iraq under various falsepretexts and flimsy justifications. In addition to the firstcolossal aggression of 1991  the United States perpetratedtwo further acts of aggression against Iraq’s civilianpopulation and civilian installations on 17 January 1993 and27 June 1993. These two additional acts of aggressionresulted in the loss of many innocent civilian lives amongchildren  women and elderly people.As a permanent member of the Security Council  theUnited States of America has a double responsibility toabide by international law and the United Nations Charter.The United States should be the last country to resort to theuse of force in resolving disputes  yet it perpetratedaggression against Iraq on the basis of unfounded and absurdallegations that there was a conspiracy against the life of theformer United States President. In so doing  the UnitedStates Government justified its action by a twistedinterpretation of Article 51 of the United Nations Charterthat was totally alien to that article’s letter and spirit.This behaviour constitutes a grave escalation of a policythat has been and will certainly continue to be a threat tointernational peace and security  a policy that violates theright of States to self-defence  as enshrined in the Charter ofthe United Nations. The behaviour of the United States  inparticular its aggression of 27 June 1993  has met withrejection and condemnation from many countries round theworld  including some allies of the United States itself.As regards the issue of human rights  Iraq proceedsfrom a complete belief in those rights and in the fact thatrespect for  and protection of  human rights remains anunquestionable element upon which the internal structure ofsociety is established and an element that contributespositively to the establishment of peace and justice at theinternational level. It is on the basis of such conviction andsuch understanding that Iraq has acceded to manyinternational covenants on human rights. Iraq has alsohonoured its obligations by submitting regular reportsregarding the situation of human rights. While we realizethat many positive developments have taken place in thefield of human rights  reflecting the widespread recognitionof their importance  a recognition further cemented by legalprovisions in the various international covenants  thesedevelopments have not been accompanied  in terms of realapplication  by an earnest endeavour to help create the rightclimate for the declared legal provisions to be implementedin accordance with the greatly varying circumstancesprevailing in various States  according to each one’s culturalbackground  religious beliefs and level of progress anddevelopment. On the contrary: it can be seen that theconcept of human rights has become a weapon used bycertain States possessing the means of influence with whichto exert discriminatory pressure on other States for selfishpolitical objectives and interests rather than for therealization of common objectives and interests of theinternational community. What is particularly worrying tous is the neglect shown towards basic rights upheld by theinternational community and declared as governing principlessuch as the right to self-determination  the right todevelopment  the right of States to respect for theirsovereignty  stability and territorial integrity as well asnon-interference in their internal affairs.The great challenges facing the United Nations put theOrganization at a decisive crossroads  beyond which we shallsee the will of the international community either totallyparalysed under the influence of dominant Powers  orsearching for an outlet through an endeavour to restorebalance to the mechanisms governing the process ofdecision-making and decision-implementation in the variousUnited Nations agencies  with a view to ensuring theeffectiveness of the Organization and guaranteeing its abilityto resolve international problems in accordance with rules offairness  justice and international law  as well as ensuring therevitalization of the role of the United Nations on the basisof compatible and unified concepts and criteria and awayfrom double standards.The enhancement of the United Nations ability tomaintain peace requires  above all  strict adherence to theobjectives and principles of the Charter  particularly theprinciples of the sovereign equality of States  the right of24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionpeoples to self-determination  to non-interference in theinternal affairs of States and to observance of the rules ofinternational law.Iraq  as a founding Member of the United Nations  isextremely anxious that the Organization’s name and emblemremain worthy of respect and continue to be regarded as abeacon of hope by all peoples of the world. We believe thatmembership in the Security Council should go hand in handwith the new realities brought about by the increasedmembership of the United Nations  and that this should bedone in a manner that would bring about a more equitableand balanced representation of all United Nations MemberStates. The Council should abide by the principles of clarityand openness in its decision-making process; it should alsooperate with due regard to respect for the sovereign rights ofall States.My country supports the thesis put forth by theSecretary-General in his report ""An Agenda for Peace""regarding the importance of the role assigned to the GeneralAssembly by the United Nations Charter  especially in thefield of the maintenance of international peace and security.The achievement of the United Nations objectivesrequires that the mechanisms of the General Assemblyshould be strengthened within the framework of its spheresof competence stipulated by the Charter and that this shouldbe done through discussion and the adoption of resolutionson subjects of international importance.The strength and vitality of the United Nations areclosely linked to the extent of participation by its MemberStates in the process of decision-making and to theirequitable representation in the various specialized organs andagencies.The United Nations Secretary-General  in his report""An Agenda for Peace""  highlights the fundamental fact thatsocial peace is just as important as strategic and politicalpeace. He stresses that peace cannot be guaranteed withinthe framework of narrow military concept  as there areseveral economic and environmental factors that play theirpart in the maintenance of peace and that those factors canthemselves become the fuel for the eruption of conflicts andwars between peoples.The need to maintain international peace and securityputs the United Nations face to face with the responsibilityof removing the causes of conflict in which economic factorsplay the vital role.If it is said today that the world has put the dangers ofthe cold war behind it  we must remind ourselves that ourworld faces very real dangers that arise from the gravedeterioration in the world economic situation  particularly thebitter suffering of the developing countries  their increasingpoverty and the frustration of their developmentprogrammes.The gap has been growing wider and wider between therich industrial North and the poor South which is seeking anopportunity for survival as it witnesses the prices of its basiccommodities tumble  its foreign trade deteriorate  and itsresources become prey to plunder and extortion.Peace is a concept that cannot be divided. It is afundamental right for mankind  recognized by all religionsas well as by international covenants. That indivisibleconcept of peace must combine all dimensions  especiallythe economic which  if missing  exposes the internationalcommunity to grave problems and dangerous conflicts.To really guarantee international peace and security  wemust realize that this depends on the extent to which theinherent causes of conflict are removed and that economicand social development constitute the most importantfoundation upon which to establish international peace andsecurity.Once we realize this  we shall find that many of thecauses of instability arise from economic and social factors.The United Nations should address such factors in allseriousness and should give them priority in the activities ofits various organs  particularly the General Assembly and itsspecialized agencies  in a manner that would heighten theefficacy of the United Nations and the role it plays infacilitating cooperation between States in the fields ofeconomic and social development and in other areas ofinternational cooperation.This responsibility should be shouldered by the UnitedNations on the basis of the principles enshrined in itsCharter for the enhancement of the factors of economicdevelopment and progress and the establishment ofmultilateral non-discriminatory international economic orderwhich would be based on respect for the choices made bycountries and peoples and which would encourage respectfor mutual interests and put an end to exploitation andhegemony.The United Nations should focus its efforts on thesearch for the practical formulae that would lead toconsolidating the national infrastructures and enhancing theForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 25capabilities of the poorer and developing countries and helpthem overcome their difficulties  implement theirdevelopment programmes and narrow the huge gap existingat present between the rich industrial countries and thedeveloping countries. Such an effort will no doubt serve thecause of stability  security and peace in the world."
"79",3389,"ISL",48,1993,"Let me begin bycongratulating the President  on his election to his highoffice. I wish him every success and pledge to him the fullsupport of my delegation.It gives me pleasure to welcome the new MemberStates which have joined the Organization since thebeginning of the forty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly - the new Member States of Andorra  Eritrea  theCzech Republic  Monaco  the Former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia  and Slovakia. With 184 Member States - andeven more prospective Members - our Organization is ableto claim for itself a higher degree of universality than ever.In extending the reach of the United Nations  we servethe basic goals for which our Organization was brought intobeing; for the rule of law  freedom and the dignity and worthof the human person are ideals common to all men irrespective of their cultural or geographical surroundings.But the simple reach of the United Nations must not beconfused with its comprehensiveness as an institution.Therefore  as we recommit ourselves to the basic objectivesinscribed in the United Nations Charter almost 50 years ago we must also maintain the flexibility necessary to readjustour structures and working habits accordingly.The question how to maintain the cohesiveness of theUnited Nations amidst the myriad - and at times conflicting -demands being made of it presents itself nowadays withparticular force. Changes on the world stage have takenplace with almost dizzying speed in the last four years. Themost important of those changes  the passing of the coldwar  has created new opportunities for the United Nationsand has raised expectations among the peoples of the worldat large. At the same time  the world itself has in manyways become more unpredictable  placing serious obstacleson the path of long-term planning.To escape this quandary  there is a need to take abalanced view of what the United Nations can and cannot beexpected to do. We must moderate ambition with reality.We must not divorce the words we use from the actions weare willing to take. If we do  we may indeed succeed inbuilding a Platonic city in speech  a United Nations whichwould stand only a limited chance of ever being actualized but the down side would be to risk undermining the trustinvested by the public in our Organization.On the bright side  a number of recent developmentshave helped the United Nations in translating its basic visioninto reality. Breakthroughs have taken place in regionalconflicts which have been a thorn in the side of theinternational community for several decades. Governmentshave increasingly come to recognize the growing threat tothe ecosystem of our planet. The protection of human rightsis no longer seen as the exclusive domain of the nationState. Last but not least  mankind has moved further awayfrom the brink of nuclear Armageddon.Those are considerable accomplishments. But this isnone the less hardly the time for members of the communityof nations to congratulate each other. There are regions ofthe world where terrifying carnage is still taking place beforeour very eyes. Deterioration of the environment  whilehighly uneven in gravity and scope  is a long way frombeing reversed. Human-rights abuses continue in manyplaces on an appalling scale. And while the threat of aworldwide nuclear catastrophe may have passed  there is adangerous proliferation of weapons of mass destruction bringing uncertainty and new instabilities in its wake. Nowis clearly the time to rise above these issues that divide ourAssembly and to concentrate our efforts on dealing withsuch challenges effectively.The landmark peace agreement recently signed betweenformer adversaries in the Middle East should be a source ofencouragement to all nations. We are being reminded of theancient truth that where there is sufficient devotion and willamong the parties concerned  there is also a way to solveeven the most intractable issues. My Government welcomesthe historic accord between the State of Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization. We hope that the mutualrecognition of the two parties will yield further agreementsin the region  paving the way for a comprehensive peacesettlement.While paying tribute to the vision and bravery of Israeliand Palestinian leaders  I take this opportunity tocongratulate the Government of Norway on its initiative inbringing the ancient adversaries together at the same table and I also commend the Governments of the United Statesand Russia for their valuable mediation. It is now up to theworld community to provide the political support and theeconomic aid for reconstruction so vitally needed to keep theprocess alive. The Nordic Governments  for their part  have34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionalready decided to participate fully in that endeavour. Thisis a process which cannot be permitted to fail.The world community has recently witnessed anotherbold step forward  which  hopefully  also marks an importantcontribution to international peace and stability. I amreferring to the courageous statesmanship of the President ofthe Russian Federation  Boris Yeltsin  in moving decisivelytowards democratic elections to Parliament. As the onlydemocratically elected representative of the Russian people President Yeltsin deserves the vigorous support of theoutside world in carrying out his far-reaching programme ofreform.A different area offering a glimmer of hope is SouthAfrica. My Government welcomes recent progress towardsgenuine democracy in South Africa  including the decisionto hold free and fair elections next year. The internationalcommunity should now speedily heed the call of Mr. NelsonMandela  made from this podium last week  for the removalof all economic sanctions  an action Iceland hopes will servefully to normalize the status of South Africa in thecommunity of nations. Iceland  for its part  has alreadyabolished the embargo on trade with South Africa.Sadly  we face continuation of the conflicts in theformer Yugoslavia  not least the tragic situation prevailing inBosnia and Herzegovina. It serves to remind us that ethnicconflicts can no longer be regarded as the sole responsibilityof individual States. The inhumanity perpetrated on innocentcivilians in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other formerYugoslav Republics has reached a point where theinternational community must act  and decisively  with allthe resources provided for in the Charter of the UnitedNations. My Government fully supports the negotiationssponsored by the United Nations and the EuropeanCommunity  and looks forward to an early agreement andimplementation of the Geneva peace plan. The parties to theconflict must be brought to realize that a solution can befound only through peaceful means. Iceland also attachesimportance to the effective functioning of the war crimesTribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Those responsible foratrocities must be brought to justice.As the conflict in the former Yugoslavia has exposedthe present limitations of regional structures  the UnitedNations has assumed responsibility for reintroducing peaceand stability in the area. Meanwhile  there are outstandingexamples of cooperation and coordination between theUnited Nations and other organizations  including the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  the Western EuropeanUnion (WEU) and the Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe (CSCE) in the implementation ofSecurity Council resolutions with regard to the formerYugoslavia.In Iceland’s view there is a need to develop theserelationships further. Suffice it to say that NATO’sreadiness to employ military force for the relief of Sarajevoand for the long-term implementation of the Geneva peaceplan would serve the interests of the international communityand should therefore be welcomed and encouraged.Two years ago we welcomed the three Baltic States Estonia  Latvia and Lithuania  as sovereign Members of theUnited Nations. Since then the world community  and theirEuropean neighbours in particular  have reached out andoffered cooperation and help in the ongoing reconstructionof those Republics. The Baltic States have  for their part demonstrated their willingness to live up to the higheststandards of democratic societies. They adhere tointernational instruments and are members of organizationsthat are fully capable of monitoring their respect forinternational obligations in the field of human rights andfundamental freedoms. I should like to express myGovernment’s hope that negotiations on the departure of allforeign military forces from Estonia and Latvia will soon besuccessfully concluded and a clear timetable established.The recent departure of foreign forces from Lithuania shouldset an example.Restoring the environment and attaining sustainableglobal development are among the most challenging tasksfacing the world community today. The outcome of theUnited Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment  held in Rio de Janeiro last year  has broughtthose tasks into sharper focus. The subsequent establishmentof the Commission on Sustainable Development was animportant step in facilitating international cooperation for theeffective follow-up and implementation of the outcome ofthe Conference. However  declarations  strategies and actionplans are only as good as their implementation. If thecredibility of the United Nations in this area is to bemaintained in the wake of the Rio Conference  we mustmake sure to obtain real action and results.The action programme contained in Agenda 21 of theRio Conference provides a sound basis for our individual orjoint activities aimed at sustainable development. It doesnot  however  cover all activities harmful to the environment including pollution of the marine environment fromland-based activities and the depletion of marine livingresources in many parts of the world. While the programmecontains important recommendations pertinent to theseForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 35issues  the main responsibility for developing global actionto protect the marine environment and to conserve its livingresources has been delegated to other forums  including theUnited Nations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks andHighly Migratory Fish Stocks.Iceland has participated actively in that Conference.Together with Argentina  Canada  Chile and New Zealand Iceland has submitted a draft convention that seeks to dealon a global level with the conservation and rationalmanagement of straddling fish stocks and highly migratoryfish stocks. Consistent with the United Nations Conventionon the Law of the Sea  the draft convention calls forincreased regional cooperation in the establishment ofconservation and management measures and elaboratesmechanisms for the enforcement of agreed measures. MyGovernment will continue to work with all other interestedGovernments to achieve results at the next session of theConference  results acceptable to all fishing nations  bothdistant-water States and coastal States.As a nation overwhelmingly dependent on marine livingresources  Iceland has supported efforts to establish aninternational regime to govern all aspects of the uses of theoceans. Iceland participated actively in the Third UnitedNations Conference on the Law of the Sea and ratified theUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1985.Iceland believes that the Convention provides for a widelyacceptable regime for the rational exploitation of the world’smarine resources and establishes rules for a wide range ofuses for the seas  thereby reducing the potential for conflictamong States in this field.The Government of Iceland is greatly encouraged bythe results of the most recent round of consultations  underthe auspices of the Secretary-General  directed at addressingproblems which have prevented certain industrializedcountries from becoming parties to the Convention. We arehopeful that at the next round agreement will be reached onthe framework of negotiations which will enable the earlyentry into force of the Convention with universalparticipation.As early as 1989 Iceland emphasized in this forum theneed for a new international instrument  an ""Earth Charter"" which would define the responsibilities and rights of nationswith respect to the environment. My Government regretsthat an agreement on such a charter was not reached beforethe Rio Conference. We would therefore strongly supporttransforming the Rio Declaration into an ""Earth Charter""before the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations twoyears hence.All nations have an obligation not only to protect andpreserve the environment  but also to promote human rightsand foster social and economic progress. The UnitedNations Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna lastJune was a world event of major significance. The resultsof the Conference  especially when seen in the context ofimprovements in the international political climate in therecent past  give us reason to hope for a more effectiveimplementation of human rights and fundamental freedomseverywhere.For the first time ever it appears that the majority ofcountries in the world now pledge allegiance to theprinciples of democratic rule of law. Still  we areconfronted with breaches of human rights all around theworld. In the follow-up to the Conference on HumanRights  we must address such breaches squarely and focusattention on ensuring greater respect and accountability byGovernments for the protection of human rights. Thismeans  among other things  devoting more resources to thisfield as a reflection of the political commitment of MemberStates. Increased resources are required if the Centre forHuman Rights is to be able to provide effective advisoryservices and human-rights monitoring. At the same time Iceland would like to support the establishment of the postof high commissioner for human rights.The determination of our countries to promote socialprogress and better standards of life is an importantcommitment embedded in the United Nations Charter.Iceland hopes that the world summit in 1995 will serve tobring issues of social development into sharper focus andhighlight  in particular  the plight of the more than onebillion people living below the absolute poverty line.In this connection  I would like to draw specialattention to the growing problem of world populationcontrol  which could have serious social  economic andenvironmental repercussions if not properly managed in thedecades ahead. Around 90 per cent of the predicted worldpopulation growth between now and the end of the firstquarter of the twenty-first century is expected to occur in thedeveloping countries  placing enormous new strains on theirresources. Against this background  the decision to convenean international conference on population and developmentin Cairo next year is to be welcomed.To stimulate social development  we need  among otherthings  economic growth. The liberalization of world tradeis the single most important vehicle for world economicgrowth. The growing importance of the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is clearly manifested in the36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionflood of new accessions and the overriding importanceattached to the Uruguay Round by the Governments of theworld. Since the end of the cold war  GATT has achievedan even greater role in international relations; countries intransition see it as a vital venue for their relations with eachother and for their integration into the world economy. Inthe last few years political walls between cultures andnations have been demolished. Trade barriers must not however  be allowed to replace iron curtains.Economic reform  the environment  job-creation andinvestment  to name but a few  are issues that affect and areaffected by international trade. A successful conclusion ofthe Uruguay Round  which now seems to be within reach would dramatically improve our ability to deal with thoseproblems through international cooperation and trade. Afailure  on the other hand  would be a fatal blow to themultinational trading system and to GATT. Protectionismwould again raise its ugly head and conflicts would erupt with disastrous consequences for the world economy.GATT’s business is therefore the world’s business.The Uruguay Round represents a tremendous opportunity torevitalize world trade. All countries stand to gain from this.The biggest gain will accrue to the developing countries andto economies in transition. We who are gathered here at theGeneral Assembly representing the citizens  our countries’consumers  cannot and must not allow special-interest groupsto block the negotiations in the few strenuous final stepsneeded to reach the goal before the end of this year.Issues of social and economic development  of humanrights and of environmental protection are part and parcel ofthe notion of extended security  which we are all gettingaccustomed to in the aftermath of the cold war. Armscontrol remains  however  a very important element ofpost-cold-war security. The success achieved in nuclear- andconventional-arms control in recent years represents ahistorical turning-point which must be exploited for thelong-term advancement of global peace and stability. Here the United Nations is singularly well placed to assume amore active role. This applies to both global perspectivesand support for regional initiatives.The systematic acquisition of nuclear warheads  ballisticmissiles  and chemical and biological weapons by a numberof States is a matter of serious concern to the internationalcommunity. Non-proliferation should be given priority andefforts made to ensure that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is both universallyadhered to and indefinitely extended. It is also to be hopedthat the present moratorium on nuclear testing willeventually be succeeded by a comprehensive and verifiabletest ban.Peace-keeping operations are among the areas wherethe Organization has enjoyed considerable success. Theresult is that Member States have placed increasing demandson the Organization. However  the time has now come toreview the activities of the United Nations in this field. Thegoal must be to ensure that peace-keeping operations servethe purpose for which they were intended and that theirmandates are specific and more limited in time. In thisconnection  the idea of a United Nations stand-by force thatwould enable the United Nations to act swiftly when crisesarise should be carefully considered. The existence of sucha force would enhance the credibility of and respect for theOrganization. Meanwhile  Member States must live up totheir current obligations and pay their assessed contributionsto peace-keeping operations in full and on time.At the outset of my speech I referred to the need forthe United Nations to be responsive to change. Since thelast review of the membership of the Security Council tookplace  there has been a substantial increase in the number ofStates Members of the United Nations. At the same time theCouncil has  especially in recent years  increasingly assumedthe role envisaged for it in the relevant provisions of theCharter. The time is therefore ripe to review the Council’smembership. The goal of such a review must be to makethe Council more representative and thus  indeed  moreeffective.I would like to welcome initiatives taken recently tostreamline the structure of the United Nations and to makeits daily operations and management more effective. This isnecessary in particular in order for the Organization toregain the trust of its Member States. In this connection Iceland favours the establishment of a permanent office ofinspections and investigations and hopes that such an officewill help to ensure that allegations of fraud  waste andcorruption are investigated expeditiously.Now  more than ever  there is an opportunity for theUnited Nations to adapt to the positive politicaldevelopments of the recent past and to revamp its structuresfrom within. Let us join forces in building a stronger UnitedNations  a United Nations which embodies the ideals of itsfounders and remains at the same time responsive to thebasic needs of people everywhere."
"80",3436,"ISR",48,1993,"I should like to congratulate you Mr. President  on your unanimous election to preside overthe forty-eighth session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly.We feel strongly that the time has come for all of us -communities  nations  peoples  families - finally to lay thelast collective wreath on the tombs of the fallen combatantsand on the monuments of our beloved. It is the right way tohonour their memories and to answer the needs of the newlyborn. We have to lay the foundations for a new MiddleEast.The peace agreement between us and the Palestiniansis not just an accord signed by political leaders. It is anongoing  profound commitment to the next generation ofArabs and Israelis  Christians  Muslims  Jews and people ofall other faiths.We know it is not enough to declare an end to war.We have to try to eradicate the roots of all hostilities. If weonly bring violence down but ignore misery  we maydiscover that we have traded one menace for another peril.Territorial disputes may have been the reason for warsbetween nations  and poverty may again become the seed ofviolence between peoples. While signing the documents onthe lawn of the White House  I could almost sense thebreeze of a fresh spring  and my imagination began towander to the skies of our land  which may have becomebrighter to the eyes of all people  both those who agree andthose who oppose. On the lawn one could almost hear theheavy tread of boots leaving the stage after a hundred yearsof hostility. One could have heard the gentle tiptoeing ofnew steps making a debut in a world awaiting peace.Yet we could not depart from reality. I know that thesolution to the Palestinian issue may be the key to a newbeginning  but it is in no way the answer to the many needsawaiting us upon our return home.The last decade saw great changes  including the end ofEast-West confrontation and the opening of the way for thegradual disappearance of North-South polarization. Thegreat continent of Asia and the picturesque continent ofSouth America introduced the dynamics of an economicdevelopment of their own. The dramatic event in SouthAfrica is a declaration to the same effect. So  contrary to allassumptions  it has been demonstrated that neither geographynor race is a hindrance or an advantage to economicpromise.We witnessed the end of some wars only to discoverthat the warriors did not reach their own promised land.Some colonized people gained their independence  but theyhardly enjoyed its fruits. The dangers may have been over but their hopes evaporated. We have learned that the end ofa war should be the beginning of a new genesis  which willbe the end of belligerency and will put an end topsychological prejudices.No nation  rich or poor  is able nowadays to attainsecurity unless the region in which it exists is secure. Thescope of regional security must exceed the range of ballisticmissiles  which may hit each and all of us.As we strive to achieve a comprehensive peace  nowound must remain unhealed.Geographically speaking  we live side by side with theJordanian Kingdom  and what is so obvious geographicallymust become clear politically. We have already agreed withthe Hashemite Kingdom on many complicated issues  andthere is no doubt that we can complete the story fully  thatwe can offer the people on both sides of the river full peace that the Dead Sea can become a spring of new life and thatthe old waters of the River Jordan can be a source ofprosperity flowing from each side to the other.We hope - as a matter of fact  we are determined - tomake peace with Syria  yet we ask the Syrian leadership  ifit has chosen peace  why it refuses to meet openly. If Syriais aiming for the Egyptian fruits of peace  it must follow theprocess that led to them. Both of us have to look ahead andrealize that the threats of war are no more than an illusionthat one can return to an unbearable past.We shall not give up our negotiations with ourLebanese neighbours. We do not have any territorial claimsor any political pretensions concerning Lebanon. We pray together with many Lebanese  that their country will nolonger be a back yard for troublemakers. It is for Lebanonto make a choice between Hizbollah  on the one hand  whichoperates from its territory and then takes orders from anotherGovernment  and  on the other  insisting on having onearmy  one policy  and offering real tranquillity to its peopleand security to its neighbours. Lebanon does not need alicense to regain its independence  and Lebanon should notpostpone its return to its balanced  traditional policy.I am not sure whether there is a new order in theworld  but all of us feel there is a new world awaiting anorder. We are encouraged by the new attempt of the UnitedNations and its Secretary-General to answer the social and22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioneconomic call of the present era. The United Nations wascreated as a political answer; today it must face social andeconomic questions.The Middle East  which has been an important agendaitem in United Nations history  must become prosperous  notonly peaceful. To construct a modern Middle East we needwisdom no less than financial support.We have to rid ourselves of the costly follies of thepast and adopt the principles of modern economy. Whowill  and who should  pay the cost of oversized armies?Who will  and who should  bear the price of an arms racewhose cost has reached $50 billion annually? Who will  andwho should  pay for the inefficiencies of old systems? Whowill  and who should  compensate for outmoded censorshipof mail and control of trade and travel? And who willcomply with the State where suspicion intercepts theenterprising spirit of the people?We can  and we should  turn to the promises ofscientific development  the market economy andcomprehensive education. We must base our industry agriculture and services on the highest of today’stechnologies. We have to invest in our schools. Israel  acountry of immigration  is blessed with many scientists andengineers. We shall gladly make this human wealthavailable as a contribution.I know that there is suspicion; that  when referring toa common market in the Middle East or announcing anIsraeli contribution  it may be perceived as an attempt to winpreference or to establish domination. May I say sincerelyand loudly that we did not give up territorial control toengage ourselves in economic superiority. The age ofdomination  political or economic  is dead. The time ofcooperation has begun.As a Jew  may I say that the virtue and the essence ofour history since the times of Abraham and thecommandments of Moses have been an uncompromisingopposition to any form of occupation  domination anddiscrimination. For us  Israel is not just a territorialhomeland  but a permanent moral commitment as well.There are other questions  concerning the building of acommon market in the Middle East  as to how to attain thiswhen governments are so varied and economies are sodifferent. The differences in governments and economiesshould not prevent us from doing together what can be donetogether: combating the desert and offering fertility to anarid land.The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UnitedNations declared that the Middle East must double itsagricultural production in the 25 years to come. Thepopulation of the region in the same period will double itselfanyway. The land is cut by many and large deserts and itswater resources are stingy and scarce. Yet we know that ina similar period of time - the 25 years between 1950 and 1975 -Israel was able to increase its agricultural output twelvefold -an increase unprecedented in history.During the past decade  95 per cent of the growth ofour agriculture resulted from research  planning  training andorganizing. High technology permits nations to attain realindependence and to experience genuine freedom  politicalas well as economic. There is nothing new about thescarcity of water in our midst. Jacob and Esau drank fromthe same wells even when their paths were separated. Butthen  unlike today  they could not desalinate the sea water;they could not computerize irrigation; nor could they enjoythe potential of biotechnology.We are meeting again with an entirely differentopportunity. Greening the land can be accompanied by thecreation of many new jobs for all people in the area. Themost promising opportunity may be the development oftourism. No other branch of modern industry assures animmediate growth of the Middle East like this one. Our areais blessed by nature and by history  a history which is stillvery much alive: the eternity of Jerusalem  the magnificenceof the pyramids  the symbols of Luxor  the Hanging Gardensof Babylon  the Pillars of Wisdom in Baalbek  the redpalaces of Petra  the inimitable charm of Marakesh  the oldwinds which still blow in Carthage  not forgetting thebeaches of Gaza or the scent of Jericho’s perfumed fruits.We have to open roads to those wonders and keep them safeand hospitable. Tourism depends on tranquility; tourismenhances tranquillity. It makes friendship a vested interest.Thirdly  we have to build an infrastructure with modernmeans so as to avoid the pitfalls of the past. Moderntransportation and revolutionary communications crossing theair  covering the ground and connecting the seas will turngeographical proximities into an economic advantage. Weshould not ask taxpayers of other countries to finance folliesof our own. We have to correct them ourselves. We do nothave the moral right to ask for the financing of unnecessarywars or wasteful systems.If the thumping of hammers replaces the thunder ofguns  many nations will be more than willing to extend ahelping hand. They will invest in a better future. They willsupport the replacement of unwarranted confrontation withForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 23much-needed economic competition. Markets can serve theneeds of the people no less than flags can signify theirdestinies. The time has come to build a Middle East for thepeople and not just for the rulers.It was not simple to open the locked doors to peace. Inthe name of God  let them not be closed again. Let peacebe comprehensive  embracing all issues  all countries  allgenerations. We suggest that we all negotiate together asequals. We offer a common ground of mutual respect andmutual compromise. Thirteen years have passed since wemade peace with Egypt. We are grateful to Egypt and itsPresident for expanding understanding  overt and hidden. Ina world in which so many insoluble problems reside  thePalestinians and we have finally shown that in fact there areno insoluble problems  only people who tend to believe thatmany problems are insoluble.We have negotiated one of the most complicated issuesof the last 100 years. We are grateful to the United Statesfor its support and leadership. We are grateful to bothPresident Clinton and Secretary Christopher for their crucialrole. We appreciate the Egyptian role and the Norwegianencouragement; the European involvement and seriouscontribution; the Asian support and blessing. Maybe wenow have the right to say to other people in conflict: ""Donot give up. Do not surrender to old obsessions and do nottake fresh disappointments at face value."" What we did others can do as well.We are determined to make the agreement with thePalestinians into a permanent success. Israel would considerthe economic success of the Palestinians as though it wereits own  and I believe that a newly achieved security willserve the aspirations of the Israelis and the necessities of thePalestinians.Gaza  after 7 000 years of suffering  can emancipateitself from want. Jericho  without its fallen walls  can see itsgardens blossom again.As the twentieth century comes to a close  we havelearned from the United States and Russia that there are nomilitary answers to the new military dangers  only politicalsolutions. Successful economies are no longer a monopolyof the rich and the mighty. They represent an openinvitation to every nation ready to adopt the combination ofscience and open-mindedness. We see at the end of thiscentury that politics can achieve more by good will than bypower  and that the young generation watching theirtelevisions compare their lot with the fortunes or misfortunesof others. They see freedom  they watch peace  they viewprosperity  all in real time. They know that they can attainmore if they work harder.If we want to represent their hopes  we have tocombine wise policies and regional security with marketeconomies. Historically we were born equal  and equally wecan give birth to a new age.""Behold  the days come  saith the Lord  that theplowman shall overtake the reaper  and the treader of24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessiongrapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shalldrop sweet wine  and all the hills shall melt."" (TheHoly Bible  Amos 9:13)So said the Prophet."
"81",3483,"ITA",48,1993,"I would like to express ourwarmest congratulations to Guyana and to you personally Sir  on your election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session.I am also pleased that in the past year the UnitedNations family has grown to include the Former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia  the Czech Republic  Slovakia Andorra  Monaco and Eritrea. We wish to extend a specialwelcome to the last two in view of our long-standing historicand human ties.Italy  deeply committed to European political andeconomic unity  shares the views expressed by the BelgianMinister of Foreign Affairs  who is the current Chairman ofthe European Council.We are not simply voicing conventional wisdom if westress the depth of the transformations that define the timesin which we live. Every day brings forth new proof that theend of the cold war has brought us to a watershed. We mustcarefully decipher the lessons and courageously shoulder thenew tasks with which this moment has presented us.As the Secretary-General said in Milan  internationallaw is the main instrument at our disposal; it is not merelya regulatory instrument but the very language of the relationsbetween States. But the social pressures we are now facingare profoundly new  generating changes that internationallaw must begin to reflect as it translates new needs into newinstitutions.If today we believe we can govern this transformation and if we refuse to yield to the disorderly growth of a newinternational order  we have first and foremost the renewedvitality and prominence of the United Nations to thank.The United Nations has evolved on the foundation ofpractices that are solidly inscribed in the Charter  whilediscovering new ways to pursue its aims. Takepeace-keeping  a practice from the United Nations earliestdays that has recently acquired a special role. Today peaceis more likely to be threatened by the explosion of internalconflicts (though at times with transnational components)than by acts of open aggression across international borders.Peace-keeping  peace-enforcement  and humanitarian reliefmissions all take place in the midst of conflicts withcomplex political causes  and tangled ethnic and nationalroots. In such an environment  the traditional juxtapositionof diplomacy and military action no longer corresponds tothe reality of the present  and a broad initial mandate is notsufficient concretely to define operations in the field.The unity of military command is an unquestionableprinciple  without which no operation can succeed.However  the political management of an operation cannotbe confined strictly to military options  especially when thereal issue is not the legitimacy of the use of force (whichmay be clearly authorized by the Security Council’smandate)  but its advisability and timing in view of thepolitical objectives. I would add that in situations involvingcrowds of civilians  we must consider making it our policyalways to give pride of place to the use of non-lethalanti-riot equipment. This is not only an Italian concern.Spokesmen for other countries have also stressed thatcountries contributing troops to United Nationspeace-keeping missions need mechanisms that would exempttheir troops from passively abiding by orders that may beillegal  inconsistent  or in contradiction with the aims of theoperation.The United Nations peace-keeping practices reveal anawareness of the need for adequate prior consultation oftroop-contributing countries. To this end  while Article 29of the Charter provides a general guideline for theestablishment of bodies subsidiary to the Security Council Article 44 could provide a more fitting solution to theproblem. It provides for the Security Council to establish16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionconsultative procedures with non-members of the SecurityCouncil that have been requested to contribute troops topeace-keeping and security operations. Today  even in theabsence of formal agreements such as those provided for byArticle 43  I believe we should extend Article 44  byanalogy  to operations conducted under Chapter VII of theCharter.In his ""An Agenda for Peace""  the Secretary-Generaldefined peace-building as laying the necessary political andsocio-economic foundations for a lasting peace after thephase of open conflict has ended. The reconstruction - orthe establishment - of legal and economic institutions incritical areas and countries represents the main prerequisiteof an enduring peace.These premises form the basis of what Italy means topropose in order to move beyond the current situation inSomalia - a situation characterized somewhat by giving prideof place to the military aspect of the United NationsOperation in Somalia (UNOSOM) and by the standstill inthe political process. We believe that it is essential that theUnited Nations step up its political efforts at peacemaking byappointing a personality of great international prestige torenew the political and diplomatic initiative with all theSomali factions. At the same time  the mechanisms of theAddis Ababa Conference should be reactivated in such away as to increase the involvement of the African nationsand their institutions in the normalization of Somalia. Butthe predominantly political nature of our operation to restorehope in Somalia must also be translated into the progressivereconstruction of Somalia’s basic economic and socialstructures and the reorganization of a government and itsadministrative structures. This requires broad developmentprogrammes  to which Italy’s commitment has remainedunswerving even in the most difficult moments.Italy welcomes the renewed central role of the UnitedNations  and at the same time supports a reform of itsinstitutional mechanisms.Let us first consider the possibility of a change in themembership of the Security Council. As Italy emphasizedto the Secretary-General last June  since the Security Councilis moving towards a future of greater burdens andresponsibilities  its representativeness and effectiveness mustdevelop in parallel. What we suggest is that  in addition tothe permanent members with veto power and thenon-permanent members  a third category be established. Itwould be made up of countries able to make a specialcontribution to achieving the objectives of the UnitedNations. What matters is not drawing up controversial lists but identifying objective criteria for selection  based oneconomic factors  human resources  culture  and masscommunications. These countries would rotate two at atime  thereby becoming semi-permanent members of theCouncil.We must all recognize the renewed central role of theUnited Nations in international relations  but avoidinterpreting this role in exclusive terms.The regional dimension of multilateralism  which isdescribed in Chapter VIII of the Charter  has today a greatrole. Take the Conference on Security and Cooperation inEurope (CSCE)  which has been explicitly defined as aregional institution on the basis of the United NationsCharter. Italy is about to assume the chairmanship of theCSCE. We believe that it is being called on to play anincreasing role  mainly in preventive diplomacy but also inpeace-keeping and in fostering negotiated settlements. Inthis regional framework  we would welcome more stringentregulations on arms transfers that build on the present UnitedNations provisions.If it is true that without peace there can be neitherdevelopment nor satisfaction of social needs  it is also truethat conflict is fed everywhere not only by the urge tosubjugate the adversary violently but also by the existence ofsocial injustice  imbalance and poverty.The first and basic injustice is the violation of humanrights. When the international community defends humanrights  it is pursuing absolute and autonomous values thatmust be protected. At the same time  it is eradicating manyof the causes of violence between groups and nations.We hope that an agreement between the groups willfinally make it possible to end the fighting in Bosnia.However  as the international community prepares to supportthe implementation of an agreement  we must not forget thewar crimes and the crimes against humanity committedduring this tragic conflict. Thus  we applaud theestablishment of the International Tribunal and hope that -impartial and free from political influences - it will begin itswork at the earliest possible date. Where appropriate  theTribunal should hand down tough sentences  although I takeexception to the death sentence  which Italy firmly opposeson the basis of its time- honoured juridical traditions.Forty-eighth session - 30 September l993 17I wonder if the international community could notsummon the same determination to establish an internationalcriminal court to prosecute the most serious human rightsviolations.Italy is convinced that human rights prosper in systemsbased on democracy and an open-market economy. That iswhy we firmly support Governments that are committed tosuch goals and work courageously through hardships andtemporary crises.An issue of great contemporary relevance is theprotection of minorities - which cannot be separated fromthe protection of individuals  for the two issues are based onthe same hopes  the same principles of freedom and thesame respect for cultural  religious and philosophicaldifferences. Too often  the territorial integrity of the Statehas been contrasted with the rights of minorities. Instead we must demonstrate that in a democracy  a democracy thatleaves room for direct participation and for true pluralism ofidentity and choice  it is possible to balance these twoequally worthy values. We must demonstrate that there isno contradiction between the protection of minorities and thestability of borders. On the contrary  as the experience ofmy country shows  they can reinforce each other.The principles  institutions and rights that make peacemore solid are a primary consideration. But we must neverunderestimate the often-decisive role played by weapons.The accumulation and development of weapons endangersstability since the perception of a threat triggers actions thatare harmful for peace and economically ruinous.That is why disarmament and non-proliferation  even inthe post-cold-war era  must remain one of our mainobjectives and why we highly value the message deliveredfrom this podium by the President of the United States.We need to complete past disarmament initiatives thatwe have agreed to and begun  and both confirm and expandexisting tools. We strongly support the early ratification ofthe Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II (START II). TheNon-Proliferation Treaty must be strictly observed  which iswhy North Korea’s unclear attitude towards that Treaty is amatter of such great concern. That Treaty must also bestrengthened and made universal. In 1995  we should alljoin together to renew the Treaty unconditionally and for anindefinite period.Today we are witnessing the emergence of a collectiveconsciousness  the expansion of a shared system of values an international citizenship based on common  objectiveinterests and the spread of more uniform lifestyles. AnItalian philosopher  Giambattista Vico  wrote:""Ultimately  once the cities got to know each other having shared dealings in war  alliances and trade  theycame  to an unprecedented extent  to the recognition ofnatural civic rights as a natural right of all peoples  thatis of all united nations - as if the world were one largecity - which is the law of humankind.""That was written in the early eighteenth century.Faced with a world beset by multiple conflicts  inwhich individual nations or groups often pursue theirinterests through the use of force  it would be intellectuallydishonest and morally reprehensible to adopt attitudes ofresignation or fatalism. Violence is no more natural thanpeaceful coexistence and collaboration between peoples andgroups. Acting against violence and for coexistence istherefore not only morally desirable  but actually practicable.One such possibility has been eloquently demonstratedin recent days by the hopeful development of a peacefulfuture in the Middle East thanks to the courage of theIsraelis  the Palestinians and the Arab countries. As aMediterranean country with a long tradition of activeinvolvement in the cause of stability and peace in the area Italy is ready to contribute further to help the entire regiontake the first steps on a long and complex journey towardpeace and cooperation  with borders permanently defined inaccordance with Security Council resolutions. The samepossibility is confirmed by the promising steps being takentowards democracy and coexistence in South Africa.The awareness of the possibility and the moral duty toact must also inspire our attitude towards the economic andsocial problems that dehumanize the lives of millions ofpeople all over the world. I am referring to developmentpolicies  which should be conducted in a spirit of solidarityand on the basis of multilateral coordination. Suchcoordination must also be extended to bilateral initiatives while we also need closer cooperation between agencies.That approach has already produced successful results inMozambique and Eritrea  and even in war-torn Somalia. Itmust now be applied to endorse the peace process in theMiddle East. The donors’ conference about to open inWashington will provide an important occasion to translateour political support into action.We know the limits of our actions  and we cannot allowourselves to be swayed by the temptations of noble butabstract Utopias. It is our responsibility to draw up18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionprinciples and instruments that are valid for the times inwhich we live and that can help us to manage and totransform in a more rational and humane way the reality thatsurrounds us.Each country must promote this action on its own orthrough alliances or other groups. But it is ultimately here in the framework of this Organization and in view of itsuniversal aims and membership  that each country will haveto contribute to the solution of these problems. To do this we must not limit ourselves to declaring principles but rather  on the basis of those principles we must be willing tohand the United Nations the tools it needs. The internationalcommunity - in other words  we as Member States - isgiving the United Nations greater and greater responsibilities.But the responsibilities of the United Nations are ourresponsibilities. The problems of the United Nations are ourproblems."
"82",3529,"JAM",48,1993,"Mr. President  it givesme great pleasure to see you  a son of the Caribbean presiding over the General Assembly at this forty-eightsession with the skill  competence and wealth of experiencewe have come to associate with you. My delegation isconfident that under your leadership this session of theGeneral Assembly will complete its vitally important agenda.I also wish to express to your predecessor His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria  ourappreciation for the most able manner in which he presidedover the forty-seventh session.16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionMay I take this opportunity also to welcomeformally to the United Nations the six countries - the CzechRepublic  Eritrea  Monaco  the Slovak Republic  The FormerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia  and Andorra - whichjoined the Organization this year.Today the global community is at a crossroads inhistory  poised between the prospect of peaceful economicprogress through globalization and technologicaladvancement and a relapse into conflict fuelled by poverty political tyranny and ethnic strife. This situation hasemerged with the end of the cold war  which has ushered inideological détente  and where the threat of nuclear conflictbetween super-Powers has receded. This is not  however  acause for complacency  because unsupervised economicglobalization coupled with an escalation of politicalfragmentation could ignite fierce conflict between economicblocs and social groups world wide. The present dilemmais how we can capitalize collectively on the advantageoffered by economic globalization  while avoiding politicalfragmentation owing to the resurgence of religious andethnic intolerance and chauvinistic nationalism.Globalization  if not complemented by a comprehensiveglobal economic framework  could lead to wider disparitiesbetween developed and developing countries  leaving agrowing portion of the world’s population mired in povertyas entire productive sectors and economic activities aremarginalized from the dynamic of economic growth in theworld economy. The United Nations is the only forum thatcan forge a global institutional consensus  a multilateralregulatory regime  and commonly subscribe to goals andunderstandings that will reduce the tendency to economicinequities. A shared economic development consensus couldprovide the basis for more equitable participation for the lessdeveloped countries.Whether mankind succeeds in seizing the presentopportunity for peace and economic progress dependscrucially on the United Nations as a mechanism for a newglobal dialogue based on genuine partnership between Stateswith widely differing philosophies  policies and practices.The United Nations  with severe constraints of financial andhuman resources  has in the past year courageouslyattempted to meet these challenges  understandably withmixed results.We therefore wish to pay tribute to theSecretary-General and his dedicated staff of professionalswho have played a critical role in the search for resolutionof bitter conflicts in every region - conflicts which haveinflicted massive human suffering and devastation of theland.In Cambodia  elections have taken place and a newGovernment has been installed. That achievement inCambodia will  we hope  mark the beginning of a new eraof peace and stability in South-East Asia.On the African continent  we welcome the signing ofthe Cotonou Peace Agreement on 25 July  and we urge thatall the parties to the conflict in Liberia remain committed tothis Agreement and work with the United Nations and theEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)to bring lasting peace to that country. Unfortunately  thesituation in Somalia continues to be tragic and dangerous.We hope that  through the efforts of the United NationsOperation in Somalia (UNOSOM) and others  there will bea speedy return of peace to this land fractured anddevastated by civil strife. Jamaica regrets the continuingloss of life of members of the UNOSOM forces.Developments in South Africa are moving in a positivedirection. We welcome the decision to hold  on27 April 1994  elections open to all parties which will markthe transition of South Africa to a democratic and non-racialsociety  and we eagerly anticipate the establishment of theTransitional Executive Council. The call by Mr. Mandelafor the removal of sanctions is a welcome one. Jamaica hasparticipated in building consensus for the United Nationsresolution to lift sanctions  and it intends to lift themimmediately upon the adoption of the resolution.The situation in the States of the former Yugoslavia isalso an agonizing chronicle of tragic strife  suffering andabuses. We continue to hope for a just settlement on thebasis of Security Council resolution 859 (1993)  whichaffirms the fundamental principles on which such asettlement should be based.Jamaica too hails the signing of the peace accordbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on13 September 1993  while fully recognizing that the progressachieved  despite its significance  is but an initial step.Indeed  there are complex matters that will face negotiatorsin the months and years ahead.Nearer to home  in the Caribbean  the Government ofJamaica and its partners in the Caribbean Community(CARICOM) have placed the resolution of the Haitian crisishigh among their priorities. CARICOM has been activelyinvolved at the United Nations in the effort to bring the issueof Haiti before the Security Council  and I express myForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 17Government’s appreciation to the member States of the LatinAmerican and Caribbean Group for their support in thisprocess.We also commend the Special Envoy of theSecretaries-General of the United Nations and theOrganization of American States  Mr. Dante Caputo  for hisuntiring commitment to this issue. However  in the light ofthe grim evidence that dangerous elements are at work inHaiti  clearly determined to deny the Haitian people security democracy and development  the international communitycannot relax its vigilance. President Jean-Bertrand Aristideis scheduled to return to Haiti on 30 October. His returnwill mark the beginning of a long and difficult period ofreconstruction. He will need the full support andcommitment of our Organization  as well as of the entireinternational community. There is urgency in the call foreconomic and technical assistance. Indeed  the Governmentof Jamaica has already offered  within our means  to provideHaiti with some technical assistance.This new era following the cold war presents mankindwith new opportunities for a more rational and equitablemanagement of problems at the global level. I refer  inparticular  to the struggle against poverty and ethnic strife human-rights violations and environmental degradation. Theend of cold-war confrontations - political as well as militaryand ideological - should not be replaced by economicconflict. We must grasp the opportunity for constructiveaction and now work towards an era of cooperation that isnot distorted by ideological and political tensions.The Security Council Summit meeting on31 January 1992 concluded with a statement in which it wassaid that its members recognized""that peace and prosperity are indivisible and thatlasting peace and stability require effective internationalcooperation for the eradication of poverty and thepromotion of a better life for all in larger freedom"".(S/23500  p. 5)We strongly support that view.For many developing countries  including my own market-oriented reforms have been a high priority. We havemade fundamental changes in economic policy  includingmonetary and fiscal austerity  trade liberalization  divestmentof public enterprises to the private sector  liberalization offoreign-exchange markets and general deregulation ofeconomies. In short  we have undertaken a thoroughgoingprocess of structural adjustment  which has created a private-sector-led  market-driven economy.For countries that are undertaking economic structuraladjustment the social consequences are high indeed. Tightmonetary and fiscal management reduces the capacity toprovide basic social services  such as health  education andhousing. Yet  if human needs are not adequately met  ifhuman resources are not developed  we destroy the verybasis of sustained development: our people. Migration -national and international - is one of the clearestmanifestations of social ills. If people do not find economicsecurity in their native land  they go wherever they can findit - from rural to urban area; from one country or onecontinent to another. So today there are some 35 milliondisplaced persons. And such people are to be found in everyregion.The processes of structural adjustment are renderedextremely difficult in the absence of sustained internationalsupport - either directly  through the sustained infusion ofexternal resources by way of development assistance anddebt relief  or indirectly  through reduced protectionism inindustrialized countries. Let me give an example related todebt. Although my Government has managed to reduce thestock of external debt  debt servicing remains the mostdebilitating constraint on the country’s economicdevelopment. The fact that international financialinstitutions  to which much of Jamaica’s debt is owed  refuseto consider the rescheduling of loans continues to be a majorconcern of my Government. The consequence of this policyis that even those resources generated by developingcountries themselves are not available for the pursuit ofnational development objectives  as they are pre-empted bydebt-servicing.I should like to refer to trade liberalization and tradearrangements  especially with regard to countries undergoingstructural adjustment. In my own region  the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM) has put in place mechanisms toenhance regional trade. At the same time  however  theCommunity is faced with the Herculean task of avoiding orminimizing the likely short-term to medium-term adverseimpacts on its members of the North American Free TradeAgreement (NAFTA) when it takes effect. We have had tomake vigorous efforts to ensure that the gains achievedunder existing agreements are not eroded.Similarly  conditionality applied to loans byinternational financial institutions must be designed to bemore appropriate to developing economies. Morespecifically  adjustment must take place over an extended18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionperiod  must minimize social distress and must be growth-oriented.My delegation therefore attaches great importance tothe formulation of an agenda for development. That processshould proceed with the sense of urgency and vision withwhich the undeniably constructive ""Agenda for Peace"" hasbeen promoted. Such an agenda must be forward-lookingand must address fully the wide range of issues pertaining todevelopment  taking into account the specific circumstancesand needs of developing countries and groups of countries.It must first establish  as its basic premise  the need for afavourable international economic environment and a non--discriminatory trading system  the latter being dependent ona speedy  balanced and comprehensive outcome to theUruguay Round of trade negotiations. Without theseconditions  the efforts of developing countries to buildself-sustaining economies - efforts often accompanied bypainful adjustment strategies and difficult economic-liberalization programmes - will be frustrated.The need for a constructive North-South dialogue to bereactivated has therefore become urgent  and has certainlybecome one of the most pressing challenges we face inelaborating our agenda for development. We wereconsequently appreciative of the initiative taken by theChairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to meet with theChairman of the Group of 7 in Tokyo. We regard this as anencouraging beginning.The agenda for development cannot be complete if itdoes not include consideration of the problem of externalindebtedness and formulation of specific solutions for itsresolution. A review of the role and functions of the BrettonWoods institutions is therefore necessary. Similarly  thereality and inevitability of regional economic integrationprocesses must be confronted in the agenda for development as well as the protection of the environment  following theground-breaking achievements of the historic United NationsConference on Environment and Development last year inRio de Janeiro.The goal of sustainable development provides a holisticframework for the United Nations and its Member States toshape a world in which care and respect for human beingsis equalled only by care and respect for the planet which weinhabit. At the Earth Summit in Rio  we undertook toimplement measures that would safeguard our naturalhabitat. Some of the decisions taken in Rio have alreadybegun to take effect. These include the establishment of theCommission on Sustainable Development and thepreparations for the convening of the first Global Conferenceon Sustainable Development of Small Island States. Mydelegation wishes to stress the importance of thisConference  which is to be held in Barbados next year. Wetake this opportunity to call upon the Members of theAssembly to give full support to the adoption by theConference of a plan of action for the sustainabledevelopment of small island developing States. This will bethe first test of our readiness and commitment to implementthe decisions taken at the Earth Summit.Equally  Jamaica fully supports the World Conferenceon Population and Development  to be held in Cairo in 1994;the World Summit for Social Development  to be held inCopenhagen in 1995; and the Fourth World Conference onWomen  to be held in Beijing in 1995.It gives me great pleasure to allude to the 1982 law ofthe sea Convention  which was signed in Montego Bay Jamaica  11 years ago and has now been ratified by 58countries. I expect that before the end of this forty-eighthsession of the General Assembly the sixtieth ratification willbe deposited with the Secretary-General  thus setting thestage for the Convention’s entry into force. There can be noquestion that support for the Convention continues to beoverwhelming. Our ultimate goal must be to achieveuniversal participation in a Convention which is designed formankind as a whole. It is therefore appropriate that all theConvention as soon as possible. As the pace of ratificationintensifies  it could serve as a catalyst for deepening theprocess of universalizing the Convention by addressingcreatively the manner in which the provisions of theConvention are to be implemented on an ongoing contemporary basis.We must pay a tribute  as well  to the Secretary-Generaland his predecessor for the initiative they took to promote adialogue aimed at addressing issues of concern to someStates in order to achieve universal participation in theConvention. The integrity of the Convention as a wholemust be maintained  and our search for universality mustrecognize the overwhelming support for the Convention bythe international community as a whole and the need topreserve its fundamental aspects. Let us therefore in ournoble quest for universality concentrate on the manner of theimplementation of the Convention in those areas of concernto some States.If the United Nations is to play an active and dynamicrole in promoting a new global partnership  it must examineits capacity and capability. For that reason  my delegationagrees that the reform processes now under way should aimat maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of theForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 19Organization. Further  my delegation intends to participatefully in the work of the open-ended ad hoc working groupwhich will continue to consider the process of revitalizingthe General Assembly. Other discussions related to therestructuring of the United Nations system must betransparent and informed by the principles of democracy andthe rules of international law and by those principlesenshrined in the Charter.My Government wishes to address the issue of theSecurity Council in the context of the increased membershipof the United Nations  which rose to 184 this year. Thesurging tide of change over the past five years has seen theresponsibilities of the Security Council increase  with theestablishment of 17 peace-keeping operations and theCouncil’s further involvement in conflict resolution throughthe good offices of the Secretary-General and the dispatch offact-finding missions. The time has therefore obviouslycome for a review of the Security Council’s composition toensure that it is truly representative of the increasedmembership of the United Nations and reflects thedemocratic principle on which the United Nations is founded -that is  the sovereign equality of all States.The reform process in which we are now engagedwithin the United Nations must clearly include the SecurityCouncil  the body charged with the responsibility for themaintenance of international peace and security. A SecurityCouncil which is truly representative and functionseffectively has to be a priority for all of us  because peaceand security  in the military and political sense  areinterwoven with our economic and social security. We inthe Caribbean cannot  and have no desire to  remain alooffrom this debate. We must ensure that a strengthenedUnited Nations is placed in a position to play a dominantrole in the elaboration of processes of peace anddevelopment and in their implementation based on genuineinterdependence  global partnership and shared responsibility.We are gathered here because we all have pressingnational concerns and we believe there remains an enduringfaith in multilateralism  which carries the potential forstronger  more broadly based development over the longerterm  if only all players agree to reaffirm their commitmentand play fully their roles within the global framework ofcooperation.There is no doubt that this will be difficult  but sharedobjectives  shared commitment and shared responsibilitieswill ensure a better world for all mankind. As wecontemplate the challenges posed by the present global economic and political environment  we must commitourselves to a new dialogue within the United Nationssystem to forge a global partnership for peace  democracyand economic progress."
"83",3575,"JOR",48,1993," I should like at theoutset to extend to you  Mr. President  my sincerecongratulations on your well-deserved election. I should liketo wish you and the other members of the GeneralCommittee success in the discharge of your important duties.I had a chance to congratulate the President of the Assemblyat its last session when I saw him in Amman  and I shouldnow like to reiterate my gratitude for his competentpresidency.The cold war may be over  but its death-knellreverberates around the globe. The comforting ideologicalcertainties of super-Power confrontation are long gone.What have we to replace them? The new world order  withits promise of peace through collective security  has comeupon a baptism of fire. And still it would appear that nocommon frame of reference  no new consensus  no globalethic  has emerged.As we enter the new millennium  we see the humanspirit under siege as never before. Across the world  thevoices of millions cry out in desperation for relief  forguidance. If we  the peoples of the United Nations  are tobe true to our humanity  we must reappraise this situationthat is of our own making. We must learn its lessons  nomatter how hard  and we must apply them. It is our tasktoday  and in the days to come  to fashion principles andpractices for a truly new world order. In all fields of humanendeavour  we need a new ethic for a new era.The balance of world power politics has given way.Ethnic nationalism has re-emerged  a phenomenon in whichthe unifying bond of common citizenship is replaced byracial or religious exclusivity. As a consequence  we face aseries of apparently endless wars of attrition  fought tosecure the domination of one ethnic nationalism overanother. This trend must be reversed if our world is to bemade safe from the spreading contagion of conflict.Many over the years have thought it impossible  but theMiddle East is bucking this alarming trend. The signing on13 September of the Palestinian-Israeli declaration ofprinciples represents a significant step towards theachievement of a negotiated settlement in our troubledregion.On the Jordanian-Israeli track  a common agenda which has been carefully worked out over the last year anda half  has now been adopted. We trust that this will signifythe commencement of serious and substantive negotiationson the various elements of that agenda  with the aim ofachieving just and mutually satisfactory solutions.These developments are a triumph not only for thepolitics of consensus  but also for the international moralitywhich the United Nations advocates and the legality itupholds. Over the years the Assembly has passed resolutionafter resolution calling for a just  comprehensive and lastingsettlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinequestion that lies at its core. Finally  the main actors areplaying the leading part in shaping their own destinies.My country has always sought to bring this prolongedand bitter conflict to an end  and in our search for solutionswe have constantly aimed to reconcile peace and justice.Jordan has advocated a negotiated settlement based onSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)longer than any other party. Under the new arrangements all parties to the conflict are committed to theimplementation of those resolutions  affirming a cardinalprinciple of international law: the inadmissibility of theacquisition of territory by force.There is an equally important principle to bear in mind however. Peace cannot be piecemeal. It must becomprehensive if it is to be viable. As foreseen in theMadrid framework for the peace talks  some issues cannotbe addressed by any two parties to the exclusion of others.The questions of regional security  water and above all therefugees cannot be resolved without direct reference to theneighbouring States. The status of Jerusalem has to bedetermined in a similar way. The legitimate rights which thethree great monotheistic faiths share in the Holy City mustbe guaranteed and claims of political and administrativesovereignty accommodated to the satisfaction of all.In view of Jordan’s long association with thePalestinian question  the Palestine Liberation Organization(PLO)-Israeli agreement will have major implications for ourlegitimate interests. At a time when new entities are beingformed  an orderly transfer of power and authority is vital.Only this can safeguard the rights of existing States andthose of individuals. There are questions to address aboutState property  archives  debts  treaties  nationality  salaries pensions - the list is long  but not exhaustive. Jordan willseek modalities for their resolution with the relevant partiesthrough our agenda.The refugee question is of paramount importance. Itshould not  and must not  be forgotten that the individualsaffected have under international law a right of return andcompensation  and their host countries are likewise entitledto compensation. Jordan has shouldered an enormous humanload as a result of the conflict. Three waves of involuntarymigrants - the refugees of 1948  the evacuees of 1967 andthe returnees of 1991 - have sought shelter and succor inJordan. Our treatment of these and other displaced personshas been exemplary. We have provided them with educationand health services  with jobs and welfare. Citizens ofJordan  whether of Palestinian or Jordanian origin  enjoycivil and human rights equally and participate as equals inour democratization process. Jordan seeks an equitable sustainable international approach to the treatment of ourdemographic burden  for it would be unconscionable topenalize host countries for their humanitarian policies.Another crucial issue is water. Our agenda strikes adelicate balance between the need for optimal utilization ofscarce resources  on the one hand  and the equallyimperative need to define the rights and duties of riparianStates  on the other. We also look forward to definitivedelineation of our borders with Israel  thereby givingconcrete expression to the right of every nation to live insecure and internationally recognized boundaries.When the euphoria has subsided  these serious andcomplex questions will remain. The PLO-Israel accord historic as it is  represents a first step towards Palestinianfinal status  which in turn will allow the Palestinians to takepart in comprehensive regional security and cooperationarrangements. For the Middle East cannot be reduced to asingle issue. It more closely resembles a tapestry woven ofnumerous intertwining threads.One of these wider regional issues - the suffering of theIraqi people - demands urgently to be addressed. Asuccession of independent reports has brought to light thespecial impact of continued sanctions upon the mostvulnerable segments of Iraqi society - in particular  thechildren. The sanctions regime that daily takes its toll onthe people of Iraq also has adverse consequences forneighbouring States  including Jordan and Turkey. Issuessuch as this must be resolved if the Middle East is to seizeits chance for lasting peace. A cooperative security systemwill help to protect the security of the States and peoples ofthe region. We can only avert the kind of destabilizingconflict that followed the end of the cold war in Eurasia byForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 3making arrangements to ensure our common future underpinned by the full support of the internationalcommunity.Despite these outstanding questions  I have no doubtthat the extraordinary achievements of the autumn of 1993will be seen in years to come as the start of a fresh coursein the settlement of regional conflicts. The politics ofdialogue and reconciliation have been our regional anddomestic priorities  for they are essential to the democraticprocess. We seek to extend the principles of consensus andcollective security to the Middle East to create a newregional order  an order which recognizes the right of eachindividual to lead a life free from fear  want and despair  anorder which will provide justice to all peoples and securityto all States  an order in which the United Nations and itsagencies can play a positive role not only in humanitarianintervention or the protection of human rights  but in activepeace-keeping and peacemaking.Jordan applauds Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali forhis valiant efforts to overhaul the United Nations structureand personnel  injecting a fresh sense of purposecommensurate with the new challenges. It is in the interestsof all Members of this body to see international lawrespected and upheld. We must all assist the Secretary-General in determining the criteria for United Nationsintervention  whether in Lebanon  Iraq  Somalia  Bosnia Angola  Cambodia or anywhere else. The terms of referenceembodied in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter mustbe clearly defined  with checks and balances approved toavoid the erosion of the independence and territorialsovereignty of Member States. There is also an urgent needfor well-trained international peace-keeping forces  whichcould be established under a reconstituted Military StaffCommittee. The modus operandi for all United Nationsaction  irrespective of the issue at hand  must be thesupremacy of the rule of law and the uniformity of itsapplication. Double standards should not and must not bepermitted  lest abuse of the law become the accepted norm.A wider issue concerning this Organization is that ofSecurity Council reform. Jordan adds its voice to the hostof countries that have called for a reassessment of thestructure of the Security Council. Clearly  conditions in theworld have changed dramatically since the formation of theCouncil  and we believe that these should be reflected in itscomposition. Jordan also lends its support to the Secretary-General’s proposals for post-conflict peace-building outlinedin his ""An Agenda for Peace"".For in every part of the world peace will remainillusory unless it touches the daily lives of ordinary people.Peace will not take root except in an environment conduciveto regional cooperation and mutual security and committedto the welfare of individual human beings. The developmentof economic infrastructure and provisions for investment inpublic services are as crucial as the questions of territorialsovereignty  national identity and security. It is for thisreason that Jordan welcomes the recently convenedconference to support Middle East peace as both timely andpragmatic. The peace dividend in my region  as elsewhere must put an end to the politics of deprivation  fear anddespair  the breeding ground for political extremism andrejection.The disparities and distortions created by half a centuryof conflict in the Middle East have given rise to suchphenomena. That is undeniable. However  there isconsiderable alarm in the Muslim world at suggestions thatIslam may replace communism as a global threat. Thesesuggestions are informed by a skewed perception of Islam asa monolithic creed of violence  intolerance and oppression.Islam is not the new enemy. Extremism does existwithin the Muslim world  much as it exists in the Christianworld  the Jewish world  the Hindu world and the secularworld. But to employ reductive stereotypes which demonizeone fifth of the world’s population must ultimately be self-defeating. It can only result in the breed of senselessviolence that has brought untold suffering and loss of life toBosnia. Rather than seeking an enemy at the gates  let useach in our own communities look inwards and address thedisparities and the despair that are the true causes ofextremism and conflict. Let us join together to do battlewith the real enemy.That enemy is a new world of ""each for himself"". Thatis what we must combat  with all the resources at ourdisposal. For the politics and economics of exclusivity arethe bane of both pragmatism and idealism.Is the triple pillar of democracy  human rights and thefree market the ceiling of our ambition? Democracy andfree market economics are exceptionally successful systemswith noble objectives. But they are not ends in themselves.The end for which we all strive is greater peace and greaterjustice for individual human beings across the world. Howis this to be achieved?One of our strongest defences against a new world of""each for himself"" would be a new global business ethic applying not only among the developed nations  but also4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionbetween those nations and the developing countries. Suchan ethic might prescribe a relationship of partnership whichwould in turn encourage greater self-reliance. Such an ethicwould be wholly reconcilable with human rights  withpluralism  with care for the environment and with basicreligious values. I would like to suggest that the key to anew ethic in all of these areas is our mutual interdependence.Whatever the context  injustice is perceived and conflictresults when the gap between ""self"" and ""other"" seems largerthan the common ground. This fundamental split between""me"" and ""you""  between ""us"" and ""them""  is at the root ofall oppositions  all polarities  all conflicts. Recognition ofour mutual interdependence requires us to acknowledge theuniqueness of each individual and each culture - even intothe broader environment - and to learn to live with thedifferences as with the commonalities. It requires that westrive for unity  but never seek to eradicate or compromisediversity. It requires a new thinking based on tolerance andcompassion - a humane approach and respect for the voicesof others. It requires  in short  that we be true to the idealsthat fired the founders of this Organization when they wrotethe words: ""We the peoples of the United Nations"".Herein lies the nexus between peacemaking  humanrights  pluralism  cultural heritage and business ethics. Herelies the key to a new world of ""all for each other""  not ""eachfor himself"".The Middle East is showing the way. Its conflict  onceheld to be the most intractable on Earth  is now on the pathto reconciliation and healing. As we enter a newmillennium  a new era  let the world take heart from ourexample. Let us emerge together from the past and togetherlet us build our brave new world."
"84",3622,"JPN",48,1993,"I should like first of all to extendmy heartfelt congratulations to you  Mr. President  who alsoserve as Guyana’s Ambassador to Japan  on your electionlast week to the presidency of this session of the GeneralAssembly. Let me also express my deep appreciation to theprevious President  Mr. Ganev  for his achievements duringthe past year  particularly in pursuing General Assemblyreforms.I want to take this opportunity to commendSecretary-General Boutros-Ghali for his selfless devotion tothe cause of global peace and for his bold efforts towardsUnited Nations reform.Finally  I warmly welcome the representatives of the sixnew Member States that have joined the United Nations overthe past year.In Japan  the reins of government recently changedhands for the first time in 38 years. The coalitiongovernment that emerged has appointed me Prime Minister.Political changes in Japan are part of the dramatic changesin the international community since the end of theEast-West confrontation. The post-cold-war era has opened not just a new page  but a whole new chapter in Japanesepolitics. This means an era of basic reform in three mainareas  namely  political  economic and administrativereforms. I believe these reforms are vital in strengtheningJapan’s bonds with the international community.As I devote my attention and energy to these domesticreforms I have come to the United Nations GeneralAssembly on my first official visit abroad. I have done sobecause Japan believes that the United Nations has a crucialrole to play in the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. I also wished personally to convey Japan’sdetermination to contribute  both financially and in terms ofpersonnel  to various United Nations efforts.Further  I wish to state again that Japan continues tofeel a sense of remorse over its past actions and that it isfirmly resolved to make further contributions to the goals ofworld peace and prosperity.As for the current situation in Russia  Japan continuesto support President Yeltsin in his reform efforts. Japanstrongly hopes that a political environment which reflects thewill of the Russian people will soon be created and that thereforms will be further promoted.Today  the primary objective of the United Nations andits Member States is to establish world peace on the basis ofthe universal principles of freedom  democracy and respectfor human rights.There are four areas in which the internationalcommunity must direct its greatest efforts in pursuit of thisobjective.I shall begin with the issue of disarmament. The Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is thecentre-piece of efforts to prevent the spread of nuclearweapons. I wish to affirm that Japan supports the indefiniteextension of that Treaty beyond 1995. It is criticallyimportant that countries which have not yet acceded to theTreaty do so to enhance its universality. At the same time the indefinite extension of the NPT should not mean theperpetuation of the possession of nuclear weapons by thenuclear-weapon States.Japan thus welcomes the progress made towards nucleardisarmament by the United States and Russia andemphasizes that all nuclear-weapon States must work inearnest to achieve further progress in nuclear disarmament.We hail the decision to commence substantive negotiationsaimed at a comprehensive nuclear test-ban. For its part Japan will work actively to help reduce world stockpiles ofnuclear weapons. For example  we are ready to assist in thedismantling of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union.We also strongly urge North Korea to dispel internationalconcern about its development of nuclear weapons by  forexample  fully implementing the safeguards agreement withthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).On the transfer of conventional arms  the effectiveimplementation of the United Nations Register ofConventional Arms is essential. I strongly urge all nationsto participate in this endeavour. In extending its officialdevelopment assistance  Japan continues to pay full attentionto such trends as military expenditures in recipient nations.The second point I wish to make is the importance ofdiplomatic efforts in the prevention of conflicts. The valueof regional security arrangements and bilateral or multilateralpolitical and security dialogue is undeniable in preventing orsettling armed conflicts.In this connection  I was deeply moved by and heartilywelcome the historic signing of the declaration of principlesfor Palestinian interim self-government by the Israelis andthe Palestinians. I pay a sincere tribute to their politicalleaders for taking this courageous step. It is essential thatthe international community support this agreement activelyand promptly in order to realize peace in the region. Japanwill continue to play a constructive role in the multilateralnegotiations that are part of the peace process. I am pleasedon this occasion to announce Japan’s intention to extendabout $200 million in assistance to the Palestinians over thecoming two years. This assistance will include grant aid forfood and medicine and concessional loans for infrastructure.Humanitarian considerations  particularly respect forhuman rights  are inseparable from the issue of peace.Where there is war  human rights are often neglected.Conversely  in countries where respect for human rights hasbeen firmly established  hostilities are less likely to breakout. Japan must actively contribute to the solution ofhumanitarian problems. I would like to see my fellowcountrymen and women roll up their sleeves and work sideby side with people from many other countries  wheneverand wherever humanitarian activities are called for.The third area of focus is economic development as afoundation for peace-building. Today  the market economyhas become a common language in most nations of theworld  including many of the former socialist States. Thedevelopment of the global economy based on principles ofmarket economy should be urgently promoted. Japan andother industrialized nations must provide support todeveloping countries in their development efforts  as well asto former socialist countries in their political and economicreform efforts. It goes without saying that assistance tocountries in transition must not come at the expense of aidto developing countries.Already the world’s top donor of official developmentassistance in absolute terms  Japan recently established itsFifth Medium-Term Target to further expand suchassistance. Japan intends to provide official developmentassistance totalling between $70 billion and $75 billion overthe five-year period beginning in 1993. As part of its aidefforts  two weeks ago Japan hosted  in Tokyo  the ThirdMongolia Assistance Group Meeting. Next week  incooperation with the United Nations  we will hold theInternational Conference on African Development in Tokyo.The fourth item I would like to address concerns globalissues such as the environment and population. The urgentneed to solve the problems of the global environment cannotbe overemphasized. Japan is willing to assume a leadingrole in international efforts to tackle environmental problems.In so doing  we will draw upon the experience andknow-how we have gained in overcoming serious pollutionproblems at home. Not only is Japan developing newtechnologies for environmental protection  it is taking thelead in transferring such technologies to developing countriesthrough the International Environmental Technology Centreof the United Nations Environment Programme  which wasset up in Japan last year. At the 1992 United NationsConference on Environment and Development  Japanpledged approximately $7 billion to $7.7 billion inenvironment-related official development assistance over thefive years beginning 1992. In fact  Japan has alreadyimplemented more than one fourth of that amount.Population problems often lead to poverty and famine.Solving these problems is therefore crucial to the goal ofsustainable development and will require a broad-basedapproach including education and public information efforts.With these thoughts in mind  Japan will sponsor a meetingof eminent persons on population and development nextJanuary  prior to the International Conference on Populationand Development to be held in Cairo next year.The year 1995 will mark the fiftieth anniversary of thefounding of the United Nations. Since the birth of thisOrganization immediately following the Second World War the international climate has changed dramatically. In themeantime  United Nations membership has grown from 51States in 1945 to the present 184. Today  the internationalcommunity is placing ever- higher expectations on theUnited Nations. But serious reform efforts are necessary ifthe United Nations is to respond to these expectations andmeet the new demands awaiting us at the threshold of thenext century.I would like to comment on three specific areas inwhich reforms are necessary - namely  peace-keeping  thestructure of the Security Council  and United Nationsadministration and finance.Last year  Japan enacted the International PeaceCooperation Law enabling it to contribute personnel toUnited Nations peace-keeping operations. Since then  it hasdispatched Japanese personnel to Angola  Cambodia andMozambique. Japan intends to continue to promote suchcooperation in the future.Among recent United Nations peace-keeping operations the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia(UNTAC) stands out as a major achievement. I would liketo take this opportunity to express my deep respect for theefforts of UNTAC personnel and all the countries concerned.The success of the operation in Cambodia owes much to thecomprehensive framework for peace that was put in placeand the support it received from the internationalcommunity. I am convinced that its experience in Cambodiawill provide the United Nations with useful insights for itsfuture activities.Ensuring the security of the personnel engaged inUnited Nations peace-keeping operations is a task of highpriority to the international community  and I hope this issuewill be the subject of thorough debate at the current sessionof the General Assembly. Other issues demanding ourattention are the need to determine a so-called ""sunset"" foreach peace-keeping operation to evaluate each operationproperly and to review strictly the activities of an existingoperation in deciding whether to extend its mandate. Japanalso strongly hopes that the Peace-keeping Reserve Fund which was established last year  will be fully funded andused effectively.The sharp increase in the number of regional conflictshas meant a dramatic expansion of the role of the SecurityCouncil. Accordingly  it is necessary that the functions ofthe Council  which has the primary responsibility formaintaining international peace and security  be strengthened.It is important that those countries having both the will andthe adequate capacity to contribute to world prosperity andstability be actively engaged in that effort. The viewsexpressed by many Member States  including our own  inresponse to a General Assembly resolution on this subjectlast year  generally indicate the need to expand themembership of the Security Council  while ensuring that itseffectiveness is maintained. Japan intends to participateconstructively in the discussion on Security Council reform.Today the United Nations finds itself in extremelyserious financial straits. In particular  the rapid expansion ofpeace-keeping operations has made it increasingly difficultfor this Organization to meet its financial needs promptly.Without adequate financial resources  the United NationsForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 19would be powerless to engage in any activity  no matter howmeaningful it may be. I would like to remind all UnitedNations Member States how important it is that they facethis reality and fulfil their obligations.At the same time  I note with concern the frequentallegations of inefficiency or wastefulness at the UnitedNations. I hope the United Nations will make the utmostefforts to meet the need for greater financial discipline andeffective budgetary control.Japan is prepared to do all it can to discharge itsresponsibilities in a United Nations reformed with theprevious three points taken into account.When the forerunner of the United Nations  the Leagueof Nations  was established in 1920  the renowned Japaneseeducator Mr. Inazo Nitobe was appointed as one of itsDeputy Secretaries-General. Mr. Nitobe  who had sought tointroduce Japan’s philosophical traditions to the world remarked that the Japanese place great value on moralprinciples. I would like to conclude my address by offeringa quote from one of Mr. Nitobe’s lectures which reflects myown view on the evolving bonds between Japan and theinternational community:""An international mind is not the antonym of anational mind ... The international mind is anexpansion of the national mind  just asphilanthropy or charity ... should begin at home."""
"85",3647,"KAZ",48,1993,"Allow me first of all  Sir  to associate myself withthe congratulations already extended to you on your electionto the high office of President of the General Assembly at itsforty-eighth session and to wish you every success in yourendeavours.On behalf of the Government of the Republic ofKazakhstan  I should like to convey deep sympathy to theGovernment and the people of the friendly country of Indiafor the heavy death toll and considerable material losscaused by the devastating earthquake on 30 September.The international realities that form the background ofthe current session are a direct reflection of the developmentof extremely contradictory tendencies within the worldcommunity. On the one hand  during the year gone by sincethe beginning of the forty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly we have witnessed a dynamic development ofinternational relations along with increased United Nationsactivity in the resolution of global economic  social andenvironmental issues and in the promotion of peace andsecurity. The achievement of agreement on the Middle Eastproblem should undoubtedly be counted as a breakthroughin multilateral diplomacy  but  on the other hand  we muststate with regret that no agreement has been reached so faron the cessation of hostilities in the former Yugoslavia  thatthe tension in Somalia has increased and that hotbeds ofconflicts still smoulder in a number of republics of theformer Soviet Union.We have made a careful study of the Secretary-General’s report (A/48/1) on the work of the Organizationand share its principal conclusion that in order to produceenduring results there must at all costs be a new level ofpolitical will and realism.The President of the United States  Mr. Clinton  pointedout in his statement on 27 September that the United Nationssimply cannot be engaged in each and every one of theconflicts in the world. This goes without saying. But it isequally self-evident that the United Nations is today  and16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionwill remain in the foreseeable future  a body to whichhumanity - the world’s nations and individuals - will linktheir aspirations for peace  development and human rights.In these circumstances  in our opinion  a package ofconcrete measures aimed at enhancing the effectiveness ofthe United Nations is called for. We believe that  along witha further definition of the functions of the United Nationsmain organs  the elimination of duplication in their activitiesand the adequate financing of United Nations peace-keepingoperations  it is high time to consider the question ofexpanding the permanent membership of the SecurityCouncil. We are confident that this measure will enable theUnited Nations to respond more rapidly and objectively tothe new  dangerous challenges of the times and eruptions ofviolence  regardless of where this might happen.The harsh realities of the post-confrontation era havehighlighted the urgency of redirecting the efforts of theworld community towards eliminating the potential fordisputes within a State or between States to escalate intomilitary conflicts. Should we fail to resolve disputes at anearly stage  we will simply reap fruits similar to those reapedin the former Yugoslavia  Nagorny-Karabakh and Tajikistan.This reaffirms once again the appropriateness of the idea ofpreventive diplomacy formulated by Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali in his report ""An Agenda for Peace"". Onlyby taking a series of preventive measures based on globaland regional cooperation between nations can peace beensured and maintained.This is at the heart of the idea of creating a system ofcollective security in Asia within the framework of theConference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measuresin Asia (CICMA). As is known  this initiative wasformulated comprehensively by Mr. Nazarbaev  President ofthe Republic of Kazakhstan  precisely one year ago  at theforty-seventh session of the General Assembly. To promotethe realization of the initiative  Kazakhstan hosted tworounds of expert-level meetings within the framework ofpreparations for CICMA  which took place this year inAlmaty and yielded promising results. At present  25 AsianStates are involved in the CICMA process. I take thisopportunity to invite other States interested in strengtheningconfidence-building measures in Asia to join our efforts. Ibelieve that today we should actively broaden our efforts todefine the problems related to this initiative. I have in mindparticularly the preparations for the conference of ForeignMinisters of Asian States which  in the view of experts could be convened in 1994.We note with satisfaction that the idea of regionalcooperation in Asia has been endorsed by theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and has founda broad response within the United Nations  the Conferenceon Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  theOrganization of the Islamic Conference and the League ofArab States. This positive reaction to our initiative fills uswith confidence in its viability and its significance for thecause of peace in Asia.Indeed  the States of the Asian region have an equallystrong interest in the prevention and peaceful settlement ofconflicts as well as in the prevention of the emergence ofnew hotbeds of regional and global tension. As an exampleI would mention the formation of the Defence CoalitionForces of the members of the Commonwealth ofIndependent States (CIS)  which acted as a restraining factorin the Tajik conflict. Joint military units of Russia Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan managed to reduceconsiderably the scale of military confrontation  saved thelives of thousands of civilians and provided relief forhundreds of thousands of refugees. In this context  theRepublic of Kazakhstan  along with the otherCommonwealth States  is asking for support for our jointappeal to recognize the Defence Coalition Forces of the CISas the United Nations peacemaking force in that region.Another important aspect of close cooperation betweenAsian States is the coordination of their efforts onenvironmental issues. The severe environmental problemsof Kazakhstan are well known. The first among them is theproblem of the Aral Sea. The critical situation in the Aralregion has frequently been discussed at various internationalconferences and meetings of Heads of States. As a result we now have a sizeable package of documents definingshort-term and strategic solutions to the problem. We pointin particular to the signing of the Agreement on JointActivities in Preserving the Aral Sea and the EnvironmentalRehabilitation of the Region and the Statute of theInternational Fund for Preserving the Aral Sea. However we are convinced that this environmental tragedy has effectsfar beyond the confines of the region. Today  only thecollective efforts of the world community can bring about asolution to this problem. We therefore support the proposalput forward by the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Mr. Karimov  to set up a special United Nations forum perhaps a United Nations commission on the Aral Sea.Another priority in the foreign policy of our Republicis the strengthening of intergovernmental relations within theCIS. We are confident that at present no member State ofthe Commonwealth is able effectively to pursue its internalForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 17and foreign policy in isolation from the policies of the othermembers of the CIS. In this context  the President of theRepublic of Kazakhstan  Mr. Nazarbaev  has repeatedlyproposed concrete measures to consolidate the commoneconomic space and ensure social and political stability ona collective basis.At the recent meeting of the Heads of State of the CISin Moscow  an economic union of the Commonwealth wasset up for the purpose of coordinating the policies ofmember States in various fields. This serves the interests ofall members of the CIS.Kazakhstan will remain active in promoting theintegration of the members of the CIS. We strongly believethat all emerging political problems and conflict situationsshould be resolved in constructive and civilized ways. Thisidea is the essence of two recent statements by PresidentNazarbaev on the current critical situation in the RussianFederation.Our State has a diversified foreign policy  and theexpansion of cooperation in all fields with all countries is ofutmost strategic importance to us. After signing the LisbonProtocol of 23 May 1992  the Republic of Kazakhstan  alongwith other States successors to the USSR  was recognized asa party to the START I Treaty and undertook to accede tothe non-proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear State. Atpresent  negotiations are under way with a number of Stateson cooperation in assisting Kazakhstan to meet itscommitments to eliminate strategic offensive weapons.In this context  I share the opinion of my Ukrainiancolleague  Mr. Zlenko  about the extreme complexity of thisproblem. In our opinion  Kazakhstan would needconsiderable funds for this purpose: approximately $2billion - not an easy sum to find in our national budget.These funds are needed not only to cover the dismantling ofnuclear weapons  but also to eliminate the consequences ofnuclear tests at the Semipalatinsk Testing Ground and tosolve the Aral sea crisis as well.Referring to the problem of the elimination of theconsequences of nuclear tests at the now-closedSemipalatinsk Testing Ground  I should like to draw theAssembly’s attention to the enormous damage to the healthof the people of a vast region wrought by 466 nuclear testsin all environments. In varying degrees  almost half amillion Kazakh citizens have suffered the deadly effects ofnuclear tests. It is quite understandable  therefore  thatKazakhstan wholeheartedly supports a comprehensive andcomplete ban on nuclear tests.One of the active areas of Kazakhstan’s foreign policyis cooperation with the CSCE and the North AtlanticCooperation Council. The possibilities of Kazakhstan’smore regular and active participation in CSCE activitieswere discussed in particular with the CSCE Chairman Margaretha af Ugglas  Minister for Foreign Affairs ofSweden  during a visit of the CSCE delegation to Almatylast June.Broadly speaking  our foreign policy can now bedescribed as dynamic and active. Kazakhstan’s membershipof the United Nations has allowed it to become activelyinvolved in international life  a fact reflected in ourmembership now of 20 international organizations  includingthe United Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO)  the Economic and SocialCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)  the WorldIntellectual Property Organization (WIPO)  the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF)  and others. The Republic’smembership in the United Nations Industrial DevelopmentOrganization (UNIDO)  the Economic Commission forEurope (ECE) and other international organizations is underconsideration.Kazakhstan’s internal reforms are being carried out inaccordance with the international treaties to which it hasacceded. In spite of major economic problems  which arecommon in varying degrees to the States of the formerUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics  a strong legal basis foreconomic reforms has been laid down in our Republic.The laws passed by the Kazakhstan Parliament aredesigned to develop medium- and small-scale business attract and protect foreign investments and liberalize foreigntrade. Providing a legal basis for foreign economic activityenvisages a gradual decrease of export and import duties andthe removal of free trade barriers which had to be imposedduring the transition period because of the particular featuresof that time. Of course  such transformations will take morethan one or two years  but Kazakhstan intends to carry themout as soon as possible.Kazakhstan has now begun to attract internationalbusiness. Following deals with Chevron and other majorforeign companies  which have demonstrated to the worldbusiness community that Kazakhstan is anxious to attractforeign investment on a mutually beneficial basis and ensurea favourable environment for it  the flow of foreigninvestment into the Republic’s economy has been growingsteadily  and this is raising our hopes for the ultimatesuccess of our reforms.18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionWe understand clearly that now  at a time when ourRepublic is reaching out to the world community and isdeclaring its willingness to join it as an equal and respectedmember  it is of particular importance for us to affirm ourcompliance with internationally recognized standards ofhuman rights. The Constitution of the Republic ofKazakhstan adopted in January 1993 recognizes  inaccordance with international standards  the primacy ofrights and freedoms of the individual and places the primacyof the interests of the individual above the interests of theState and society  proclaims the ideas of civil peace andethnic accord  and the equality of all nations and ethnicgroups living in the Republic. I wish to draw attention tothe fact that Kazakhstan is the only one of the newly formedStates of the former USSR where national radio and TVprogrammes are broadcast in six different languages newspapers and magazines are published in seven languagesand instruction in schools is given in 18 languages.Kazakhstan’s commitment to equal rights for all ethnicgroups in economic and social development was clearlystated at the World Conference on Human Rights held inVienna last June. The documents adopted at that Conferencewill undoubtedly serve as an important guarantee of theobservance of human rights both at the international and atthe national levels.However  the practical realization of human rights andfreedoms is a long and gradual process which depends onmany factors such as the level of economic and politicaldevelopment of the society  the ideological priorities  thenational mentality  and so on. It is therefore unjustifiable forsome people to assume the responsibility for setting humanrights standards and to use their own interpretation of theconcept as an instrument of pressure on certain countries inquestions related to bilateral or multilateral relations.In this context  Kazakhstan  while supporting efforts toaffirm the universal nature of human rights  believes that itis necessary to take into account the specific nationalconditions of each member of the world community. Theproblem of human rights is not only pressing but alsodelicate  and hence it requires an extremely careful andbalanced approach. It is this understanding which drives theinternal ethnic policy of our country  a State the verystability of which depends upon the peaceful and mutuallyrespectful coexistence of ethnic groups.The forty-eighth session of the General Assembly is thesecond one in which Kazakhstan has participated as a fullMember of the United Nations. Despite such recentmembership in the Organization  Kazakhstan has activelyparticipated in the promotion of international relations contributed to the strengthening of processes of integration and has offered its own ideas on how to improve the UnitedNations.We reaffirm our readiness to make an activecontribution to the work of the Organization and to supportall endeavours aimed at enhancing international cooperationand achieving peace and international accord.At the same time I should like particularly to point outthat the United Nations today is an international forum of184 Member States  including those which  like Kazakhstan only recently gained their independence. Considerableexpansion of the membership over the past few years has  inour view  broadened the range and diversity of opinionwithin the Organization as well as pluralism in approachesto the analysis of international political events. To achieveconsensus today we need a collective search for newprinciples of coexistence of States in the United Nations  aswell as the improvementForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 19and adaptation of the Organization to the rapidly changingrealities of modern life.It is for this reason that we call upon all StatesMembers of the United Nations to consider our proposal toconvene a special session of the General Assembly devotedto the problems of strengthening international peace andsecurity  expanding the scope and potential of preventivediplomacy  promoting human rights  and enhancing the roleof the United Nations in an interdependent and integratedworld.We believe that on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary ofthe United Nations it would be extremely useful to discussnew goals and the challenges facing the Organization."
"86",3694,"KEN",48,1993,"May I  at the outset  takethis opportunity to extend our most sincere condolences anddeepest sympathy to the delegation  Government and peopleof India following the earthquake disaster  which has leftthousands of people dead and many villages destroyed. Weshare the grief of the people of India at this sorrowful andtragic time.I should like to join those representatives who havealready congratulated Mr. Insanally of Guyana on hisunanimous election as President of the General Assembly ofthe United Nations at its forty-eighth session. His electionto this high office is a demonstration of the confidence thatthe Member States have in him and of their respect for hiscountry  Guyana. We are confident that  under his wiseguidance  our deliberations in this session will achieve thedesired results.I also wish to pay tribute to Mr. Insanally’spredecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria  for steering theforty-seventh session to a successful conclusion.We commend the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  too for the skilful and competentmanner in which he is directing the Organization.Allow me to take this opportunity to congratulate theMembers that were admitted to the Organization during thepast year. Their admission strengthens the ideal of theuniversality of the United Nations. We assure them of ourwillingness to work closely with them in our common effortsto create a better world.The end of the cold war created an unprecedentedopportunity to increase international cooperation with a viewto achieving international peace and security and promotingthe socio-economic progress envisaged in the United NationsCharter. However  the new challenges emerging on theglobal scene demand that the international communitysummon up the will and imagination to overcome them.The disappearance of the great ideological rivalrybetween East and West has resulted in a sense of sobernessand improvement in relations between States. It has also ledto a reduction in tensions and to significant progress in thearea of disarmament  thereby creating opportunities for theconversion of massive resources to peaceful uses.Peace and security  however  is not merely the absenceof war or the threat of war; it is the absence of conditionsthat threaten the enjoyment of life and social harmony. TheUnited Nations now has an opportunity to put fully intoeffect the system of security envisaged in its Charter. Thissystem is based on the principles of the peaceful settlementof disputes and collective action in pursuit of internationalpeace and the maintenance of global security. Equallyimportant  the world has an opportunity to build pillars ofpeace by tackling sources of instability in the economic social  humanitarian and ecological fields.The brutal war in Bosnia  the destruction of Somaliaand the protracted civil wars in Angola and elsewhereconfirm the futility of the use of force as a means of solvingdisputes.The ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty(START I) by the Governments of the United States ofAmerica and the Russian Federation and their signing of theSTART II Agreements in January 1993 are significantdevelopments in disarmament. The primary responsibilityfor nuclear disarmament rests with those States that possessthe nuclear arsenals. Kenya  however  strongly believes thatthe international community as a whole must be involvedand should contribute to measures intended to achievenuclear disarmament and the non-proliferation of allweapons of mass destruction.Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 21Contrary to expectations  the collapse of the bipolarworld order has not given way to a new order of peace anddemocracy and improved socio-economic situations. Theemerging order has raised new challenges and newapproaches to solutions. As Members of the United Nationsfamily  we need to redouble our efforts with vision anddetermination to balance both short- and long-term interestsas we struggle to shape the new order.In many parts of the world  we are confronted withassertions of nationalism coupled with territorial claims. Asthe Secretary-General puts it in his Agenda for Peace ""... the cohesion of States is threatened by brutal ethnic religious  social  cultural and linguistic strife"".(A/47/277  para. 11)Kenya subscribes to the thrust of the Agenda for Peaceas elaborated during the forty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly  on the basis of which a draft resolution will beadopted during this session. The elaboration of the Agendafor Peace should take into account the principles ofsovereignty  independence  territorial integrity andnon-interference in the internal affairs of nation-States.The new approach will widen and deepen the scope ofthe United Nations in the promotion of the peacefulsettlement of disputes and the maintenance of peace andsecurity. In this regard  Kenya urges the full exploitation ofthe potential of the International Court of Justice in theadjudication of disputes between States as a potentialtransparent and cost-effective means of conflict resolution.The case of Somalia is particularly distressing. Westrongly believe that keeping United Nations peace-keepingpersonnel in Somalia is critical to the pursuit of peace andsecurity in that country. We note with appreciation theSecretary-General’s report that  despite several incidences ofviolence in Mogadishu  there are improvements in theoverall situation  including eradication of starvation establishment of a large number of district councils  openingof schools and resumption of normal life in most areas ofthe country.We also welcome Security Council resolution865 (1993) of 22 September  by which the Council  interalia  invites the Secretary-General to consult the countries ofthe region and regional organizations concerned on means offurther reinvigorating the reconciliation process. We believethat the regional peace initiatives can effectively complementthe United Nations efforts in facilitating reconciliationbetween all the factions in Somalia.The highest priority is to assist the people of Somaliain furthering the national reconciliation process and topromote and advance the re-establishment of regional andnational institutions and civil administration in the entirecountry  as set out in Security Council resolution 814 (1993).This requires improvement of the dialogue between theUnited Nations personnel in Somalia and the general Somalipublic as an essential element in confidence-building tofacilitate reconciliation between the various factions.Kenya shares an 800-kilometre-long border withSomalia. In many ways  we are extremely exposed to theSomalia problem. Somalia is a sister country with which weshare family relations as well as ethnic and culturalaffinities. The very heavy influx of Somali refugees intoKenya has had a devastating effect on the most ecologicallyfragile parts of the country. The border region has sufferedserious environmental destruction as a result of excessivecutting of trees for building materials and firewood. Thephysical and social infrastructures have been overstretchedby excessive usage and overloading.Most seriously  our people and security personnel havebeen subjected to numerous acts of banditry by armed gangscrossing into Kenya from Somalia  causing general insecurityin the border region. We have continued to lose bothcivilians and security personnel at an unacceptably high rateas a result of attacks by bandits. Huge numbers of livestockand huge quantities of other property have also been lost tothem.As peace is being restored in Somalia  we arecooperating with the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees to accelerate the voluntaryrepatriation of refugees. At the same time  we arerequesting the United Nations and the donor community tourgently assist Kenya with programmes for the rehabilitationof the physical and social infrastructures as well as for therestoration of the ecosystem in the region.We are also requesting the Secretary-General toreinforce the United Nations Operation in Somalia(UNOSOM) patrols along the Somali side of the border soas to complement the efforts of the Kenyan securitypersonnel on our side. We believe that the joint securityefforts will significantly scale down the flow of armed gangsand individuals into Kenya.Sudan is another neighbouring country that has for along time now been suffering devastating civil strife. Theproblem has been of great concern not only to theneighbouring countries but also to the Organization of22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionAfrican Unity (OAU) and the United Nations. There is anurgent need for the United Nations to support the ongoingregional efforts spearheaded by Presidents Yoweri Museveniof Uganda  Afwerki of Eritrea and Zenawi of Ethiopia underthe chairmanship of President Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya.We appeal to all parties involved in the conflict to beflexible in the search for a just and lasting solution.Elsewhere in our continent  efforts to find solutions toethnic and other conflicts have shown encouraging trends.We are confident that the people of Mozambique  Rwandaand Liberia will realize their dreams of peace through theprocess of dialogue. Greater involvement by the UnitedNations in the Rwandese peace process is pertinent at thisstage. It is essential that the peace accords signed in thesecountries be honoured by all the parties  with effectivesupport from the United Nations  the OAU and regionalbodies  and with generous assistance from friendly countries.The situation in Angola is very disturbing. Theongoing bloodshed could easily have been avoided if theUNITA leadership had accepted the verdict of the people inthe elections. We appeal to UNITA to agree to a dialoguefor a peaceful political solution  with the mediation andincreased support of the United Nations  OAU and thesponsors of the Peace Accords.We are also greatly encouraged by the developmentsthat have taken place in South Africa. The agreementreached for the creation of the Transitional ExecutiveCouncil and the setting of a date for the first democraticelections pave the way for the establishment of a trulynon-racial  democratic South Africa. We support the recentcall by Mr. Nelson Mandela  the President of the AfricanNational Congress of South Africa (ANC)  for all diplomaticand economic sanctions against South Africa to be lifted.The recently concluded  momentous agreement betweenIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) marksa turning point in the process of finding a just and lastingsolution to the Palestinian and  indeed  the Middle Eastproblem. We are encouraged by the assurances that this isthe first tangible step towards the establishment of aPalestinian State alongside Israel. We wish the Palestinianand Israeli people happy and peaceful coexistence.Further afield  we welcome the successful holding ofthe elections under United Nations auspices in Cambodia the conclusion of the Governors Island Agreement on therestoration of a democratically elected Government of Haiti and the progress towards the establishment of lasting peacein El Salvador.The experience of Somalia and other regional conflictsconvinces us that there is an urgent need for the UnitedNations to re-evaluate the existing international controlsystems for conventional-weapon production and trade. Thewidespread availability of deadly conventional weaponsconstitutes the most important factor in the prolongation ofregional and civil conflicts.With its increased responsibilities and challenges  theUnited Nations needs to be restructured and revitalized sothat it can effectively discharge its responsibilities. It mustalso be provided with adequate resources. The tasks aheaddemand that the energy and attention of all components ofthe United Nations be engaged fully and appropriately.The General Assembly must be enabled to play its fullrole in decisions affecting international peace and security.There is a need to establish a balanced relationship betweenthe Assembly and the other principal organs of the UnitedNations  and to ensure logical accountability of the principalorgans  in particular the Security Council.The Security Council must also be reformed so that itis more transparent  more representative and moredemocratic in its decision-making process  while at the sametime its effectiveness is ensured.The ongoing restructuring and revitalization of theEconomic and Social Council and the United Nations in theeconomic  social and related fields should strengthen theCouncil and enable it to play a central role in providingpolicy recommendations to the General Assembly.Similarly  the ongoing efforts to restructure the Secretariatmust be balanced and accord appropriate priority todevelopment concerns. Operational activities of theOrganization must be provided with adequate resources ona sustainable basis to enable it effectively to promotesocio-economic progress in accordance with its Charter.Peace-keeping operations have increasingly becomeamong the most utilized and widely acceptable instrumentsof the Organization  especially in discharging its primaryresponsibility in the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. The operations have also increasingly taken onnew and broader assignments and responsibilities. Kenya ishappy to be closely associated with peace-keepingoperations. We have contributed military and policepersonnel to many peace-keeping operations world wide.The enormous rise in the number and scope ofpeace-keeping operations requires that the ability of theSecretariat to manage such large-scale operations beForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 23strengthened and also that Member States be ready tofinance the operations.In this connection  the serious concerns expressed bythe Secretary-General and his urgent appeals to MemberStates to pay arrears of contributions must receive a concreteand speedy response from all the Members of thisOrganization. The formula for apportioning contributionsshould reflect the special responsibility of the permanentmembers of the Security Council and of other developedcountries and take into account the relatively limitedcapacities of developing countries. A dramatic change in theformula of contributions could  I submit  complicate furtherthe problem of arrears. The establishment of thepeace-keeping reserve fund would go a long way towardsmaking peace-keeping operations more efficient. In thisregard  a timely and effective response by the UnitedNations will largely depend on the availability of adequateresources  at least in the initial stages  to cater for the criticaltime lost in negotiations for the financing of peace-keepingoperations. It is also important that a formula be developedto establish a more predictable financial basis for thepeace-keeping operations.The uncertainty prevailing in the world economy todayis a cause for serious concern. Insufficient growth in thedeveloped countries has contributed to the unfavourableexternal conditions that threaten the political  economic andsocial stability of many developing countries. These includerenewed pressures for increased protectionism  fallingcommodity prices and the decline in financial flows  amongother conditions. Despite the far-reaching economic andpolitical reforms which have been put in place by mostAfrican countries in the last three years  the situationcontinues to be grim  since the region continues toexperience economic growth of less than 2 per cent. Thecurrent trends  if not reversed  threaten to marginalize furtherthe participation of African countries in the global economy.The liberalization of the African economies and thehard work of the African people are not in themselvessufficient to transform the socio-economic situation inAfrica. The continent is not playing the internationaleconomic game with other continents on a level ground. Wewish  therefore  to underscore the need for the internationalcommunity to seize the opportunity created by the positivechanges taking place on the continent and give Africa realsupport so that the gains made for economic and democraticreform will be sustainable.At the same time  African countries should continue tostrengthen their regional integration efforts within theregional bodies already established  such as the PreferentialTrade Area for the Eastern and Southern African Countries(PTA)  the Inter-Governmental Authority for Drought andDevelopment (IGADD) in the Horn of Africa  and theongoing efforts to revive East African cooperation.Our experience in Kenya in implementing structuraladjustment programmes is that the reforms have inherentnegative short-term effects  particularly on the poor and theother vulnerable members of society. These include the fallin their purchasing power owing to the liberalization ofprices  job losses through a reduction of manpower in thepublic sector  and the reduction of government expenditureon such essential social services as health  education andother infrastructures. The donor community needs therefore  to balance the aid conditionalities with thesocio-economic realities obtaining in the countriesimplementing structural adjustment programmes  particularlyby addressing the social dimensions of such programmes inconcrete and human terms.The United Nations new agenda for the development ofAfrica in the 1990s  adopted by the General Assembly at itsforty-sixth session  commits the international community toimplement concrete and effective measures to supportAfrica’s own efforts in the process of economic reforms anddevelopment. The success of the implementation of theprogramme will depend  first  on the efforts of the Africancountries themselves and  secondly  on the back-up resourcesfrom multilateral and bilateral donors. We are concernedthat these resources are shrinking owing to diversion andwhat appears to be a subtle disengagement from Africa.The acute external debt of African countries and theheavy and unbearable burden of servicing that debt areamong the matters on which concrete action is needed. Theburden of debt-servicing drains the continent of over $10billion annually  thus diverting resources badly needed forinvestment and alleviation of poverty.On trade  it is gratifying to note that  after six monthsof stalemate  multilateral negotiations of the Uruguay Roundof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)have resumed. We emphasize  however  that the outcome ofthe negotiations should be balanced to take account of theparticular needs of the poor developing countries.The World Conference on Human Rights  which washeld in Vienna  Austria  in June this year  marked asignificant watershed for the international community on theimportant question of human rights. That Conferenceemphasized that human rights are interdependent and24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionindivisible. It recognized development as a basic humanright. Democracy  development and human rights go handin hand  as experience has shown that it is difficult toguarantee some basic rights  especially economic and socialrights  in situations of abject poverty.As I emphasized in my statement at that Conference the existing international institutions for human rights needstrengthening. At the same time  developing countriesrequire support and assistance to strengthen their domesticinstitutions and build strong foundations for the rule of lawand the administration of justice.Since the Rio Conference on Environment andDevelopment  Governments and international agencies havefocused their attention on the implementation of Agenda 21.The first substantive meeting of the Commission onSustainable Development  held in June this year  madetangible progress in adopting crucial decisions on its workprogramme. Kenya welcomes the progress being madetowards ensuring the effectiveness of the GlobalEnvironmental Facility as an important instrument forfunding incremental costs related to the implementation ofAgenda 21. However  we are concerned that adequatefinancial resources for the implementation of the programmehave fallen short of expectations. On institutionalarrangements  while Kenya supports the mandate given tothe Commission on Sustainable Development in regard tomonitoring progress in the implementation of Agenda 21  theUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) mustcontinue to play a central role owing to the experience andexpertise it has accumulated over the years in the area of theenvironment. The need to strengthen UNEP to enable it toparticipate effectively in the implementation of Agenda 21can therefore not be overemphasized.Accordingly  the conference facilities at UNEPHeadquarters in Nairobi must be put to full use. It is neithereconomically sound nor in keeping with the objective ofstrengthening UNEP to have many meetings initiated by theOrganization held outside its Headquarters. As a hostcountry  Kenya shall continue to provide all the necessaryassistance to UNEP to enable it to play its central and indeed  its rightful role.As the Secretariat of the United Nations undergoesrestructuring  we should be mindful of the mandates ofvarious agencies and bodies in order to avoid the possibilityof losing the original objective. Kenya is concerned that therole of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements(Habitat)  whose Headquarters are in Nairobi  is beingeroded by the undue delay in filling the post of ExecutiveDirector  despite the concerns expressed by the GeneralAssembly at its forty-seventh session. The filling of the postwill give the required impetus to the Habitat secretariat.As to the social issues  I wish to assure members of ourcooperation with the international community in thepreparatory work for the forthcoming Conference onPopulation and Development  to be held next year; theFourth World Conference on Women  also to be held in1994; and the World Summit for Social Development  set for1995. We need to put all our energies into the preparatorywork of these Conferences to ensure that they achieve theirintended objectives.In conclusion  the international community  through thisAssembly  must make every effort to face these challengesand many more which are yet to come. We owe it toposterity and to future generations to leave this world abetter place to live in. We have neither excuses nor reasonsto fail. And if we do fail  history will judge us harshly. Inthis endeavour  our differences should strengthen rather thanweaken us  for in unity lies our strength. In the words of ourbeloved President  His Excellency Daniel Teroitich ArapMoi  love  peace and unity are the pillars for developmentand progress."
"87",3718,"KGZ",48,1993,"I wish to begin by congratulating the Presidentand the other officers of the Assembly on their election totheir high  responsible posts and by wishing them everysuccess in their work  which will certainly yield positiveresults for us all.The end of the twentieth century will go down inhistory as the period in which the cold war came to an endand which saw the dawn of a new world  a period of newopportunities to do things that only yesterday would havetaken a miracle to achieve. It is enough to recall the historicagreement between Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO)  the reductions in nuclear and otherweapons of mass destruction  and  for my country something that seemed impossible only very recently: theachievement of the high degree of sovereignty that permitsus to speak from the rostrum of the General Assembly Hall.I represent a small country that can be viewed as anoasis of democracy. But that is not strictly accurate: we arehardly surrounded by an empty wasteland. We are trying tofind our place in a new  complex world. In that quest weare guided by the following definitions: In the politicalsphere  our quest means pluralism  allowing the existence ofvaried ideologies and parties that do not espouse violence orextremism; in the economic sphere  it means a policydesigned to achieve a multi-faceted social market economy with equal rights and freedoms for all economic entities; inthe social sphere  it means a policy of self-relianceprotecting the most vulnerable sectors of our population; inthe legal sphere  it means legal safeguards for the interestsof all citizens  economic entities  parties and movements  aswell as for the State; in the area of religion  it meanstolerance and the application of ethical principles; in thesphere of building the structures of State authority  it meansforming coalition groups with broad participation by officialsfrom many parties and movements.The linchpin of our policy is acknowledgement of thepriority of humanitarian values and of the natural right of theindividual to happiness. The new Constitution ofKyrgyzstan clearly lays down these basic principles  throughwhich we are attempting  in spite of difficulties  to establishour chosen State model.My purpose in this statement is not just to give an ideaof our Republic’s political prospects. I shall try to take abroader approach to issues; perhaps to some extent this is aprerequisite for our acknowledgement by the worldcommunity. The process of the victory of democracy inKyrgyzstan  and in the other Republics of the former SovietUnion  seems paradoxical and almost irrational.Revolutionary changes have taken place at the top levels ofthe political elite. These changes were welcomed  as I seeit  primarily because by that time we had already achievedthe democratic victory of glasnost. What happened could beexpressed as follows: the storming of the Bastille waspreceded by The Marriage of Figaro. Our reforms begannot with the economy but with politics. How could it beotherwise  since Kyrgyzstan had no elements of a marketeconomy  and property ownership was distorted?Kyrgyzstan today is one of the few independent States of theformer Soviet Union to have adopted and be carrying out aprogramme of economic reforms for transition to a marketeconomy  as approved by the International Monetary Fundand the World Bank.For a number of objective reasons pertaining to thestructure of production and current shortages of energysources  such as oil and gas  implementation ofrecommendations for our Republic has caused us social andeconomic difficulties. Our country has a dire need formedicines  and a balanced diet is lacking. Thousands andthousands of young people are coming into the cities fromthe villages without any real professional training or anychance of prospering. Furthermore  we cannot yet give oureconomy the necessary impetus to enable us quickly to solvethese and other major social problems. We need investment.Like other relatively small countries  we need a kind ofMarshall Plan. The experience of many States has shownthat this would be profitable for the wealthy countries anddonors in many ways.I would not venture to say that  but for my firmconviction that the ability to empathize with the suffering ofothers has always been a strong point of the United Nations;in fact  it is what has given it its high standing in the eyesof the world. This is not a case of political parasitism. Wefirmly intend to pay off all of our debts  and we fullyrecognize that the usefulness of these policies can bemeasured only by mutual advantage  and that the results ofany foreign policy activity  including the economic aspects depend on the participation of others and the ability to pay in the broad sense of the words.For the world community  for large and small countries one thing is becoming more evident: there exists not onlyeconomic power  the power of gold and production  not onlybrute military power  but also spiritual power. I am talkingnot about the cruel  soulless and heartless fanaticism of somepeople  not about trends and faiths whose history is writtenin blood  but about lofty and pure ethical values which bindForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 17together people who espouse them. These values and idealsare the moral postulates of religion.The President returned to the Chair.I wish to draw attention to what I regard as a specialtopic. We have been witnessing tragic conflicts withreligious roots. One possible solution to this problem wouldbe to adopt a universal convention on freedom of religion which would call upon people of different faiths to applyethical and moral principles for the sake of peace andharmony.The United Nations is recognized to be a universalOrganization  and as such not to be at variance with otherinstitutions of the world community. No  it is in thoseinstitutions  in the specialized agencies and regionalorganizations  that we find the embodiment of the ideals andprinciples of the United Nations. With this in view  I wouldlike to draw attention to the problem of establishing acollective security system in Asia. In principle  thedelegation of Kyrgyzstan agrees with what previous speakershave said in this regard. On the other hand  a collectivesecurity system in Asia cannot be established quickly  or asquickly as might be hoped. In this connection  no doubt thebest we can do is to ask the Secretary-General to conduct astudy  which could give us useful guidelines for future workon such an important problem.Naturally  I have covered only a few issues  against thebackdrop of upheavals in the political and social life of theworld today. But I still hope that I have drawn attention tomajor issues of interest to us all.Every State whose representative has addressed theAssembly has made recommendations  and further valuablerecommendations and proposals will be made  based on thehigh ideals of our Organization  whose focal point should bethe individual and his or her prosperity and happiness. Wefully agree with these proposals and hope that the creativeenergy involved will not be self-destructive."
"88",3763,"KHM",48,1993,"First ofall  may I be permitted to join previous speakers inexpressing deep sadness and sorrow at the loss of thousandsof lives in Killari  India  as a result of the tragic earthquakeon 30 September 1993. On behalf of the Government andpeople of Cambodia may I offer our profound condolencesto the Government of India and to the relatives of thevictims.It is a privilege and an honour for me to address theGeneral Assembly at their forty-eighth session as the FirstPrime Minister of the democratically elected RoyalGovernment of Cambodia  where  in accordance with themandate given to the Organization by the Paris Agreementsof 23 October 1991  the United Nations has played ahistoric  decisive and successful role in ending 23 years ofsuffering and misery for our people.May I express a warm welcome and congratulations toMr. Samuel Insanally of the Republic of Guyana on hiselection as President of the United Nations GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I am sure thatAmbassador Insanally will lead the deliberations of this bodyto a successful conclusion.I also wish to convey our warmest thanks andappreciation for the tireless work undertaken by hispredecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev of the Republic of Bulgaria for his judicious and capable management of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-seventh session.Cambodia welcomes Andorra  the Czech Republic Eritrea  Monaco  the Slovak Republic and the Republic ofMacedonia to this international body. Their decision tobecome Members of the United Nations will no doubt helpto strengthen peace and security in the world.On behalf of His Majesty  Norodom Sihanouk  King ofCambodia  of His Excellency  Mr. Hun Sen  Second PrimeMinister of the Royal Government of Cambodia  and onbehalf of our people  may I be permitted to express ourprofound and everlasting gratitude to Mr. Javier Perez deCuellar  former Secretary-General of the United Nations; toMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  current Secretary-General of theUnited Nations; and to Mr. Yasushi Akashi  SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations in Cambodia  who are the artisans of the success ofthe United Nations operation in Cambodia  which hasbrought to our people peace  freedom  independence and thebeginning of a period in which democracy will beestablished in our motherland.Availing myself of this solemn opportunity  I shouldlike to recall the important historic role played by Indonesia France  Thailand  Japan and the People’s Republic of China which hosted crucial meetings on Cambodia that have led tothe present positive results. I should like to express mydeepest gratitude to the following eminent personalities  theirExcellencies President Suharto and President FrançoisMitterrand  Mr. Roland Dumas  Mr. Ali Alatas  Mr. GarethEvans and Mr. Ahmed Rafeeuddin for their tirelesscontributions to the success of this precious peace process.We are most gratified by the many congratulatorymessages from Governments welcoming the promulgation ofthe new Constitution of Cambodia and the reaccession to thethrone of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. Last  butnot least  the official recognition extended to the new democratically elected Royal Government of Cambodiaconstitutes an act of justice  which to us is of greatencouragement.The success of the United Nations operation inCambodia can be described as a combination of trust in thegood will of the international community to save Cambodiaand of the will of the whole Cambodian population to saveits homeland.Forty-eighth session - 4 October l993 7The Cambodian people  by their participation  in hugenumbers  in the free and fair elections held in our countrylast May  played a decisive role in sowing the seeds ofdemocracy in Cambodia. His Majesty King NorodomSihanouk  father of the Cambodian nation  played a crucialrole in encouraging and nurturing national reconciliationamong all Khmers  and provided firm support for the UnitedNations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) andfor Mr. Yasushi Akashi  the leader of UNTAC. The stepstaken by His Majesty ensured success for the last stage ofthe peace plan  including the drafting of our newConstitution and the orderly transfer of power.I am indeed pleased to report that the peace process inCambodia continues in accordance with the Paris PeaceAgreements. The elections  in which  happily  huge numbersof my compatriots participated  were free and fair. Despitetremendous difficulties and constraints  the outcome wasmost encouraging for the future of democracy in Cambodia.Cambodia’s new Constitution  which was drafted by asovereign Constituent Assembly  established a constitutionalmonarchy within the framework of a democratic and liberalpolitical system  under which the people are the sole sourceof State power  and the judiciary is totally independent ofthe legislature and the executive. The constitutionalmonarchy represents the will of the people  expressedthrough their elected representatives in the constituentAssembly. Under the new Constitution  respect for humanrights and individual freedoms has a key place.Even though we have the same leadership as we hadduring the transitional period  when the provisionalGovernment was in power  the establishment of the RoyalGovernment of Cambodia will ensure the social stability andpeace that are so necessary to enable us all to dedicateourselves to the reconstruction and development of ourhomeland.We still need a peaceful settlement of the Khmer Rougeproblem. This problem must be resolved by the Cambodianpeople. We hope that a solution will be arrived at duringthe course of the November round-table discussions  atwhich His Majesty the King will preside. In this regard  theposition of the Royal Government of Cambodia is perfectlyclear: we are ready to welcome the Khmer Rouge group asadvisers to the Royal Army and the Royal Government.However  we demand that  in return  the Khmer Rougegroup assume the same responsibilities as were undertakenby the other three former parties that signed the ParisAgreements: that its administration be dismantled; that itsarmies and its zones become part of a single national entity a unified and indivisible Cambodia whose territory and landand maritime borders are internationally recognized  as wasthe case in the 1960s; and that there be a centralgovernmental structure consisting of a national Assembly  aRoyal Government  Royal armed forces and a RoyalAdministration.The international community should guarantee theindependence  sovereignty and territorial integrity ofCambodia. Indeed  a unique international guarantee isclearly enshrined in the text of the Agreement on aComprehensive Political Settlement of the CambodiaConflict of 23 October 1991  Part III  which is entitled""Agreement concerning the sovereignty  independence territorial integrity and inviolability  neutrality and nationalunity of Cambodia"".The Royal Government of Cambodia solemnly pledgesthat it will scrupulously respect the relevant clauses ofarticles 1 and 3 of Part III of the Agreement. Cambodiarequests that  in return  all signatories to the ParisAgreements of 23 October 1991 respect the clausescontained in articles 2  4 and 5 of Part III.The new Cambodia counts on all countries signatoriesto the Paris Agreements to""solemnly undertake to recognize and respect thesovereignty  independence  territorial integrity andinviolability  neutrality and national unity ofCambodia.""Notably  the parties must""refrain from interference  in any form whatsoever whether direct or indirect  in the internal affairs ofCambodia.""The Royal Government of Cambodia urges that thosecountries which have not yet subscribed to the ParisAgreements of 23 October 1991 do so in order to helpCambodia and the Cambodian people  who have suffered somuch  to maintain and reinforce this fragile peace. This issomething that benefits not only Cambodia but the entireAsia-Pacific region. Maintenance of peace will be the soleguarantee of recovery and reconstruction in Cambodia.8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session(spoke in French)We are determined to conclude this process  and weshall do so by ourselves. However  after 23 years of warand suffering  Cambodia is a devastated country. Thus  thenew Cambodia needs aid and assistance from theinternational community. We pledge that we shall devote allour meagre human and financial resources and the extremelygenerous assistance of the international community to thereconstruction and rehabilitation of our devastated andimpoverished country.We welcome the great success of the Tokyo MinisterialConference on the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction ofCambodia that took place in June 1992 and the success ofthe international conference on the reconstruction ofCambodia that was held in Paris last month. The success ofboth these conferences is an indication of the internationalcommunity’s great compassion for the Cambodian people and we shall be for ever grateful.The Royal Government of Cambodia is determined with the help of the international community  to take allappropriate measures to meet this tremendous challenge. Weare determined to respect and abide fully by thearrangements provided for in Part IV of the ParisAgreements of 23 October 1991 on the rehabilitation andreconstruction of Cambodia.It is precisely because we are determined to achievethese objectives that His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk with the agreement of the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Cambodia  asks through the Secretary-General and the Security Council:First  a United Nations integrated office should beestablished in Cambodia.Secondly  the offices of the specialized agencies  suchas the United Nations Development Programme  the UnitedNations Children’s Fund and the World Food Programme should be retained in Phnom Penh.Thirdly  we should maintain the human rightscomponent in Phnom Penh and expand it into a permanenthuman rights centre.Fourthly  we should continue the demining operationswithin the framework of the Cambodian Mine Action Center.Fifthly  we should actively maintain in Phnom Penh ateam of military observers  who would help us to buildconfidence among the Cambodian people and would alsoserve as a guarantee against external threats.The Royal Government of Cambodia wishes to drawthe attention of the international community to the problemof the mines which have been laid throughout Cambodia.Current research shows that there are between 6 million and10 million mines in Cambodian soil. The RoyalGovernment requests the ongoing cooperation of theinternational community in removing as many of these minesas possible. In particular  we request assistance from thecentral database of the Cambodian Mine Action Centre which is one of the most crucial aspects of the wholeoperation. The Cambodian Mine Action Centre has so farcleared over 3 883 230 square metres of minefield. Theremaining task requires special equipment and a budgetspanning the next 5 to 10 years. We hope that theinternational community can help us make our country safefor present and future generations.Also  as a signatory to the 1970 Convention on theMeans of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property  andas the Angkor monuments have been listed since December1992 as a world heritage site  we request the internationalcommunity to give unstinting assistance to the RoyalGovernment of Cambodia in its struggle against the illicittraffic of Khmer cultural patrimony  which has been subjectto unprecedented looting and vandalism. In order to recoverthese valuable cultural properties  we appeal to all countrieswhich export such goods and through which they aretransported - whether or not they have ratified the foregoingConvention - to adopt the following steps to help us. First they should prevent national museums and similarinstitutions from acquiring any antiquities which are nativeto the Kingdom of Cambodia. Secondly  they should banthe import of these cultural properties as soon as they arelegally listed in the inventories of Khmer national patrimony if they are not legally licensed by the competent Cambodianauthorities for export purposes. Thirdly  they should take allnecessary steps to ensure that antique dealers and merchantsof cultural resources assist the Royal Government ofCambodia in recovering and repatriating those culturaltreasures illegally exported from the Kingdom of Cambodia.The Royal Government of Cambodia wishes to expressits deepest appreciation to the countries of the Associationof South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) for their past andongoing efforts to help Cambodia and the Cambodian peopleachieve peace  freedom and independence. We in CambodiaForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 9note with sincere admiration the tremendous developmenttaking place in the countries of ASEAN  and we hope tolearn much from their extensive experience.Cambodia very much regrets that conflict has engulfedthe former Yugoslavia  a country that always maintainedclose and friendly relations with us. We sincerely hope thatthe current negotiations will put an end to the suffering ofthe innocent people of the various regions of that unfortunatecountry.Cambodia also regrets the renewal of conflicts inSomalia  Angola and Georgia. We hope that the interventionof the international community will put a swift end to theseconflicts that have caused so much bloodshed.Cambodia congratulates the Palestine LiberationOrganization and the State of Israel for reaching initialagreement on some of the issues that have divided them forso many years and caused so much suffering to thePalestinian and Israeli peoples. We urge them to pursuetheir efforts to achieve permanent peace. My Governmentis thus pleased to announce that Cambodia has officiallyrestored diplomatic relations with the State of Israel at theambassadorial level.Cambodia welcomes the progress achieved in thediscussions between the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea and the United States of America. We support the10-point programme proposed by President Kim Il Sung forthe peaceful reunification of Korea  and we also support thetotal nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.We have followed with satisfaction the positivedevelopments in South Africa  where apartheid is beingdismantled. We are aware that many obstacles remain andwe hope that they can be removed without senseless violenceand in peaceful and constructive cooperation between theblack majority and the white minority.(spoke in English)Before I conclude  may I be permitted to pay profoundhomage to the courageous military and civilian personnel ofthe United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia  whohave given their lives for the cause of peace in my country.Their names are enshrined deep in our hearts.Cambodia’s complex problems have been solvedpeacefully thanks to the tireless efforts of Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of the United Nations.The Royal Government and people of Cambodia salute himand highly commend and praise him for his just leadershipin the crucial Cambodia conflict and for bringing it to apeaceful settlement.The message the people of Cambodia have entrustedme to convey to the General Assembly is one of gratitude of hope and of continuous cooperation with the internationalcommunity with a view to strengthening peace  democracyand respect for human rights in Cambodia. We know thatour task is huge  complex and by no means easy  but wepledge to do our utmost to bring it to a successfulcompletion."
"89",3806,"KNA",48,1993," I amextremely pleased to bring warm and cordial greetings fromthe Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis. It isindeed with a profound sense of pleasure and honour that Iaddress this  the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations.First  I should like to express my sincerecongratulations and appreciation to the outgoing President Mr. Stoyan Ganev  for the very proficient and skilful mannerin which he handled last year’s deliberations.I hasten to extend to you  Sir  our new President  a veryhearty welcome. Your presence in the Chair is a source ofgreat joy and pride to all of us from the Caribbean. I knowthat you will bring your vast experience and great skill tobear on these proceedings. I wish to assure you of mycountry’s continued support and willing cooperation.I should also like to commend most highly ourSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whosecommitment to the furtherance of the cause of peace equality  freedom and democracy world wide stands out asa testament to hope and prosperity in a time of conflict andsocial chaos.Last week the world was shocked by the tragedy of theearthquake which caused such extensive loss of life in India.I extend condolences to the Government and people of Indiaon behalf of the Government and people of Saint Kitts andNevis. I know that the world community will continue torespond in appropriate measure with timely assistance.My Government regrets the startling and violent eventsthat have been occurring in Russia over the past few days and we express the hope that peace will quickly return andthat democracy will indeed come to the people of Russia.On 19 September my country  Saint Kitts and Nevis celebrated the tenth anniversary of our independence. On 23September it was 10 years since I had in this Hallannounced our nation to the world  indicating the principlesthat would guide our participation in world affairs and theobjectives that we would pursue. The principles enunciatedthen are timeless and unchanging  and I can only ask theAssembly to revisit them with me as I quote:""The rights and freedoms embodied in the Constitutionof Saint Kitts and Nevis reflect our commitment to thesanctity of human life  and of human dignity  the rightsof the individual  and the non-violent pursuit ofhappiness."" (A/38/PV.3  p. 41)At that time the East and the West stood precariouslybalanced on the brink of the total nuclear annihilation of thehuman species. Today the world breathes a collective sighof relief as the process of reducing nuclear armaments isgenuinely proceeding.Initially Saint Kitts and Nevis refused to sign thenuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Our position was aprincipled one  because while we supported the objective ofstemming the spread of nuclear weapons among countries we felt that in practical terms it would be meaningless unlessthose countries with the largest stockpiles of nuclearweapons made meaningful reductions in their arsenals.Forty-eighth session - 4 October l993 21Saint Kitts and Nevis has now signed the Treaty. I call onall countries with nuclear weapons or the capacity to makethem to join in the global effort for the complete eliminationof nuclear weapons.Our attention is focused now on conventional conflictsin various arenas. The fighting and the attendant atrocitiesreported from the theatre of conflict in Bosnia andHerzegovina represent a serious affront to every principle ofhuman sanctity and human dignity that we share within thisbody of nations. The United Nations is endeavouring tofulfil a humanitarian mission  but we must redouble ourefforts to bring an end to the fighting. We cannot butexpress our condemnation and abhorrence at the atrocity of""ethnic cleansing"" being attempted in that theatre of conflict.The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis appeals to all theparties involved in this brutal conflict to heed the call of theinternational community to broker a peaceful settlement andto respect the efforts of the United Nations to implementeffective programmes aimed at ending the civil war and atproviding humanitarian assistance to those victims caught inthe crossfire.My Government commends the efforts of the UnitedNations in delivering humanitarian assistance to the peopleof Somalia who face the threat of disease  hunger  starvationand imminent death. At the same time  my Governmentdeplores the barbarous attacks on United Nations personneldeployed in Somalia by forces loyal to Somali factions. Wewould also like to add our voice in protest against the killingof 23 Pakistani peace-keeping soldiers  and otherssubsequently. Although we would wish to see theperpetrators punished  it is our hope that the United Nationswill remain faithful to its original mandate to keep the peaceand feed the hungry.My country looks forward to an early end and apermanent solution that will permit the process ofdevelopment to be resumed. We sincerely hope that thiscrisis does not threaten the prospects for peace in the Hornof Africa.Elsewhere in Africa hope has come alive. I refer inparticular to the developments in South Africa. TheGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis welcomes theannouncement of the prospects of non-racial and multi-partyelections scheduled to take place in South Africa in Aprill994. The Caribbean has always been unambiguous andemphatic in its condemnation of apartheid. There is nodoubt that our commitment and our principled stand hascontributed to the inevitable dismantling of the unjust systemof apartheid.We are at the threshold of a new South Africa whichoffers to its people an unprecedented opportunity to write anew chapter in the history of South Africa whereby theeradication of apartheid could lead to the creation of a new united  non-racial and democratic society. We are extremelyencouraged by the progress in the negotiations taking placebetween the Government of F. W. de Klerk  Nelson Mandelaof the African National Congress (ANC)  and members ofother political parties in South Africa. While there are stillmajor difficulties  we call upon all parties to seize thisopportunity to bring peace and freedom to all SouthAfricans.However  Member Governments must maintain theirvigilance until the Transitional Executive Council has beenestablished  with the proper terms of reference clearlyoutlined and defined  to allow for the integration and activeparticipation of all races within the developmental andgovernmental process of that country. But Saint Kitts andNevis supports Nelson Mandela’s call for the removal ofsanctions at this time.The involvement and influence of the United Nations inconflict resolution have been outstanding in recent times. Inthis regard  my delegation wishes to applaud the timelyefforts of the United Nations and the Organization ofAmerican States (OAS) to bring the relevant parties in theHaitian crisis to the negotiating table. My Governmentwelcomes the Governors Island Agreement brokered by theUnited Nations  which resulted in talks betweenPresident Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the military highcommand in Haiti. The appointment and installation ofPrime Minister Malval  who was chosen by PresidentAristide  was a significant achievement.The international community must provide support andsecurity to ensure the safe return of President Aristide following which a major development offensive  withinstitution-building  must be mounted and sustained. Haitimust be given the same high priority as is accorded to otherareas of conflict or poverty in the world.Changes in international affairs are taking place with astartling rapidity and suddenness that could not possibly havebeen predicted. Who would have expected the surprising butvery welcome rapprochement between Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  which now offersa genuine prospect for peace in the Middle East? The peaceprospect is obviously very fragile  but we must all supportit and give it every opportunity to prosper. The realities ofthe present world situation call not for a hardening oftraditional attitudes  but for a genuine search for solutions 22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioneven if they require unprecedented approaches andcompromises.Also in relation to that region  we welcome thefinalization of the demarcation of the boundary betweenKuwait and Iraq  which was accomplished by the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission on 20 May1993. We also welcome the adoption by the SecurityCouncil of its resolution 833 (1993)  in which it guaranteedthe inviolability of the boundary between the two States.We expect that this guarantee will serve as a deterrentagainst future conflict between Kuwait and Iraq  and alsoenhance stability and security in the region. Iraq is calledupon to respect the terms of Security Council resolution 833(1993) and other relevant Security Council resolutions.Who would have predicted the fall of the Berlin Walland the reunification of East and West Germany? Whowould have predicted the breakup of the Soviet Union andthe subsequent United Nations membership of a largenumber of new sovereign States? The United Nations hasbeen in the midst of it all. We have welcomed themembership of North and South Korea  ideologicaldifferences notwithstanding. And we support their effortstowards reunification.It is clear that membership in the United Nations isneither a deterrent to reunification  as we saw in the case ofGermany  nor to fragmentation  as we saw in the case of theSoviet Union. Whatever the aspirations of a country’speople  as determined by that people  these can beaccommodated within the framework and forum of theUnited Nations  which is more effective as an organoperating by a process of inclusion than one operating by aprocess of exclusion.In that context  my Government calls on the UnitedNations to begin the process that would eventually lead tothe admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan into thisOrganization. The Republic of China on Taiwan has proveditself to be a country that espouses the principles inherent inthe United Nations Charter  a country dedicated to peace social tranquillity and economic development  not only forits people  but also for the peoples of other nations.I want to extend a warm welcome to those who havebecome Members of this august body and to congratulatethem on seeking membership within this brotherhood ofnations. Membership itself implies an acceptance of theUnited Nations Charter and a recognition of the importanceof the Organization’s objectives. I want to assure these newMember States of my Government’s readiness to extend awilling hand of friendship and cooperation as we worktogether to further the cause of global peace and humandevelopment.The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis fullysubscribes to the policy of universality of membership. It isour strong belief that once a country satisfies theprerequisites for membership it should be allowed to joinand to participate actively in the international fraternity ofnations dedicated to upholding the principles of the Charter.It is timely  in the context of membership  to examinethe issue of the planned restructuring of the United Nations.I would like to underscore the fact that the Government ofSaint Kitts and Nevis is fully supportive of the movementtowards restructuring the United Nations with a view toensuring that such restructuring will lead to the creation ofmore efficient and effective organs that are responsive to thedevelopment needs of States Members of the Organization.This restructuring should include both the permanent and thenon-permanent membership of the Security Council.As we seek to proceed with plans for the restructuringof the United Nations  the Government of Saint Kitts andNevis wishes emphasis to be placed on ensuring thatequitable geographic representation is seen to be encouraged especially in respect of decision-making and in respect ofpositions within the Secretariat. For too long  countries likemine in the Caribbean have not been adequately representedwithin the United Nations Secretariat. I wish to suggestalso that due consideration be given to the establishment ofa United Nations office in the eastern Caribbean to serve theinterests of the smaller island-States that comprise theOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).We have looked at the questions of membership andrestructuring of the United Nations. It is important for us toreview the question of the mission of the Organization. TheCharter calls for the promotion of the economic and socialadvancement of all peoples. Ten years after ourindependence  Saint Kitts and Nevis would like to remindthe Assembly of the mission as we perceived it then:""We seek the establishment of a new internationaleconomic order  for a redeployment of the world’sresources and for the implementation of mechanisms toincrease the flow of assistance towards the world’spoor."" (A/38/PV.3  p. 42)We ask ourselves: to what extent are these objectivesbeing realized? To what extent is the mission beingfulfilled? The answers are gravely disappointing. The newForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 23international economic order that seems to be emerging isone in which the developed and the more powerful countriesare creating mega-sized trading and economic blocs  andseeking to establish rules designed to secure their ownaggrandizement at the expense of small developing countrieslike ours in the Caribbean  which are being quietly butsurely marginalized. We see the developed and powerfulcountries seeking to redeploy the world’s resources  as foundin the biodiversity of our forests and the vastness of theocean resources  for their own benefit  on the spuriousground that the technology is theirs and not ours. We seeflows of direct assistance to developing countries drying up and more so for the countries of the Caribbean. It wouldappear that the hope of seeing this mission fulfilled is lessrealizable now than it was 10 years ago.Some will say that the danger of nuclear war isdiminished. Some will say that many conflicts are beingresolved  even though new ones are springing up. Andpeace is being realized in many former areas of conflict.That is all true. The question remains  however: What sortof peace are we experiencing? Peace in Haiti is fragile;peace in the Middle East is uneasy; peace in Africa isunstable. I submit that the prospects for lasting peace wouldbe immeasurably enhanced if we sought to achieve thatpeace through development.Peace and development have always been linked  butthey are always portrayed as following parallel courses. Mycountry contends that their paths must be merged and thatwe must achieve the one  peace  as a consequence of theother  development - development which must be sustainableand sustained.It is important that all sectors of our communities havethe opportunity to participate in the process of developmentand to enjoy its benefits. In Saint Kitts and Nevis  weensure as a matter of policy that women are empowered tobe effective participants in development. Our Ministry ofWomen’s Affairs designs and implements programmes fortraining and mobilizing women in a variety of areas essentialto the development of our country. This is an approach werecommend to all developing countries as part of the processof maximizing our human resources.My Government welcomes the call for a GlobalConference on the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States  scheduled to convene in Barbados inApril 1994. We hope that this will result in tangible benefitsfor the small island developing economies of the Caribbeanand in a recognition of our special characteristics and needs.There is developing in international affairs - in relation tothe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  theNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)  theEuropean Common Market and the International MonetaryFund (IMF) - a ""one size fits all"" mentality  or a ""oneprescription for all countries approach"". These are obviouslyout of place in matters of development and human needs.The peculiarities and differences which prompted theadoption of special economic arrangements - the CaribbeanBasin Initiative  the Trade and Investment Agreementbetween Canada and the Caribbean Community Countries(CARIBCAN) and the Lomé Convention - are still verypresent today  and are likely to remain so  because ourislands are not going to become any larger. In fact  wesuffer from serious coastal erosion  which can be properlyaddressed only if substantial financial assistance isforthcoming.I appeal to the Member nations of this august body torecognize also the fragility of our export commodities  suchas sugar and bananas  as their producers represent the majoremployers  and they are significant sources of foreignexchange  for many Caribbean countries. Any loss  nomatter how small  of the limited access which these productsfrom the Caribbean enjoy could have catastrophicconsequences for the economies and lives of the people inthe Caribbean  and by extension could undermine thesocio-political tranquillity of the region.I cannot overemphasize the vulnerability of theCaribbean’s ecosystem and the need for constant vigilancewith respect to its protection and preservation. It is againstthis backdrop that my Government  along with otherGovernments of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) strongly condemns the transboundary movement of toxicwaste and of nuclear and other hazardous materials throughthe Caribbean basin. We therefore call upon theindustrialized countries to refrain from exporting their wasteto or through the Caribbean region. We also deplore thedumping of ship-generated waste in our Caribbean waters and call upon all ships’ operators to discontinue the practice.Those waters are indeed a significant part of our economicpatrimony.The Rio Summit was a watershed for unprecedentedpartnership and international cooperation in the area ofenvironmental protection. The approach that we as nationsadopt on the environment should be modelled in such a wayas to demonstrate our commitment to human development environmental protection and sustainable growth.24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionI want to make a strong appeal to the industrializedcountries and the multilateral agencies to be more rationaland more sensitive to the developmental needs of thedeveloping world  especially island communities  in theirapproach to dealing with the environment. Environmentalconcerns must be appropriately considered within the contextof sustainable development. The peoples of the developingcountries are entitled to an improved standard of life. Theindustrialized North  therefore  should not use a single policyon environment as a yardstick for assessing an individualcountry’s eligibility for developmental assistance.My Government firmly believes that our environmentmust be protected and preserved at all costs - not at theexpense of our people’s standard of living  but rather toenhance their quality of life. The desirability ofenvironmental protection must be appropriately balancedagainst the imperatives of human development.The problem of environmental degradation concerns aglobal common which we all share  and it is only throughinternational collaboration and an adequate transfer oftechnical and financial assistance from developed todeveloping countries that we can begin to arrest and  hence eventually solve this problem.While we attempt to harness our collective efforts toimprove the standard of living of our citizens  we are facedwith the increasing danger of drug trafficking andnarco-terrorism. We can ill afford to relax our resolve.While we seek peace on other fronts we must continue towage war relentlessly on the illicit drug trade and those whowork so assiduously to bolster it. There is an urgent needfor greater financial assistance and technical expertise tocombat this problem. It is the children  the flower of ouryouth  the promise of our nations’ tomorrows  who are beingdestroyed today.At the historic children’s Summit in 1990  we setourselves the task of creating a better world for children andof equipping them now to manage it in the future. Thechallenge is vast  involving their educational  health physical  mental and psychological development  and wemust make ourselves equal to the task.There can be no greater or more noble mission than toensure that our youth from developing nations  small orlarge  as from developed nations  is given every opportunityto aspire to a better quality of life. We can better achievethis in a world of peace  and we can better realize andmaintain that peace through development."
"90",3832,"KOR",48,1993,"May I congratulateAmbassador Insanally of Guyana on his assumption of thepresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighthsession. I also wish to acknowledge the excellent work doneby His Excellency Ambassador Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria asPresident of the last session of the General Assembly.I also pay tribute to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his dedication to the causeof the United Nations and to its reform at this importantjuncture.Allow me to take this opportunity to express mywarmest welcome to the new Member States - Andorra  theCzech Republic  Eritrea  the former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia  Monaco and the Slovak Republic. Mydelegation wishes them every success and looks forward toworking closely with them in all areas.We live in an age of historic transition. This isconfirmed by the dramatic changes in the internationalsituation since the last session. A new world order  whichis fundamentally different from the old one  is taking shape.We are witnessing a trend towards peace  cooperation andinterdependence  instead of conflict  confrontation andideological bigotry. The most resounding testimony to thiseffect emerged in the peace accord between Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization signed in Washington thismonth.Today we find ourselves in an internationalenvironment that was only a vision to the founding fathersof the United Nations. I should like to quote from theremarks of Mr. Oswaldo Aranha  a distinguished diplomatfrom Brazil  who was the President of the General Assemblyin 1947. He said:""All idea of force is today obsolete and negative. Theold order  based on political power  is trying to survive but there is no longer room for predominance throughforce. The United Nations stands for the new order based on peaceful accord  on understanding  on freediscussion ... and on the common and equalresponsibility of peoples."" (Official Records of theGeneral Assembly  Second Session  Plenary Meeting ""128th meeting  p. 1442)Forty-five years after these words were spoken  wefinally stand at the end of one era and on the threshold of anew one. This may be a second  and perhaps the last opportunity for us to fulfil the stated mission of the UnitedNations at its creation.To be sure  the end of the cold war does not mean theend of all problems. The world worries about the continuingand even worsening ethnic and religious conflicts. We facethe proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. Environmental protection is another majorchallenge to today’s world. Development cannot be takenfor granted. These are monumental issues that require thecollective efforts of all members of the internationalcommunity  and of the United Nations in particular.We have entered an age of diversity and uncertainty but we should not be daunted by this new reality. We maynot be accustomed to it  but we should not be afraid ofliving in a pluralistic world. Nations differ in what theywant to achieve and in how they want to achieve it. Thesediverse goals  while constituting a possible source ofconflict  should also form the basis for complementarity andcooperation among nations.Some say that bipolarity is being replaced bymultipolarity. Yet ""pluralistic""  rather than ""multipolar""  isperhaps more precise a term to describe the emerging worldorder. A multipolar world would postulate geopolitics basedupon conflict and balance of power. A pluralistic world  onthe other hand  accepts diversity and encourages cooperation.Thus  the world has the potential to become more democraticand harmonious than it has ever been in history.One of the most noteworthy changes in the aftermathof the cold war is the strengthening of the United Nations particularly in the field of peace and security. The ""Agendafor Peace"" report that Secretary-General Boutros-Ghalisubmitted last year provides a solid base on which toaugment the role of the United Nations in this area.Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 35Preventive diplomacy  in particular  is of the utmostimportance  given the enormous human and material costs ofconflicts once they break out. My delegation will continueits participation in the efforts to translate into a meaningfulreality such initiatives as ""preventive diplomacy"" and""post-conflict peace-building"".As the continuing tragedies in Bosnia and Somaliademonstrate  conflicts fuelled by ethnic and religiousdifferences  poverty and internal disorder are becoming anew and major threat to international security. In responseto increasing demands  17 United Nations peace-keepingoperations are active in different parts of the world.However  traditional peace-keeping may no longer bea sufficient response to current conflicts. We find that thescope of these operations is widening  ranging from thesupervision of a cease-fire to nation-building. Furthermore the timely deployment of peace-keepers is imperative totemper a conflict at an early stage.For this reason  we believe that the proposedmechanism of United Nations stand-by forces is anappropriate way to enhance the Organization’s role inmeeting new challenges to peace. The availability ofstand-by forces will enable the United Nations to provide aquick and effective response to conflicts.I take this opportunity to reaffirm my Government’ssupport of the United Nations Operation in Somalia(UNOSOM II). We dispatched an engineering battalion inJune  and we urge all the factions concerned in Somalia tocooperate fully with the United Nations. Given thesuccessful precedent set by the United Nations TransitionalAuthority in Cambodia (UNTAC)  I am confident thatUNOSOM II will also fulfill its peacekeeping mission.None the less  it is a source of grave concern that thenumber of United Nations casualties in Somalia is sharplyincreasing. Effective arrangements need to be worked out toenhance the safety and security of those who are involved inthe United Nations peace-keeping operations there andeverywhere else.In the domain of peace and security  preventing theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction  both nuclearand biochemical  is another critical task.The Republic of Korea strongly supports the efforts tostop nuclear-weapons proliferation beyond 1995 through theextension of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). Wealso support the strengthening of International AtomicEnergy Agency (IAEA) safeguards as the central device forensuring the effectiveness of the NPT.At the same time  consistent with the spirit andobjective of the NPT  we urge the existing nuclear Powersnot only to accelerate their efforts to reduce their nucleararsenal but also actively to join the efforts for acomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. That will encouragenon-nuclear countries to adhere and agree to an indefiniteextension of the NPT régime. My delegation welcomes thecommitment of nuclear-weapon States to a continuingmoratorium on nuclear testing.With regard to chemical and biological weapons  theconclusion of the chemical weapons Convention in Januarywas a big step forward. We urge those States that have notyet joined the Convention to do so as early as possible. TheConvention  together with the biological weaponsConvention  will serve as a major instrument in preventingproliferation of biochemical weapons.With the ending of the cold war  disarmament hasmoved into the realm of real possibility. Over the past fewyears disarmament has gained momentum with agreementson nuclear-arms reduction and cut-backs in conventionalforces. We have to keep this momentum alive. In the lightof these developments  the October 1992 report of theSecretary-General on ""New dimensions of arms regulationand disarmament in the post-cold war era"" has offered timelyand useful guidelines for disarmament.At the same time  we should take note of the ongoingreassessment of multilateral disarmament machinery. TheConference on Disarmament is particularly important as thesingle multilateral disarmament negotiating forum. In mydelegation’s view  the Conference on Disarmament should beappropriately expanded in membership to reflect the changedinternational environment.In addition  the United Nations Register ofConventional Arms that was launched with the participationof more than 70 Member States should be implemented ona universal basis as soon as possible.As I discuss the issue of disarmament  I need to drawattention to the Korean peninsula. Despite the worldwidetrends towards peace and cooperation  there is still tensionin Korea.My Government believes that the solution to the inter-Korean question should be sought in the context of the post--cold-war international order of reconciliation and36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioncooperation. This means active participation by both Northand South Korea in the regional and global order.We are particularly concerned with the North Koreannuclear programme. North Korea should cooperate inremoving any suspicions surrounding it by honouring itsnon-proliferation obligations under the NPT.In conformity with the Security Council resolution825 (1993)  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea mustcomply with its safeguards agreement with IAEA. At thesame time  we urge the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea to cooperate with us in implementing the 1991inter-Korean Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of theKorean Peninsula.My delegation is also deeply concerned about the safetyof North Korean nuclear power reactors. The InternationalAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the countries concernedshould pay special attention to the safety issue as well as tothe non-proliferation question in relation to the North Koreannuclear program.There are several urgent issues of a non-military naturewhose solution requires a global approach. Developmentand trade  environment  and human rights are some of them.The post-cold war international environment bothrequires and enables us to place greater emphasis oneconomic and social development. We should now devotethe peace dividend to development efforts. Given the highdegree of interdependence in today’s world  no country isimmune from the consequences of economic difficulties inother countries. Poverty  population problems andenvironmental degradation have become a common threat tothe well-being of mankind. These non-military crises arenow the issues to be addressed with a sense of urgency andcollective endeavour by all nations.The role of the United Nations in this area should bestrengthened. I welcome the recent initiatives to restructureand revitalize the United Nations system in the economicand social field. The structure of the system should bestreamlined for effective mobilization of limited resources.Meanwhile  I believe a substantial increase in developmentresources is necessary to support developmental cooperation.Developed countries are encouraged to enhance their effortsin this area.To achieve a more prosperous world  we need tostrengthen the global free trade regime. The regime of theGeneral Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) was createdshortly after the founding of the United Nations. Theunderlying philosophy was clear: peace and security canbest be guaranteed if buttressed by economic prosperity.During the cold-war period  this global free trade regimeexceeded early expectations by bringing wealth andprosperity to those who embraced it. Now that the cold waris over  the whole world can more fully benefit from it.Our choice is clear. We must strengthen the free tradesystem  by ensuring a successful conclusion of the UruguayRound.Economic development is closely linked with theenvironment issue. It was at the Rio Summit last year thatthe world was keenly awakened to this critical issue. TheSummit emphatically stressed the importance of globalpartnership to achieve environmentally sound and sustainabledevelopment towards the twenty-first century.When we deal with environmental problems  it isimportant to strike a balance between the North and theSouth. The former focuses on the primacy of environmentalprotection while the latter emphasizes the developmentimperatives. We believe that the Commission on SustainableDevelopment is a very appropriate forum for seeking sucha balance and coordinating the implementation of the resultsof the United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment.As a member of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment  the Republic of Korea is ready to do its partin contributing to global action. We hope to help bridge thedivergences between the developed and the developingcountries. We are now in the process of joining theFramework Convention on Climate Change and otherenvironmental agreements.The human rights issue is receiving growing attentionon the international level. This may be a naturalphenomenon as the emerging pluralistic world societyfacilitates the promotion of democracy all over the world.At the World Conference on Human Rights held in Viennain June  I had the privilege to report to the forum that humanrights have finally come of age in Korea. I also pledged ourfirm support for the international movements to promotehuman rights.The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action arethe most significant results of the Conference. We must takethe necessary follow-up measures. In five years we willcommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights of 1948. I hope that ourForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 37generation will be able to meet the expectation set by thosewho produced this Declaration.As we pay due attention to the human rights issue  weshould also concern ourselves with the question of refugeesand disadvantaged groups. Armed conflicts and naturaldisasters around the world raise the need for humanitarianassistance and protection of refugees and displaced persons.The Republic of Korea’s recent accession to the Conventionrelating to the status of refugees testifies to its commitmentto this cause.I attach special significance to the World Summit forSocial Development which will take place in 1995 inCopenhagen. I hope that effective programmes of actionwill be put forward at this Conference to tackle majorimpediments to social development.As the United Nations faces new opportunities andchallenges  it also needs reforms in order to cope with thembetter. This is indeed a tall order.We believe that  with the enormous increase in thegeneral membership of the United Nations  it has becomenecessary to enlarge the Security Council. The question ishow to enlarge the Council without sacrificing itseffectiveness. The creation of a third category  with long-term membership but without the power of veto  coupledwith the expansion of the non-permanent membership  maybe an answer.Concerning the General Assembly  the simplification ofthe committee structure  through the merger of the FourthCommittee and the Special Political Committee  willundoubtedly enhance its efficiency. The rationalization ofthe agenda may be another measure to help enhance thecapability of the General Assembly.My delegation also welcomes the Secretary-General’smeasures to reform the Secretariat and supports him in thiscomplex task. In particular  the recent establishment of theOffice of the Assistant Secretary-General for Inspections andInvestigations is an initial step towards increasing theaccountability of the Secretariat.I note with concern the report of the Secretary-Generalthat refers to the financial status of the United Nations. Wefully agree with him that in order to enable this Organizationto meet the demands of its time  the resources providedshould match its political will. My delegation is in favor ofconstructive discussions during the current session whichwould explore ways and means of alleviating the currentfinancial difficulties of the United Nations.I believe the reform should be based on a properunderstanding of the changed world situation. It should alsoconform with the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations. I hope this process will lead to an efficient andproductive United Nations that is truly capable of fulfillingthe aspirations of mankind by the year 1995  the worldbody’s fiftieth anniversary.Given the vital role that the United Nations has playedin the Republic of Korea  we will observe this occasion withparticular dedication. A national committee will be formedand activities will be coordinated with the Secretariat  withspecial emphasis on conveying the message of the UnitedNations to Korea’s next generation.In the Republic of Korea  the new Government haslaunched a reorientation of foreign policy. Our newdiplomacy places emphasis on universal values - peace democracy  liberty  welfare and human rights. Globalism isat the core of the new diplomacy.Korea is pursuing a more active role in tackling globalissues such as international peace and security  disarmament the eradication of poverty  protection of the environment andefficient utilization of natural resources. It is through suchengagement in global affairs that Korea seeks to play its duepart in the activities of the United Nations designed to makethe world a safer  more just and more prosperous place.The Republic of Korea is now participating in theUnited Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II). It isalso serving a three-year term on the Economic and SocialCouncil. We shall actively seek ways to increase ourcontribution to international organizations  especially thosewithin the framework of the United Nations.In this regard  the Republic of Korea hopes to bettercontribute to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity by having an opportunity to serve on the SecurityCouncil. We hope to receive the encouragement and supportof the world community in these efforts.Democratization  and harmony between nations  are themost important trends of the new world order. By drawingupon them  we have the opportunity to make the future morepeaceful and secure than ever before in the history ofmankind. Our success or failure will depend upon ourunderstanding of the nature of the new order and our abilityto build on it.38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionTo be sure  there are dangers also. We failed with theLeague of Nations. We often experienced bitter frustrationduring the cold war period. Yet  we are on the threshold ofa new beginning. We need to look forward  because thefuture is in our hands. We have to prove to ourselves thatwe are equal to the task."
"91",3878,"KWT",48,1993,"On behalf of Kuwait  it gives me pleasure toconvey to Ambassador Insanally our sincere congratulationson his unanimous election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I take this opportunityto assure him of the support and cooperation of thedelegation of Kuwait in recognition of the close ties thatexist between our two countries. His ability and skill giveus confidence that our deliberation under his leadership willbe fruitful.I am pleased also to pay a tribute to his predecessor His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev  Minister for ForeignAffairs of Bulgaria  for his able and effective stewardship ofthe General Assembly at its previous session.Forty-eighth session - 30 September l993 21On behalf of the Government and the people of Kuwait I wish to extend deepest sympathy and condolences to theGovernment and the people of India with respect to thetragedy resulting from the earthquake in that country  whichclaimed thousands of innocent victims.Kuwait has been following the impressive role of theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Ghali  in developing newmodalities of work for the United Nations that are more inline with the sweeping developments  events and changesthat are taking place in the world. We cannot but put onrecord our appreciation of the Secretary-General’s tirelessefforts and creativity in restructuring and streamlining theworld Organization to reflect in a more meaningful mannerthe realities of the new world situation. He deserves specialcredit for his promotion of the concept of preventivediplomacy.Kuwait takes pride in its backing of the United Nationsand we do support the new approach it pursues despite thevarious difficulties it faces and the accusations levelled at it.The United Nations  at the threshold of its fiftiethanniversary  needs from us every material and moral supporteach and every Member can extend to it. On the other hand the Organization itself should enhance its effectiveness streamline its structure and revitalize its organs  especiallythe Security Council. The Council should reflect moreclosely the new realities of today’s world. It should be morecapable of making and preserving peace and more forcefullyfirm in implementing its resolutions in consonance with theprovisions of the Charter.The United Nations today reflects new world realities as shown by the recent increase in its membership. Kuwaitwelcomes the accession to United Nations membership byEritrea  the Czech Republic  the Slovak Republic  Monaco Andorra and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedoniaand trusts that their accession to the Organization’smembership will consolidate further the efficacy anduniversality of multilateralism.With the end of the cold war and the effectualparticipation by the United Nations in resolving manyinternational problems  the world today is moving steadilytowards the realization of the principle of interdependenceand mutual cooperation between members of theinternational community. The demise of bipolarity and thedisappearance of the barriers that used to separate peoples together with closer contacts through mass communicationmade available by the technological revolution  have madeit possible for every individual to watch world events as theyunfold. Thus peoples are now able to react to and interactwith global issues in an unprecedented manner. A directoutcome of all that is the constant expansion of the web ofinterrelated interests  so that regional security has become aninseparable part of global security. Economic and socialdevelopment issues have now acquired a high priority amongthe concerns of the international community.While we in Kuwait support this new tendency  wemust stress that movement in the new direction should behumane in concept  civilized in ways and means  pragmaticin modalities and realistic in aims. We also stress that theright of both the individual and the community todevelopment should be accorded top priority amonginternational concerns. In this context  we consider that thefirst and foremost human right is the right to secure essentialnecessities of living. Social and economic development atvarious levels is a close second. Kuwait believes thatdevelopment should be addressed collectively and that is themost effective way of ensuring the availability of itsessential ingredients  so that no region or group of nationsshould monopolize world resources at the expense of wholecontinents which remain hostage to the cycle of want andpoverty.We view with satisfaction the new approach of dealingcollectively with hotbeds of tension  as envisioned by theCharter. Here we have in mind the practical and effectiveapplication of the concept of collective security in thecontext of which regional conflicts are viewed as directthreats to world peace and stability and not as mere threatsto regional security. Therefore we demand that any conflictshould be dealt with firmly and expeditiously in order toavoid its worsening  opening the door and allowing terrorismto fly in the face of international legality and flout the newapproach.It is in keeping with this conviction that Kuwait  despiteits difficult circumstances  participates in the United Nationshumanitarian operations in Somalia  our sister country. Suchparticipation bespeaks our commitment to the new UnitedNations approach and our support for putting it into practice.Kuwait considers that the international presence in Somaliais indispensable if the Somali people are to be saved fromdestruction and chaos and if Somalia itself is to survive asan independent country. Indeed  the United Nationspeace-keeping operations  which now total 17  as stated bythe Secretary-General in his report on the work of theOrganization (A/48/1)  require from us all full materialsupport  practical participation and political backing.Accordingly  the Government of Kuwait announces from thispodium that it will voluntarily bear two thirds of the costs ofthe United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session(UNIKOM). This is to demonstrate our firm belief in thetrue role of UNIKOM in safeguarding the security and peacein our region. It represents also a consolidation of theconcept of collective security and the United Nations roletherein.Kuwait believes that the most important underpinningsof the new world approach are: compliance with establishednorms of conduct in international relations; respect for theprinciples of international law; rejection of interference inthe internal affairs of other States; rejection of seeking gainsand concessions at the expense of neighbouring countries;the resolution of problems by dialogue rather than by force;and the renunciation of terrorism as a means of revenge.The Iraqi regime invaded and occupied the State ofKuwait. However  the adamant international will embodiedby the United Nations helped liberate Kuwait in a historicact that led to a clean and tidy elimination of that horrendouscrime. Subsequently  Iraq accepted the consequences of itscrime as set out in Security Council resolution 687 (1991)which contains the provisions of fair and binding solutionsfor the false Iraqi claims regarding Kuwait. It also outlinesthe conditions for dealing with the consequences andunderlying reasons of the Iraqi invasion. The quintessenceof resolution 687  which was accepted unconditionally byIraq  is the reaffirmation of the sovereignty andindependence of Kuwait. It also called for the utilization ofUnited Nations technical assistance in the demarcation ofboundaries between Kuwait and Iraq on the basis of thedocuments exchanged between the two countries inOctober 1963. In implementation of the provisions of thesaid resolution  the United Nations set up a BoundaryDemarcation Commission which successfully completed itswork last May and has issued its final report which containsthe definitive map of land and maritime boundaries betweenKuwait and Iraq (document S/25811).Kuwait commends the technical Boundary DemarcationCommission and pays tribute to its members for theirimpartiality  dedication and patience  especially in the faceof Iraqi accusations and provocations. Kuwait also paystribute to the Security Council for adopting two historicresolutions this year. The first  resolution 806 (1993) extended the terms of reference of UNIKOM into apeace-keeping operation with full powers to prevent Iraqiraids into Kuwait and to put an end to riots instigated by theIraqi regime. Resolution 833 (1993)  unanimously adoptedunder Chapter VII of the Charter  reaffirms the commitmentof the Security Council to guarantee the inviolability of theinternational boundary as demarcated by the United Nationstechnical commission and to consider that boundary as finaland inviolable. By so doing  the Security Council has put anend to an amorphous situation which had lasted for far toolong and which Iraq exploited in a bid to secure territorialexpansion  to exercise regional hegemony  and to gainpolitical  strategic and material concessions at the expense ofKuwait and the other Gulf States. The demarcation of theboundary between Kuwait and Iraq is a major contributionby the international community to the elimination of avolatile hotbed of regional tension which the Iraqi regimeused to exploit in creating an atmosphere of uncertainty andmistrust and which culminated in its vicious invasion of theState of Kuwait.Kuwait responded positively to the Secretary- General’sacceptance of the outcome of the border demarcationprocess. In our response  we also reaffirmed our sincerecooperation with the United Nations despite the fact thatKuwait had voted against some Commission decisions whichdenied Kuwait its rights in Khowr Zhobeir. Iraq  for its part responded with two letters to the Secretary-General. Thefirst in May 1992  following the demarcation of the landboundary  and the second in June 1993 following thedemarcation of the maritime boundary. Both lettersreiterated previous Iraqi claims to what it calls its historicalrights. Iraq also rejected the demarcation results andchallenged the integrity of the United Nations technicalCommission and the validity of its procedures and work.This prompted the Security Council to reprimand Iraqstrongly in a presidential statement which it issued on28 June 1993 and in which it rejected the contents of theaforesaid Iraqi letters and reminded Iraq of its obligationsunder resolution 687 (1991).Iraq has unconditionally accepted resolution 687 (1991)in all its provisions and in so doing has undertaken legal political and moral obligations on which it cannot renege nor can it fail to abide by the consequences of suchobligations because the functions of the technicalCommission were not to the liking of its representative onthe Commission  who had participated fully  for a wholeyear  in its work and deliberations and then chose towithdraw from the Commission when he found himselfunable to produce substantive documents corroboratingIraq’s claims  despite the fact that the Commission pressedhim to do so. The stance of the Iraqi regime constitutes arebellion against Security Council resolutions in defiance ofthe will of the Council and the international community.This represents an egregious departure from the currentglobal mainstream and warrants firm international resolve toreject the Iraqi regime’s practices in both form andsubstance.Forty-eighth session - 30 September l993 23I find it necessary now to emphasize in no uncertainterms that the Iraqi regime remains in its philosophy behaviour  thinking and nature a threat to regional and globalpeace and security. It persists in its aggressiveness while itthumbs its nose at the world community  which continues toreject and isolate it with sanctions. Kuwait has confidencein the wisdom of the Security Council and the ability of itsmembers to fulfil their mandate. We trust that they are keento ensure their collective commitment to the SecurityCouncil resolutions and thus compel the Iraqi regime torecognize that it has no option but to begin the complete anddocumented implementation of all those resolutions to theletter. The Iraqi regime should be made to understand thatits desperate endeavours to have the sanctions lifted will betotally futile unless and until it clearly and legally complieswith the boundary demarcation decisions as set forth in therelevant Council resolutions  especially resolutions 773(1992) and 833 (1993). The Iraqi regime must also meetother basic requirements  such as desisting from the falseclaims made by its official information apparatus whichcontinues to describe Kuwait as part of Iraq and to makeother false claims to so-called historical rights. Thepersistence of and increase in such falsehoods  whichemanate from ranking officials of that regime  is a reversalof and retreat from acceptance of the essence of resolution687 (1991)  which represents Iraq’s commitment to respectKuwait’s sovereignty  independence and internationalborders. We have submitted regular reports to the SecurityCouncil containing complete verbatim excerpts of the claimsmade by senior Iraqi officials and the official Iraqi media.We call upon all Member States of the United Nationsto welcome the relevant Security Council resolutions on theborder demarcation and the inviolability of boundaries asessential components of the regional security structure. Wealso expect Member States to demand that the Iraqi regimerespect all relevant resolutions and link the lifting ofsanctions with its implementation of all Security Councilresolutions  particularly those regarding the boundarydemarcation and the release of prisoners.In this context  I should like to recall that theCooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC)issued at its last March session a statement welcoming thedemarcation of the boundary between Kuwait and Iraq. TheGCC also underscored the demarcation as an underpinningof regional security. Furthermore  the Damascus DeclarationStates  which include the six GCC countries together withEgypt and Syria  issued a statement last June supporting thedemarcation and welcoming the measures taken by theSecurity Council as positive contributions to stability andsecurity at both the regional and international levels.Iraq’s procrastination in implementing the SecurityCouncil resolutions is not limited to the boundarydemarcation but extends to a purely humanitarian issue: therelease of all prisoners  hostages and detainees of Kuwaitiand third country nationals. Those hostages and prisonershave been languishing in Iraqi prisons and detention campsfor some three years now. We trust and hope that theinternational community will bring pressure to bear on theIraqi regime to release every one of those innocent men women and children. Their plight is a stark violation of allthe values and concepts associated with the issue of humanrights. It is also a case that represents a rejection of the newglobal approach  which we believe all here are keen topromote with a view to safeguarding human rights in theworld.Kuwait has explored all possible avenues  using allavailable Arab  Islamic and international channels topersuade the Iraqi regime to comply with the norms ofinternational law  especially its commitments under theGeneva Conventions. To date  the Iraqi regime has made nopositive response to the efforts made by the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on behalf of thosepersons. Most recently  it boycotted a meeting organized bythe ICRC in Geneva last month to discuss the latestdevelopments of this important and urgent humanitarianmatter. The people of Kuwait will feel no relief and enjoyno peace of mind until the very last prisoner is returned tohis or her family and homeland.Iraq has also failed to fulfil its obligation to return theremainder of Kuwaiti property belonging to the private andpublic sectors in our country. Furthermore  it has neitherimplemented Security Council resolutions 707 (1991) and715 (1991)  nor has it desisted from oppressing andsuppressing its own population in the northern and thesouthern regions of the country. It continues to resort to actsof terrorism. We in Kuwait share the Iraqi people’s painand suffering by virtue of the brotherhood between our twopeoples and our everlasting neighbourhood. It is withparticular concern that we see the humiliation of the Iraqipeople as the Iraqi regime pursues its atrocities with totaldisregard for the plight of the Iraqi people and its future.The Iraqi regime has stubbornly rejected the mechanismprovided to alleviate the suffering and hardships of the Iraqipeople by failing to implement Security Council resolutions706 (1991) and 712 (1991). Indeed  responsibility for theplight of the Iraqi people lies squarely on the regime itself which must be held accountable for all the direconsequences of its atrocities.24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionKuwait firmly believes that security in the Gulf regionis part and parcel of world security. Hence  the internationalcommunity is responsible for ensuring respect for thesovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Statesthat fall prey to aggression. Support for States that fallvictim to aggression should also be provided by the worldcommunity when a conflict breaks out. The consolidation ofregional security requires confidence-building among allcountries in the region as a basic premise for attaining thatcommon goal. Here  I should like to underline the close tiesand complete trust that exist among GCC States. Theircooperation is a substantial contribution to the stability andsecurity of the region. Facts on the ground attest to ourcommon endeavours.Kuwait is keen to improve its relations with the IslamicRepublic of Iran on the basis of the principles ofgood-neighbourliness  non-interference in the internal affairsof each other and respect for sovereignty as specified by theGulf Cooperation Council Supreme Council. Having saidthat  Kuwait would like to emphasize the sovereignty of theUnited Arab Emirates over its three islands - Abu Mousa Lesser Tonb and Greater Tonb. Furthermore  Kuwait wishesto put on record its absolute support for all the peacefulmeasures and means to which the United Arab Emiratesresorts in order to regain sovereignty over its islands.Kuwait remains hopeful that dialogue will eventually clearaway all the outstanding matters between the two countries.With that aim in view  Kuwait calls upon the IslamicRepublic of Iran to commit itself to resolving this dispute onthe basis of international law and treaties and to ending it bypeaceful means.In the context of the developments that are taking placewith regard to the Middle East peace process  Kuwaitwelcomes the signing of the accord between the people ofPalestine and Israel to exercise their right to self-determination  to free their territory from occupation and tobuild their own national institutions. In keeping withKuwait’s support for every effort made and every avenuechosen by the Palestinian people to further their cause  theKuwaiti Council of Ministers has issued a statement inwhich it welcomed this first step towards the fullimplementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions.Kuwait views this accord as a first step towards thecreation of a framework to deal with many details - aprocess that will require enormous effort and patience on thepart of the parties directly involved if a successfulconclusion is to be ensured. The accord has indeed usheredin a totally new chapter in the history of the Middle Eastand the question of Palestine. We hope that  in the new era negotiation will replace conflict; dialogue will supersedeconfrontation; and that disputes will be resolved under therule of international law instead of by force of arms  inconsonance with the developing new approach. However the litmus test will be in the steps that will follow and in theachievements that will be made on the other Arab fronts. Inthe final analysis  partial or incomplete peace will not last and a unilateral accord will not lead to a fair andcomprehensive peace. From now on we should not look tothe past with pain and sorrow; rather  we should look to thefuture with hope and confidence.In the end  the success of the peace process hinges ongenuine and serious commitment on the part of Israel toimplement United Nations resolutions  particularly those thatcall for complete and unconditional withdrawal from theSyrian Arab Golan. In the same vein  Israel must withdrawits forces from Southern Lebanon  without any further delay in compliance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978).I take this opportunity to commend the LebaneseGovernment for its remarkable effort to build nationalreconciliation in Lebanon. For its part  Kuwait will continueto back the Lebanese people in their efforts to reconstructand rehabilitate their homeland.The tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovinacontinues unabated. That people is the target of brutalaggression by the Serbs and the Croats  who want to imposea fait accompli and to make territorial gains by imposing agrossly unjust settlement on the Muslims of Bosnia andHerzegovina.We call upon the Security Council and the EuropeanCommunity to take all urgent and effective measures toprevent the aggressor from gaining any reward and to refuseto legitimize the outcome of outright aggression. We appealto the international community to lift the embargo on armssupplies to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina toenable its people to exercise their right to self-defence  as setforth in the Charter of the United Nations.A few days ago  Kuwait was pleased to receive thePresident of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Thevisit was the culmination of Kuwait’s constant support forthe struggle of that Muslim nation  and it demonstrated ourdeep  comprehensive and unwavering commitment to Bosniaand Herzegovina.Kuwait firmly welcomes the agreement that has beenreached between the Government of President de Klerk andthe other parties involved in the negotiations on the futurepolitical and social structure in South Africa. The thrust ofForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 25this accord is to end the system of apartheid  which dividessociety into segments whose rights and prerogatives arebased on the colour of their skin. We applaud this historicagreement  which will put all the people of South Africa irrespective of class  on a totally new humanitarian cause enabling all South Africans to unleash their energies in thebuilding of a new society.For its part  Kuwait has complied fully with all theboycott regulations. Together with other members of theinternational community  it contributed to the creation of theeffective mechanism that eventually led to the agreement inquestion. Now we intend to take the necessary measures onthe national level to lift sanctions in response toMr. Nelson Mandela’s recent appeal from this rostrum. Ouraction will be in line with the global trend towards thecreation of conditions conducive to thefulfilment of the targets set out in the agreement. MyGovernment will review Kuwaiti national legislation thatprohibits dealings with the Government of South Africa  inthe light of the national agreement in South Africa international consensus and the important statement in whichMr. Nelson Mandela called for an end to the economicsanctions while continuing to maintain the ban onconventional and nuclear weapons.We welcome also the proposal by the MultilateralNegotiating Council and the agreement that has been reachedto enable the young Republic of Namibia to have itsterritorial rights in respect of Walvis Bay and the off-shoreislands restored.Parallel to the heart-warming transformations on theworld political arena  there are some significant economicindicators. The issues relating to the world economicsituation are of great concern to my Government. In ourview  top priority must be given  on the internationaleconomic agenda  to the economic plight of the developingcountries  especially the most impoverished among them  sothat they may be helped to alleviate the severe suffering oftheir populations.Convinced that the future of the world and the well-being of its inhabitants require wholesome approaches thatbalance the use of resources with conservation of theenvironment  Kuwait has played an active role in theinternational forums dealing with the questions of theenvironment and energy. We are extremely keen on thepromotion of international cooperation with a view toachieving wider development and removing obstacles thatimpede it. We believe  however  that priority should beaccorded to national and international efforts that aim atachieving overall social and economic development andincreasing political stability.The individual must always be the focus of everydevelopment effort. All development policies should beflexible enough to accommodate the ingenuity and creativepower of all individuals. This is indeed our guarantee ofprogress and excellence in human endeavour. Internationalinstitutions should provide the platform and the frameworkto harness our national efforts towards that end.The new international orientation  in its political andeconomic aspects  presents us with yet another window ofopportunity. As interdependent partners  we should forgeahead together so that  together  we may reap the commonbenefits of the new order."
"92",3924,"LAO",48,1993,"First of all  I would like on behalf of thedelegation of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic tocongratulate you  Sir  most warmly on your unanimouselection to the presidency of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations at its forty-eighth session. We are familiarwith your great diplomatic skills and your patience andperseverance and therefore feel certain that you will guidethe work of this session towards a successful conclusion.12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionI would also like to convey our wholeheartedcongratulations to the Secretary-General of our Organization His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the tirelessand efficient efforts he has exerted in discharging hisimportant responsibilities over the past year. We wish himevery success in the accomplishment of his complex anddifficult tasks at the head of our Organization.The Lao delegation also extends a welcome to theStates that have recently become Members of the UnitedNations: the Principality of Andorra  Eritrea  The FormerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia  the Principality ofMonaco  the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic.Their presence among us certainly enhances the universalityof the United Nations.The present session of the General Assembly has begunat a time when the international situation as a whole isevolving in a positive direction  conducive both to dialogueand to cooperation between States. None the less  thegenuine peace that peoples the world over have so longawaited has not been attained. From East to West  fromNorth to South  sizeable and often tragic conflicts keepbreaking out. It is true that some of them have beensuccessfully resolved  but many others  of an ethnic  racialand religious nature  are arising in various parts of the worldand are raging unabated  rendering the world situation fragileand precarious.In Europe  the situation in the Republic of Bosniaremains tense and even explosive  and could threaten bothregional and global peace and security. In flagrant defianceof international humanitarian law  crimes such as ""ethniccleansing""  mass rapes  torture and deliberate bombing ofcivilian targets continue to be committed against the innocentBosnian people. Given the gravity of the problem  all theparties to this painful conflict should show the courage andthe sense of realism necessary to reach a just and equitablepolitical settlement freely and as quickly as possible  andthereby contribute to the restoration of peace  security andnormalcy in that country and in the entire region.In South Africa  the conclusion of an agreement on thedate of the first multiracial elections and the establishmentof the Transitional Executive Council constitute an importantstage in the efforts of the people of that country to build aunited  democratic and non-racial South Africa.Nevertheless  the overall situation in the country remainsfragile. Sadly  we still witness an upsurge of acts ofviolence and of discord in many parts of the country.Therefore  political  social and racial order must be restoredso that the reforms thus begun can continue  at anaccelerated pace.In Somalia  the evolution of the situation is stilldisquieting. It is vital that the international community findjust and lasting solutions to this problem in accordance withthe rights and aspirations of the Somali people.In the Middle East  an important step has been taken inthe quest for a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement ofthe Israel-Arab conflict. The Lao delegation is pleased atthe mutual recognition between the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO) and Israel  as well as the Gaza-Jerichoautonomy agreement which was signed in Washington on 13September 1993. We hope that that agreement will help thevarious parties to the conflict to establish a climate ofmutual trust and in this way to find a comprehensivesettlement that is just and honourable for all  in theframework of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and338 (1973) and other relevant United Nations resolutions.In western Asia  despite the signing last March atIslamabad of a peace agreement between the Afghan partiesin conflict  Afghanistan remains the theatre of civil war. Inthe interests of national concord among Afghans  of thereconstruction of their homeland and of the peace andsecurity of the entire region  we appeal to all the partiesconcerned to put an end to their conflicts.On the Korean peninsula  there is still an atmosphere ofmutual distrust in the military sphere. We welcome thetireless efforts made by all the countries concerned including the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  toensure that the Korean peninsula is a nuclear-weapon-freezone. It would be in the highest interest of the entire north-east Asian region and of the world if peace  stability andcooperation were to be achieved.In South-East Asia  the countries of the region generallyenjoy good relations  and this is opening up a new era forthe broadening of their cooperation  day by day  in manyfields of shared interest. For the first time my own country the Lao People’s Democratic Republic  participated as anobserver in the Ministerial Meeting of the countries of theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  heldrecently in Singapore. We are pleased at this importantmeeting with the countries of ASEAN which has given newimpetus to our joint efforts to promote cooperation indifferent fields among the peoples of the region.Our delegation is also gratified by the historic eventsthat have taken place in Cambodia  our immediateneighbour. The promulgation of the new constitution by HisMajesty King Samdech Norodom Sihanouk and theestablishment of a new Government in that country will openthe way to peace  stability and national harmony  thusForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 13contributing to the strengthening of cooperation andfriendship in the region.In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic  1992 was ayear of many achievements. Our gross national productincreased by 7 per cent over 1991; our rate of inflation is 10per cent  compared to 14 per cent in 1991; and the rate ofexchange in general has stabilized. In other words  themulti-ethnic Lao people is seeing a gradual improvement inits standard of living. From a political standpoint  ourcountry has experienced solid stability  and we intendvigorously to continue our effort to promote democracy andour people’s collective decision-making power  inaccordance with our country’s historical and cultural realitiesand with its level of economic and social development.At the beginning of 1993  the National Assemblyendorsed our national plan for socio-economic developmentthrough the year 2000. Under this plan  the LaoGovernment has set for itself two major objectives.The first is aimed at meeting the most urgent dailyneeds of our population  especially of the ethnic minoritiesthat live in the mountainous regions; bringing about agradual rise in their standard of living  both material andcultural; and ensuring political and social stability in thecountry.The second is to promote the development ofagriculture and forestry in concert with the development ofservices and of industry  especially in the field ofhydropower  one of the areas of potential growth in ourcountry; to develop more forcefully our market economy create internal savings  stabilize State finances and worksteadily towards financial autonomy; and to strengthen ourefforts at development of human resources in order to createconditions conducive to national development in theimmediate future and for the years to come.In order to realize this plan  we will endeavour toachieve an average growth rate of 8 per cent  to maintaineconomic and financial balance  to preserve stability ofprices and of rates of exchange  and to keep the inflationrate no higher than 10 per cent per year. The Governmentwill continue its policy of broadening cooperation with othercountries and in this regard hopes to have the support andassistance in all respects of the international community.According to the United Nations World EconomicSurvey  production at the international level should increaseby only 1.5 per cent this year and 3 per cent in 1994 compared with .6 per cent in 1992: a very weak recovery ofgrowth in general terms. This weak recovery  especially inthe industrialized countries  entails a continued decline in thedemand for export goods from the developing countries anda more abrupt decline in the prices of their raw materials which are of vital importance to their economies. Bearingin mind the interdependence of the components of the globaleconomy  it would be wiser for the developed countries toattach greater importance to the developing countries and tocommit themselves truly to international cooperation foundedupon revitalization of the economy and development in theinterests of all.The problem of the environment  because of itsimportance in its relation to development  is still at theforefront of global concerns. We are still witnessing thepollution of our air  seas and oceans  abrupt climate changes a steady depletion of the ozone layer  and desertification inmany parts of the world. It is time for the developedcountries and the developing countries to strengthen theirinternational cooperation effectively and to take forcefulmeasures to protect the environment  in accordance withtheir respective responsibilities and capacities and with thewell-known Agenda 21  adopted in Rio de Janeiro  Brazil  in1992.As for the drug problem  my delegation is pleased thatthe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly will devotespecial meetings to this subject. We intend to contribute toits consideration in view of the importance of this problemand its implications in the world at large and in our owncountry.The question of promoting human rights andfundamental freedoms still occupies a central place on theinternational agenda. Because it is so important and sosensitive  this question requires serious consideration on thebasis of the principles of non-selectivity  objectivity andimpartiality. To this we should add that the historic cultural  political  social  economic and religious realities ofeach country need to be taken into account. From thisstandpoint  we are on the whole satisfied with the resultsobtained at the recent World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna  Austria  from 14 to 25 June 1993.With the end of bipolarization  it is important thatStates place their hopes in the United Nations  which is trulyintended to be universal and institutional  capable ofmaintaining international peace and security  of promotingdevelopment and of having law and justice prevail the worldover. So that it can live up to its new responsibilities  theOrganization must also build its new structure. Arevitalized  restructured United Nations made moredemocratic in its decision-making process  particularly in the14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionSecurity Council  will certainly be able to play its rightfulcentral role in the management of international affairs.States and peoples all over the world  large and small alike powerful or weak  rich or poor  could benefit greatly fromsuch a development."
"93",3967,"LBN",48,1993,"It gives me pleasure to start out by congratulating you onyour election as President of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations at its forty-eighth session. I should also liketo pay tribute to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr.Stoyan Ganev  for his able stewardship of the previoussession of the Assembly.Also  I should like to set on record our appreciation forthe outstanding efforts of the Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to attain the goals ofthe United Nations and to fulfil the growing responsibilitiesentrusted to the world body in behalf of world peace. Wedo note that the changes sweeping across the world todayimpose upon the United Nations additional responsibilitieswhich the President  Government and people of Lebanonview with hope and optimism. Therefore  we are all calledupon to provide the United Nations with the necessarymeans for fulfilling its expanding mandates. By the sametoken  the United Nations should for its part streamline itsoperations in order to adapt to the demands of the future.I take this opportunity to welcome the Member Stateswhich have recently been admitted to the membership of theUnited Nations. This is yet another indication of theuniversality of this Organization and a confirmation of thegrowing need for it.As the current decade brings us closer to the end ofanother century in the history of mankind  we now have aclearer picture of the issues and concerns that dominate thethinking of the peoples of the world. In dealing with thespectrum of these questions  we need to rely first andforemost on rational thinking. The wealth of experiencedrawn from the lessons learned from the numerous conflictsthat have taken place throughout this century has taught usthat the path of peace is  in the final analysis  the optimalcourse to follow  as all other avenues have proven futile.The era of a divided world based on blocs and polarization which severely strained international relations andprecipitated crises for many decades  is now over.Therefore  the world is now ready to develop a universalvision of mankind based on a universal code of ethics andset of human rights. The United Nations Organization which has long suffered from rivalries that paralysed it andplaced severe constraints on its potential  is increasinglycalled upon  in an unprecedented fashion  to engage inpeace-keeping activities. Despite the fact that its currentoperations are somewhat different from the conventionalfunctions originally envisioned for the Organization  itsoperations demonstrate the growing need for this world bodyto lend confidence and credibility to the multinational effortin dealing with challenges and conflicts in a fair and soundmanner.We believe that understanding between States andpeoples hinges upon the preservation of democracy andhuman rights. Such understanding would in turn contributesignificantly to the elimination of regional and globaldisputes  in keeping with a major principle set forth in theCharter of the United Nations. Here  I would be remiss ifI did not recall Lebanon’s contribution to the drafting of theCharter as well as of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  for Lebanon was a member of the SpecialCommittee entrusted with the drafting of both instruments.Lebanon’s well-known tradition of firm commitment tothe principles of democracy  freedom and human rights  andits success in upholding those principles despite the dangersthat threatened it for many years  remains faithful to thebasic pillars upon which our pluralistic  open and creativesociety rests. Lebanon  which has withstood the trying yearsof its plight  is now facing its critical challenges with thevigour of renewed and consolidated national unity. It has12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionincorporated those principles into the fabric of its identity.Thus  the new constitution proclaims that Lebanon is""Arab in identity and affiliation  a founder and activemember of the League of Arab States  fully committedto its covenants; and a founding and active member ofthe United Nations Organization  fully committed to itsCharter and the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. The State is an embodiment of all theseprinciples  in all areas and spheres wherever they apply without exception.""In view of its singular experience  Lebanon deservesyour support and a pledge from the world community notonly to provide material assistance and help in thereconstruction of what the civil war has destroyed  but tobolster the Lebanese system. The need for the example setby this system is all the more urgent in our world today given the many ethnic and religious conflicts currentlyraging in various regions.Lebanon  with its time-honoured tradition ofcoexistence  moderation and tolerance emanating from theselofty human values  can indeed be a living example to thoseeven in advanced societies who are searching for asuccessful formula for social harmony. This is especiallytrue now that Lebanon has put its tragedy behind it andembarked on a course of accord and concord.The great majority of the Lebanese lived through theyears of war and bore the brunt of its devastation withouthaving any real belief in bellicosity or its causes.Throughout the war  some one million students continued toattend their schools and colleges as if to express  throughpursuit of education  their rejection of war. The samemajority continued to discharge its duties towards societyand the State in many parts of the country. Even ordinarycivilian crimes did not rise noticeably during the war.All this confirms that the Lebanese  who settled thisproblem a long time ago  not only in texts and precedents but also in their daily routines and life-styles  are proud tobe able to present to the world  after their long suffering  atrue example fashioned from first-hand experience of theresilience of human nature with its wealth of intellect andvivid diversity.In our common interest we must all seek to safeguardsuch a legacy and protect it from violence. This isparticularly true in the case of the Middle East region  whichhas traditionally and historically suffered from theinterference of foreign powers and the struggles of interestand conflict that transcended national frontiers  and even theentire region  to pose a threat to world peace in its entirety.Given the magnitude and intensity of the conflicts thathave ravaged Lebanon soil  the survival of our countryproves that the Lebanese nation is too strong to beeliminated and that it has long-established traditions that willstand the test of time. The people of Lebanon hasdemonstrated great stamina and resilience in the face ofoverwhelming odds.Lebanon is committed to realizing its aspirations anddetermined to achieve progress within the context of theopportunities offered by the modern world. If the armedconflicts and hostilities of recent decades have drained manyof our resources  our potential and our capabilities musthenceforth be channelled to face up to and overcome thecommon challenges that confront mankind everywhere.To this end  the Lebanese Government is striving torestore Lebanon to its special position in the community ofcivilized nations. The emphasis is on achievements that willmake the Lebanese individual capable of facing the future.Lebanon considers that its major loss  perhaps  has been themigration of many of its most talented and highly skilledyoung people. One of our major concerns now is to createfavourable conditions that will attract them back. It is ourhope that our human resources will be highly instrumentalin expediting the reconstruction of the better society we allaspire to see: a society that enjoys peace  democracy andprosperity.Lebanon  whose people suffered enormous hardshipduring the dark years of war  fully recognizes andappreciates the various tragedies and pains that afflict someparts of the world today. As we reaffirm our permanentcommitment to peace and to the Charter of the UnitedNations  and to the tenets that emanate from them  we stressour adherence to and respect for an integrated system ofvalues which includes human rights  freedom and dignity.Indeed  this should be the ultimate goal of every undertakingand endeavour.Early on  the United Nations took cognizance of thesituation in Lebanon  as attested to by the many resolutionsadopted by the Security Council on the Lebanese crisis.Some people may not be aware that between 1968 and 1993more than 80 United Nations resolutions and statements onLebanon were adopted. This is a large number ofresolutions in comparison with other crises. Lebanon has animposing file indeed with both the General Assembly andthe Security Council. If the sheer volume of United NationsForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 13official records on Lebanon is compared with that of thedocuments submitted to ordinary courts of law  it willbecome clear instantly that  on the scales of internationaljustice  the weight of evidence tips the scales in favour ofLebanon. Justice and law have been  and continue to be  onthe side of Lebanon. Notwithstanding  the Lebanese havealways been deeply disappointed by the fact that politicalinterests have continued to outweigh justice and the rule oflaw  and led to the application of double standards regardlessof the scores of resolutions that have been adopted right herein the United Nations in support of the legitimate demandsof Lebanon  a country that sought effective recourse fromthe United Nations.All those United Nations resolutions have called forending violence in Lebanon and for respecting itssovereignty and territorial integrity  and thus have reaffirmedthe country’s political independence and nationalsovereignty. Therefore  we must give credit to theOrganization for its initial favourable response in regard toLebanon  especially in terms of the need to implementSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978) and the establishmentof the United Nations peace-keeping force in southernLebanon. I avail myself of this opportunity to recognize theeffective role played by the United Nations Interim Force inLebanon (UNIFIL). May I pay tribute to the many UnitedNations personnel who have made sacrifices  including theloss of life  in the line of duty in southern Lebanon. Tothose contingents and to the friendly countries that havecontributed troops  we express our deep gratitude.However  as we look forward to the future - havingtaken firm and crucial steps towards restoring normalcy  withthe substantial and effective help of Syria in disarming themilitias  ending the internecine fighting and restoring theauthority of the State  we feel we have the right to call uponthe United Nations at a time when its role is being redefinedin consonance with current global changes  to act decisivelyin Lebanon. More specifically  we expect the UnitedNations to work forcefully for the implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978)  and to ensureIsrael’s total withdrawal to the internationally recognizedboundaries. It is not an overstatement to point out thatpeace in Lebanon has been  and continues to be  the sinequa non for stability in the Middle East and for theestablishment of a just and comprehensive peace in theentire region. Any peace arrangements will remain fragileand incomplete should the international community chooseto tolerate the continuation of a situation that threatensLebanon with potentially explosive disputes.The Lebanese have agreed by consensus on a newformula for national reconciliation  which was worked out in1989 at Taif in Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabiaplayed the principal role in working out that formula  whichlater became Lebanon’s constitution. Furthermore  SaudiArabia  in keeping with a long-standing tradition  togetherwith other members of the Gulf Cooperation Councilcontinues to donate substantial assistance towards thereconstruction of Lebanon. With the same goal in mind  theLebanese Government undertook the implementation of arehabilitation programme in all spheres of life and in anunmistakable atmosphere of international confidence.Gradually  Lebanon began to restore its traditional  regionaland international role. This permitted Lebanese energies tobe unleashed  and gave rise to creative initiatives forreconstructing and developing the country.In all this  Lebanon has faced up to occupation andviolence  by adopting a stance anchored in the Charter of theUnited Nations and the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. Our country  which draws its strength from thesteadfastness and resilience of its people  has reaffirmed timeand again its right to live in dignity and to ensure thefreedom of its territory. The Lebanese Government isheavily engaged in the reconstruction effort and theenhancement of civilian life in order to promote stabilitythroughout the region.Israeli acts of aggression  which have clear objectivesand purposes  have been met by the Lebanese with a highsense of responsibility  solidarity and internal unity. Ourunchanging  spontaneous response is insistence on peace andon securing the security and progress of our country  whichhas paid dearly for having been used as an arena to settleaccounts among conflicting parties.An insistence on peace was the driving force thatprompted the Lebanese to return immediately to theirvillages and farms following the most recent Israeliaggression. They pitched tents in front of their demolishedhomes  thus demonstrating their deep attachment to the landand their loyalty to the territory and its bounties.The true nature of the Al-Khiyam detention camp where Israeli military authorities hold more than 200Lebanese citizens without any legal grounds  is well knownto United Nations officials and to Member States. Indeed the case of those detainees is common knowledge in theinternational media. Moreover  100 other Lebaneseprisoners are being held in various prisons inside Israel.Despite the repeated appeals by the Commission on HumanRights and Amnesty International and the demands made by14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionthe Lebanese Government and human-rights societies inLebanon and the rest of the Arab world  the Israeliauthorities refuse to release them. Furthermore  for morethan eight years  Israel has denied the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross as well as family membersaccess to visit those prisoners.It is high time indeed for Israel to respond to theappeals of international bodies by releasing those hostagespromptly  thus putting an end to their drawn out sufferingand the agony of their families. In fact  Israel is duty-boundto do so in compliance with the relevant international treatiesand conventions.The positive developments now taking place daily inLebanon are the most articulate expression of the Lebaneserefusal to permit their country once again to be a victim ofthe Middle East conflict at a time when the winds of peaceare starting to blow towards the region. Lebanon yearns forpeace and has consistently opted for peace throughout itshistory. In fact  Lebanon can thrive only in an atmosphereof peace and stability. Indeed  its role in its own region andin the world at large cannot be performed in the midst ofviolence and war. Lebanon believes that the Middle Eastregion  if it enjoys a just and comprehensive peace  will bein a position to contribute incalculable services to mankind.All the peoples of the region  including the Lebanese  haveenormous potential  backed by a great cultural heritage anddiverse capabilities. Energies and resources that have longbeen squandered on war could then be harnessed in theservice of social and economic development as we stand onthe threshold of the twenty-first century with all its promiseof achievements to come.Against this backdrop  and in view of the regional andinternational developments that have made it possible toinitiate negotiations with Israel  Lebanon participated inthose negotiations two years ago despite the fact that partsof its territory have been under occupation as a result of anact of aggression committed by Israel in 1978 - and notbecause of a state of war with Israel. Lebanon’s just casefirmly rests on a series of United Nations resolutionsadopted over the past 15 years  all of which demand Israel’swithdrawal and define the necessary means and modalitiesrequired to achieve it.If Israel uses the security of its northern border as apretext  we would argue that all the measures taken byIsrael  including the occupation of territory  have contributedto the disruption of security. In fact  Lebanon and theinternational community are more than ever convinced thatthe only way to ensure regional security is to end theoccupation of Lebanese territory and desisting fromtampering with the security and safety of its population.Forty-five years of unabated disputes  conflicts andwars have created certain outlooks. Changing such outlookswill require great political courage and deep understandingon the part of those who are interested in peace. Large-scaledirect support will also be needed  along with innovativethinking to shake ourselves loose from traditional frames ofmind.More than ever before  the Middle East sorely needsbrave  innovative approaches if it is to attain a firm andlasting peace. Lebanon  which is participating in the peacetalks in order to liberate its lands and lay the foundations ofa just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East  wishesto point out the following:First  Lebanon demands the total withdrawal of Israelfrom all occupied Lebanese territories under SecurityCouncil resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978). TheLebanese armed forces will assume full responsibility forsecurity in the southern and western regions should Israelimplement the provisions of those two resolutions.Secondly  Lebanon  which believes in and seeks peace would be among the first beneficiaries of a just peace as itexpands to encompass the entire region. Along with itsArab brethren  Lebanon will be an active participant inmaking peace and in supporting its development andadvocating its consolidation as the underpinning of life in theMiddle East.Thirdly  Lebanon which has had very painfulexperiences as a result of the policy of the singling out ofcertain countries and imposing partial solutions  believes thatpeace is indivisible  especially in cases where issues areclosely interrelated  as is the case in the Middle East. Wealso believe that unilateral and partial arrangements arebound to give rise to nothing but new disputes and conflicts.In this context  I should like to affirm  on the basis ofthe object-lessons learnt from our common experience  thatthere can be no firm and lasting peace in the Middle Eastwithout Lebanon and Syria. The accord reached betweenIsrael and the Palestinians will remain a mere single stepunless it is quickly complemented by substantive solutionson the other Arab tracks. Lebanon  which is extremelylimited in the size of its territory  has a delicate populationcomposition and scant economic resources  cannot providea solution for Palestinians who have been uprooted fromtheir land. The responsibility for returning the PalestiniansForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 15to their homeland and for finding a satisfactory solution totheir status remains within the competence of theinternational community. If we really wish to put an endonce for all to the chapters of pain and anguish in theMiddle East  then the cause of the Palestinians should beaddressed in such a manner that may ensure for them adecent life commensurate with their legitimate aspirationsand the aspirations of all our countries after human rights.Fourthly  in order to achieve peace  Lebanon is willingto cooperate fully with the two co-sponsors of the peaceconference  particularly the United States of America  toreach a comprehensive and just solution that wouldsafeguard the right of all parties to permanent peace  and putan end once and for all to conflicts in the region. Towardsthat end  Lebanon stands ready to assume its due share ofthe responsibility."
"94",4014,"LBR",48,1993,"I wish to congratulateyou  Sir  on your election to the presidency of theforty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are surethat your vast experience  personal qualifications  andintimate knowledge of the manifold problems confronting theinternational community will serve you well in theperformance of your duties. Please be assured of the fullestcooperation and support of the Liberian delegation.We extend a deserving tribute to your predecessor Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria  for the efficient and ablemanner in which he handled the affairs of the Assemblyduring the past year. His decisiveness and fairness paid offgreatly in producing the many results which are a positiveoutgrowth of the debate of the previous session.Our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  alsodeserves special commendation for his persistent and tirelessForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 5efforts in trying to secure a world that is both peaceful andjust and sustained by an equitable economic order. Indeed his devotion and singular commitment to the principles andpurposes of the Organization have brought renewedconfidence on the prospects of achieving mankind’s dreamof a stable international environment.We seize this opportunity to welcome thenewly-admitted Members of the United Nations. It is ourfervent hope that they will make a meaningful contributionto our common search for global peace and security.Over the past three years Liberia’s external relations  inresponse to domestic imperatives  have focused on theachievement of four primary objectives: first  to ensure thatinternational opinion is sensitized to the serious effects ofthe civil war in Liberia and the need for internationalsupport to end the conflict; secondly  to effect themobilization of humanitarian and emergency relief assistancefor the war-ravaged population; thirdly  to help sustain theconsensus on the situation in Liberia within the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)  and tosecure broader international acceptance of the ECOWASpeace plan as the best possible formula for resolving theLiberian civil strife; and  fourthly  to enhance the peaceprocess itself by neutralizing attempts to resolve the Liberianconflict through the military victory of a faction  whileencouraging a negotiated political settlement of thisseemingly intractable conflict.In pursuit of these objectives  the Interim Governmentof National Unity (IGNU) has participated in 25 peace talksand a great number of other consultations with the Liberianfactions  the leaders of subregional  regional andinternational organizations  and foreign Governments toenhance the prospects for peace in Liberia.It is now my pleasing duty to inform the Assembly thatthe Interim Government of National Unity  the NationalPatriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and the United LiberationMovement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO) signed apeace accord in Cotonou  the Republic of Benin  on 25 July1993. The Cotonou Agreement is a significant breakthroughin the quest for durable peace in Liberia.By agreeing on a process beginning with a cease-fireand leading to disarmament  demobilization and then freeand fair elections  we Liberians have all finally decided onhow power will be acquired in our country. The Agreementis therefore a great victory for the people of Liberia in theirefforts to secure a democratic future.As my delegation stated on 10 August 1993 during theSecurity Council’s consideration of the report (S/26200) ofthe Secretary-General on Liberia  the Cotonou Agreement isalso a victory for the leaders and peoples of the memberStates of the Economic Community of West African States who took a bold and courageous initiative to resolve asecurity question in their subregion  with the active supportand cooperation of the Organization of African Unity(OAU).On that occasion  we went on to state  and we hererepeat  that the United Nations must also share in thisvictory. In this vein we wish to register our appreciation toSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his consuminginterest in the crisis in Liberia. We thank him immenselyfor his thorough and incisive reports on Liberia  whichenhanced the decisiveness of the Security Council withrespect to resolutions 788 (1992)  813 (1993) and866 (1993).We also commend the Secretary-General’s SpecialRepresentative for Liberia  Mr. Trevor Gordon-Somers; theOAU Eminent Person for Liberia  former ZimbabweanPresident the Rev. Dr. Canaan Banana; and the formerExecutive Secretary of ECOWAS  Dr. Abbas Bundu; whoserelentless collaborative efforts helped to make the CotonouAgreement a reality.The people of Liberia will for ever remain grateful tothe gallant men and women of the ECOWAS Cease-fireMonitoring Group (ECOMOG). Enduring thanks go to theWest African States which have made troop contributions tothe peace-keeping effort: Nigeria  Ghana  Guinea  SierraLeone  Gambia  Mali and Senegal.During the process of negotiating the CotonouAgreement  the Interim Government  largely a coalition ofvarious political parties and interest groups representing thevast majority of our citizenry who do not bear arms demanded the disarmament of all combatants as a sine quanon for the restoration of peace. The armed factionsconceded to this demand on condition that a new transitional authority  to include the Interim Government  beorganized within a framework acceptable to them. Thisconcession  hardly an unreasonably high price to pay fordisarmament and peace  was made. The CotonouAgreement  then  divided into a military and a politicalcomponent  encompasses provisions attending a trade-off.The political demands are far-reaching  in that theyrequire more than a simple reconfiguration of the InterimGovernment within the context of power-sharing. The6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionLiberian National Transitional Government  being a newcreation  requires the divestiture of power from the currentinterim authorities. On the other hand  the warring factions divested of their arms and demobilized  will equally cease toexist as fighting forces.To strengthen the Agreement  or otherwise reinforce theconfidence of the parties  it was agreed that the installing ofthe Transitional Government  and the beginning of thedisarmament process  each being a precondition for theother  would ensue simultaneously. However  this demandfor concurrent processes harbours the prospective danger thatan achievement lag in either component  military or political may tend to undermine confidence in the entire peaceprocess and thereby threaten the understanding.What  then  does each phase require  and how muchand in what area has progress been made?The implementation of the political phase of theAccords has largely been completed  and on schedule. TheInterim Government has complied with all the concessionsrequired for disarmament so that Liberians may live freefrom fear and have a chance of being at peace with eachother.A five-member Council of State has been formed toconstitute the executive authority of the TransitionalGovernment. The legislature  the judiciary  and theElections Commission are being reorganized or otherwisemade to reflect the inclusive intent of the transitional period.The Liberian National Transitional Government is waiting tobe installed once the disarmament process begins. Pactasunt servanda. What  then  is the requirement for thedisarmament process to begin? The following paragraphfrom the report of the Secretary-General on Liberia  of 4August 1993  correctly reflects the specific provisions of theagreement and the factor motivating them. TheSecretary-General states:""Given the level of mistrust existing betweenECOMOG and the NPFL  special measures weredevised to make ECOMOG acceptable to all parties inoverseeing encampment  disarmament anddemobilization. It was agreed that ECOMOG would beexpanded to include new troops from countries notalready participating in ECOMOG. These troops wouldbe drawn from other ECOWAS countries  as well asfrom OAU countries outside of the West Africansubregion. In addition  it was proposed that UnitedNations military observers would monitor and verifythe cease-fire as well as the implementation of theencampment  disarmament and demobilizationprovisions of the Agreement."" (S/26200  para. 7)A month later  in September 1993  theSecretary-General  recognizing that these preparations fordisarmament would not keep pace with the politicalarrangements  advanced a most constructive proposal in hisreport of 9 September 1993 as follows:""... The Agreement forecasts that thetransitional government would be establishedapproximately one month after the signing of theagreement  concomitant with the commencement ofthe disarmament process. While this process isalready somewhat behind schedule  the establishmentof the transitional government is crucial toreinforcing national reconciliation. I therefore urgeECOMOG to move quickly in commencing thedisarmament process  with monitoring provided bythe advance team of UNOMIL  even before fulldeployment of the expanded ECOMOG andUNOMIL. In this regard  it is encouraging to notethat NPFL expressed to the planning mission itsreadiness to accept troops from among the presentECOMOG contingent to be deployed in NPFL areas.With the expected full deployment of the advancedteam of United Nations military observers in thecoming days  the disarmament process could possiblybegin immediately thereafter."" (S/26422  para. 40)Last week in Monrovia  Dr. Amos Sawyer  thePresident of the Interim Government of National Unity publicly assured the Liberian people that if the armedfactions accept the Secretary-General’s proposal and allowthe disarmament process to commence  he wouldimmediately transfer power to the transitional authorities.However  the unwillingness of any of the armed factions toavail itself of the proposal need not necessarily be viewed asreflective of a lack of will or suggestive of bad faith.Scrupulous adherence to the actual terms of the Agreementmay ultimately enhance the prospects for genuine peace however slow and exacting the process may prove to be.Meanwhile  efforts continue to get the full complement ofadditional ECOMOG forces and United Nations observers.The Government of Liberia wishes to thank the UnitedStates Government for its contribution to the Trust Fund ofthe Economic Community of West African States tofacilitate the expansion of ECOMOG and assist the forcescurrently in place. We renew our request to other friendlyGovernments to respond to the Secretary-General’s appealfor contributions to the Trust Fund as a means of advancingthe peace process in Liberia.Forty-eighth session - 13 October l993 7We are convinced that the enabling conditions fordisarmament will be expeditiously created and that theTransitional Government will be installed shortly. The factthat the cease-fire continues to hold and that the parties arelargely cooperating with each other is a basis for continuingconfidence in the commitment of the parties.Our hearts are touched by the great outpouring ofempathy and good will from countries that have contributedto the well-being of the people of Liberia since thebeginning of our conflict. Through the specialized agenciesof the United Nations system  as well as many privatevolunteer and non-governmental organizations  they haveenabled many Liberians to find life worth living because ofthe genuine concern that has been demonstrated. Our thanksgo to all those who continue to make a difference in thelives of our people.The Transitional Government  when installed withauthority spanning the entire country  will stand in need ofextensive relief assistance to respond effectively to themonumental human suffering existing in some parts ofLiberia. Our delegation envisages an upsurge in the demandfor humanitarian assistance  with food and medical suppliesbeing the obvious priorities. We appeal to the internationalcommunity to stand ready to assist the people of Liberia fora reasonable period  as it will take time before theadvantages of peace are translated into real improvements inthe lives of the people.A successful disarmament exercise will be thelong-awaited signal for our people in refugee camps toreturn home. Indeed  the Transitional Government will needthe cooperation and assistance of men of good willeverywhere in order to succeed in the awesome tasks ofrepatriation  resettlement and rehabilitation. The gruesomecivil war devastated the economy of the country  paralysedvital social services and destroyed basic infrastructure. It issignificant that the political division of the country hasprevented a coordinated needs survey to fully assess thereconstruction demand.It is important  also  that the Transitional Governmenthas the task of helping to prepare the country for free andfair elections  to be held under international supervision andmonitoring within six to seven months. This is hardly idealtiming  but it proved to be the best that a negotiatedsettlement could produce. Clearly  the internationalcommunity has a moral obligation to help the people ofLiberia succeed in this endeavour  since the very thought offailure attending these exercises is  in itself  a nightmare.The Interim Government has striven  even in thethroes of a civil war  to maintain law and order and operatewith a Constitution which affirms civil liberties and respectfor fundamental human rights. We  as men of conscience condemn and stand in total opposition against those who  inthe midst of the war  trained their weapons on helplesscivilians. We therefore thank the Secretary-General forresponding with dispatch to the Interim Government’srequest for the establishment of a commission of inquiry toinvestigate the atrocities committed since the commencementof the civil war. We believe that the Wako CommissionReport has contributed to amassing the evidence required inorder for justice to be done to the perpetrators of the Harbelarea massacre and other massacres.Liberia’s tragic circumstances  coupled with theefforts to resolve the conflict  provide useful lessons thatcould be most instructive for the international community.The Liberian peace process has shown that  even in the faceof scarce resources  member States of the EconomicCommunity of West African States have contained a securitythreat in their subregion by marshalling the requisite politicalwill to do so. The dispatch and maintenance of a peace-keeping force in Liberia by the leaders of ECOWASrepresent the finest hour for Africa in its efforts to maintainpeace and security on the continent.The Liberian experience has also demonstrated thatpeace initiatives that are conceived and implemented withina subregional context  while supported and assisted byregional and international organizations  are a practicalapproach which stands the best chance of success in conflictresolution. The States closest to the conflict are likely tohave a deeper understanding of  and appreciation for  theinterplay of forces within the milieu. It is against thisbackground that the Government of Liberia gave its fullestsupport for  and endorsement of  the establishment of amechanism for conflict prevention  management andresolution within the Organization of African Unity.We welcome the establishment of the Department ofPeace-keeping Operations in the Secretariat for the planningand coordination of all United Nations peace-keepingactivities  confident that it will countenance greater regionalinvolvement in conflict management  buttressed by supportfrom the United Nations.On the question of Somalia  the Government ofLiberia welcomes the bold and courageous efforts by theUnited Nations to resolve the tragic situation there and bringpeace to that country. We deplore the killing of UnitedNations peace-keepers in Mogadishu  and we support the8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionefforts by this world body to bring to justice thoseresponsible for such acts. The implementation of the AddisAbaba Accords  signed on 27 March 1993  at the nationalreconciliation conference  offers the best hope for a peacefultransition to a pacified and democratic State of Somalia. Wetherefore urge the Somali factions to respect and implementthat agreement.Regarding South Africa  we welcome the currentmulti-party negotiations in that country as the most inclusiveforum so far convened to end the apartheid system andcreate a non-racial  democratic society. We are pleased that as a result of these negotiations  a democratic Governmentis scheduled to be elected in April 1994.With regard to Angola  the Government of Liberiawishes to call on UNITA to abandon its military agenda andseek to resolve the crisis through peaceful means inconformity with the Bicesse Accords. In this light  we alsomake a special appeal to UNITA to conform to the wishesof the people of Angola by accepting the results of theSeptember 1992 elections. We call on it to sign the protocolof agreement negotiated in Abidjan in a spirit of nationalunity and reconciliation of all Angolans.Last month the world welcomed the historic anddramatic developments affecting peace in the Middle East when the Government of Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO) recognized each other. The signing ofan agreement on Palestinian autonomy means that the firstreal step has indeed been taken towards Palestinian self-rule.It is our sincerest hope that this agreement will soon becomplemented by peace accords between Israel and all of itsArab neighbours.Perhaps no problem  apart from the spectre of anuclear holocaust  has elicited more global concern than thatof the environment  given its intrinsic linkage to man’ssurvival and his economic well-being. In a worldcharacterized by issues of common concern andever-increasing interdependence of States  a collectiveapproach is indispensable in meeting the challenges posed byenvironmental problems and the international economicsituation. The environmental crisis is now posing a seriousthreat to the life-support system of our planet. This is whymy delegation believes it is most important that MemberStates maintain the momentum gained at the historic 1992Conference on Environment and Development  held in Riode Janeiro  by effective follow-up at the national andinternational levels. We welcome the establishment of theCommission on Sustainable Development whoseresponsibility it is to review and monitor implementation ofAgenda 21.With respect to the world economic situation  itremains our firm belief that  in order to achieve progress inglobal economic recovery  issues of long-term significance such as the excruciating debt burden of developing countries low commodity prices  protectionism and dwindling resourceflow into developing countries  should all form the realagenda for the setting of priorities to include a permanentincrease in global economic growth. The current gloomysituation of the international economy  worse now than inthe previous decade  is further accentuated by new risks tothe world economy caused by conflicts  the problem ofrefugees and the plight of the world’s children. Theseproblems pose a real threat to growth and development inmany regions of the world.In view of what I have said  there is an urgent need as a part of the continuing effort to forge a new and fairerinternational economic order  for the peace dividends derivedfrom the easing of bipolar tension to be deployed to meetthe development needs of the world’s most economicallydisadvantaged regions. They should not be reserved for theexclusive use of the already wealthy nations  and they shouldnot be directed only towards the political and economicliberalization of a particular region of the world. All musttake into account the fact that economic opportunity andsocial justice are essential preconditions for peace andsecurity in our global village.The post-cold-war era has offered the United Nationsnew opportunities and challenges  particularly in thefulfilment of its unique responsibility as the conscience ofmankind. In recent years  the United Nations has taken bolddecisions in peacemaking  peace-keeping and peace-building humanitarian intervention and the protection of human rights.These assertive approaches have made the United Nationsappear more relevant to the peoples of the world.It is hoped that  in its honourable pursuits  the UnitedNations will continue to be led by men of vision who canensure the realization of the noble ideals enshrined in its Charter -fostering world peace and promoting development andcooperation amongst all the peoples of our one world."
"95",4060,"LBY",48,1993,"On behalf of my delegation may I condole through the delegation of India  with theGovernment and people of India over the natural calamitywhich has befallen that great people. Allow me  at theoutset  to congratulate you sincerely on your election to thepresidency of the forty-eighth session of the United NationsGeneral Assembly. I should also like to express mycountry’s appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. StoyanGanev  for his constructive efforts. We hope that incontinuing to play a constructive role in the newinternational environment the General Assembly will benefitfrom your diplomatic skills and broad experience.May I also take this opportunity to express ourappreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for his dedication to the United Nations andfor his efforts aimed at reforming the Organization at thiscritical juncture.I should like also to welcome the new countries thathave joined the United Nations. We are confident that theirmembership will enhance the role of the Organization andfurther universal acceptance of its principles and purposes which aim at establishing and strengthening internationalpeace and security and ensuring that justice is done.Today  the people of the Jamahiriya celebrate theanniversary of the departure of the last remnants of Fascismfrom Libyan soil  thus putting an end to a period in itshistory that was characterized by the domination of settler-colonialism  a period during which injustice and persecutionprevailed. As our people celebrate this anniversary today they reaffirm that relations between Libya and the State fromwhich those settlers came are now relations of good-neighbourliness  based on understanding and cooperation inevery field.During the forty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly  there were numerous developments in theinternational situation. However  before I speak of mycountry’s position on those developments  allow me to startwith a question which is of great importance to us andwhich is not unrelated to those recent internationaldevelopments. Rather  it is one of their by-products. It hasto do with the tendency of certain countries to imposesolutions to their differences with other countries in amanner that is not consonant with the Charter of the UnitedNations or with international norms and conventions. In sodoing  those countries tend to deliberately apply doublestandards  especially when the dispute is with a country thatpursues independent policies and adopts unsubmissivepositions. This is the case with regard to the dispute thatarose between the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and France Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 5Britain and the United States of America  when the threecountries declared that they suspected the involvement ofLibyan nationals in the Pan American and UTA planeincidents and demanded that two Libyan citizens be handedover to stand trial in Scotland or the United States ofAmerica. Notwithstanding the fact that the Libyanauthorities  once notified  took the appropriate legal steps the other parties refused to cooperate with the Libyanauthorities or to await the results of their ongoinginvestigations. Instead  they resorted to the Security Counciland directed it to deal with this matter under Chapter VII ofthe Charter  which has nothing to do with the issue inquestion. Libya has not threatened anyone  nor has itendangered international peace and security. The wholething is a question of suspicions and allegations that have tobe investigated through judicial channels.Although my country realizes that this matter has beenaddressed  intentionally  within a framework that is totallyincompatible with its legal character  it has continued toinvestigate the whole issue  as it has done since it wasnotified of the matter  because it is determined to uncoverthe circumstances and facts surrounding the case. Libya hasalso declared its readiness to cooperate by responding to therequirements of Security Council resolution 731 (1992) which include cooperation with the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations to ensure the success of the missionentrusted to him by that resolution.In this respect  my country has reiterated itscondemnation of international terrorism in every shape andform. It has severed relations with all organizations andentities suspected of being involved in terrorist acts and hasaffirmed that it will not allow its territory  institutions orcitizens to be used  directly or indirectly  for the carrying outof such acts. It has declared its readiness to punish severelythose proven guilty of involvement in terrorist activities. Mycountry has also declared that there are no terrorist trainingcamps on its soil and has invited the Security Council  orany other international body the Council may choose  toinvestigate and verify this.In addition  my country has cooperated with theGovernment of the United Kingdom in trying to findindividuals whom the British Government has accused ofinvolvement in terrorist acts. More than one meeting hasbeen held in this respect  and British officials haveconfirmed the Jamahiriya’s positive cooperation with themin this matter. Moreover  in order to determine theresponsibility for the bombing of the French UTA plane more than one meeting has been held between the Libyaninvestigative judge and his French counterpart. Contacts areongoing with the French authorities to arrange the Frenchjudge’s visit  and his mission will be facilitated  provided hearrives in a peaceful and civilized manner and not in themanner of sixteenth-century gunboat diplomacy.I have spoken briefly of the measures taken by Libyain response to the stipulations of Security Councilresolution 731 (1992). As regards the determination ofresponsibility for these terrorist acts to which the Americanand French planes were subjected  my country took legal andinvestigative measures and has called on the British andAmerican authorities to cooperate in completing theinvestigation. It has also called on neutral bodies andinternational and humanitarian organizations to verify thefairness of the investigations.Concerning its contribution to the eradication ofinternational terrorism  the aforementioned practicalmeasures prove my country’s seriousness in stamping outthis phenomenon. Libya’s eagerness to eliminateinternational terrorism was embodied in our call for theconvening of a special session of the General Assembly tostudy the causes and dimensions of the problem.The matter that has not yet been resolved is thatrelating to the request by the British and Americanauthorities to turn over the two suspects to stand trial in thecourts of one of those countries. My country has spared noeffort in seeking to resolve this problem in accordance withthe conventions of legality. We offered to go to theInternational Court of Justice and we proposed surrenderingthe two suspects to the United Nations office in Libya forinvestigation. We also proposed that the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations establish a legal fact-findingcommittee to examine the verisimilitude of the accusationsand carry out a comprehensive investigation.The competent authorities in my country put thisproblem before the Basic People’s Congresses - thelegislative authority - in Libya  which adopted a decisionwherein they stated they would not object to the suspectsbeing tried before an unbiased and fair court agreed upon byall concerned. On this basis  my country announced itsreadiness to enter into negotiations with the countriesconcerned  under the auspices of the Secretary-General  ona venue for the trial that could be agreed upon by all partiesto the dispute and that would guarantee an environmentconducive to revealing the truth. To our minds  this is thesubstance of Security Council resolution 731 (1992). TheSecretary-General was notified of this step in December1992 and again last July  when he was informed that Libya6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionwas prepared to discuss the proceedings and arrangementsrelating to the trial.The position taken by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriyaconcerning these disputes met with widespread approvalfrom various States and regional organizations  including theNon-Aligned Movement  which is made up of some 110States (see the Jakarta Message  A/47/675); theOrganization of the Islamic Conference  with its 54 members(resolutions 6/20 and 21/14); the League of Arab States which has 22 members (resolutions 5156  5158  5161  5224and 5281); and  last but not least  the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU)  which consists of more than 50States. The OAU  in resolution 1457  expressed appreciationfor Libya’s initiatives towards the resolution of this disputeand commended Libya’s readiness to cooperate with thelegal and judicial authorities and called upon the SecurityCouncil to review resolution 748 (1992) with a view tolifting the embargo imposed on Libya.The positions taken by these organizations show thatthey see the justice of the Libyan viewpoint  and alsohighlight their interest in playing their roles in resolving thedispute by peaceful means according to Chapter VIII of theCharter. It was hoped that the three States concerned wouldtake these positions into consideration and respond to theLibyan initiatives  but our efforts have been rejected.Moreover  the States concerned have discredited both theflexibility and responsiveness of the Libyan position andhave insisted  in contravention of international laws andpractices  on the extradition of the suspects to the UnitedStates or Britain to stand trial before the courts of one ofthose countries.Libya has not  in principle  rejected the trial of thesuspects  as it has confirmed from the very start. All Libyahas asked for  and is still determined to obtain  is alegitimate and unbiased trial with all the legal andpsychological guarantees that go with it. Intensiveconsultations and contacts in this regard were recentlyconducted  and their results were communicated to theSecretary-General on 24 September 1993. Libya considersthe content of the Secretary-General’s reply sufficient andacceptable  and  therefore  the only step left in the resolutionof this problem is that of convincing the suspects to submitthemselves to the Scottish judiciary. The Libyan ArabJamahiriya is encouraging them to do so. This wascommunicated to the Secretary-General in two letterscontained in document S/26523  dated 1 October 1993.The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has respondedpragmatically to the stipulations of Security Councilresolution 731 (1992). Now it becomes necessary not onlyto abandon the efforts aimed at tightening the sanctionsimposed by resolution 748 (1992)  but to lift those sanctionsimmediately. This is why we appeal to this Assembly which represents the conscience of the world  to support themeasures that have been called for by the international andregional organizations I have mentioned.The sanctions have caused the Libyan people muchmisery and have cost them billions of dollars in materiallosses  to which must be added the deaths of hundreds ofchildren  women and elderly people. I do not want to gointo detail  for we have elaborated on this in 14 documents the latest of which is document S/26139. However  in brief let me say that the embargo has prevented about 8 525patients with severe illnesses from travelling abroad fortreatment. It has prevented college professors fromtravelling to Libya and has led to the suspension of contractswith hundreds of physicians. The embargo has caused thenumber of fatal road accidents to double because of thedifficulty in transporting the injured to specialized hospitalsin neighbouring countries. Also  the death rate among cattlehas been high because of lack of immunization and ashortage of preventive medications. It has cut the revenuefrom economic activities by more than $2 400 000 000.Furthermore  there is a severe lack of spare parts for aircraft which has led to a plane crash with 157 fatalities amongpassengers of various nationalities.The easing of tensions in international relations hasenabled the international community to achieve progress inthe areas of disarmament and the protection of human rights.It has also enhanced international efforts aimed at solvingdisputes which  until recently  have been a source of greatconcern. This has included the reconciliation in Cambodiaand the maintenance of stability in Central America. Thereare also positive signs regarding the attainment of lastingpeace in Mozambique. Important steps have been takentowards full national reconciliation in Liberia  and thedispute in Rwanda is on its way to a final solution.However  these hopeful developments should not mask thefact that the world now is in the grip of unprecedentedtensions and conflicts  which necessitate further efforts bythe United Nations and regional organizations not only toresolve them but also to prevent certain countries frommonopolizing the resolution of such conflicts. The problemof Cyprus remains unsolved. The situation in Bosnia andHerzegovina and the Balkans in general has deteriorated andcontinues to cause much human misery. Afghanistan has notachieved total stability yet  and fighting in Angola hasintensified. The national peace accords there have not beengenuinely observed  regardless of the international andForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 7regional efforts deployed. The situation in South Africa haswitnessed some positive developments  but an immediatestop must be put to the acts of violence which negativelyaffect the transformation of South Africa into a unified democratic and non-racial State.For more than four decades  the United Nations hascontinued to adopt numerous resolutions on the question ofPalestine. Regardless  the Israelis have refused to complywith any of those resolutions  all of which recognize theinalienable and legitimate right of the Palestinian people toself-determination and their right to return to their homeland.The provisions of General Assembly resolution 194 (III) onthe right of return for refugees  of resolution 478 (1980) onJerusalem  of resolution 3375 (XXX) on the right to self-determination and of resolution 799 (1992) on deportees areonly a few dead letter examples. Despite the recentdevelopments concerning the question of Palestine  theposition of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya regarding this issueand the conflict in the Middle East remains as we havepreviously explained it  and let me now reiterate it: alloccupied Arab territories should be liberated  and thePalestinian people should be supported until they haveregained all their rights - the foremost of which being theirright to self-determination  their right to return to their landand their right to establish in Palestine their own State where both Arabs and Jews can live on an equal footing.In another part of the Arab homeland  namely Somalia the situation is still a source of grave concern. Althoughearlier efforts were successful in creating a safe environmentfor the distribution of humanitarian relief assistance to thosesuffering from the widespread famine  the recent events which indicate that the circumstances have changed  showhow sensitive the situation is in that region. My country which has closely followed the developments in Somalia remains convinced that solutions to problems cannot beimposed by force regardless of the enforcer. Solutions canbe found only through dialogue and understanding.First and foremost  the Somalis themselves shouldabandon their differences and work together to implementthe agreements they have reached so that Somalia and itspeople may regain peace  security and stability.Given our conviction that peace and security in theMediterranean region is closely related  not only to securityand cooperation with Africa and Europe  but also to worldpeace and security  the strengthening of security andcooperation in the region is a high priority for the LibyanArab Jamahiriya. That is the reason why my countrywelcomed General Assembly resolutions in this regard aswell as the resolutions adopted on the subject by otherorganizations  such as the Non-Aligned Movement. Onceagain  we declare that we welcome any and all initiativesaimed at removing the causes of tension  enhancing stabilityand expanding cooperation in the region.My country is fully cognizant of the fact that thestrengthening of security and cooperation in theMediterranean region is a multidimensional issue. However we continue to believe that withdrawal of foreign fleets andthe closing down of foreign bases in this region constitutethe essential elements. Such a step would enhanceconfidence-building in the area and channel resourcestowards economic and social development. At the sametime  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya believes that the use ofdialogue and understanding - on the basis of mutual respectfor sovereignty and in accordance with international normsand conventions - to settle differences would also constitutea basic element in restoring security and stability to theMediterranean region. Moreover  intensified collaborationand coordination of efforts in areas of common interestwould further enhance cooperation. For this reason  theJamahiriya welcomes the steps taken within regionalgroupings such as the Arab Maghreb Union and the WesternMediterranean Grouping (5 + 5)  as such steps constitute animportant breakthrough towards the realization of peoples’aspirations after peace  security and cooperation.Concrete progress has been made over the past fewyears in the area of disarmament  especially with regard tothe reduction of nuclear-weapon stockpiles and accession bymore countries to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. While itwelcomes those developments  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriyadoes not consider them to be sufficient and believes that thedanger of nuclear proliferation requires further internationalefforts that would lead to the complete elimination of allweapons of mass destruction in the case of every State thatpossesses  produces or stockpiles them. Consequently  mycountry supports all initiatives aimed at achieving this end including the enhancement of the United Nationsdisarmament mechanisms and especially the Conference onDisarmament  whose work has been crowned by theChemical Weapons Convention. This is an ambitiousdocument on the road to general and complete disarmament.However  my country has so far abstained from signing thisConvention because of the existence in the region we live inof weapons of mass destruction that are not subject tointernational safeguards and inspection. Under suchcircumstances  it is difficult to consider the ChemicalWeapons Convention without considering other weapons ofmass destruction in the Middle East  mainly nuclearweapons.8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionMy country has supported the call for the establishmentof nuclear-weapon-free zones  including the proposal by theArab Republic of Egypt which calls for making the MiddleEast an area free of weapons of mass destruction. Based onmy country’s eagerness to stamp out the dangers of suchweapons and in order to get rid of them  it has called on theUnited Nations to adopt the necessary measures to destroynuclear  bacteriological  chemical and other weapons of massdestruction  such as ballistic missiles  and to prohibit andcriminalize the development  possession and use of all suchweapons.The international family’s current efforts to establishsecurity and stability in the world  mainly through theredoubling of efforts to contain political crises and endregional disputes  should be expanded to embrace economicproblems as well. The impact of economic problems oninternational peace and security is not less dangerous thanthat of armed conflicts. According to the 1993 WorldEconomic Survey  the world economy continues to stagnate.Its revitalization requires urgent international measureswhich would give special attention to the developingcountries  which suffer from economic difficulties that arisefrom trade protectionism  large external debts  restrictions onthe transfer of technology  the reverse flow of resources andlow commodity prices.In the context of the international community’s effortsto promote economic and social development  my countrywishes to draw attention to the danger of the coercivemeasures of various forms  to which some developingcountries  including mine  are being subjected. Suchmeasures constitute one of the main obstacles todevelopment and run counter to the Charter  the rules ofinternational law and to all relevant General Assemblyresolutions.Support for development efforts also requires theinternational community to honour its commitments tocertain development programmes  such as the United NationsNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.Africa attaches great hope to this programme because itwould help promote developmental efforts that began withthe establishment of Africa’s economic community and havebeen enhanced by the establishment of a number ofsubregional groupings such as the Arab Maghreb Union which has taken important steps towards improving the useof the region’s resources and towards strengthening theregional ties that would enhance the adoption of commonpolicies by its member countries in the political  economicand social spheres.Last year’s Earth Summit yielded important results.We are satisfied with the measures adopted towards therealization of the Conference’s objectives  especially thebeginnings of a convention to combat drought anddesertification. This is an extremely important issue for mycountry and for the whole North Africa region  which suffersfrom a shortage of water and is threatened by drought andcreeping desertification. Furthermore  we believe that truedetermination to protect the environment lies in internationalcooperation and in honouring the commitments made at theRio Conference. Protection of the environment is one of mycountry’s top priorities. Our first step in combating droughtand desertification is the great man-made river. Our nationalplans include the reclamation of thousands of hectares ofdesert for the purpose of agriculture and settlement.In this respect  I must inform the Assembly that ourefforts to expand environmental protection and maintenanceare being hampered by the widespread presence of remnantsof war  and of mines that were laid in Libya’s soil duringWorld War II. International and regional organizations haveadopted numerous resolutions in this connection  and theGeneral Assembly has also adopted similar resolutions  thelatest of which was resolution 40/197. All those resolutionshave called upon the countries responsible to provide theinformation and technical assistance required for the removalof those mines and other remnants of war  and to paycompensation for the damage caused. Today  we call onceagain upon those countries to shoulder their responsibilityand to respond to the calls of the international communityand the United Nations resolutions on the remnants anddebris of war.The adoption of international policies and programmesaimed at ensuring mankind’s well-being and attaining thebest possible standard of living is one of our objectives. Onthis basis  my country welcomes the convening of theInternational Conference on Population and Developmentnext year  and of the World Conference on Women and theWorld Summit for Social Development in 1995. To ourmind  these conferences will give a strong political impetusto international efforts and activities aimed at stamping outunderdevelopment  poverty and hunger. In welcoming theseconferences  we are encouraged by the important resultsfrom the International Conference on Human Rights. Theyare a great achievement in the promotion of respect forhuman rights and basic freedoms.My country which belongs to one of the great culturesof the world  namely the Arab-Islamic culture that hascontributed greatly to the promotion of human rights  isdetermined to continue to support the internationalForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 9community’s efforts  deployed through the United Nationsand its organs  in the area of human rights  so that we mayrealize the goals of the Vienna Declaration and Programmeof Action.Given its interest in human rights which it considers tobe the basis for development and prosperity  my country hasworked to achieve and strengthen equality for all its citizensand to guarantee their rights. This has been stressed in thegreat green document on human rights and basic freedoms.The freedom enhancement act was promulgated in 1991  anda large number of international agreements in the area ofhuman rights have also been ratified. In addition  theInternational Committee on the Qaddafi Award for HumanRights has been established.The restructuring and reform of the United Nations andthe democratization of the composition of its organs havebecome a necessity if the United Nations is to be enabled tomeet international demands  become more responsive to theneeds of Member States and more effective in its work  inconsonance with the goals of the Charter.My country has been following with interest the currentattempts at reforming the United Nations in the economicand social fields. We welcome the decision on therevitalization of the General Assembly and the streamliningof its agenda. We hope that the ad hoc working groupestablished for this purpose will reach a conclusion thatstrikes a balance between  and safeguards the interests of  allMember States.The Secretary-General’s proposals in his report entitled""An Agenda for Peace"" are a valuable contribution towardsenhancing the Organization’s ability to meet the challengesof the coming period. My country welcomed thoseproposals  and has taken note of the two resolutions adoptedby the General Assembly in this respect.In carrying out the recommendations of the Agenda forPeace  the United Nations should be guided by the principlesof the Charter and especially by its respect for thesovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence ofStates  as stipulated in resolution 47/120  and confirmed byresolution 47/233 adopted by the General Assembly just lastmonth. The strengthening of the General Assembly so thatit may perform the role entrusted to it by the Charter shouldbe one of the main objectives in reforming the UnitedNations. The Security Council  which Member States haveentrusted with the maintenance of international peace andsecurity on their behalf  should carry out its duties in amanner that fully conforms with the principles and purposesof the Charter and with international laws and norms. TheCouncil should also improve its methods of work and adoptan objective course of action. It should not apply doublestandards when dealing with issues of world peace andsecurity. The present facts on the ground necessitate anenlargement of the membership of the Security Council notthrough partial measures but through radical solutions thatreflect the increase in the membership of the United Nationsand take into consideration equal geographical distribution inaccordance with the provisions of Article 23 of the Charterand the objectives of General Assembly resolution 47/62.Within the context of the reform process  it is highlyimportant to review some of the provisions of the Charterthat are no longer in keeping with the great changes thathave taken place in the international arena. The worldsituation in 1945 and the situation now are different. Thisrequires the adoption of bold measures in relation to certainprovisions of the Charter whose continued existenceconstitutes a major impediment to the most important role ofthe United Nations  namely  the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. Here  we refer to the veto power in theUnited Nations Security Council  which is held by a veryfew countries. The abolition of this privilege is somethingthat has long been called for; calls for abolition have grownover the last few years. The position expressed by manycountries  including my country  during the last session ofthe General Assembly and in other forums  confirms thewidespread desire to abolish this privilege and highlights thefact that any collective security system that is subject to theveto power of some countries cannot be depended upon tomaintain international peace and security.In conclusion  as we prepare to celebrate the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  and as we look forward10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionto the next 50 years  we are duty bound  both as States andas peoples  to lay down a strong and just foundation for theworld of tomorrow. The world we aspire to is a world freefrom conflicts  disputes and wars; a world where the meansof annihilation and destruction do not exist and where themanifestations of poverty and suffering have longdisappeared; a world of security and stability built by peopleon the basis of virtue  justice and equality  where democracyand human rights are reinforced by the absence of violence injustice and arbitrary acts; a world where all people have agenuine opportunity to look to the future with optimism andto enjoy peace  security and happiness by truly applying theprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. Incontributing to the achievement of these goals  the LibyanArab Jamahiriya put forward a proposal designed to dealwith and solve many of the problems and issues with whichmankind is preoccupied. That proposal was circulated indocument A/46/840 which I shall not address but which isavailable to representatives as an addendum to thisstatement."
"96",4091,"LCA",48,1993,"May I at the outsetextend to you  Sir  my own and my country’s warmestcongratulations on your election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. Yourassumption of the presidency is a singular honour for theCaribbean Community (CARICOM). It marks the firstoccasion on which a person from that region has beenelected to preside over the General Assembly. Yourpresence here in the Chair therefore provides addedsignificance to the honour and privilege attached to theopportunity presented to my country  also a CARICOMState  to address this body. Knowing you as I do  Sir  I amcertain that your experience  wisdom and diplomatic skillswill guide our deliberations to successful and historicconclusions.Forty-eighth session - 11 October l993 17The end of the cold war and the movement towardsdemocratization within the former Soviet Union and inEastern Europe  accompanied by the new level of ententebetween the major Powers in the Security Council  have ledto a new paramountcy of this Organization in the conduct ofrelations between nations. Many of the essential principlesof the Charter  too long suppressed in the presence of super-Power rivalries  are now given the opportunity  within thismore conducive environment  to assume the importance forwhich they were designed when first established as a productof the wisdom of the founding fathers of this Organization.The tendency towards globalization in economic  if notin political  terms suggests an era within which consensusand mutuality of approach will be essential for furtheringbalanced and sustained global advancement. The ideal ofuniversality within the framework of this Organizationbecomes even more important in this context. Now that thegrim obstacles which oppose the concepts of equality anduniversality are being dismantled in South Africa  we arehopeful that that country will soon be able to take its placearound this hearth of the family of nations.It was also in furtherance of the spirit of universalityand its all-embracing purpose that Saint Lucia joined 11other Member States of the United Nations in proposing theinclusion of a supplementary item in the agenda aimed atobtaining General Assembly agreement for the establishmentof an ad hoc committee to study the situation of theRepublic of China in Taiwan. That study would havefocused on the search for an equitable  rational and practicalsolution that would enable the Republic of China in Taiwanto become a full Member of the United Nations.Unfortunately  this new but overdue initiative suffered atemporary setback in the General Committee.However  I find it difficult to envisage that a country of21 million people  whose industriousness has contributed tomaking their country the fourteenth-largest trading nation inthe world  can continue to be impeded from becoming aMember of this Organization  where they will be affordedthe opportunity to discharge their international obligationsmore fully. In keeping with its belief in the concept ofuniversality  Saint Lucia gives support to the Governmentand people of the Republic of China in Taiwan in theiraspiration to become full Members of this worldOrganization.For many years now  the problems associated with theMiddle East have been considered intractable. Thatunforgettable handshake  beamed to us in Saint Lucia live bythe wonders of satellite technology  was for us as much asymbol of relief as it was a signal of hope - relief that itperhaps marked the beginning of the end of the bloodshed suffering and hostility which have so plagued that region and hope that their end would bring us one step fartheralong the path towards global cooperation through which thefuture of humanity may eventually be rescued from a worldwhich has hitherto been seemingly drifting towards self-destruction. My country wishes to convey itscongratulations to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin andChairman Yasser Arafat on this bold and courageous step inthe cause of peace against odds which  until then  seemedinsurmountable. It is Saint Lucia’s wish that this event willignite the spark which kindles a beacon of peace to light theregion along its way to realization of its fullest potential.The heroic efforts of President F.W. de Klerk andAfrican National Congress President Nelson Mandela inSouth Africa must also be praised. They have remainedunintimidated by violence and endemic opposition in single-mindedly spearheading the creation of the TransitionalExecutive Council  which at long last gives an official sayto a majority too long disenfranchised by official oppressivedictate. This progress allows Saint Lucia fully to support thelifting of the remaining sanctions  as called for by Mr.Mandela. With the recent agreement on Walvis Bay and theexpectation that free and fair elections will be held in Aprilnext year  perhaps we can soon bring to a close this sadchapter of our history.However  Saint Lucia is less sanguine over the situationin some other countries of Africa. The world recession hashad an adverse effect on export revenues and therefore ontheir foreign-exchange earnings and debt-settlement ability.In addition  political strife has tended to exacerbate thesedifficulties. The success of globalization in its promotion ofworld economic growth depends on development which isshared. It is important that  in the understandableenthusiasm to do everything possible to assist with thetransformation of previously centrally managed economies Africa not be allowed to become a casualty of the endedcold war.Saint Lucia welcomes the finalization of thedemarcation of the boundary between Kuwait and Iraq which was accomplished by the Iraq-Kuwait BoundaryDemarcation Commission on 20 May this year. We alsowelcome the adoption by the Security Council ofresolution 833 (1993)  by which it guaranteed theinviolability of the boundary between the two States. Thisguarantee will serve as a deterrent against future conflictbetween Kuwait and Iraq. It will also enhance stability andsecurity in the region. We call upon Iraq to respect theterms of Security Council resolution 833 (1993) and otherrelevant Security Council resolutions.18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe firm resolve which this Organization  particularlythe Security Council  has shown in dealing with theproblems of the long-suffering people of Haiti is to becommended. Since the adoption of General Assemblyresolution 45/2 of 10 October 1990  the United Nations hascontinued to reflect the international community’s concernand will in its several action-oriented decisions culminatingin the adoption of Security Council resolution 867 (1993) on23 September of this year to deploy both military andparamilitary forces in Haiti. With a return to democracy andthe application of the economic recovery programmeenvisaged by the World Bank and the United NationsDevelopment Programme  it is hoped that Haiti will at lastbegin to experience the economic development which has forso long eluded it and which is an absolute imperative foralleviating the long suffering of its people.Saint Lucia is happy to have been able to contributeactively to the process of democratization in Haiti. A teamof more than 30 Saint Lucians helped with the organizationof the electoral process and assisted in monitoring theelections. Some 15 Saint Lucians are today serving asmonitors of human-rights abuses in that country. SaintLucia is therefore deeply anxious that the restructuring andrecovery process in Haiti should succeed  and we urge theinternational community to maintain solidarity with PresidentJean-Bertrand Aristide as he returns home to resume themantle of leadership of his country.Saint Lucia is a small Caribbean developing islandState. If developing countries in general are in jeopardy then small Caribbean developing island countries areexposed to double jeopardy. We are all trapped in aninternational economic system which yields no quarter to theproblems and needs that are peculiar to us  and additionallyinsists upon using a continental measuring rod as a gauge ofour development processes. Like castaways set adrift on theworld’s oceans  we have for some time been desperatelytrying to catch the ears of those who happily stand on solidground. But our voices have somehow failed to carry in theface of the biting winds of global change which have  almostovernight  altered the very environment within which wehave been conditioned by history to survive.It is true that the small Caribbean island developingcountries have in some cases registered importantdevelopment gains over the past 10 to 15 years  a periodwhich marks the attainment of sovereignty for these smalldeveloping countries. But the gains  where they do exist have been achieved only by Herculean effort and should notbe interpreted as evidence that particular or even specialconsideration in the granting of economic and technicalassistance is not now still needed to promote sustaineddevelopment. These gains are to be seen  rather  in thecontext of the maxim: ""One should help those who try tohelp themselves"". The graduation of the small Caribbeanisland developing countries from the World Bank’s ""softwindow"" into net contributor status within the UnitedNations Development Programme - a graduation determinedsolely on the basis of an index of per capita income - is inour case tantamount to helping a drowning man onto a raftand then setting him adrift without a paddle.Apart from having average per capita incomes that areonly two-thirds that of developing countries in general  thesmall Caribbean island developing countries are burdened  asa factor of scale of operations  by administrative costs whichare proportionately three times as high as that of continentaldeveloping countries. With our natural resources limited inquantity as well as diversity  the odds between success andfailure become marginal and purely a matter of the qualityof administration. Where no resource surpluses exist  littleroom is left for mistakes. Yet  because of our small nationalbudgets and disproportionately high administrative costs  weoften find ourselves unable to afford the diversity andquality of expertise required to broaden the odds.In the case of my country  Saint Lucia  this alreadyprecarious economic situation is now compounded by adirect attack on the sole item of domestic exports whichvirtually keeps us from sinking into the depths of economicdespair. As a primary agricultural state  Saint Lucia is thelargest producer of bananas in the eastern Caribbean. Asused here  however  ""largest"" is an extremely relative term.World annual banana production is currently about 10million tons  of which the small States of the WindwardIslands  comprising Dominica  Grenada  Saint Vincent andSaint Lucia  produce less than 300 000  Saint Luciaproducing about half of that quantity. Over 50 per cent ofthe working populations of these islands work in banana-associated enterprises. Both in Dominica and Saint Lucia more than 50 per cent of export earnings is derived frombanana exports. Our agricultural production is completely inthe hands of many small private farmers. There is noGovernment banana-production ownership and there are nolatifundia. Because of topographical constraints thatadversely affect production costs  our banana industry hasbeen assisted to survive primarily through the umbrella ofmodest preferential arrangements made available under thevarious Lomé Conventions.Today  there are forces at work  urged on bymultinational business interests  which would seek to wrestfrom us even the minuscule share - just 2 per cent of themarket - which has enabled our economies barely to weatheran increasingly hostile economic environment. In order toForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 19attempt to secure that end  they have also mounted initiativesin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  inthe European Court and within various international forums.Apart from the serious social consequences which cannot butfollow a demise of the banana industry in these islands  it isalso to be recognized that  in order to purchase goods andservices from those very sources which advocate measurescalculated to bring about that demise  we must first earn theforeign exchange to be able to do this. It can only be hopedthat  in the end  sympathetic understanding will prevail overintransigence in the determination of this vital issue.In this post-cold-war era  ideological considerationshave given way to political initiatives in the determination ofthe direction of official-aid flows. The weight given toforeign policy in deciding on foreign-aid flows means thatassistance is not always necessarily directed towards areas ofgreater need  but is directed  rather  to areas with issueswhich are politically topical. With a modest per capitaincome which threatens the little remaining access it has toconcessionary assistance  with official financial flowsdirected elsewhere  and with the main export commodityunder attack  Saint Lucia is left to wonder whether there isin existence a concerted intention to marginalize small islandcountries or whether it is merely the accident of presentworld conditions that bears this responsibility. In any event the effect remains the same.Political gain cannot be sustained in the absence ofcomplementary economic progress. Where world economicadvancement is isolated in its impact  political gain in worldterms will continue to prove transitory and incapable ofbeing sustained. It is true that the world has seen animpressive political transformation in a rather brief period oftime in terms of a transition to democracy and a new degreeof cooperation in the United Nations at the level of theSecurity Council. But if the price of these political gains isan exacerbated marginalization of the small developingcountries  they will undoubtedly soon be dissipated in a seaof economic troubles and the social disruption whichexperience suggests must follow as a consequence.The urgency of the international debt crisis may havebeen defused  but developing-country debt  after reaching abrief plateau  is again on the rise  approaching $1.5 trillion.This situation is made more difficult by the drag on worldeconomic output  which is being caused partly by thedislocation of economies of the former Soviet Union andEastern Europe. An expansion of world trade  coupled withthe recovery of commodity prices  lies at the foundation ofa solution to this problem. That is why we in CARICOMare seeking to establish trading and other economic linkswith our neighbours in the Latin American region and arelooking to participate in economic-cooperation initiativeswithin the Americas and elsewhere.Population growth in the developing countries  too though it has maintained a relatively steady rate for over adecade  continues to increase in numerical terms  accountingfor 93 per cent global population growth  which is nowabout 93 million annually. The balance between economicand population growth must be stabilized in the interest ofhuman progress.We approach the twenty-first century with worldchanges which have been as rapid as they have beenbewildering. The ensuing challenge which lies before smallcountries such as ours  daunting as it is because of ourslender resources  is to develop the necessary resilience toenable us to adapt to these changes. I am of the view thatincorporated within the idea of universality is the concept ofcommon progress and the need to ensure that anenvironment is created within which world-embracingadvancement becomes possible.In this context  the United Nations cannot be expectedto micro-manage global change; as the pre-eminent global20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionOrganization  its resources must be enhanced to allow it toplay an even greater role as a fulcrum  both in the traditionalspheres of activity and in new areas created by the neworder of things. The United Nations is  accordingly  seen asplaying an expanded role in the economic welfare ofdeveloping countries  including the development andapplication of further initiatives to address constraintsimposed by smallness and island status.We look forward to the Secretary-General’s agenda fordevelopment  with the expectation that it will seek to addressthe new problems and challenges which have arisen even assome of the old issues have been  or are in the process ofbeing  put to bed.Let me assure the Assembly of Saint Lucia’s pledge tocontinue to cooperate fully within the institutions of theOrganization to further its objectives for the betterment ofhumanity. What we lack in financial resources we canperhaps make up in human resources. The fact that SaintLucia has produced two Nobel laureates in this generation isindicative  I believe  of our ability to cooperate in thecommon pursuit of the noble purposes of this esteemedOrganization."
"97",4118,"LIE",48,1993,"Allow meto congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidencyof the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly and toexpress our conviction that your experience and diplomaticskills will make a valuable contribution to the work of thisaugust body. My delegation will spare no effort to supportyou in the fulfilment of your tasks. I should also like toavail myself of this opportunity to thank your predecessor Mr. Stoyan Ganev  for the way he conducted the work of theGeneral Assembly during a difficult period.Over the last eight months  this Organization has beenable to welcome six new Member States: Slovakia  theCzech Republic  The Former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia  Monaco  Eritrea and Andorra  thus enhancingthe universality of the United Nations.Since the last session of the General Assembly we havebeen witness to historic gains in regional disputes. Thesigning of the peace agreement between Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization is a unique breakthroughand will  it is hoped  lead to a just and lasting peace for theregion. When the President of the African NationalCongress  Mr. Nelson Mandela  spoke in this Hall on 24September  he outlined the historic advances made towardsdemocracy in South Africa. We are very hopeful that a newSouth Africa will play a vital role in the development of theAfrican continent.My country was admitted to the United Nations on18 September 1990 and has tried over the last three years tomaintain as active a presence and participation as possible.While Liechtenstein was the 160th Member in 1990  theOrganization today has 184 members. This considerableincrease in the Organization’s membership makes it clearthat the ongoing discussion of equitable representation onand expansion of the Security Council’s membership istimely and necessary.In our view  the priorities in reforming the SecurityCouncil are cohesion and effectiveness. It is of greatimportance  however  that the discussion of reforms alsoinclude the question of the Security Council’s work  sincebroad support for its actions is an indispensable condition ofits legitimacy  which can only be guaranteed by enhancedtransparency and cooperation with other Member States.Article 23 of the Charter establishes that the contribution tothe maintenance of international peace and security is thefirst criterion for membership in the Council; it is obviousthat the second criterion - equitable geographical distribution- has so far not been given due attention. In view of theobvious importance of the Security Council’s composition we favour taking the necessary time to make adjustmentsbeneficial to the credibility of the Organization as a whole.The new effectiveness of the Security Council ismanifested  among other ways  by the recent considerableincrease of peace-keeping and peacemaking missions. Theseoperations are closely observed by the public and are oftentaken as a yardstick for the activities of the United Nationsas a whole. While we think it important to give moreattention to other fields  such as that of social development we are aware of the impact that the failure or success ofpeace-keeping activities can have on the credibility of theOrganization. In our view  the United Nations should notengage in an ever-increasing number of peace-keepingForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 9missions all over the world. A more important role shouldbe given to preventive diplomacy  which can be carried outby regional organizations or arrangements such as theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).The participating States consider the CSCE a regionalarrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the UnitedNations Charter  and as such it provides an important linkbetween European and global security. Liechtenstein  as aparticipating State  believes that enhancement of thecooperation with the CSCE is crucial; my country favoursthe idea of granting observer status to that organization andhas supported the request for the inclusion of an additionalitem to this effect in the agenda of the forty-eighth session.Preventive diplomacy cannot  however  replace peace-keeping  and the United Nations must remain as active inthat field as is necessary. It must be pointed out that theexisting infrastructure in New York is not sufficient to copewith the wide range of tasks  and urgently needs to beimproved.Deplorable events in the recent past have made it clearthat there is not sufficient protection of civil and militarypersonnel involved in peace-keeping missions. We thereforewholeheartedly welcome the inclusion of a new agenda itemproposed by the delegation of New Zealand regarding thequestion of responsibility for attacks on United Nations andassociated personnel and measures to ensure that thoseresponsible for such attacks are brought to justice.With the growing involvement of the United Nations incomplex conflicts  the Organization’s role has beentransformed into a more active and comprehensive one. Asa result  relief workers expose their lives to great risk intheir efforts to alleviate human suffering. My delegationbelieves that it simply cannot be tolerated that relief workers who themselves want to save lives  should become targets.The United Nations should make it very clear that these actsof violence will not go unpunished. The emblems of theUnited Nations  the Red Cross and the Red Crescent must berespected.Humanitarian assistance today faces the challenge ofmany complex emergency situations. These challenges mustbe met on the basis of the principles of neutrality impartiality and humanity; humanitarian aid must not bepoliticized. When we are called upon to give proof of oursolidarity  we must provide the necessary financial means.We are  however  also called upon to address the root causesof many disasters  such as poverty  population increase andcivil and ethnic strife. Imbalances feed misery; they notonly are unfair but are dangerous.Forty-five years after the adoption of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  a great deal remains to bedone in this field  to which we attach particular importance.The World Conference on Human Rights in June 1993 wasa very important event  and we all know how difficult it wasto adopt the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.This text can constitute a milestone in the history of theUnited Nations only if it is followed by determined action bythe General Assembly in the spirit of the ViennaDeclaration. In our view  it is of the utmost importance thatthe the Centre for Human Rights be given the resourcesnecessary to enable it to carry out its tasks even moreefficiently. In addition  the creation of the post of highcommissioner for human rights is a laudable initiative  andthe General Assembly should provide him or her with astrong mandate within the already existing structures.It is a well-known fact that the financial situation of theUnited Nations is disastrous. In his speech of 26 August the Secretary-General accordingly outlined initial steps tocope with this crisis. The measures taken by the Secretary-General seem to be unavoidable  and we hope they will nothave a negative impact on the work of the GeneralAssembly. In our view  urgent action by the GeneralAssembly is needed to prevent further deterioration  whichcould have serious consequences. Punctual and full paymentof the assessed contributions must be made by all States andarrears must be paid in full and promptly. Proposals aimedat ensuring proper utilization of resources and establishingadequate accountability within the United Nations should bediscussed thoroughly and expeditiously. Finally  an overallreform of the financial sector seems to be necessary. Allsuggestions which might contribute to this aim  especiallythose contained in the so-called Volcker-Ogata report  shouldbe studied with due attention.Much has been said about the changes that have takenplace since the ending of the cold war. Unfortunately wecannot say that all these changes have been positive. To theinfinite regret and dismay of the whole internationalcommunity  we have continued to witness the outbreak of agreat number of ethnic and national conflicts  accompaniedby the untold suffering of innocent people. There must bea better way for the world to manage its affairs. Whiletensions within and between communities may be aninevitable part of the human condition  it is  in our view  ofthe utmost importance that ways be found to defuse thempeacefully and without bloodshed.In this context  I should like to refer briefly again to anidea which might take us a step in the right direction andwhich I introduced when I had the great honour to address10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionthe General Assembly for the first time at its forty-sixthsession  very soon after Liechtenstein became a Member ofthe United Nations. On that occasion  I ventured to suggestthat a basis for some solutions could be found within theprinciple of self-determination. The value of this greatprinciple has been fully demonstrated in the traditionalcontext of decolonization. But it need not be limited to thatcontext. Applied also to communities within States  andallowing for them to have different levels of autonomyaccording to the particular circumstances of differentcommunities  it could perhaps defuse many of the tensionswhich are such a potent source of conflict. Such principles placed within a suitable framework  would give an effectiveand practical dimension to the principle of self-determinationwhich it has sometimes seemed to lack. Eventually suchprovisions could perhaps come to be elaborated in aconvention to be of general application.Since first putting those thoughts before this Assembly we in Liechtenstein have been encouraged by the degree ofinterest which has been shown in them. Our ideas areflexible  although our objective - which is to find practicaland effective ways of avoiding  or at least reducing  tensionsbetween communities - remains firm. We have refined ourinitial thoughts on the subject in the light of comments madeby others  and we developed our ideas further at the lastsession of the General Assembly  both during debates in theThird Committee and when the Head of Governmentaddressed the Assembly in the course of the general debate.On that occasion  the Head of Government announcedthat the Government of Liechtenstein would be inviting eachGovernment represented in the Assembly  includingObservers  to nominate an independent expert to attend aninformal meeting of experts in Liechtenstein to discuss thesematters further. That meeting took place from 16 to 18March this year  attended by participants nominated by 46States and international and non-governmental organizations.I attended it myself throughout  and can say personally howvaluable we found the contributions participants made to thedevelopment of our thinking. Perhaps I might be allowed totake this opportunity to thank them all for their participationin what we see as an important and valuable project.Over the past two years we have  in these various ways carried forward our belief that  in the ideas first put forwardto Assembly in 1991  the international community may findsome way forward in its search for ways of avoiding thekind of internal conflicts which cause ever-increasing humansuffering and which are increasingly dangerous for the peaceand safety of our world. To make further progress wedecided this year to seek to inscribe an item on theAssembly’s agenda which would enable our ideas to be fullydiscussed by the full membership of the United Nations. Weare grateful that our proposal was accepted and now appearson the agenda for this session as item 108 (b)  entitled""Right of peoples to self-determination: Effective realizationof the right of self-determination through autonomy"". Welook forward to the debate which will follow  and I hope tobe able to participate myself in at least part of it. We hopethat in the light of what may be said in the debate  theAssembly will agree that there is  in the ideas which wehave put forward  something valuable which merits furtherconsideration and elaboration.We do not underestimate the difficulties ahead. We areaware of the sensitivities of this whole subject  especially inthese times. Great though those difficulties and sensitivitiesmay be for some States  we are convinced that the needs ofthe international community are even more pressing. Thedangers  horrors and suffering to which tensions betweencommunities within States can give rise  and of which wesadly have daily reminders  make it essential for theinternational community to make every effort to open upnew thinking in this field in order to find practical andeffective means for further promoting the principles andpurposes of the Charter of the United Nations.We consider it a great privilege to have an Organizationsuch as the United Nations  founded upon a Charter whichencompasses the highest ideals of humankind. I wish to takethis opportunity to reaffirm my country’s commitment to theprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations."
"98",4165,"LKA",48,1993,"It gives me great pleasureto see an eminent son of Guyana guiding this forty-eighthsession of the General Assembly. Sri Lanka and Guyanahave a long tradition of cooperation at the United Nations in the Non-Aligned Movement and in the Commonwealth.Sri Lanka also expresses its appreciation to HisExcellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria  who presidedover the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly.Before I proceed  may I take this opportunity  on behalfof the Government and the people of Sri Lanka  to expressour profound sorrow over the terrible tragedy that has struckthe people of India in the wake of the devastating earthquakethis week.I bring best wishes from His ExcellencyDingiri Banda Wijetunga  President of Sri Lanka  and bestwishes for the success of this session of the Assembly in itsendeavours for world peace.Sri Lanka welcomes the new Member States admittedto the United Nations this year.We thank the Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his dedication andcourageous leadership in meeting the challenges of peaceand development that lie ahead.Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 37It is four years since I last addressed the Assembly.Our hopes voiced at that time for the post-cold-war globalorder are now being realized  although there are problems ofinstability in the international arena.The current international political trend gives us freshhope of relations being conducted between States inaccordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.Regarding Palestine  Sri Lanka has welcomed themutual recognition between the Palestine LiberationOrganization and Israel. We hope that the interimarrangements now being worked out will lead eventually toa comprehensive and durable settlement of the Palestinianproblem in all its aspects.In South Africa  the Non-Aligned Movement’s resoluteopposition to apartheid and its advocacy of a free democratic and non-racial South Africa stands vindicated.As President Nelson Mandela described it last week  ""thecountdown to democracy"" in South Africa has begun.Cambodia  a founding member of the Non-AlignedMovement  is now free. We welcome this development andcongratulate the United Nations on its role.These developments certainly give us encouragementand hope. But this does not mean that the world is now freefrom tension and disputes.The situation in Bosnia gives grounds for a vote ofno-confidence on the political leadership of our times. It isa situation which has shocked the world. It is clear that theinternational community is still incapable of rising abovenarrow and parochial considerations. It is vital that an earlysolution be found which will meet the aspirations of all theparties concerned.We have watched with alarm the rising tide of racismin many countries  which violates the very foundations oftheir cherished goals and objectives. It is not relevant hereto diagnose the causes  but these dangerous and ugly trendsmust be checked. This is not just a challenge toGovernments alone. All men and women of good will mustjoin together to fight this evil.The implementation of recent arms-limitationagreements and the shelving of plans to extend the arms raceinto outer space have enhanced the prospects for genuinedisarmament. Since 1991 world defence spending has beenset on a downward course. We must bring about asuccessful conclusion to the 1995 conference on theNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).Sri Lanka is pleased at the recent successful conclusionof the Convention on chemical weapons.At the same time  genuine disarmament must alsoincorporate measures to reduce the flows of conventionalarms. The uncontrolled movement of arms and explosivesto extremist fringe groups threatens to destabilize smallcountries.In a similar context  Sri Lanka wishes to draw theAssembly’s attention to the initiative to enforce aninternational ban on the use of mines in warfare. The tragicconsequences of mine warfare are visible in the thousands ofamputees in many parts of the world and call for urgentinternational attention.Today it is widely recognized that security can nolonger be reduced to military considerations alone. Securitymust take account of economic crises  poverty  hunger  massmigrations  international terrorism and environmentalpollution. These developments require the revitalization ofthe United Nations.In 1995  the United Nations will celebrate its fiftiethanniversary. The founding principle of the United Nations -the sovereign equality of all States - remains valid today.The Secretary-General has emphasized this principle in hisreport ""An Agenda for Peace"". The principle of sovereignequality must be put into practice if the bold proposals in""An Agenda for Peace"" are to succeed.As the transition to a new global order continues  theUnited Nations will come under greater pressure to live upto its ideals. However  in order to command the widestpossible support  the United Nations must operate on thebasis of an acceptable set of guiding principles. With regardto national disputes  United Nations intervention must beconsidered only upon the request of the Member Stateconcerned. Indigenous peace efforts must be encouragedand respected.Regionalism has received a new impetus. The UnitedNations should extend its fullest cooperation to theseregional trends and initiatives. A lingering obstacle toregional unity is the question of border disputes. TheNon-Aligned Movement has made useful proposals in thisregard  including the suggestion by Sri Lanka that a borderdisputes commission be formed. Most recently  the SecurityCouncil itself had to lend its authority to resolve the border38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessiondispute between Kuwait and Iraq  and we support allrelevant Security Council resolutions in that regard.Let me now turn to South Asia  my own region consisting of seven States and accounting for over 1 billionpeople. Some 12 years ago  I had the pleasure ofinaugurating  in Colombo  the first meeting to launch theSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation(SAARC). Since then  it has been a matter of constantsatisfaction to note the steady development of regionalcooperation in South Asia. Today  we had the pleasure ofhearing the Prime Minister of Bangladesh  current Chairmanof SAARC  under whose able leadership SAARC is movingforward. Last year  during the period of our chairmanship Sri Lanka guided SAARC in several new directions. Theseincluded poverty alleviation  the establishment of the SouthAsian Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA)  the SouthAsia Development Fund and a Charter for Children. In SriLanka’s view  SAARC should now extend its horizonbeyond economic and social cooperation.With a view to sharing our regional experience with theinternational community  Sri Lanka supports the subject ofpoverty alleviation as a major theme for consideration at theforthcoming World Social Summit. It is our firm convictionthat structural adjustment programmes in developingcountries must provide a safety net for the poorest of thepoor until the fruits of economic growth are widelydistributed throughout society.Yesterday  we commemorated the third anniversary ofthe World Summit for Children. Within SAARC  we havealready set ourselves certain attainable mid-decade goals formeeting the basic needs of the children of South Asia. Wewelcome the World Conference on Women in Beijing as anopportunity to focus world attention on issues related towomen and development.As an island nation  Sri Lanka has special interest ininternational endeavours to create a new legal regime of theoceans. In 1971  the declaration of the Indian Ocean as azone of peace was proposed by Sri Lanka. The world scenehas since changed and the time has now come to examinenew  alternative approaches. Yet another regional initiativeby Sri Lanka is the Indian Ocean Marine Affairs Conference(IOMAC)  a cooperative endeavour to develop the region’smarine resources.The commitment of the Sri Lanka Government toensuring the human rights of all our citizens is central to allour policies  and we will maintain our policy of candidcooperation with the United Nations. The dictates ofhumanitarian law must be respected. Where economicsanctions are invoked as a tool of punitive action  let usensure that the humanitarian needs of the people of thecountry involved are fully protected.Neither the end of the cold war nor the new thrust ofeconomic liberalism has in any way diminished Sri Lanka’scommitment to non-aligned principles. At the JakartaSummit  there was a consensus that the political campaignsagainst racism  colonialism and apartheid had now beenlargely completed. The central unresolved issue of our timeremains the economic disparities between the developed andthe developing countries. Economic interdependence is aglobal reality. We reiterate the Non-Aligned Movement’sappeal to the developed countries to consider favourably thecall for a new compact on development between the Northand the South  a new liberal democratic partnership forglobal economic solutions. There is now a relativeabundance of liquidity in private markets. Access to theseresources is not easily affordable for the developingcountries because of the private market rates. A mechanismis therefore needed to bridge what is available and what isaffordable. Such an initiative is most urgent in view of theeconomic difficulties facing developing countries.Furthermore  today there is increased need for globaleconomic cooperation owing to the emergence of many newStates. All the needed assistance must be provided for thesenew States to complete their journey to democracy. But thismust not be achieved at the expense of other developingcountries.In South Asia  we have embarked on policies ofexport-led growth and trade and foreign-exchangeliberalization. We have done so despite the severe effects onus of unfavourable trends in commodity prices andprotectionist measures in the markets of developed countries.Our efforts at national and regional levels will succeed onlyif there is a reciprocal commitment to free-trade policies atthe international level. In this connection  it is imperativethat the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations be concludedsoon  in a fair and just manner. We hope that theindustrialized countries will be able to resolve the issues thatdivide them. At the same time  however  they must notconcentrate on their own problems to the exclusion of abalanced result for all participants in the negotiations.Sri Lanka is an island nation with a unique commitmentto social welfare. For many years  it needed virtually nobudget for defence. When terrorism broke out in such force many thought Sri Lanka would disintegrate.Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 39Most recently  the world was shocked by the brutalassassination of President Ranasinghe Premadasa  the dulyelected Head of State. This act of terrorism  aimed atdestabilizing the country  was confounded by the peacefultransfer of power within 24 hours  thus vindicating thestrength and maturity of Sri Lanka’s constitutional anddemocratic system.The Government has never wavered from its objectiveof seeking a political solution to the North-East conflict. Imyself have spent some 14 months negotiating with armedgroups  to find a peaceful solution acceptable to all. Duringthese 14 months  there was peace in the North and the Eastbut  unfortunately  at the end of this period these groupsbroke off negotiations for reasons undisclosed to me. I alsopresided for one and a half years over the All-PartyConference  which examined the question of a politicalsolution for over eight months.A Select Committee of Parliament  chaired by anOpposition Member of Parliament  has been working overmany months to reach a political settlement. Thus thesearch for a political solution continues. In the thick of theconflict we have maintained the flow of food  medical andother supplies  and services such as education and health tothe affected areas. Many have acknowledged that this is anexceptional achievement.On the economic front  the Government has steadfastlyfollowed open economic policies since 1977. As a result Sri Lanka is today well on the road to attaining newlyindustrialized-economy status. Foreign investment recordeda quantum jump last year  clearly reflecting investorconfidence in Sri Lanka’s economic stability andpredictability. It is our firm conviction that in amulti-ethnic  multicultural society  sustained economicgrowth is the best defence against divisive forces.When I addressed the Assembly in 1988  I suggestedthat we project our vision beyond this building  and beyondthe resolutions and speeches  to focus on the impact of ourwork on the millions of people we represent.It would be wise to remind ourselves that themaintenance of world peace is multidimensional and theUnited Nations political agenda must go hand in hand withits development agenda.Our nations are all travellers together on the road to thefuture. How will the future judge us? It will not be by ourmilitary victories and parades of power  nor by our eloquentdebates and sophisticated slogans. We will be judged by oursuccess in turning weapons into tools of development  inbanishing poverty  hunger  disease and ignorance and inlearning to live in a sustainable environment in harmonywith a fragile and finite world."
"99",4207,"LSO",48,1993,"On behalf of the Lesothodelegation and on my own behalf  I wish to congratulateAmbassador Insanally on his election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. Hiselection is a well-deserved tribute to his great personalqualities and also to the dynamic role that the Republic ofGuyana has always played within the United Nations and inworld affairs. We are also indebted to the dedication andthe effective manner in which his predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of the Republic of Bulgaria guided the deliberations of this lofty body during the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly.Allow me also to extend our congratulations to thatdistinguished son of Africa  His Excellency Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of the United Nations whose untiring global efforts for peace continue to inspire usall. My delegation wishes to reiterate once more itsreadiness to continue to cooperate with him in every waythat would promote international cooperation andunderstanding  in conformity with the Charter of ourOrganization.On behalf of my delegation  allow me also to express like those who have spoken before me  deepest condolencesto the Government and the people of the Republic of Indiafor the tragic loss of human lives resulting from the recentearthquake in that country.Since 1945 the membership of the United Nations hasincreased dramatically  lending credence to the universalityof this Organization and bearing out the wisdom of thefounding fathers. Today we welcome the new Members toa United Nations whose numerical strength is matched bythe broadened scope of its vision  the depth of itscommitment to global issues and the capacity of itsoperations world wide which  more than ever before  itbehooves us all to enhance further. We also look forward towelcoming back into the fold a free  democratic andnon-racial Republic of South Africa in the very near future.With the emergence of the new world order  we aretoday at a high tide of opportunity to realize the vision ofglobal peace that inspired the United Nations Charter in1945. The original design for peace  as outlined in theCharter in 1945  seems to be in sight with the emergence ofthat new world order.Forty-eighth session - 8 October l993 11The commendable efforts made by theSecretary-General towards the promotion of internationalpeace and security and for the consolidation of peacefulcoexistence among nations are about to bear results.Following the period characterized by international relationsof confrontation between the military blocs of East andWest  we see around us today an increasing recognitionamong nations of the need for the settlement of internationaland regional problems by peaceful means  that is  throughnegotiation and dialogue. All these developments augur wellfor the realization of the goals and objectives we set forourselves in San Francisco in 1945.Recent developments  however  continue to test ourOrganization’s capacity to make the initiative of 1945 areality. New challenges have emerged and continue toconfront us. Though different in nature and content fromthose of the past  they are no less important in their bearing scope and influence on peace and the future of mankind.The beginning of this last decade of the century heldout hope for international peace and stability. The worldcommunity lifted itself from the trenches of the cold war pledging to build for mankind a new world order firmlybased on legitimacy  cooperation and respect for the rightsand dignity of the human person. The residual tendencies toconfrontation were also collectively suppressed by the unitedworld action in the Gulf.The euphoria of a world finally at peace has not regrettably  been universal. From Angola to Somalia toBosnia and Herzegovina and  recently  in the politicalstandoff in the Russian Federation  we witness a worldhaunted anew by disputes originating from legacies of thepast. The destructiveness and brutality of internal wars arethreatening to unweave the very tapestry on whichcivilization is based.As it stands on the eve of celebrating the golden jubileeof the Charter  the world body must recognize the need forincreased resources and more balanced burden-sharingamong Member States in order to strengthen the capacity ofthe United Nations to fulfil effectively its peacemaking andpeace-keeping obligations. It must continue to pursue moreresolutely the objectives of the Charter  all of which stipulatethat the realization of peace and development are legitimateaspirations of all peoples.In the past we have talked about the urgent need for thedemocratization and restructuring of the United Nations. Inthis regard  we take note of the commendable efforts whichare being made by the Secretary-General to strengthen thestructures of the other organs of the Organization within thecontext of ""An Agenda for Peace"" and through regionalcommissions.In the aftermath of the cold war and at a time wheninternational relations are being reshaped  it is necessary thatthe imbalances inherent in the present United Nations systembe reviewed and corrected. Such an exercise should takeinto account the principles of decentralization of resourcesand equitable geographical representation in the decision-making organs of the world body. Like a world parliament the United Nations must reflect in its structures the samedemocratic values that it advocates  the values of fairness transparency and equitable representation  in order tovalidate the principle of equality of States.The need for democratization extends  in particular  tothe Security Council. The African continent accounts foralmost one third of the United Nations membership. In thespirit of reflecting the regional diversity of our Organization we must consider positively the interest of Africa in beingallotted at least two permanent seats on the Security Counciland an increased number of non-permanent seats.Never before in the history of the United Nations hasthe world been presented with a greater opportunity forpeace. The challenge of this opportunity will require us toconduct international relations with the vision and realism ofpeople who recognize how near  in the past  the world hasbeen to the edge of the precipice.The United Nations global peace-keeping missions area beacon of hope and a source of inspiration to peace-lovingcommunities world wide that are ravaged by war and strifeand in many cases have nowhere else to turn. But even inthese trying times  a great opportunity exists  an opportunitypossibly greater than any the world community of nationshas seen since the founding of this Organization for thecreation and maintenance of global peace.Notwithstanding the positive initiative taken by themajor nuclear Powers since the end of the cold war  there isstill a need to establish a close link between disarmamentand international peace in the years ahead. This is the idealformula to fulfil the aspirations of mankind for a life that isfree from the threat of war. To be effective towards thisend  disarmament must be universal and embrace allcategories of weapons  including conventional weapons.We also recognize that the global reduction of militaryexpenditures could enable the world to redirect its resourcesto development and to meet the challenge of reversing the12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionenvironmental degradation of our planet on the eve of thetwenty-first century.The hopes of the world were placed last year in theUnited Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment (UNCED). The Earth Summit broke freshground in addressing global environmental and developmentcrises. While it did not solve these problems  it at leastsucceeded in building a large amount of goodwill for theglobal economic partnership that is so vital if addressing themany environmental problems that the UNCED processrecognized and  indeed  highlighted  are to be addressed.More than a year after the Rio Conference  theestablishment of the high-level Commission on SustainableDevelopment remains the most tangible development so far.The majority of the commitments made by worldGovernments in Rio are yet to be matched with actual deeds.The global trends towards the reduction of aid budgets bythe developed countries and the intensifying commercial andpolitical pressure on aid administration contrast sharply withthe commitments made by these countries in Rio to reachthe United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross nationalproduct in aid towards assisting the developing countriesmake a transition to sustainable development.Another source of great disappointment is thecontinuing decline in voluntary contributions to the UnitedNations operational activities. The United Nations systemhas a central role to play in channelling assistance todeveloping countries  capitalizing on its comparativeadvantages of neutrality  widespread field-level presence andrapid response.The least developed countries are continuing toexperience a deterioration of their socio-economic situationowing to profound structural constraints and handicaps whichreduce their ability to overcome the negative impact ofexternal factors. The issue of the stalemate in multilateraltrade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT) is a matter of great concern to thedeveloping countries. Further delays towards successful balanced and comprehensive GATT negotiations will renderthe principle of trade as the engine of growth anddevelopment an illusion. These basic economic structuralproblems  coupled with a proneness to natural disasters seriously hamper these countries’ efforts towards meaningfuleconomic growth.The recent drought which struck the countries ofeastern and southern Africa was the worst ever. In Lesotho the Government has had to declare a state of continuingdrought emergency and to extend provision of drought-reliefmeasures for another year  until June 1994. We wish toexpress our gratitude to the Secretary-General and his teamfor their efforts in convening  jointly with the SouthernAfrican Development Community  a donors’ conference inGeneva last year to address the drought problem. Similarly we wish to thank the international community for itsdemonstration of solidarity with our region at a time ofdesperate need.The Kingdom of Lesotho welcomes the Secretary-General’s report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277).This document contains far-reaching recommendations onpeacemaking  peace-building and peace-keeping. However the implementation of these recommendations will fall shortof attaining the intended results fully if they are notcomplemented with efforts to harness and reverse the furtherdeterioration in peoples’ socio-economic situations. It is onthis basis that my delegation lends its full support to GeneralAssembly resolution 47/181 on the ""Agenda forDevelopment"". We stand ready to engage in constructivedebate on the Secretary-General’s preliminary report on ""AnAgenda for Development"".The world today faces profound changes  which arefuelled by the deep desire of people across the globe forrespect for their basic human rights  for democracy  forpublic accountability and good governance. Thedemocratically elected Government of the Kingdom ofLesotho embraces the idea and concept of nationalreconciliation  for which the people of Lesotho have yearnedfor so long. The Government has also embarked on avigorous campaign to inculcate and nurture the culture ofdemocracy  respect for basic human rights and popularparticipation  which should  in turn  have an impact on socialmobilization for development  democratic institution-building  political stability and national prosperity.The new Government views the 1993 general electionand the overwhelming popular mandate it received for thestewardship of the nation’s affairs as a golden opportunity toaddress  with fresh impetus  the urgent national issues ofpoverty  ignorance and disease. We therefore wish to makea special appeal to the donor community to lend a helpinghand to our efforts in this regard  in the considered beliefthat democracy and development are complementary.On behalf of the Government and the peace-lovingpeople of Lesotho  I wish to express our gratitude for theprompt and generous support and assistance we receivedfrom the international community towards the success of ourreturn to democratic civilian rule.Forty-eighth session - 8 October l993 13The situation in South Africa is always a cause forconcern in Lesotho  as South Africa is our only immediateneighbour. Despite our concern with the ever-rising levelsof violence and the increasing resolve by the right-wingelements to engage in sabotage in South Africa  we areencouraged by what has been achieved through negotiationsin that country. In particular  we applaud the agreementreached by the negotiating parties on the date of the end ofApril 1994 for the holding of the first democratic electionsas well as the establishment of the Transitional ExecutiveCouncil to oversee the transitional arrangements prior toelections. While we acknowledge and support the call forthe lifting of economic sanctions against South Africa  weurge the United Nations to upgrade the United Nationsmonitoring team in South Africa in order to give effectivemeaning to the Secretary-General’s report ""An Agenda forPeace"" and its central message of preventive diplomacy peace-building and peacemaking.It is our fervent hope that the lessons of the Kingdomof Lesotho’s peaceful transition to democracy will not belost on the citizens of South Africa  whose own chance toelect a Government of their choice for the first time seemswithin reach.The people of Angola  another sister country in thesubregion  continue to be denied a chance for peace byUNITA. We condemn UNITA for the escalation of themilitary actions and for the continued massacre of innocentcivilians and the destruction of the infrastructure in Angola.We appreciate the efforts of the Secretary-General and takenote of Security Council resolution 851 (1993)  whichimposes a number of sanctions intended to limit the abilityof UNITA to continue with its war effort.We also wish to applaud the decision by the UnitedStates to recognize and establish diplomatic contact with theGovernment of Angola  as well as the subsequent positiveinitiatives for peace taken by the United States in Angola.Mozambique is currently enjoying relative peace. TheGeneral Peace Agreement signed in Rome is holding  andthe parties have continued to exercise restraint. We appealto the parties concerned to implement the peace accordswithout delay and to cooperate with the Secretary-General’sSpecial Representative in full  including the timelyimplementation of the mandate of the United NationsOperation in Mozambique.In Liberia  we are optimistic that the collaborationbetween the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia(UNOMIL) and the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) Military Observer Group (ECOMOG) together with the Peace Agreement signed in Cotonou inJuly 1993  will bring lasting peace and that the warringfactions will stop hostilities and agree on a transitionalarrangement to lead the country to democratic elections.Last  but not least  it is heartening to see real hope ofa solution to one of the bloodiest  most impassioned andmost obdurate conflicts of our time in the Middle East. Thesigning last month of the peace accord between the State ofIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization is a victoryfor common sense and the validation of peaceful methods inresolving disputes between States. The virtue of this mutualachievement is that it puts coexistence to a test in reality andnot in mere exchange of rhetoric.None of this  however  should distract the world fromthe reaffirmation of the right of the Palestinian people tonationhood in accordance with the relevant Security Councilresolutions.During the World Conference on Human Rights  heldin June this year  the whole world converged in Vienna todiscuss human rights issues. Although the WorldConference was inundated with diverse interpretations ofhuman rights  a great deal of progress was made. Mydelegation believes that the international community shouldrededicate itself to the Vienna Declaration and Programmeof Action as the central document in the effectiveimplementation of existing human rights instruments andcommit itself to the principles enshrined in the Charter ofthe United Nations and the Universal Declaration of HumanRights.In conclusion  my delegation would wish to emphasizeonce again that it remains for us to join hands and striveresolutely in all spheres of human endeavour to ensure thevery survival of current and succeeding generations. Let thisOrganization remain the burning light of hope andinspiration for all mankind. For all its differences  and forall its diversity  ours is a world of interdependence anddestinies inextricably joined. Let us renew our resolve topursue to the end the lofty purposes and principles of theCharter of our Organization."
"100",4233,"LTU",48,1993,"Allow me to congratulateMr. Insanally on his election as President of the forty-eighthsession of the General Assembly and to wish him muchsuccess in heading this august body.It is a great honour to speak in this historic Hall  inwhich  as nowhere else  all the victories and concerns of theworld  all its problems and opportunities  are concentrated.The voice of Lithuania  which had been muffled for half acentury  can now be heard loud and clear throughout theworld. Lithuania  with a long tradition of statehood datingback to the thirteenth century  regained its independencethrough the determination of our people  certain fundamentalchanges in the world and international support.Our State is consolidating democracy. It respectshuman and minority rights  and strives to ensure socialprogress and an improved standard of living founded on freemarket principles. By participating in the activities of theUnited Nations and other international organizations  wehope to contribute to a better world.We have an opportunity to voice our concerns and toobtain support not only at the United Nations  but also at theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) the Council of Europe  the North Atlantic CooperationCouncil and other international organizations. Inestablishing friendly relations with other countries  Lithuaniahas felt the supportive and increasing influence ofinternational organizations in the process of democratizationand in the creation of a free market economy. We trust thatthe following international Conferences sponsored by theUnited Nations - the International Conference on Populationand Development  the World Summit for SocialDevelopment and the Fourth World Conference on Women- will help us find lasting solutions to these concerns.Since parliamentary elections held last autumn theGovernment in Lithuania has changed. Our chosen coursein foreign policy  however  in the tradition of democraticStates  has not altered. Our foreign policy priorities remainclose cooperation with the other Baltic States of Latvia andEstonia  as well as with the countries of northern Europe and full integration into Europe’s political  economic security and cultural sphere.Lithuania is seeking in particular friendly and mutuallybeneficial relations with neighbouring Russia  Poland andBelarus. Lithuania supports President Boris Yeltsin’s effortsto stabilize the political situation in his country and tomaintain the course of reform. We are essentially in fullagreement with the position of other democratic Statesregarding recent events in Russia.Like its other neighbours  Lithuania is seeking its placeon the new map of Europe  and we hope for closercooperation between the countries of the Baltic Sea region.An important aspect of such cooperation  and of Lithuania’srelations with Russia  is our relationship with theKaliningrad region. The gradual demilitarization of thatregion  the development of a free trade zone there and theincreased influence that international organizations especially the European Community  have on its future arein Lithuania’s best interest and  we believe  in the interestsof other States in the area.In the long term  the shores of the Baltic Sea should befree of armaments. Measures should be taken now toincrease trust and security. Our chosen path - a gradualcoming together of the nations and States of the Balticregion and good relations between neighbours - should leadus to the European Community and contribute to theconsolidation of security on the old continent.14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe shortest road from Paris  Berlin and Warsaw toMoscow and St. Petersburg leads through Lithuania. Formany centuries  however  the vehicles of war of attacking orretreating armies rolled across these crossroads  bringingwith them many misfortunes and tragedies. Today  however we hope that convoys of goods will roll across our territory.We believe  and are working to ensure  that our complexgeopolitical situation in a new Europe - a Europe no longertorn apart by antagonistic ideologies - should become asource of new opportunities  benefits and prosperity. We areinspired by the example of countries such as Denmark Switzerland  Austria and others  which have successfullytaken advantage of similar situations and the opportunitiesoffered by a more unified Europe.Having restored its independence  Lithuania has onceagain become a participant in the processes of a moreunified Europe. Lithuania is receptive to cooperation withthe West and the East  and sees future opportunities in suchcooperation.Despite the great distances that separate us  relationswith the United States have been  and will continue to be especially significant for Lithuania. We are grateful to theUnited States for resolutely adhering to the policy ofnon-recognition of the illegal incorporation of Lithuania intothe Soviet Union. A sizeable emigré community  whichfound refuge in the new world  links our two countries. Wevalue close United States cooperation with Europe  includingthat with the structures of the CSCE and the North AtlanticTreaty Organization  and we sincerely wish every success forefforts to stabilize the situation in a changing world and toencourage the progress of post-Communist countries towarddemocracy and a free market.We turn to the United Nations  asking it to safeguardthe interests of small States. The future of a more integratedworld lies in democracy and in the individuality of freenations. The international community should be prepared todefend  with force if necessary  the sovereignty of small -even the smallest - nations. During his recent visit toLithuania  Pope John Paul II stressed that""the interests of large States should never force smallStates to become satellites of a foreign Power"".In spite of the conflicts that now plague the world  it isfortunate that some good news also reaches this house inNew York. We welcome the peace processes in the MiddleEast and the positive trends in South Africa  Cambodia Haiti and El Salvador.On 31 August  in compliance with General Assemblyresolution 47/21 of 1992  the last remaining units of theRussian army were withdrawn from Lithuania. I should liketo take this opportunity to thank representatives from all thecountries  large and small  that supported our legitimate goal.I should also like to sincerely thank the United Nations andSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who monitored thefulfilment of the obligation to withdraw that army  and who during the most critical moments  sent his envoy Ambassador Tommy Koh  to Vilnius  and Mr. StoyanGanev  President of the forty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly  who visited Lithuania and the other Baltic Statesin July to discuss the army’s withdrawal. We were gladwhen  having made it just in time for the ceremony markingthe departure of the last Russian troops  Ambassador Kohsaid:""My work in Lithuania is done  although some work iswaiting for me in the other Baltic States.""When a large State withdraws its army from a smallone without issuing any ultimatums or setting conditions this signals a new era for the world in which  thanks tointernational efforts in accordance with the principles of theUnited Nations Charter  even the most sensitive problemscan be solved peacefully. Despite several disagreements thatarose at the last minute  calm and balanced diplomacyallowed Lithuania and Russia to reach agreement on thisfundamental question.On more than one occasion I had the pleasure ofspeaking openly and sincerely with President Boris Yeltsinof the Russian Federation. A fresh page is being turned inthe relations between our two countries. Of course  the issueof compensation for damage inflicted during the years ofoccupation is still on the agenda for negotiations betweenLithuania and Russia.The Russian army still remains in Estonia and Latvia.We believe that with the help of the United Nations thisinternational problem will be resolved successfully and  atthe same time  the stability of the region will be bolstered.Until people become fully aware of the possibilities thatdemocracy and freedom provide these ideas will remain justthat - ideas. After an initial wave of euphoria  disillusionmay follow. One can already notice this in some post-communist countries. This causes me  as President ofLithuania  great concern. I do not think that the worldcommunity can afford to remain indifferent to this problem.Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 15A democratic and civic State  based on the rule of law in which people are not segregated according to theirnationality or religious and political beliefs  is beingestablished in Lithuania. There is no tension in our countrybetween Lithuanians and ethnic minorities. We arereforming and stabilizing the Lithuanian economy; we aresearching for ways to provide at least minimal social welfareguarantees; as much as possible we are trying to clear theway for private initiative. We cannot  however  change oureconomy overnight. The Lithuanian people are patient andindustrious  working hard for their well-being and future.However  disillusion with democracy and the free marketwould be disastrous.Therefore I wish to speak very frankly to this body:even though we feel the concern and support of the worldcommunity  that is not enough. It appears that even themost authoritative international organizations lack thecoordinated action and initiative for truly effectiveassistance. We occasionally feel isolationist tendencies onthe part of the most industrialized nations; having attained ahigh standard of living  they attempt to dissociate themselvesfrom the countries of Eastern and Central Europe. Thisgreatly complicates the future of these countries as theyattempt to solve by themselves the difficult economic political  psychological  cultural and historical problems thatthey have inherited from the recent past. In mostpost-communist countries there still prevails a nostalgia forthe past  when authoritarian government guaranteed peopletheir minimum needs  albeit at the expense of their freedom.Without timely and joint efforts  this nostalgia for apseudo-socialistic past could cause the development ofcertain countries to follow a course that would beunacceptable to all of us.For several years now  both in Europe and NorthAmerica  the idea of a new ""Marshall Plan"" has been in theair  but it has in no way materialized. Yet investments inthe countries of Central and Eastern Europe - and I have inmind not only financial investments - would really beinvestments in all of our futures. Greater and more effectiveassistance for the democratic forces in post-communist Stateswould help decisively to rid the world of the remnants oftotalitarianism and dictatorship that have so tormentedmankind in the twentieth century.With the dissolution of two hostile blocs  the world hasbecome a safer place. However  that does not solve all thesecurity problems that mankind now faces. Indeed  thenumber of such problems has increased. There is now agreater possibility of localized conflicts: they have flared upin precisely those places where dictatorships that suppressednations have fallen. Such horrendous practices as ""ethniccleansing"" must be severely condemned. The model of anabsolutely closed nation-State is no longer a viable one forthe solution of separate national problems.The Lithuanian people respect the struggle of nationsfor their freedom  but they condemn atrocities which occurunder the guise of a noble cause. The tragedy of what wasformerly Yugoslavia is truly horrible. We approve of themeans that the United Nations uses to uphold peace andsecurity  but too often resolution of the structure of a Stateand border issues are left to warring countries to decide byforce of arms. In the future the United Nations shouldpursue even more actively preventive diplomacy to stopconflicts before they erupt. Every illegal and violent actrequires a response  not appeasement.The Secretary-General’s ""An Agenda for Peace"" is awelcome plan that provides a solid foundation. What shouldthe new role of the United Nations be in an ever-changingworld? As I see it  in future the Organization must not onlybe a guarantor of security  but also an instigator of economicdevelopment and a global defender of human and ethnicminority rights. At the Vienna Conference on HumanRights  we spoke out in favour of establishing the post ofhigh commissioner for human rights. At this time  ideasabout the sovereignty of States  the self-determination ofnations  national security and the maintenance andenforcement of peace are changing rapidly. The individualproblems of individual States are becoming global in scope especially in the areas of environmental protection  refugees narcotics and organized crime. For precisely that reason cooperation among neighbouring States is growing inimportance.Regional interaction is broadening and the role ofinternational organizations is being extended. We approveof regional structures and arrangements that help toguarantee peace and stability in their respective regions.However  their activities should be linked with UnitedNations supervision  so that large and powerful nations donot transform such regional structures into instruments ofdomination. I am referring to failed States. They needinternational assistance that would not force upon them theprotectorate of another State or provide conditions forassimilating them into some sort of sphere of influence  butwould respect and protect their sovereignty andindependence. Small countries have a right to rely on a firmguarantee of security. The United Nations could and shouldbecome that guarantee. In the long-term future  asdemocracy and cooperation become firmly established16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionthroughout our planet  the United Nations would perhapsassume certain functions of a world government.I reiterate my support for Lithuania’s proposal  whichwas outlined here at the United Nations exactly one yearago  that new permanent members could be added to theSecurity Council. For the United Nations to achieve itsobjective  it is important to continue and even expand thesystem reforms that are now being put into effect to increasecost-efficiency. We welcome the initiatives by severalcountries  among them the United States  to establish moredependable internal and external inspection machinery. Thesuggested creation of an office of inspector-general couldhelp to assure Member States that the mandates that we haveprovided for various programmes are put to the mosteffective use possible.I should like to state clearly that the current financialcrisis of the United Nations is of great concern to Lithuania.We are not indifferent to it. Lithuania is firmly resolved tofulfil its obligations to the Organization and it hasdemonstrated its readiness to do so. Lithuania could supportthe activities of the Organization even more strongly if forthree years now we had not been forced repeatedly todiscuss the difficult problem of assessments with regard tothe United Nations budget. Our delegation  along with othercountries that have found themselves in a similar situation has on more than one occasion suggested ways in which thisproblem could be solved. I wish to emphasize that theposition of Lithuania remains unchanged. The scale ofassessments must be determined on the basis of statisticaldata provided by each State  in accordance with its capacityto pay and  most important  abiding by the principle that thesame methodology for calculating assessments must beapplied to all States equally. In seeking to ensure theseprinciples and finally to resolve this problem  we areprepared to exchange ideas with  and we hope for thecooperation of  all delegations.I reiterate my support for Lithuania’s proposal  madehere at the United Nations exactly a year ago  that newpermanent members could be added to the Security Council.Lithuania not only supports peace-keeping efforts  but wouldlike eventually to become a contributor to military andcivilian operations.When Lithuania became a member of the Council ofEurope I suggested a meeting of all the Heads of State ofpost-communist countries. This would not be an attempt tocreate some sort of new bloc or to console each other aboutour economic hardships. Such a conference  under theauspices of the Council of Europe or perhaps some otherorganization  could provide an opportunity to discuss in adown-to-earth way how to recover more quickly from themaladies of national egoism and ethnocentricity that may beunavoidable in young States and fragile democracies. All ofus in post-communist countries should  as quickly aspossible  learn how to cooperate among ourselves and withthe rest of the world and strive to be better full-fledgedmembers of our planet’s democratic community. Othercountries have learned the art of cooperation over decades.We have not had that much time. It is very important thatwe succeed through a joint effort in making this period asbrief as possible.We welcome the initiative by some Members of theUnited Nations to establish a forum for new and restoreddemocracies. It is our sincere hope that this movement begun in the Philippines  will help bring developingcountries and countries in transition closer together  so thatthey may reach common approaches down the path todemocracy and a free market.The spirit of the approaching twenty-first centuryalready fills this Hall. At the turn of the third millenniummankind is faced with critical global problems that threatenits very existence: ecological  social and spiritual problemsand the nuclear threat  which has not yet been abolished.National and regional problems seem to pale in comparison but I do not think that that is really the case. Every steptowards progress  even if taken in a small country or withregard to improved relations between two States  diminishesthe possibility of global conflict  and vice versa. I shouldtherefore like to believe that the withdrawal of the Russianmilitary from Lithuania was an achievement for more thanjust two countries. The entire world became somewhatbetter  somewhat more just  and the threat that hung over itwas abated.I think that there will be more and more such successes.The United Nations system contributes  and will continue tocontribute  significantly to their attainment."
"101",4277,"LUX",48,1993,"First of all  I should like toextend to the President of the General Assembly at thisforty-eighth session my sincere congratulations on hiselection. He was unanimously supported for this positionbecause of his excellent qualities; and his election is also atribute to his country  Guyana.Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  our Secretary-General  alsodeserves our wholehearted thanks and appreciation for hisconstant and resolute efforts in implementing the decisionsof our Organization and applying the principles of ourCharter.The already very broad universality of the UnitedNations has been further strengthened - and I welcome this -with the admission of six new countries: the CzechRepublic  the Slovak Republic  Eritrea  The FormerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia  Monaco and Andorra.Mr. Willy Claes  the Belgian Minister for ForeignAffairs  yesterday expressed the views of the EuropeanCommunity and its member States. I shall therefore be ablein this statement to focus on a few matters of particularconcern to my Government.Three years ago  from this very rostrum  we welcomedthe end of the East-West confrontation and its corollary  theend of the threat of nuclear annihilation. Throughout theworld  democracy and respect for the state of law wereprogressing in a most encouraging way. But givendevelopments in the last few years  it would seem that weshould somehow dampen our enthusiasm.Changes in the balance of forces between the Powersthat dominated the old order have allowed nationalism andregionalism to develop. In some cases  this has led to thedestabilization of entire regions following upon rivalriesbetween neighbors  ethnic tension and religious fanaticism.Nationalism is of course not in and of itself evil. It isin some sense a logical manifestation of feelings of prideand self-confidence which can finally express themselvesafter long years of oppression during which free speech wasforcibly repressed.But once the legitimate expression of this regainedpride of a people is transformed into open hostility towardseverything that is different  then nationalism carries withinitself the seeds of grave danger.Extreme nationalism can be seen in many places whether it be in the territory of the former Soviet Union orthe former Yugoslavia  where it has found its mostintolerable expression. It leads to explosions of violence armed aggression  acts of terrorism and unspeakablesuffering for the civilian populations.Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 31Ethnic conflicts are proliferating in all regions of theworld. In Western Europe itself  it can be seen in theresurgence of racist and xenophobic incidents.As a challenge to the primacy of law and to respect forhuman rights  extreme nationalism constitutes a threat to theinternational order.A clear and coherent strategy is necessary to respond tothis challenge.First of all  education with regard to tolerance should berenewed; and  secondly  legal protection for minorities mustbe ensured.The principles and rules drawn up in this area by theCouncil of Europe and the Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe might suggest some solutions. Newinstruments are to be defined next week at the summit of theCouncil of Europe. The plan for stability in Europe is partof this same approach.Thirdly - and this is the most important action to betaken - we must do everything possible at the national regional and international levels to strengthendemocratization and to promote protection for human rights.It is on the basis of these principles  focused on the freeexpression of peoples and the development of democraticstructures  that the United Nations has proposed solutionsand agreements to resolve the conflicts which are beingsubmitted to it in ever-increasing numbers.The Government of Luxembourg expresses its deepsatisfaction over the agreement on mutual recognition andthe agreement on the autonomy of occupied territoriesconcluded between Israel and the Palestinian LiberationOrganization.We should like to pay tribute to those who forged theagreements  in particular Prime Minister Rabin  his ForeignMinister Peres and President Arafat. They have given theworld a lesson in courage and clarity of vision and inpolitical realism as well.The developments we have witnessed are of a historicsignificance comparable to that of the collapse of the BerlinWall. They fundamentally change the facts of the MiddleEast; they have launched a process of reconciliation in orderto put an end to an explosive  untenable and unjust situation.In a region devastated by more than 40 years of war violence and hatred  a window is now opening on a morepeaceful and democratic future. The still fragile dynamicthat has been created must be strengthened without delay.This can first be achieved by the conclusion of peaceagreements between Israel and its neighbours: Lebanon Jordan and Syria. The Government of Luxembourgencourages the leaders concerned to overcome the lastobstacles and to open the way to normalization of theirrelations with Israel.The Israelis and the Palestinians must then act togetherand in good faith  with the solidarity of the regional andinternational community to implement successfully theagreement on autonomy in the occupied territories  the firststep towards a comprehensive settlement. The firstcontributor of funds  the European Community and itsmember States  is prepared to increase cooperation on behalfof a population that must be helped to emerge from povertyand build a more dignified and prosperous future. OurGovernment will participate fully in that effort.Thanks to the United Nations  peace was restored inNamibia and Nicaragua three years ago.Today in Cambodia the effort led by the United Nationshas enabled the people of an ancient culture  humiliated bydecades of bloody oppression and foreign occupation  toparticipate on a mass scale in free and open elections. Byconsolidating a State of law and national reconciliation  thecountry will be able to rebuild itself.In Haiti a firm policy of close cooperation between theUnited Nations and the Organization of American States(OAS) has led to an agreement which provides for therestoration of democracy.In El Salvador the assistance of the United Nations wasdecisive in putting an end to the civil war and recommencingthe construction of a civilian society and the process ofnational reconciliation. Free elections in which allSalvadorians will be able to participate are to be held nextyear.In Somalia  however  intervention by the UnitedNations has demonstrated the limits of armed intervention ina tribal civil war in the absence of a political agreement anda cease-fire. Nevertheless  the difficulties encountered inMogadishu should not make us forget that the UnitedNations made an essential contribution to combating thefamine.32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionIn South Africa further decisive progress is being madetowards the definitive abolition of apartheid. I welcome theagreement on setting up a transitional body to draw up aprovisional Constitution and prepare for free elections inApril 1994. Only a shared determination and closecooperation between all the parties will make it possible tostop the deadly violence which continues to kill and whichjeopardizes the process of reconciliation.Significant progress towards restoring democracy andtowards national reconciliation has also been made in othercountries in Central America and in Africa.Those achievements  however imperfect  areencouraging  and demonstrate the role that our Organizationcan play in preserving peace and consolidating democraticregimes.The situation in the former Yugoslavia is still extremelydisturbing. Every day we see on television the barbarismthat accompanies ""ethnic cleansing"" and the bloodstaineddismemberment of Bosnia and Herzegovina -a country whichwas once an example of ethnic and religious coexistence.The agreement between the three Bosnian parties which has yet to be finalized  is admittedly complex and farfrom perfect. Yet it has the merit of opening up theprospect of putting an end to terror and violence. It offersa comprehensive arrangement for emerging from the crisis.Its success  which is far from being assured  presupposes areal desire on the part of the three parties to reach agreementand to carry out and abide by what is signed. The EuropeanCommunity and its member States  where necessary assistedby the Western European Union (WEU)  are ready tocontribute to implementation of the agreement  incooperation with the United Nations  the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO) and the Conference on Securityand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Sanctions could belifted when the various Security Council resolutions on theformer Yugoslavia have been implemented and when asatisfactory solution to the problem of minorities has beenfound.Overall  our Organization’s peace-keeping activitieshave reached an unprecedented level. Almost 80 000 BlueHelmets  military and civilian  are in the field in anunparalleled number of humanitarian missions and peace-keeping operations. I pay tribute to all those who serve thecause of peace and in particular to those who have lost theirlives during these actions. We have a duty to ensure bettersecurity for personnel.Luxembourg  itself born as a modern State of aninternational treaty guaranteed by the Powers of the time  isparticularly sensitive to the need for security and the need topreserve the peace. It has therefore contributed actively toUnited Nations peace-keeping operations  sending militarypersonnel and making suitable financial contributions. MyGovernment intends to continue this cooperation in thefuture.Luxembourg also firmly supports the efforts to step upUnited Nations activities in the area of preventivediplomacy. These efforts must be increased. Measures suchas fact-finding missions  the use of rapid alert systems  theestablishment of a rapid deployment group  and areinforcement of the roles of regional organizations could allbe very useful in preventing conflict. Once a conflict hasbeen unleashed it requires a much more costly interventionto ensure the restoration of peace.New cooperation is developing between the UnitedNations and regional organizations  which will increasinglybe called upon to carry out peace-keeping functions at theirlevel or to support and supplement United Nations activitiesin the area of collective security. The WEU  of which mycountry currently holds the presidency  is in the course ofdefining its role in peace-keeping operations. NATO and theCSCE are doing likewise.The preservation of peace and the promotion ofdemocracy and the rule of law go hand in hand with theprotection of human rights.Over the years  our Organization has succeeded indeveloping and progressively codifying human rights. Butthat is not enough; we must also see to it that these rightsare better respected. The annual reports of organizationsinvolved in the defence of human rights show that we arestill far from attaining that objective.We are pleased that the Vienna Conference on HumanRights allowed encouraging progress to be made. Theuniversality of human rights was clearly affirmed. Specificproposals were made for ensuring broader knowledge ofhuman rights  promoting them and respecting them. It isnow for this Assembly to approve those proposals  includingthe establishment of a High Commissioner for HumanRights.There is an indissoluble link between respect for humanrights and the promotion of democracy. Within the UnitedNations system this link takes concrete form in theOrganization’s growing activities in the area of technicalForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 33assistance and international supervision of electoralprocesses. I support the proposals by our Secretary-Generalto broaden these support activities to include theestablishment of a free press  political parties and anindependent judiciary.In this context  I welcome the decision taken byPresident Yeltsin to organize free elections in order to ensuredemocratic legitimacy for all State bodies in Russia.The United Nations must also increase its activities inthe economic  social and environmental areas. This will alsorequire the continued courageous reform of its structures andworking methods.We can have no lasting peace while peoples aresubjected to abject poverty and famine and while they haveno hope for progress towards greater justice and equality.Cooperation and trade: these are the two foci of a singlepolicy  which must be followed. In the past few years myGovernment has doubled the aid it designates fordevelopment and cooperation. We are in favour of the swiftconclusion of a balanced agreement in the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Such anagreement can provide at the world level a new impetus totrade and economic relations.Following the Rio Conference on Environment andDevelopment  the new Commission on SustainableDevelopment must be determined to ensure that thecommitments entered into at that Conference are followedup.The world’s population has more than doubled over thepast 40 years and according to estimates will double againin the next 30 years. The international community mustengage in a thorough analysis of the consequences of thatlevel of growth - for example  the problems of refugees urban concentration  and the enormous constraints in theareas of food  housing  health and education. That is whythe Conference on Population and Development to be heldin Cairo in 1994 has such importance.It is not surprising that social problems are becomingincreasingly important at a time when many economies arefacing difficult adjustment processes and others are carryingout a delicate transition from a planned economy to a marketeconomy. Moreover  all recently published reports confirmthat there is a disturbing increase in the gap between therichest sectors and the poorest sectors of populations  bothwithin countries and between countries.The World Summit for Social Development which willtake place in 1995 will  if it is adequately prepared  offer theinternational community an opportunity to develop a strategyto combat poverty and to ensure the better distribution ofwealth.More than a year ago the Secretary-General issued hisreport ""An Agenda for Peace""  which was designed tostrengthen the Organization’s capacities in the area ofpreventive diplomacy and the maintenance and restoration ofpeace. Some of the proposals it contains are already beingapplied in practice  but others are still pending. We hopethat the current review of the Agenda will lead to specificresults that can meet the Organization’s needs.Reform of the Security Council is a delicate issuewhich touches on the very heart of international post-warcooperation. The Council has now been in operation for50 years  and the time has come to have a candid and in-depth discussion of the question. The fiftieth anniversary ofthe Organization in 1995 could offer us a good opportunityto do this.The second crisis facing the United Nations - and thispoint has been emphasized in all the statements made hereso far - is the chronic budget deficit. To put it bluntly  theUnited Nations is bordering on insolvency. This is all themore astonishing in that the annual budget of theOrganization is about the same as that of a medium-sizedcity.The legal obligation that binds all Member Statesmakes it incumbent on them to pay their financialcontributions in full and at the proper time. The credibilityand the operational capacity of the United Nations depend onthis.In conclusion  let me turn to an old Europe.In building European union the members of theEuropean Community have tried to seize an unprecedentedopportunity for the entire continent to achieve a truly unifiedEurope  a Europe of countries that have often made waragainst each other in the past.Without denying the current difficulties  I believe thatthe process of integration being carried out by the EuropeanCommunity can serve as the inspiration for initiatives forregional integration in Asia  Africa and Latin America.European unification was thought up and implementedon the basis of principles that are still fully valid:reconciliation between peoples that only yesterday were34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionenemies; broad-ranging political  economic  commercial andcultural cooperation; and the development of a social modelbased on pluralistic democracy  the market economy andsolidarity. Such a model guarantees justice and socialcohesion even if we are never able to make it perfect and itmust be constantly adjusted.It is on the basis of these common values that all thepeoples of Europe can  for the first time in their history build their future together. I believe that at the world levelalso  thanks to concerted international action  we will be ina better position to overcome the obstacles to peace and tocreate a world order that is more democratic  more tolerant more just and more social - in a word  more in keeping withthe spirit of the Charter of the United Nations."
"102",4303,"LVA",48,1993,"Mr. President  pleaseaccept Latvia’s congratulations on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighthsession. The people of Latvia wish you a successful term asleader of this body.Latvia wishes to pay its respects to those nation Stateswhich have recently been admitted to the United Nations andlooks forward to cooperation with them.It has been an eventful year for Latvia. On18 November 1993  Latvia will celebrate the seventy-fifthanniversary of the declaration of independence of Latvia in1918. Our seventy-fifth year of statehood has been markedby the election and the convening of our Parliament  theSaeima. The convening of the Saeima was an especiallysolemn occasion in that it meant the full restoration ofparliamentary democracy and the Constitution of 1922.Moreover  the convening of the Saeima completed athree-year restoration process that included there-establishment of our de facto independence in August1991 and our admission to the United Nations. There-establishment of Latvia’s independence and the restorationof its Constitution  following a half century of suspension is testimony to the power of democracy  the endurance ofthe human will and the supremacy of international law.To understand the processes currently under way inLatvia and in our region  it is helpful to note some aspectsof recent history. According to a secret protocol to theMolotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939  signed by Nazi Germanyand the Soviet Union  Latvia was relegated to the SovietUnion’s sphere of influence  an act which cleared the wayfor the Soviet Union’s illegal occupation of Latvia in 1940.Even though the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and its secretprotocols were  under international law  void at their signing Latvia was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union shortlyafter the occupation.Although Latvia lost its sovereignty and independencede facto  its status as a State continued de jure. Latvia’s dejure status continued to be recognized by many States  andthis position was echoed in their declarations throughout thefifty-year period of Latvia’s occupation. The continuingidentity of the State of Latvia was preserved by theapplication of the principle that illegal acts cannot validlychange an existing legal situation - ex injuria non oritus jus.Consequently  when it re-established its independence inl991 Latvia was quickly able to renew diplomatic relationswith those States with which it had had such relations priorto its occupation in 1940. In addition  Latvia continues toadhere to certain bilateral and multilateral agreements towhich it became party between 1918 and 1940.I have stressed the matter of Latvia’s continuous identitybetween 1918 and 1991 in order to emphasize that Latvia isnot a newly independent State. This fact is importantbecause the de jure continuity of Latvian statehood has legal political and economic consequences for Latvia  in particularwith respect to our relations with the Russian Federation.The key to stable and friendly relations between our twoStates  in both the political and economic spheres  isrecognition by both parties that Latvia was illegally andforcibly occupied and annexed in 1940 by the Soviet Union.I should like to express Latvia’s support for the variousefforts by the Secretary-General and the Member States topromote the maintenance of international peace and security in particular  efforts that were initiated by the report of theSecretary-General entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"".Recognizing the pragmatic and forward-looking approach ofthe proposals contained in the Secretary-General’s report preventive diplomacy in particular  we must also considerproposals that will similarly address other responsibilities ofthe United Nations  including the enhancement of respect forhuman rights and fundamental freedoms and the promotionof sustainable development. Latvia’s experience with regardto the utilization of preventive diplomacy may be useful indeveloping such proposals.I should like to emphasize that Latvia has utilizedpreventive diplomacy to the maximum extent possible.Latvia has initiated or welcomed United Nations andregionally sponsored efforts in fact-finding and confidencebuilding in connection with the issues facing Latvia and ourregion. Among these efforts is our recent agreement withthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe toestablish a presence in Riga  our capital. These efforts haveresulted in an increased understanding of the situation inLatvia  providing the United Nations  Member States andregional organizations with the knowledge and perspectiveto respond adequately to our problems. TheSecretary-General  Member States and regional organizationshave been involved  in cooperation with Latvia  in applyingthese measures to the most important and urgent matter nowconfronted by Latvia - namely  the continued illegal presenceof the military forces of the former Soviet Union on Latvianterritory.Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 7For over two years  Latvia has sought the removal ofthe former Soviet Union’s military forces from its territory through bilateral negotiations with the Russian Federationand with the assistance of the international community. Yetthese forces  now under the control of our large neighbour the Russian Federation  are still stationed on our territory.Last year the General Assembly addressed this issueunder the agenda item entitled ""Complete withdrawal offoreign military forces from the territories of the BalticStates"". In adopting resolution 47/21 by consensus  theGeneral Assembly called upon the Baltic States and theRussian Federation""to conclude without delay appropriate agreements including timetables  for the early  orderly and completewithdrawal of foreign military forces from theterritories of Estonia and Latvia"". (resolution 47/21 para. 2)The Russian Federation  in joining in the consensus for theadoption of resolution 47/21  affirmed its obligation towithdraw its military forces from the Baltic States  which ithad earlier assumed as a participating State of theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe at theHelsinki meeting in July 1992.A fact-finding mission headed by Tommy Koh Ambassador-at-Large of Singapore  recently returned fromLatvia and the Baltic States to report to theSecretary-General on the implementation of resolution 47/21.We thank the Secretary-General for his efforts at ensuringthe implementation of this resolution. We also wish to thankMr. Stoyan Ganev  President of the General Assembly at itsforty-seventh session  for accepting our invitation to visitLatvia in July 1993 and witnessing the situation in Latvia atfirst hand. I hope that  in addition to reviewing the situationregarding foreign military forces  Mr. Ganev gained insightinto Latvia’s process of renewal.Before I report to the Assembly on the present situationregarding the issue of the foreign military forces on theterritory of Latvia  I should like to express Latvia’s supportfor the ongoing democratic processes in the RussianFederation  at whose head is the lawfully elected Presidentof the Russian Federation  Boris Yeltsin. I hope that thepolitical and economic reform process in the RussianFederation will continue and that political forces there willsolve their problems using peaceful and democratic means.At critical moments in the past  democratic forces in theRussian Federation have demonstrated their ability to actdecisively to keep the Russian Federation on the road todemocracy. I am convinced that this will also be the case inthese  for Russia  difficult and complicated times.Since February 1992  State delegations of Latvia andthe Russian Federation have held eight sessions ofnegotiations on the subject of troop withdrawal from Latvia.These negotiations resulted in various agreements  whichgovern technical matters during withdrawal. Unfortunately we have failed to secure agreement on the importantquestion of a withdrawal timetable. Latvia has consistentlydemanded that withdrawal be completed by the end of 1993 two and a half years after Latvia regained its independence.The delegation of the Russian Federation has offered finalwithdrawal dates ranging from 1994 until 1999  without eversubmitting a concrete timetable or systematic plan forwithdrawal. The problem of the final withdrawal date iscompounded by the demands of the Russian Federation tomaintain three bases in Latvia: the radar station in Skrunda the cosmic intelligence centre in Ventspils and the navalbase in Liepaja. We have repeatedly stated  and theinternational community  including the Russian Federation has concurred  that withdrawal should be early and complete;furthermore  we cannot permit our soil to be used forpurposes that may be directed against third countries.A second principal issue on which the RussianFederation has held up its withdrawal from Latvia is itsdemand for extraordinary social benefits for pensionedofficers of the former Soviet Union and the RussianFederation who are residing in Latvia. For years  the officercorps of the occupying army was granted favourable accessto apartments  medical care and other social services.Demands for continuation of such privileges are not onlyunacceptable to Latvia  but unjust to all its residents; weshall not permit these demands to delay the withdrawalprocess.At the beginning of the negotiations between our twoStates  in February 1992  agreement was reached on certainmatters. Among these was the requirement that both partiesrefrain from uncoordinated  unilateral actions during theperiod of withdrawal. The time since then has been markedby such incidents as the military forces of the RussianFederation conducting unauthorized troop movements on theground  unauthorized naval movements through Latvia’sports and unauthorized air sorties in Latvian skies. Contraryto agreement  fresh recruits have secretly entered Latvia toreplace departing troops.In the light of the continued presence of these forces foreign investment in Latvia  which is necessary for thedevelopment of our small country  has been discouraged. In8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionaddition  the military forces of the Russian Federation havedone substantial damage to Latvia’s environment.Latvia seeks an assurance that its sovereignty independence and territorial integrity will be respected andthat a threat to international peace and security will not arisefrom its territory. I hope that the negotiations with theRussian Federation  which began yesterday  on 28 September1993  will be pragmatic in nature and will soon lead to anagreement providing for the complete withdrawal of foreignmilitary forces from the territory of Latvia. Such anagreement would have the potential to open a new chapterin the relationship between our two States  a chaptercontaining neither suspicion nor animosity. We could theneven foresee a time when our societies and children wouldbe free of the prejudices of the past.Latvia welcomes the complete withdrawal of themilitary forces of the Russian Federation from Lithuania which is a step toward improving the security of the Balticregion.As I have stated  it is important to recognize that Latviawas illegally occupied and annexed  and that a principalconsequence of these events is the significantly altereddemographic situation there. This situation must be takeninto account if one is to understand the internal situation inLatvia. In 1940  75 per cent of Latvia’s inhabitants wereethnic Latvians but today they constitute only 52 per cent ofLatvia’s population. During the Soviet occupation  hundredsof thousands of persons were deported to Siberia  and manythousands were arrested and executed. During the SecondWorld War tens of thousands died  were sent to NaziGermany for forced labour  or were forced to emigrate to theWest in order to escape the Red Terror. In sum  during theoccupation  the pre-war population of Latvia was reduced byone third. Among the victims who suffered this fate werethe Livs  one of the indigenous peoples of Latvia  who atpresent number only a few dozen.During the post-war years  the deportation and massiveinvoluntary emigration of Latvians from their native landwas paralleled by a heavy influx of residents of the SovietUnion. In 1945  newly arrived Soviet military personnelwere immediately allocated approximately 25 per cent of allthe apartments in Riga  the capital of Latvia. Many of theseapartments had earlier been vacated by Latvian familieswhich had been deported to Siberia or which had beenforced to flee to the West. In addition to the introductioninto Latvia of active and retired military personnel  theSoviet regime  using offers of various privileges  enticedcivilian labourers and managers from the Soviet Union tomigrate to Latvia.The pace of population transfer increased dramaticallyafter 1959  when Soviet leaders initiated a policy ofcolonization for Latvia by undertaking a heavyindustrialization drive there. During the next 30 years thetotal population of Latvia increased by 27 per cent. Whilethe indigenous population grew at a rate of 7.6 per cent population growth in the migrant community was 58.5 percent  with the result that mechanical growth exceeded naturalgrowth by close to a factor of eight. I should like to stressthat no other country has lost  as a result of occupation andcolonialism  such a large part of its indigenous populationduring modern times. In no other modern-day country hasthe indigenous population nearly become a minority in itsown country  as has happened in Latvia.We believe that the restoration of our independence hasgiven us the opportunity to improve our demographicsituation. If we can reach a point where Latvians feel secureabout their future  we will then have the freedom to investmore of our resources in finding solutions to globalproblems.The change in the demographic situation of Latviaduring the Soviet occupation cannot be conveyed bynumbers alone. Latvians were subjected to discrimination in particular with respect to the use of the Latvian languageand professional development. Command of the Russianlanguage became necessary in both the educational systemand many workplaces  while use of the Latvian languagewas eliminated in many spheres. Further  the policy of theSoviet authorities was to prevent access by Latvians toprofessions in various governmental and strategic fields.With a view to ensuring the survival of the Latvianpeople  it has become necessary for Latvia to develop a lawon citizenship which will safeguard the national identity ofits indigenous population. Concurrently  Latvia will upholdits obligations under international human rights law.Latvia has already determined its present body ofcitizens through a process of resident registration. In 1991 along with the restoration of its sovereignty andindependence  Latvia restored citizenship to those personsfrom whom it had been taken in 1940; this was doneregardless of their national  religious or ethnic backgrounds and citizenship was granted to their descendants as well.Pursuant to Latvia’s Constitution  it is this body of personswhich participated in the June 1993 parliamentary elections.Latvia’s present body of citizens includes approximatelyForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 9400 000 non-ethnic Latvians  or approximately 25 per centof the electorate - a figure that reflects the non-ethnicLatvian composition of the electorate prior to the occupationin 1940.Latvia’s democratically elected Parliament  the Saeima will in the near future adopt a citizenship law which will setthe requirements  in accordance with international law  forobtaining Latvian citizenship for residents of Latvia whoarrived after 1940. Persons transferred into Latvia during theSoviet occupation exercise freely all rights granted byinternational human rights instruments. According to expertsof the Council of Europe  the protection afforded by Latvia’slegislation is comparable to that provided by theconstitutional instruments of most States members of theCouncil of Europe and guaranteed collectively by theCouncil of Europe  in particular through the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights.Historical minorities of Latvia such as Russians Belarussians  Poles  Jews and others have their own schoolsand active national cultural societies  which help to maintaineach group’s national identity.A peaceful  legal and pragmatic restoration process hasbegun in Latvia. Numerous appraisals by the internationalcommunity have affirmed that this process is in fact peacefuland is being conducted within the confines of internationallaw.Latvia has no reason to hide its internal situation andhas thus welcomed numerous examinations of its humanrights record. On behalf of Latvia  I should like to thank theSecretary-General and the States Members of the UnitedNations for the fact-finding mission  headed by the presentAssistant Secretary-General for Human Rights  Mr. IbrahimaFall  which visited Latvia in October 1992. I should like toquote from the Mission’s conclusions:""Latvia is going through a transitional periodfollowing the reestablishment of independence. Duringthis period the Latvian Government is endeavouring toredress certain historical inequities and injusticesperpetrated during Soviet rule from 1940 to 1991.""This has given rise to anxiety among thenon-ethnic Latvians about their future status and role inthe country. It is this sense of insecurity rather thanany gross violation of human rights that is mostcharacteristic of the situation prevailing in Latvia today.""The information received and examined by theMission does not reveal gross and systematic violationsof human rights in Latvia. Individual violations whichhave been reported are limited and not related todiscriminatory policy as such and they should and canbe remedied at the appropriate level. On the positiveside  it should be emphasized that no instances ofviolence  no mass dismissals from employment exclusion from educational establishments  evictionsfrom apartments  or expulsions were reported.""(A/47/748  paras. 21-23)The report of the United Nations human rightsfact-finding mission to Latvia is similar to reports submittedby the Council of Europe  the Conference on Security andCo-operation in Europe and the European Court of HumanRights. Despite these numerous affirmations that humanrights are not being violated in Latvia  it has become theobject of political attacks - the Russian Federation constantlyaccuses Latvia of human rights violations. Latvia hasexpended great efforts and resources to refute theseunsubstantiated allegations. In addition  resources ofinternational organizations  including the United Nations have been expended.I shall now address the grave financial crisis that facesthe United Nations and has forced the Secretary-General totake drastic measures to economize. Latvia believes that asolution to the crisis that is acceptable to all Member Statesand based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of theUnited Nations must be found.Latvia wishes to bring to the attention of the GeneralAssembly an ad hoc decision which was made for reasonsof financial and political expediency  but which will in factcontribute to the financial crisis. I am referring to thedecision taken by the General Assembly in December 1992to determine  inter alia  the assessment rates of 15 MemberStates  including Latvia  according to an ad hoc methodrather than the standard method for determining capacity topay.The December 1992 decision is not in accordance withthe Charter principle of sovereign equality because the twodifferent methods for determining assessments result inunequal financial obligations for different Member States.Notwithstanding the fact that Latvia and the other two BalticStates are not successors to the former Soviet Union  theyhave been made to assume excessive financial obligations ofthe former Soviet Union and even to accept a portion of itscontribution to the Working Capital Fund.10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionLatvia is now entering its third year as a State Memberof the United Nations. We expect to increase ourinvolvement in the work of the United Nations and otherinternational organizations  participating in the search forsolutions to global problems. At the World Conference onHuman Rights in Vienna  we addressed two problem areaswhere we should be able to make contributions: the rightsof minorities and the rights of foreigners.Latvia reiterates the offer it made at the Earth Summitin Rio de Janeiro to host an international conference in itsresort city of Jurmala to examine possibilities for redirectingresources from armaments towards rehabilitating theenvironment.Latvia supports the establishment of the post of UnitedNations high commissioner for human rights. We also urgean increase in the percentage of the regular budget allocatedto the Centre for Human Rights in Geneva.The position of Latvia regarding non-governmentalorganizations is that they play a valuable role on theinternational stage  especially in the area of human rights.Their access to the United Nations human-rights systemshould be increased.With respect to the debate on restructuring the SecurityCouncil  Latvia supports increasing the number of membersof the Security Council. Such reform must ensure that theCouncil is adequately balanced between large and smallStates.Latvia supports the efforts aimed at rationalizing thestructure and the agenda of the General Assembly.Latvia welcomes the positive processes under way inthe Middle East  South Africa  Cambodia and Haiti. Wehope that  with the efforts of the United Nations and otherinternational organizations  peace will prevail in the formerYugoslavia  Georgia  Somalia and elsewhere where blood isstill being spilt.Latvia has a history of participation in internationalaffairs  including its term as Presiding Member of theCouncil of the League of Nations. In order to mark ourhistoric contribution to international relations  and tocelebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the signing of ourdeclaration of independence  Latvia has undertaken the taskof restoring a hall at the United Nations Office in Geneva.This hall  located in the Palais des Nations  and adornedwith amber collected from the shores of the Baltic Sea  wasdecorated and endowed by the Government and the peopleof Latvia in 1938 as a donation to the League of Nations.May the return of that hall at the Palais des Nations to itsoriginal splendour symbolize the victory of justiceconstituted by the return of Latvia to full membership in theinternational community.It is my belief that the restoration of our independencewill enable Latvia  a small State  to play a greater role insecuring peace and democracy in the world. I am convincedthat together we can leave our children a better world withmore security  more faith and more freedom."
"103",4350,"MAR",48,1993,"It gives me pleasure  at the outset  to extend to you thecongratulations of the delegation of Morocco on yourelection to the Presidency of the forty-eighth session of theGeneral Assembly  and to express to you our best wishes forsuccess in the discharge of your important duties. I wouldlike to assure you of our full cooperation in ensuring thesuccess of our deliberations.To the outgoing President  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  I shouldlike to express our appreciation for the wise manner inwhich he conducted the work of our deliberations during thepast session. To our Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  we would like to pay a special tribute for histireless efforts to uphold the principles of the United NationsCharter  and to promote international peace and security inthe world’s current difficult circumstances.I should also like to welcome to our midst the manynew Members who have joined our Organization in recentmonths.As we approach the end of fifth decade since theestablishment of our Organization  it is proper to evaluate itssuccesses in attaining the goals set by the Conference of SanFrancisco in 1945  with a view to maintaining world peaceand security and ensuring development  prosperity and socialjustice in a world free from the scourges of war  bigotry andracism.Our Organization was built on the ruins of a WorldWar. It was therefore natural that the effects of that war’saftermath left their imprint not only on the United NationsCharter but also on the rules that govern its work as well ason its structure.The rivalry between the two blocs contributed to theweakening of the effectiveness of the Organization inaddressing international issues. However  to do justice toour Organization  one cannot but speak of its historicachievements in liberating people from the yoke ofcolonialism and foreign domination  its opening of its forumsto dialogue between all nations  promoting cooperationbetween nations and peoples and its working for thesettlement of conflicts by peaceful means.The end of the cold war  the collapse of what used tobe called the Eastern Bloc and the sudden disintegration ofthe Soviet Union  were important and unexpected events ofhistoric proportions. They transformed the world situationand altered its parameters. The result was a radical changein international relations  a profound shift in the balance ofpower and the emergence of underlying ethnic and nationalextremist trends which were suppressed under the formerrule. Those have brought civil wars  unspeakable tragedies suffering and destruction to many countries.While it has been difficult under such circumstances tofind quick solutions to the old problems of the world assome would have hoped  new issues have arisen that havemonopolized the attention of the international community demonstrating the inadequacy of the means available to theUnited Nations and the United Nations inability to keep pacewith the changes on the international scene.20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe often-sought intervention by the United Nations inareas as diverse as the peaceful settlement of conflicts andthe organization and supervision of elections has resulted inan increase in its volume of work and has justified the callfor the strengthening of the Organization and support for itswork. Consolidating the role of our Organization is of greatimportance and enjoys the steady support of my country.Positive  vital and commendable as it may be  the roleof the Organization remains  nevertheless  of limited impactand effectiveness because the Organization’s Charter andstructure have not evolved sufficiently and because it lacksthe financial resources that would enable it to meet therequirements of its international mandates in all their variousaspects.Those transformations have given rise to new concepts notions and priorities  such as preventive diplomacy post-conflict peace-building  and brought to the fore suchissues as those of human rights and of intervention onhumanitarian grounds in the course of the ongoing globaldebate on what is termed ""the new world order"" that is inthe making.Moreover  the Summit meeting of the Security Council held in January 1992 in New York  was a testimony to acommon ambition to develop and regulate internationalaction in such a way as to make it capable of meeting therequirements of the new situation in the world. As a currentmember of the Security Council  Morocco - represented byHis Majesty King Hassan II - took part in that historicmeeting and did not fail to express the sensitivities andconcerns of the Muslim  Arab and African world  andcontribute fully in the formulation of the final declaration.It is also in this context that the Secretary-Generalpresented his thoughts and recommendations aboutpeacemaking and peace-keeping in his report ""Agenda forPeace""  which was favorably received by Member States.We believe that those thoughts  concepts and activities area positive endeavour on the whole  but they contain certainaspects which might prove to be dangerous and evendamaging. It is therefore imperative that those thoughts andconcepts be clarified  with a view to defining their goalsthrough an all-embracing dialogue between all States. Thiswould lead to a consensus genuinely reflecting the concernsof all members of the international community.It is also necessary  now  to supplement those thoughtswith views and reflections on how to correct the economicsituation which does injustice to the rights of the developingworld  whose economic interests have not been included inthe international agenda.Nowadays  human rights issues are the subject ofheated debate. Morocco  which firmly believes in theuniversal character and the comprehensive nature of thoserights  regards them as a basic pillar of governance  socialjustice and civil liberties in any State. However  my countryis equally of the view that the concept of human rightsshould be attuned to the values  cultures  traditions and thediffering levels of development of countries  without anyimposition of any particular concept of such rights. In otherwords  the political dimension of human rights should notprevail over the social and economic one  which covers thebasic needs of man including food  clothing  health care andshelter.Our constant interest in and tireless efforts towardsmaintaining international peace and security and the settlingof conflicts by peaceful means will be futile so long as thesocioeconomic imbalance between the developed anddeveloping countries continues to increase daily. Theeconomic crises in the developing world have been greatlyaggravated: unemployment and economic stagnation havebeen compounded by persisting problems in internationaltrade  by foreign debt and by falling prices for raw materials.Morocco deplores the lack of genuine dialogue between theNorth and the South  which has created a situation in whichsub-Saharan Africa claims less than 1 per cent of the world’sincome while the developed countries  with only 15 per centof the world’s population  control more than 80 per cent ofworld income.The discussions in international economic forums arealmost exclusively centered on topics of direct concern todeveloped countries while the role of developing nations inthe management of the world economy continues to bealmost non-existent. In that respect  we regret that therequest made by the current chairman of the Non-AlignedMovement to meet with the leaders of the G-7 last July inTokyo  to explain the consequences of the presentmanagement of the world economy on the developingcountries  was turned down.My country is convinced that unless the world economyis collectively managed in a manner that would take intoaccount the interests of all countries without exception  itwould be futile to look forward to an era in which globalpeace and security may prevail  and in which well-being andprosperity may be attained by all peoples of the world.Forty-eighth session - 27 September l993 21While we concede that the advanced countries too facea difficult economic situation  we maintain that they stillhave the potential and the ability to lend a helping hand tothe developing world.We also maintain that the time has come for thedeveloped countries to demonstrate true solidarity with thedeveloping countries by giving them access to the economicdecision-making process  and by helping them to developtheir economies and improve their social standards. To thisend  the developed countries could liberalize the worldeconomy  open their markets to the products of the ThirdWorld  increase their investments in developing countriesalleviate the debt-burden of those countries and enhance theeffective transfer of technology to them.By the same token  we believe it is necessary for worldeconomic relations to embark upon a new phase of genuinepartnership and shared responsibility  within the context ofeconomic interdependence.Such a new approach would prove much morebeneficial to the countries of the North since deterioration ofthe economic and social situation in the South wouldinevitably have a negative impact on the security  stabilityand development of the North.While calling for a meaningful contribution by countriesof the North to development  the countries of the Southremain mindful of the need for self-dependence. Thereforemost countries of the South have made the necessaryadjustments  strengthened the structures of their economiesand enhanced cooperation among themselves  by usingavailable forums such as the Group of 77 and the Movementof Non-Aligned Countries.Morocco  which has always demonstrated its utmostreadiness to promote South/South cooperation  is stillcommitted to participate actively in these efforts  inparticular with the African countries. Our keen interest inAfrica stems naturally from solid bonds of common history goals and destiny which link us to that continent whoseconcerns and ambitions we fully share.The lack of stability that characterizes the internationaleconomic situation led the African continent to a veryalarming crisis which has been exacerbated by the fallingprices of raw materials  a deterioration in the terms of trade the heavy foreign debt-burden and drought.Despite the adoption by the forty-sixth session of theGeneral Assembly of a new agenda for the development ofAfrica and the new reform programme adopted by themajority of African countries in conformity with therecommendations of the international financial institutions the situation in our continent remains critical and calls for anexceptional effort to overcome this crisis.In this context  Morocco spares no effort to assist manyAfrican countries  for example  by writing off loans extending valuable assistance in the areas of health care andeducation  and allocating more than 90 per cent of itsinternational cooperation budget to the assistance of Africancountries.Moreover  Morocco has endeavoured  in consultationwith other African countries bordering the Atlantic Ocean to set up  in collaboration with the United Nations and theFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations(FAO)  a legal framework and relevant structures to createmultilateral cooperation in the field of fisheries in order tosafeguard the vital interests and national resources of thesecountries.The present is a crucial period of transition in thehistory of international relations  which  while it is markedby new and promising prospects of international cooperation is fraught with the danger of the many hotbeds of tensionwhich proliferate around the world and which give cause forconcern.The Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is in the gripof a devastating war that irks the world conscience. Thishas been the result of the Serbian aggression against thesovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of Bosnia andHerzegovina. Bosnian Serbs especially have not hesitated toperpetrate the crimes of genocide  ethnic cleansing  rape  andthe destruction of houses of worship and historical andcultural monuments in furtherance of their shameful designs in violation of the principles and norms of international law.It is regrettable that the many settlement plans and theendless meetings have resulted in nothing other thanrewarding the Serbian aggressor and increasing pressure onthe Muslim majority of that country. Having been unjustlydeprived of the legitimate right to self-defence  the BosnianGovernment had to make successive unilateral concessions.The Kingdom of Morocco cannot but strongly condemnthe Serbian aggression aimed at the dismemberment of theRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  a Member State of theOrganization. It profoundly deplores the inertia of theinternational community and the inability of the UnitedNations to ensure proper compliance with andimplementation of the principles enshrined in the Charterand in international law  those principles which have beenrepeatedly recalled in resolutions  often adopted underChapter VII  by the Security Council.Somalia has recently experienced a cruel anddestructive civil war which led to a dreadful famine thatdecimated tens of thousands of its people. A multilateralhumanitarian rescue operation was launched with the aim ofpromoting national reconciliation and restoring the rule oflaw and the good functioning of government institutions.Morocco was one of the first countries to show itsactive solidarity with that sisterly African country in theframework of a multilateral humanitarian mission. Mycountry sent an important military contingent to alleviate thesuffering of the Somali people. In this context  Moroccovolunteered to set up a complete military hospital in whichmore than 100 000 patients have received treatment.Unfortunately  we have recently seen the situation inSomalia change as a result of deadly confrontations thathave claimed numerous lives. While deploring these tragicdevelopments and condemning these reprehensible acts  weremain convinced that the solution to the Somali crisishinges on continued negotiation and dialogue between all theparties  with the assistance of the United Nations  in order toachieve a genuine national reconciliation that would ensurepeace  security and prosperity for our brethren in Somalia.Angola remains in the grip of a destructive civil wardespite the peace agreement between the Government ofAngola and the National Union for the Total Independenceof Angola (UNITA)  which agreement was supported by theinternational community and the United NationsOrganization. Inspired by its solidarity with the Angolanpeople  and determined to promote peace and security in thispart of Africa  the Kingdom of Morocco  on severaloccasions has assisted the two parties in resolvingoutstanding problems through dialogue and negotiation. Asa member of the Security Council  Morocco has voted infavour of all resolutions on this issue in the hope that thetwo parties would implement the Abidjan protocol  preparedwith the help of the United States of America  the RussianFederation and Portugal  so that an end could be put to thecycle of war and destruction  and thus allow Angola to usherin an era of peace  security and stability.In South Africa  the cycle of violence continues toclaim innocent victims. This must not slow down or side-track the democratic process or the current efforts aimed attransforming South Africa into a democratic  united and non-racial State. It is a source of satisfaction that the process ofconstitutional reform is proceeding despite the bloody actsof provocation perpetrated by extremists from various sides.Morocco  which has always encouraged dialoguebetween the parties concerned  wants to express itssatisfaction at the establishment of a transitional ExecutiveCouncil. We are hopeful that the parties will continue thedialogue and the process of reconciliation.Moreover  Morocco supports the appeal of Mr. NelsonMandela  made before the Special Committee againstApartheid on 24 September 1993  for the lifting of theeconomic sanctions against South Africa. We are convincedthat such an action will result in alleviating the economicburdens borne by the people of South Africa and will thuscontribute to resolving their internal and external problemsand give new momentum to the settlement process.Two weeks ago  the Middle East entered a new era asa result of the mutual recognition between the PalestineLiberation Organization and Israel  and the signing of anagreement allowing for a regime of self-rule  initially in theGaza Strip and Jericho.Those two historic events have had a great impact onthe situation in the Middle East  as this is the first time thatthe Palestinian and the Israeli sides have officially andpublicly expressed their willingness to coexist and torecognize one another.Despite the strong impact of those two events  Moroccobelieves that the path to a genuine  comprehensive settlementof the Arab-Israeli conflict is still long and that patience andperseverance are required in order to circumvent the manyobstacles and difficulties that beset the process.This first decisive step should be strengthened andshould be accompanied by a good measure of progress in theother bilateral negotiations. A real solution in the MiddleEast can be achieved only if the momentum for peace isallowed to run its full course and reach its goal with theconsent of all the peoples of the region.To shoulder these responsibilities at this crucial andhistorical juncture  it is necessary to mobilize all efforts andto bring together all people of goodwill in order to achievea just and comprehensive settlement that would beacceptable to all parties. Such a settlement should restore tothe Palestinian people their rights  including their right to anForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 23independent State on their soil with Jerusalem as its capital.It should also ensure the withdrawal of Israel from the otheroccupied Arab territories in Syria  Lebanon and Jordan  inconformity with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) 338 (1973) and 425 (1978).Only then can the Middle East  afflicted by war violence and tragedies for more than half a century  enterupon an era of peace  security  disarmament  stability andcooperation between all the States of the region; this wouldbring about development  welfare and prosperity.In the Maghreb subregion  the Kingdom of Moroccofirmly believes in the principles that formed the foundationof the Arab Maghreb Union; we adhere to the goals of theUnion. We are firmly convinced that the future of theregion and the prosperity of its peoples  linked as they areby history  language  religion and a common destiny  dependon the achievement of that unity.The Arab Maghreb Union has recently encounteredsome difficulties and obstacles. This  in our view  is onlynatural. However  we are determined to overcome suchdifficulties and to go forward in order to fulfil the ambitionof the Maghreb people to build an effective structure ofcooperation and solidarity for themselves.In the area of relations with the rest of the internationalcommunity  Morocco and the other members of the ArabMaghreb Union view with special importance their relationswith countries of the European Community on the one hand and with its member States on an individual orMediterranean basis on the other. The results achievedwithin the framework of dialogue and cooperation amongcountries bordering the Mediterranean are encouraging. Wehope therefore that the current difficulties  which haveprevented the resumption of that dialogue  will be overcomesoon in order to promote a balanced regional cooperationbetween the northern and southern flanks of the WesternMediterranean.With regard to the so-called question of the WesternSahara  the Settlement Plan is being implemented  and theSecretary-General continues to bring all new developmentsto the attention of the Security Council. The Kingdom ofMorocco  which has always cooperated with the Secretary-General and striven to facilitate his mission  has given itsconsent in principle to the compromise he proposed in theinterpretation and application of the criteria for votereligibility. We are confident that the Secretary-General willnot fail to inform the Security Council of Morocco’s sincereand loyal cooperation and our constant readiness toimplement the provisions of resolution 809 (1993) in all itsaspects. It was in the same spirit of cooperation andreconciliation that Morocco agreed to the Laayoune meetingof last July where Sahrawis  in particular  from within theterritory and from the region of Tindouf  took part andinitiated a brotherly and positive dialogue.A close examination of conditions prevailing in theworld as we stand on the threshold of the next centurywould clearly show that the strivings of humanity in theareas of world peace  justice and welfare fall short of thehopes it set out to realize and that the challenges in the wayof meeting those goals are still difficult and numerous.What is most needed now is a new code of conduct forinternational relations  a code that would take into accountthe concerns of all peoples and countries of the world restore balance to international dealings and bring theprinciples of justice and partnership to the management24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionof world affairs. We hold the view that the United Nationsis the most suitable forum for discussions on this issue andfor attaining our common goals."
"104",4374,"MCO",48,1993,"For me this is a very special occasion  for it is thefirst time I address  on behalf of my father  the SovereignPrince of Monaco  and on behalf of my country  thisprestigious world Assembly of the States Members of theUnited Nations.I wish to tell members of the tremendous joy of allMonégasques and inhabitants of the Principality of Monacowhen my country joined this great world Organization. Ishould like to take the opportunity once again to thank themembers of the Security Council and of the GeneralAssembly for their favourable consideration of Monaco’sapplication for membership of the Organization.I wish the Assembly every success in its work. Anumber of its agenda items are of particularly vital historicand political significance. The decisions we take willundoubtedly have far-reaching and long-term consequencesfor the future of the world community.I wish also  to congratulate you  Sir  very sincerely andwarmly on your election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly. My congratulations also go to the members ofthe General Committee. I have no doubt that your skill andlengthy experience will enable our work to proceed underthe best possible conditions.Like all countries that put their trust in international lawand cooperation  the Principality of Monaco  in its relationswith other countries  has always relied on respect forinternational norms and documents.Its Princes have always been fully aware of the fact thatthe maintenance of peace necessarily entails respect for thesovereignty of States and the development of friendlyrelations among peoples.Prince Albert I of Monaco  when he created the PeaceInstitute at the end of the last century  was even theninspired by that philosophy  which led to the founding  in1919  of the League of Nations and  in 1945  of the UnitedNations. On 5 February 1934 Prince Albert’s successor -Prince Louis II  who was profoundly touched by thehardship and suffering caused by the First World War - setup the Medical-Legal Commission of Monaco  whose soberreflection and work which continue today  gave inspirationto the drawing up of the 1949 Geneva Conventions of theInternational Red Cross.My country’s commitment to peace is therefore atradition of more than 100 years - a tradition observed by itsPrinces  whose dynasty will shortly celebrate its 700thanniversary. It is also a political aspiration that has onlygrown in strength with the passage of time. It will alwaysbe adhered to with both conviction and determination in theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations.In this spirit  I should like to refer in particular to aresolution of the International Olympic Committee  of whichI am a member  which unanimously recommends observanceof a long-standing tradition of the Olympic movement - theprinciple of the Olympic truce.The Government of Monaco supports this initiative which was signed and endorsed by the National Committeesof 184 countries and was officially addressed to ourSecretary-General on 9 February this year. An internationalyear of sport and the Olympic spirit would undoubtedlyafford an opportunity to launch this project.Perhaps it is by constantly repeating certain initiativesof this nature - albeit modest ones - that we shall be ablegradually to create the just and lasting peace to which we allso deeply aspire.Did we not  a few days ago  receive from the southernshores of the Mediterranean news giving us immense hopeof peace? Though it may be tenuous  we are at one withthose who inspired it and with those who are todayendeavouring to make it a success. It is our earnest wishthat they will succeed.Peace is not just the silence of guns. Indeed  there canbe no doubt that the establishment of genuine peace can flowonly from greater respect for justice  human rights andfundamental freedoms. For this very reason  the work andthe conclusions of the Vienna Conference on human rightswarrants our very close scrutiny.Finally  echoing a wish expressed by my father Prince Rainier III  when he addressed the Earth Summit inRio de Janeiro  I should like to emphasize that theGovernment of Monaco has set for itself the priority ofprotecting our environment  both natural and cultural  so thatit may provide a healthy  enriching and balanced life for all.The Principality has undertaken major efforts to combat  inparticular  all types of pollution that attack and contaminatethe Mediterranean.My country is more than ever resolved to encourage allinitiatives in this area  including the establishment  on itsown soil  of institutions dealing with coordination and the10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionadoption of a General Assembly resolution that wouldproclaim 1998 the international year of the seas and oceans.I should like  in conclusion  to reiterate that thePrincipality of Monaco - in full respect for the rule of lawin domestic affairs and for treaties and law in theinternational order; having neither armed forces nor militaryarsenals; and bearing no enmity to anyone at all - is fullyprepared to assist the Organization in all its actions undertaken sometimes with great difficulty  aimed atmaintaining and rebuilding peace."
"105",4399,"MDA",48,1993,"First of all  I joinprevious speakers in warmly congratulating Mr. SamuelInsanally on his election as President of the forty-eighthsession of the General Assembly  and wish him success inperforming this highly responsible function. At the sametime  I address sincere thanks to Mr. Stoyan Ganev for the14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioncompetent manner in which he led this great forum duringhis presidency.I also take great pleasure in expressing my gratitude tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for histireless efforts aimed at enhancing the efficiency of theUnited Nations.I take this opportunity to convey cordial congratulationsto the Czech Republic  the Slovak Republic  The FormerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia  Eritrea  Andorra andMonaco on their admission to the United Nations.Recent political developments in a number of Statesand at the international level brought about the end of thecold war  the abatement of the danger of a nuclearcatastrophe and some other positive changes. Unfortunately we are compelled to note at the same time the emergence ofsome negative phenomena  such as disastrous regional andinter-ethnic conflicts. The end of this century presents aterrible picture: countries and people torn apart by fiercefratricidal wars  towns and villages set on fire  thousands ofdisplaced people and refugees  innocent victims  tearfulwomen and children.The serious and complicated problems of our times -for example  those rooted in history or border disputes  andthose with ethnic and religious  political and economic social and spiritual origins  have generated various conflictswith grave consequences. These problems may lead to theoutbreak of new violent confrontations in Europe that couldendanger international peace and security. Under thesecircumstances  which are indisputable  the United Nationsand other international organizations  such as the Conferenceon Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  the Western EuropeanUnion (WEU) and the European Economic Community(EEC) have a crucial role in stopping these unfavourabledevelopments by the peaceful settlement of conflicts  thusleading to the strengthening of peace  international stabilityand security.While appreciating the European efforts to find anadequate response to new challenges to security and stability both at the global and regional levels  we consider that therole of the United Nations in this respect remains decisive.In order to meet the new imperatives  the United Nationsought to undergo a profound reorganization and a carefulreassessment of its means. The report of theSecretary-General  ""An Agenda for Peace""  represents areference point in the modern history of the United Nationsand the starting-point of these necessary changes. Wewelcome the continuation and broadening of the debates onthis matter.The recent outbreak of regional conflicts - the Yugoslavcrisis in particular - reveals certain deficiencies in theinternational machinery dealing with peace and securityissues  and indicates an urgent need for improvement.The Republic of Moldova supports the reforms initiatedwithin the framework of the Organization and is confidentof its ability to adapt itself to the new political climate.The appointment of an Under-Secretary-General forHumanitarian Affairs strengthens this confidence. In ouropinion  the programme of reforms should include thefollowing three priorities: restructuring the Secretariat rationalizing the work of the Main Committees and theirworking mechanisms  and reinforcing the role of theSecretary-General in his relations with the subsidiary bodiesand specialized agencies.I should like to point out that our delegation has beenpursuing with great interest the debates on the agenda itementitled ""Question of equitable representation on and increasein the membership of the Security Council"". We considerthat an increase in the membership of the Council aimed atensuring wider representation would be in full consonancewith the major changes that have occurred lately in theinternational arena and would reflect to a much greaterextent the present level of democratization in internationalrelations. At the same time  we share the opinion that anychanges should maintain and increase the efficiency of thisvital organ of the United Nations  taking into account afurther possible recourse to the remarkable contributions bymajor Powers.Over two years have passed since the Republic ofMoldova proclaimed its independence. Our aspiration tobecome a democratic State with a market economy isabsolute  notwithstanding the difficulties of transition. Ourcountry has taken the first steps in this direction  irreversiblyengaging itself on the path towards democracy. Thisresolute choice is reflected in our endeavours to join ininternational cooperation  an integral part of which is respectfor human rights and fundamental freedoms.The Republic of Moldova has ratified the internationalconventions on human rights. The Government hasconsistently come out in favour of assuming newcommitments to adapt the Republic’s internal legalframework to international standards.Forty-eighth session - 8 October l993 15This position of principle on human rights on the partof the Republic of Moldova was reiterated at the WorldConference on Human Rights. Unfortunately  thisconstructive approach has been vehemently challenged bythe separatist forces in Transdniestra  which are beinginspired and supported from abroad. Shortly after theproclamation of independence  the pro-imperial forces startedhostilities that resulted in great losses of innocent lives andflagrant violations of the basic rights of the nativepopulation  who were born and bred in areas controlled byseparatists.The allegations by certain political forces and massmedia in the Russian Federation that the conflict is an inter-ethnic one are simply not true. In fact  it is a politicalconflict aimed at rebuilding the imperial structure. Theseaccusations by the pro-imperial forces are meant to leadpeople to the conclusion that human rights are being violatedin the Republic of Moldova and that ethnic groups had beensubject to discrimination. In this respect  I should point outthat these accusations were not confirmed by the UnitedNations and Conference on Security and Cooperation inEurope (CSCE) missions that visited my country on severaloccasions.Those same accusations were the pretext for theRussian Federation’s decision to keep up a presence by itsarmed forces on my country’s territory. The conditionsimposed for the withdrawal of the Russian Fourteenth Army namely that special legal status must be granted to theeastern districts of Moldova  is an attempt to keep thatgeographical area - including the Republic of Moldova - inRussia’s sphere of influence.The presence of foreign military forces on the territoryof the Republic of Moldova is the principal source ofinsecurity and instability for my country. As was so rightlypointed out by the Secretary-General in his report on thework of the Organization  the question of the withdrawal ofthe Fourteenth Russian Army is a major stumbling-blockalong the way to a settlement of the conflict.In this context  I should like to thank the EuropeanCommunity which  in their memorandum to the GeneralAssembly  called for an early withdrawal of foreign troopsfrom Moldova. In fact  the Fourteenth Army has hugeamounts of military hardware and enormous weaponsstockpiles in Transdniestra that could easily be taken over byseparatist forces: this is what happened during the escalationof hostilities in 1992.Moreover  many residents of the eastern districtscontinue to be illegally drafted into the Fourteenth Army.This is another example of crude interference in the internalaffairs of the Republic of Moldova  and is a serious violationof international law.Thus  with the political  logistic and moral support ofthe Fourteenth Army  the separatist leaders are still doingeverything they can to impede the talks on a politicalsettlement of the conflict. This has prevented theimplementation of the Moldovan-Russian agreement of21 July 1992 on the principles for a peaceful settlement ofthe military conflict in the eastern districts of the Republicof Moldova.The high degree of politicization of the foreign militaryforces stationed on my country’s territory and their supportfor the anticonstitutional regime in Transdniestra are themain threats to the independence  integrity and security ofthe Republic of Moldova. At the same time  the presence ofa foreign army in Moldova is the major obstacle to apeaceful settlement of the conflict in the eastern districts.We therefore consider unacceptable the Russian Federation’sinsistent proposals for it to be entrusted with a UnitedNations mandate for peace-keeping operations in conflictzones throughout the former Soviet Union.First  we are convinced that neither the CSCE nor theUnited Nations have exhausted possibilities for solving theseregional conflicts.Secondly  one of the basic criteria for participation inpeace-keeping operations is impartiality. In view of Russia’sobvious interest in these zones and its insistence onassuming the role of peace-keeper  it is clear that theseefforts are aimed at continuing and justifying its militarypresence on the territories of independent and sovereignStates Members of the United Nations. Russia’s final goalis obviously the revival of the old imperial structures withthe blessing of the international community.The acceptance of the 14th Army’s presence on theterritory of the Republic of Moldova as a precedent willcertainly be very dangerous  not only for the territories ofthe newly independent States but also for all the adjacentareas.The negotiations between the Governments of theRepublic of Moldova and the Russian Federation - whichbegan last year - on settling the terms for the withdrawal ofthe 14th Army have not attained any significant results. TheRussian side obstructs the negotiations and displays no16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionwillingness to withdraw its military forces. In thesecircumstances  the CSCE mission in the Republic ofMoldova suggested that it participate in these negotiations.While the Moldovan party supported this initiative  theRussian party rejected it on every occasion. We note withdeep concern that the constructive attitude in favour ofcompromise taken by the leadership of the Republic ofMoldova is being repaid with a policy of fait accomplimeant to separate the Transdniester area from Moldova andplace a ""Trojan horse"" in my country.The recent developments are relevant in this sense anddeepen this concern. General Alexandr Lebed  thecommander of the 14th Army was recently elected  with thetacit consent of Moscow authorities  a deputy to theso-called Supreme Soviet in the ""partial elections"" that tookplace in the self-proclaimed ""Dniester Republic"". In thisway General Lebed has proved once again his lack of goodfaith and his total disregard for the provisions of theagreements signed by Presidents Mircea Snegur and BorisYeltsin.The Government of the Republic of Moldova considersthat the defiant and cynical actions of General Lebed  whois a Russian citizen and the commander of a foreign armytemporarily stationed on the territory of my country constitute blatant interference in the internal affairs of asovereign State. This action is a new attempt by certainconservative forces in Russia to recognize de facto theso-called Dniester Republic.It would probably be enlightening to recall that theself-proclaimed authorities in Transdniestria applauded withenthusiasm the putsch against Mikhail Gorbachev in August1991. Moreover  during the recent events in Moscow  troopsfrom Transdniestria were sent to the Russian capital to jointhe Communist hardliners in their fight against PresidentBoris Yeltsin. The active participation of Transdniestrianfighters in the Moscow rebellion was a logical consequenceof the close ties between the Tiraspol leadership and thereactionary Russian parliament  which violated allinternational norms under the false slogan of ""defending theRussians"" by means of the so-called Dniester Republic and in practice  created a bridgehead in Moldova for therestoration of the Soviet empire.In this context  I should like to inform the internationalcommunity that the situation in the area of conflict continuesto be tense and is very likely to become unstable.We have all accepted the general principle that aforeign army cannot be stationed on the territory of anotherState without the consent of the Government of the hostcountry. I should also like to recall the appeals contained inthe documents of the CSCE and the North AtlanticCooperation Council  stating the need for complete immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the 14th Army.In this spirit  we urge United Nations Member States toexamine  with understanding and good will  a possiblerequest for the inclusion of an additional item on the agendaof the General Assembly  on the question of the completewithdrawal of foreign military forces from the territory ofthe Republic of Moldova.It is my belief that the same laudable solidarityexpressed by the international community with the BalticStates is urgently needed by my country  which is preventedfrom achieving real independence and pursuing its firmchoice of democracy and freedom. We reiterate our supportfor resolution 47/21  on the complete withdrawal of foreignmilitary forces from the territories of the Baltic States  andwe welcome with great satisfaction the encouragingachievement of the Lithuanian people  which has finally seenits territory free of foreign troops. We deem that only theconcerted action of international bodies  especially that ofthe CSCE and the United Nations  can ensure peace andsecurity in our region and protect the territorial integrity andindependence of the Republic of Moldova.I wish to assure this body that my Government is fullycommitted to doing its utmost to protect the rights ofForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 17minorities in the Republic of Moldova and is ready toreceive any international monitoring mission to ascertain thereal situation.I cherish the hope that the fresh spirit emerging at theUnited Nations will help us to identify  by consensus  thenecessary solutions for various problems the internationalcommunity is facing now. My delegation is ready to makeits contribution to the carrying out of efficient cooperationwith other Member States in order to achieve the lofty goalsof the United Nations that we are all striving for."
"106",4482,"MDV",48,1993,"It gives me great pleasureto congratulate Ambassador Insanally on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighthsession. His election to this important post is  beyond adoubt  a testimony to his personal credentials and theimportant role being played by his country in internationalaffairs.I should also like to commend the work of hispredecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria  whodemonstrated outstanding skills of diplomacy  anddedication.It is also my pleasant duty to pay tribute to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for hisuntiring efforts in promoting international peace and security.I should also like to extend a warm welcome to the sixnew States  Andorra  the Czech Republic  Eritrea  Monaco the Slovak Republic and the Former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia that have joined us during the past year. I amconfident that their participation and contribution will furtherenrich the work of the Organization.Along with the end of the cold war came promises:promises of a better future  without the threat of nuclearholocaust  where scarce resources would not be spent onbuilding up military might  where millions of starving wouldbe fed and provided with their basic health care needs  safedrinking water and a basic level of education  where a safeand clean environment would be provided along with theright to sustainable development  and where the dignity ofthe human being would be respected. This is the vision thatgave rise to this Organization in 1945.We have rededicated ourselves to this vision withrenewed vigour following the demise of the cold war. The30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionmoral authority of the United Nations has been reassertedover military might. A number of protracted conflicts haveshown signs of movement towards resolution. Internationalcooperation in addressing global issues such as environment disarmament  international peace and security and humanrights have reached new heights. As a consequence  theUnited Nations has gained new respect and been entrustedwith new responsibilities. In order to live up to theheightened expectations  the Organization must continue toreceive the unwavering commitment of its Member States.The Republic of Maldives would like to take thisopportunity to renew its commitment to the purposes andprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations.These changes in the work of the United Nations reflectcorresponding changes in the political  economic  andsecurity landscape that underpins efforts in internationalcooperation today. In view of this reality  the SecurityCouncil of the United Nations needs to be reformed andrestructured. We should be careful not to take a piecemealapproach to this: any expansion of the Council  and thestatus of the members  should be based on the principles ofequitable and balanced representation. We should formulateprincipled criteria that reflect the political  economic anddemographic realities of the world today.The events in Bosnia and Herzegovina have shamed usall. A State Member of the United Nations has beensubjected to naked aggression. The entire population of asmall country is being progressively exterminated. It isdeliberate genocide.We need to examine why the international communityhas failed to stop the carnage that is taking place in thatcountry. Regional  international and direct diplomacy havebeen applied  but to no avail. At a time when the worldcommunity has rededicated itself to the sanctity of humanrights  it is a tragic shame that systematic violation of theserights has gone unpunished owing to lack of will on the partof the international community.We condemn the continued violence and genocide inBosnia and Herzegovina and call upon the internationalcommunity to take more decisive steps so that theresponsibilities entrusted to us under the Charter of thisOrganization may be discharged fully. We fully recognizethe inherent right to self-defence  as prescribed in theCharter. We believe that the right to self-defence comprisesthe most fundamental right - the right to life.A permanent solution to the situation in Bosnia shouldbe found by peaceful means and within the parameters of theCharter of the United Nations  one of which is the principleof territorial integrity.The continued violations of basic human rights that aretaking place in Angola and Somalia are a matter of seriousconcern to us. The events in Somalia - especially the attackson the United Nations peace-keeping personnel - are gravedevelopments that threaten the working of this Organization.United Nations involvement in Somalia now raises severalquestions  including those concerning the sincerity of thewarring parties with regard to their acceptance of help fromthe international community to overcome the extremepoverty that has ravaged the entire country.Today  the United Nations is learning a lesson that isvery expensive  in terms of both human life and financialresources  as it provides humanitarian assistance and seeksto protect the people of these countries. It is indeed ironicand tragic that peace- keepers have themselves becometargets of violence. My Government condemns suchviolence in the strongest possible terms and believes thatthose responsible for such acts should be brought to justice.These experiences demonstrate that if the partiesinvolved are not sincere in the efforts to find a peacefulsolution and to avoid violence  the United Nations  acting onits own  will be unable to perform miracles.Developments taking place in South Africa have beenencouraging. The very active and high-level role currentlybeing played by the United Nations in facilitating thecessation of political violence and the promotion ofnegotiations to establish a democratic and non-racial State inSouth Africa is commendable. My Government alsocommends the African National Congress (ANC) and theGovernment of South Africa for their positive attitudetowards working out the details of the multi-party elections.In this connection  the recent agreement to set up amulti-party Transitional Executive Council is a welcomedevelopment. We feel that the end of the era of apartheid which is an affront to human dignity  is imminent. In thiscontext  we urge all parties concerned to refrain fromviolence and actions that would subvert the peace process.It is our hope that when we meet here in New Yorknext year we shall have amongst us the true representativesof the South African people and that this Organization willbe able to benefit from their experience and knowledge.Forty-eighth session - 4 October l993 31The Arab-Israeli peace talks that began in 1991 havemade remarkable progress. The signing of the declarationsof principles by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)and Israel in Washington last month was an historic event.In this context  I should like to express to the PLO and thepeople of Palestine our admiration for their courage and theirdetermination to find a comprehensive and peaceful solutionto the question of Palestine.The Maldives pays tribute also to the Government ofthe United States of America and other Governmentsinvolved for the important role they are playing in theMiddle East peace talks. It is our earnest hope that thisagreement will lead to the restoration of the inalienable rightof the Palestine people to self-determination  sovereignindependence and the establishment of a national homelandon their own soil.The tragic consequences of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwaitare still a matter of serious concern to the internationalcommunity. All outstanding issues  such as the borderdispute and the release of Kuwaiti and third-countryprisoners still being held in Iraqi jails  should be settledimmediately. The resolution of these issues  in conformitywith international law and practice  will contribute to theelimination of tension and to the restoration of security andstability in the region.In this regard  the Government of Maldives welcomesthe completion of the work of the Iraq-Kuwait BoundaryDemarcation Commission and the endorsement of the reportof this Commission by the Security Council. We also feelthat Kuwait’s acceptance of the Commission’s report is avery positive step indicative of that country’s eagerness andsincerity in its attitude towards a comprehensive solution.The Government of Maldives urges Iraq to adopt an equallypositive attitude in the interests of peace  security andstability.In June this year the international community cametogether at the second World Conference on Human Rightsto review and assess progress and setbacks in the area ofhuman rights since the adoption of the Universal Declarationin 1948. I am happy that we were able to makeconsiderable progress in several key areas. We believe thatsome of the achievements of this Conference will give newimpetus to the promotion of human rights throughout theworld. However  we all need to be very realistic inaddressing this very important issue. The internationalcommunity should not let the promotion of human rights beused by a few as an excuse for imposing uniformity inhuman behaviour and thinking  at the expense of diversity.Rather  it should emphasize the significance of theuniversality of human rights. We know only too well thefate of societies that try to impose uniform thinking andbehaviour on their peoples. Differences between individualsand societies should be valued. Such diversity enriches ourfamily of nations.The Government of Maldives has always attached greatimportance to disarmament and international peace andsecurity. It is our firm belief that the production andstockpiling of armaments will only worsen the security ofthe entire world. In this regard  Maldives calls upon theinternational community not to lose the current momentumtowards disarmament. We therefore urge the partiesinvolved to continue to build upon past achievements particularly in the elimination of weapons of massdestruction  the control of proliferation  the achievement ofgreater transparency in armaments and the negotiation ofother confidence-building measures.Early this year  Maldives acceded to the Convention onthe Prohibition of the Development  Production andStockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and ToxinWeapons and on Their Destruction  and  today  on behalf ofthe Government of Maldives  I have signed the Convention.Maldives is not involved in the production and stockpilingof such weapons. My Government’s accession and signaturetherefore demonstrate our commitment to supporting allinternational efforts to eradicate such weaponry.The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was one of thefirst international Treaties to which my country became aparty after gaining its independence in 1965. Ourcommitment to this Treaty is unwavering because we fullyrealize the consequences of the proliferation of suchweapons of mass destruction. My Government supports theindefinite extension of the Treaty beyond 1995. We believethat  within its framework  progress could be made in theestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones ofpeace  for which my Government reiterates its full support.We feel that the establishment of such zones will furthercontribute to the promotion of international peace andsecurity.I also wish to express my Government’s unqualifiedsupport for the total eradication of all weapons of massdestruction  be it chemical  biological or nuclear  and toreiterate our call for the conclusion of effective agreementson a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. In thisconnection  the Government of Maldives commends theUnited States for its unilateral decision to extend itsmoratorium on nuclear testing until the end of 1994.32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe Charter of the United Nations recognizes theinherent rights of all States to self-defence. However  onlya privileged few possess the ability to provide for their ownsecurity unilaterally. Small States which lack adequatefinancial resources for the acquisition of military equipmentand face severe constraints in manpower are never in aposition to provide suitably for their own security. Anyattempt by small States to build their military capabilities upto a level of even near self-reliance would be a mere wasteof resources. The United Nations remains the only guarantorof security for the small States.In the economic sphere  the world economy once againfailed to meet the expected rate of growth. It continues tobe characterized by deteriorating terms of trade for thedeveloping countries and rising protectionism in developedcountries. For decades the developing countries have soughta new world economic order that would eliminate theimbalances existing in the present system. However  littlehas been accomplished towards the attainment of this goal.The scientific and technological gap between the developingand the developed countries is becoming ever wider. Theflow of official development assistance has declined as aresult of the slow growth in the economies of the donorcountries.The global arrangements and institutions established tomanage economic relations between States have not beenable to lift the world from its present depression. Thisfailure has serious implications for the developing countries.In order to avoid disastrous consequences  we call for anearly conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral tradenegotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) that will set the tone for a future based on an open-trading system.The North-South dialogue must be reactivated on a newbasis comprising common interests and benefits and sharedresponsibilities. Similarly  South-South cooperation must beintensified  allowing States to pool their resources andpursue concrete development efforts within the frameworkof collective self-reliance and continued support for opentrading systems. The world cannot rise out of its economicdisarray and be assured of stability until the North and theSouth can together work out a system that encourages closereconomic relations and strengthens the North-Southexchange.One particular concept that needs emphasis is theinseparability of development from the equitable sharing ofits fruits and its responsibilities. This twofold aspect ofdevelopment must be pursued at one and the same time andwith equal intensity if development is to succeed. In thisregard  let me reiterate my Government’s firm belief thatsustainable development is the only way to guaranteecontinued life on this planet Earth. We need to accelerateour efforts to meet the commitments we made in Rio lastyear. We call on all States urgently to ratify the climateConvention and the bio-diversity Convention. MyGovernment is proud to announce that it was one of the firstto ratify both these Conventions.The establishment of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment is a welcome development. We commend theCommission for the very productive work accomplished atits first substantive session and hope that its future work willbe of the same high standard.The preparatory work for the Global Conference forSmall Island States on Sustainable Development and itsImplications began during this year. My country  as a smallisland State  regards this Conference as a very important stepin addressing and finding practical solutions to the uniqueproblems facing us in our developmental efforts. We hopethat the international community will continue to participateconstructively in the preparatory process and will participatein the Conference itself.The responsibility that has been thrust upon us today istremendous. The realization of the dreams of our peoplesare in our hands. We cannot afford to be blind to thedesires of our peoples to be better fed  to have safer drinkingwater  to have access to education and health-care needs andto be free from the prospect of nuclear holocaust and thedangers of environmental degradation. We cannot afford tobe embroiled in the build-up of stockpiles of armaments andweapons of mass destruction while our economies are themain victims of these acquisitions for death and destruction.We should rise above all this and become more humanin all our endeavours. I have no doubt that together we canactually achieve the better future that has been promised tous."
"107",4529,"MEX",48,1993,"The United Nations has embarked on an irreversible processof profound transformation. Efficiency and flexibility willbe the defining features of this process. But an effectiveUnited Nations must continue to be in the service of peaceand development.The United Nations of the next century must not be amechanism  however efficient  for balancing the interests ofthe most powerful. The Organization must move ahead asthe world’s primary instrument for promoting developmentand solidarity among nations and among men.Our Organization is first and foremost a body ofsovereign nations. It does not and cannot have any otherwill than that expressed here by Member States. The drasticincrease in the number of Members over the last four years something that had not been seen since the days of18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessiondecolonization  underscores this characteristic and is alsoproof of the confidence that we States place in the UnitedNations.This community of nations now wishes tointernationalize certain issues which in earlier times fellexclusively within the internal jurisdiction of States.Mexico  as a country aware of its internationalresponsibilities  is acting within the requirements of the newconsensuses. But we must repeat time and again that wereject the idea of international action developing to thedetriment of national sovereignty.All the peoples represented here must participate inforging the Organization of the future. Mexico sees in anyreforms a historic opportunity to strengthen the democraticlife of this Organization.The question of equitable representation in the SecurityCouncil plays a central role in the reform of ourOrganization. There is a consensus on the need to increasethe number of seats in the Council. Whereas in 1945 therewere 51 Members of the United Nations  today there are 184of us. For this reason  we should perhaps try  at the veryleast  to double the number of seats in the Council. Butsimply increasing the membership would not be enough.The restructuring of the Council must take into account first of all  the fact that the Council lacks authority of itsown. It acts by the mandate of those of us who havedecided  as sovereign States  to delegate our authority to itfor the delicate task of maintaining world peace. Thequestion of the Council’s composition must be addressedhaving regard to the overriding need to guarantee thelegitimacy and transparency of the Council’s actions.Those who make the greatest contributions to themaintenance of peace  not necessarily those who are thelargest producers and exporters of the world’s weapons should be members of the Council. Carrying out peace-keeping operations is not simply a question of placingmilitary contingents at the Council’s disposition. We mustrecognize the efforts of all those countries which havebrought about the peaceful settlement of internationaldisputes. The recent frequent recourse to the SecurityCouncil has tended to hide the fact that our first obligationis to resolve differences by peaceful means.A representative body must be democratic. The rightof veto is not democratic  and therefore Mexico has neversupported it. Together  we must seek new ways to controlthe exercise of that right and ensure that no permanentmember alone can decide or obstruct the Council’s action.Transparency in the working methods of the Councilwill restore to the General Assembly the primacy derivedfrom its universality and pluralism. We propose that aGeneral Assembly working group be established to makerecommendations on all aspects of the Security Council’sreform.In recent years peace-keeping operations have increasedconsiderably. This shows that the world has not yetmanaged to resolve its most pressing problems.Nationalisms persist. Xenophobia and racism are onthe rise. Extreme poverty has increased.Mexico sees peace-keeping operations as an excellentinstrument for containing the effects of conflict situations.Such operations exist to create the conditions for a politicalsolution to be reached by peaceful means. They are anopportunity for peace  but they are not peace itself.Before the Security Council decides to set up a peace-keeping operation  all parties to the conflict must have giventheir consent. Only in this way can we guarantee theinviolability of the sovereign rights of States and respect fortheir internal jurisdiction.A clear mandate is also indispensable. Preciselybecause their functions have become diversified  the BlueHelmets must have clearly delimited fields of activity. MyGovernment is concerned that the scope of activity of themembers of those forces can be widened in situ  and thattheir areas of competence are confused with other collectiveactions based on the enforcement measures outlined inChapter VII of the Charter.In Somalia United Nations forces should only ensurethat the international humanitarian aid reaches its intendedbeneficiaries. The international community’s support forpeace-keeping operations and humanitarian relief depends ontheir impartiality and transparency.Mexico makes an urgent appeal to Member Statesimmediately to lay down parameters regulating all aspects ofthe establishment and functioning of peace-keepingoperations.No force can replace political will in finding solutionsto international conflicts. This is demonstrated by theForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 19agreement between the Palestinian Liberation Organizationand the State of Israel regarding autonomy for the occupiedterritories. Mexico congratulates both the parties involved as well as those who assisted them in this great success ofpolitical intelligence  of concertation and respect for therights of the other side. Weapons are yielding to the rule ofreason. The self-determination of peoples and the right ofevery State to live within secure and recognized boundaries -principles to which Mexico has always subscribed - arebeginning to gain strength in the Middle East.In contrast to the signs of hope we are seeing in theMiddle East  the failure of the efforts to bring peace to theformer Yugoslavia is clear. Peace plans come and go  butthere has been no end to the killing and suffering ofinnocent people. Mexico urges all the parties to the conflictto agree on concrete confidence-building measures whichwill allow the conditions for a broad  lasting agreement to becreated.Mexico welcomes the recent decision by the UnitedStates  France  the United Kingdom and Russia unilaterallyto extend the moratorium on nuclear testing. This decisionwill make it possible for the Conference on Disarmamentfinally to begin negotiations to ratify a treaty completelybanning these tests. We hope that all the nuclear Powers including China  will join the moratorium.This historic decision  inspired and encouraged from thebeginning by my country  will be a vital step in preventingthe proliferation of nuclear weapons. Mexico stresses thepriority of the negotiations  both on their own merits andbecause of the effect they will have on the next Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference  which willdetermine the future of this important internationalinstrument. For Mexico  the complete cessation of nucleartests is inextricably linked to the fate of the non-proliferationregime.The community of nations must now confront anotherdanger: drugs. Now the largest illegal business in history they are putting an end to human lives  corrupting the forcesof order and harming political institutions  and they can evenaffect the stability of States.We cannot question the merit of the United NationsConvention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs andPsychotropic Substances  an instrument which has served toguide State policies and coordinate international cooperation.Certain local and national battles have been won as a resultof them. But the war has not been won  and it is now aworld war.In view of the uncontrollable spread throughout theworld of the dirty business of drugs  of their consumption production and traffic  and all the related illegal activities we must give thought to the ineffectiveness of the strategieswe have followed  and we must adopt a new course. Wemust intensify our political determination  imagination andstrategic creativity and  above all  international cooperationin which there is respect for sovereignty and no one claimspreeminence  in order to stop the growth of this terriblesocial cancer.Another central issue of our times is the great migratorycurrents which are developing with renewed vigour as thecentury draws to a close. The great international migrationsare a result of the polarization of wealth and well-being.They are a problem which affects the entire world exceeding the capacity for action of individual States. Weneed new plans for international cooperation to seeksolutions to the most distressing problems relating toeconomic underdevelopment.Every wave of migration throughout history has its ownexplanations  and the explanations are not necessarily related.However  they always include the search for a better life.Changes in the world’s structure are both a brake onmigration and an encouragement. In 1989  1 per cent of theworld’s population - more than 50 million people - livedoutside their country of origin. In 1992  only three yearslater  this figure had doubled. At the beginning of the1990s  the number of refugees in the world had reached 17million.Those countries which  because of their economicdevelopment and social peace  seem to be able to accept newgroups of migrants are today undergoing internal conflicts attimes expressed through manifestations of ethnic andreligious intolerance.During this period of difficult transition towards a newordering of power and balance in the world  internaltensions  protectionist tendencies  the global recession andthe disintegration of numerous States have combined tomake certain countries perceive the phenomenon ofmigration as a threat to their national security.Let us keep this phenomenon from overwhelming us byadopting restrictive measures that are only superficialpalliatives.Mexico proposes that the Assembly begin seriousthought on this subject as soon as possible.20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe national plans of any State must be based onpolicies which make it possible for the inhabitants to live ina dignified manner in their own country. Only in this waycan we ensure that whole peoples will not try to leave insearch of better economic opportunities. Extreme povertyhas increased in all areas of the world. For as long as therichest one fifth of the world’s population represents 83 percent of total income  we will have failed in our efforts ateconomic cooperation.The countries of Latin America and those of Centraland Eastern Europe have made special efforts to makeinternal adjustments to bring about economic reforms thatwould have been hard even to imagine a few years ago. Theproblem of critical poverty  however  cannot be left to thewhim of market forces. In Mexico the State has notabdicated its social responsibility. Indeed  we havestrengthened our development policies based on solidarity.President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has said  time andtime again  that in order to consolidate any programme ofadjustment and economic stability  the promotion of socialprogrammes is indispensable. He has also stressed that theexpansion  modernization and proper orientation ofeducational programmes was the only way  in the long term to increase productivity and raise the living standards of thepeople.The convening of the World Summit for SocialDevelopment in 1995 shows that the United Nations hasacknowledged the priority nature of this item on theinternational agenda. Mexico is already participating withenthusiasm in preparations for this important event.In the course of this year the World Conference onHuman Rights was held at Vienna. The agreements reachedmust lead to a strengthening of already existing legalinstruments. The community of States participating in theConference expressed their political determination toimplement these agreements in a non-selective manner  withobjectivity and respect for universality. This is afundamental aspect of the protection and promotion ofhuman rights throughout the world. Mexico would repeatbefore the Assembly that full respect for human rightsrequires us to direct our efforts towards the weakest groups:those that live in conditions of poverty  refugees  ethnicminorities  and all those people in need of respect for theirway of life and their culture.Mexico’s total trade with the United States of Americaand Canada is equivalent to 20 per cent of its gross nationalproduct. For this reason it signed the North American FreeTrade Agreement and parallel agreements. On that basis wehope to promote  regulate and ensure trade flows  servicesand investments among these three countries. In due coursethis will be the largest free-trade area in the world: 360million people with a product worth $7 trillion  a movingforce of principal importance for the world economy.But Mexico is also a substantial and proud part of LatinAmerica. We have our cultural links and historic alliancesin Latin America. We give priority to our cooperation withCentral America and with the countries of the Caribbean.We participate actively in the Rio Group and in the LatinAmerican Economic System (SELA). We  together withColombia and Venezuela  are involved in negotiations onfree trade with the Group of Three  and we hope that thesewill be completed this year. With Chile we already have anagreement which has been in existence since January 1992.We are also having talks with other countries in the area.We participate actively in the Ibero-AmericanConference  which is gaining the kind of standing that befitsan organization of 21 Spanish- and Portuguese-speakingcountries in America and Europe.As an Atlantic country we feel very close to Europe where we have our principal partners and friends. We feelespecially close to the European Community  with which wehave a standing dialogue.We are also a Pacific country and have significantlyexpanded the number of our representatives and our tradewith Asian countries. We appreciate the support that hasbeen given to us by the countries of the Asia PacificEconomic Cooperation Council to help us to enter that bodyvery soon.We have also been invited by the 24 countries of theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD). We appreciate the invitation. We are working outthe details of our entry into this prestigious group.We congratulate the leaders of South Africa  PresidentDe Klerk and Nelson Mandela  on the agreements that theyhave reached and we are ready immediately to initiate fullrelations with that Republic.We recognize and fully support the efforts that havebeen made in Haiti. Our Ambassador has now returned toPort au Prince. We reiterate our offer to the Secretary-General to give technical and economic resources for thegeneral recovery of Haiti.Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 21We wish to continue to be respectful friends of eachand every one of the States that are Members of the UnitedNations.The central strategy of the foreign policies of PresidentCarlos Salinas de Gortari are diversification and thedeepening of our relations with all regions and countries ofthe world.Mexico has already begun preparations for thecommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations. In my country this will not be an occasion formeaningless celebrations and self-congratulatory gestures.We are making a serious effort to give serious thought to thefuture of the Organization. The first question that we mustanswer  however  is: What functions do we want the UnitedNations to perform in the coming century? All the rest willfollow by accretion.If in truth we have an opportunity - as has so oftenbeen said since the end of the cold war - to turn theOrganization into the cornerstone of a truly new  more justinternational order  then let us take action."
"108",4555,"MHL",48,1993,"On behalf of thepeople and the Government of the Republic of the MarshallIslands  I warmly congratulate Ambassador Samuel Insanallyon his election as President of what promises to be a historicsession of the General Assembly. I would also like toexpress my country’s profound appreciation to hispredecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  Foreign Minister ofBulgaria  for his superior guidance during a time ofunprecedented change.We are gathered here at a crucial juncture in humanhistory when numerous changes are becoming apparent.Few of us ever imagined that we would witness in ourlifetimes the dismantling of the Berlin Wall  a handshakebetween the leaders of Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization  the peaceful separation of Eritrea fromEthiopia after decades of war  or the transition to aGovernment in South Africa that is truly representative of itspeople. In the current international climate we can beoptimistic about the peaceful resolution of the difficultproblems of our time. However  at the same time our worldwitnesses these triumphs of the human spirit  it also facesgrave new problems  such as the tragedies that are unfoldingin Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Somalia.The new order will require fundamental changes in theattitudes and thinking of nations and all mankind. Gone arethe clearly defined divisions of super-Power conflict. Intheir place are a myriad of problems  suppressed during thecold war  that are now resurfacing. The confrontationbetween East and West has given way to more intricateproblems  without readily apparent solutions. There are noeasy answers for bringing restraint to the extremes of ethnicand religious nationalism  or promoting human rights andsustainable development. Yet the past few months haveshown the real progress that can be made on even the mostintractable problems. Rather than wringing our hands  wemust draw upon the diversity of views represented in thisgrand Hall and upon the examples of those who dedicatedtheir lives to the struggle to bring peace to the world.The world’s billions are increasingly looking to theUnited Nations for solutions. However  as currentlystructured and financed  the United Nations by itself cannotaccommodate the breadth and gravity of the many problemsit faces. It is our view that the Organization must becarefully re-evaluated to ensure its effectiveness in asituation of new realities. We support the creation of anOffice of Inspector General and will continue to study thevarious proposals for expansion of the Security Councilmembership.As proud Members of this body  we cheer ourOrganization’s successes and are troubled by its fewsetbacks. The Marshallese people mourn the loss ofmembers of United Nations peace-keeping missions  whichare bravely endeavouring to maintain peace and provideassistance to those in danger.Allow me  for a moment  to address the specialsituation of the island nations. The physical limitations ofislands and their lack of natural resources  which largernations might regard as insurmountable barriers  we  bynecessity  view as challenges to overcome. Throughouthistory  islanders have displayed a remarkable degree ofinnovation and adaptation  which has allowed us to survivenumerous natural and man-made disasters. Our people andway of life were not deterred by the horrors of modernweaponry from which the Marshallese people sufferedduring the nuclear testing. Despite the end of the super-Power arms race  the world must still confront the gravedangers of nuclear testing  nuclear proliferation  and theproduction  transit and disposal of nuclear material. TheMarshall Islands will forever have a special interest in thedismantling of nuclear weapons because many Marshallesepeople are still prevented from returning to their ancestors’homeland.As survivors of that legacy  we very much welcomedthe nuclear-testing moratorium. We are greatly distressedthat this moratorium has now been broken by one of thenuclear Powers  and we would appeal to the others not tofollow this path. I should like to lend my Government’svoice to the voices of others that have called for negotiationson a lasting and effective comprehensive nuclear-test-bantreaty that will enjoy universal adherence. It is the wish ofthe people of the Marshall Islands that no one else shouldhave to endure the same hardships and physical harm thatwe did. We pray for a world free from nuclear testing andintend to participate actively in the steps leading to such atreaty.We were proud to be one of the first signatories of theConvention on the Prohibition of the Development Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons andon Their Destruction earlier this year in Paris. We will doour part to contribute to the goal of the abolition of thatimmoral class of weapons and commend the many officialswho worked on the Convention for their tireless efforts.Perhaps the most effective way to avoid the graveconsequences of nuclear weapons is to address the problemat its source by prohibiting the production of weapons-gradeplutonium. We therefore look forward to working on atreaty to this effect  and we commend the United States andothers for taking the lead in this regard.The islands of the Pacific are especially vulnerable tothe dangers posed by transport of nuclear material. We hopethat such shipments will cease. If they are to continue  theStates responsible must take every precaution to ensure thatthe safety of States along the sea lanes and the high seas isensured.All of humanity is shocked by the brutality ofnationalist and ethnic conflicts raging throughout the worldtoday. The possibility of introducing nuclear weapons inthese disputes threatens global peace and security and raisesthe spectre of death and suffering on a magnitude neverbefore witnessed. My Government will continue to supportall efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.The efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) in the area of nuclear safeguards merit specialpraise. I am very pleased to report that last week theMarshall Islands was accepted as a member of the IAEA and we look forward to contributing to the work of theAgency. We are confident that the Agency’s vast expertisein the area of protection from radiation can shed light on thematter and at the same time come up with remedialtreatment for the many Marshallese victims afflicted bynumerous cancerous diseases resulting from nuclear testing.My Government warmly applauds the increasedattention by the world community to human rights anddemocratic institutions. Although it fell short of some of ourexpectations  this year’s World Conference on Human Rightswas an important milestone in the efforts to protect therights of individuals and vulnerable sectors of society.Perhaps more important  the Vienna Declaration andProgramme of Action clearly demonstrated that respect forbasic human rights and fundamental freedoms can exist in acontext of cultural diversity.As important as the Vienna Declaration is  it ismeaningless without the means to enforce its provisions.We will therefore continue strongly to support efforts aimedat creating a post of United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights and a Special Rapporteur for Women’sRights  and we will continue to study proposals for aninternational court with jurisdiction to consider cases ofhuman-rights violations.Tomorrow’s leaders are today’s children. With this inmind  we must ensure that our children are well prepared toaccept the mantle that will be passed on to them. Fordecades  the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) hasadvanced this objective with determination  and we areespecially appreciative of its assistance to the Marshallesechildren. We are proud to have recently ratified theConvention on the Rights of the Child  and we encourageothers to do the same so that the world may attainUNICEF’s goal of universal adherence by the year 2000.The Marshall Islands are endowed with natural beautyand a rich cultural heritage. The development potential ofForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 3our islands resides in the preservation of their fragileenvironment. Because our land area is so limited  we treatit with the greatest respect and conserve it as best we can.Given the small land area of our atolls  we faceconstraints to agricultural and industrial development. Asthe pressure from a growing population increases in mycountry  additional demands are made on our resources.Regrettably  we have become increasingly dependent onimports to meet basic human needs.The long distances from markets of many islands resultin especially high transport costs. In our case  we are almost2 000 miles from the nearest major market for our goods.Consequently  transport costs raise the cost of goods tolevels that are often not competitive. Even with competitiveproducts  restrictive trade barriers further limit our access tomarkets. We are hopeful that the negotiations of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will produce atrade agreement that is equitable and fair to all nations.The Marshall Islands welcomes with gratitude therecently approved country programme of the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP). It would be especiallywelcome if this plan of action could assist my countrysignificantly along the road to sustainable development. Thespirit of cooperation that was exhibited at the first round-table meeting in 1991 is evident in this programme. It ishoped that this will be the first step in a long and fruitfulpartnership and that the UNDP will become more responsiveto the special needs of the Marshall Islands. Like many ofthe island States in the region  the Marshall Islands is not atraditional recipient of overseas development aid  and wehave few bilateral partners. Given its regional expertise  weare pleased that UNDP is becoming a major focal point forour development assistance. UNDP understands thecomplexities of the Pacific region and the developmentchallenge for the island States. We hope that the UNDPbudget for the region will not be cut back any further. ThePacific is a vast area  and the logistical challenges faced bythe field office in Suva  Fiji  are daunting.Sustainable development is a primary objective ofGovernment planning. We are increasingly aware of thelimits that constrain our development potential. We want toprosper on the resources that we have  but we do not wantto repeat mistakes that others have made on their road todevelopment. I commend our neighbour  Papua NewGuinea  for the important work it has initiated to integratesustainable development into the framework of internationalrelations.The Marshall Islands is a small nation  and weincreasingly feel the strain caused by our expenditures on theUnited Nations. We are  of course  very grateful and proudto be a part of this body  but we are becoming worried at thescale of new contributions  particularly for peace-keepingoperations. The burden of membership is not shared equallyby every citizen of the world  and we would like to see thisinequity in contributions addressed in some way. If onelooks at the cost of United Nations membership on a percapita basis  one sees that the island States are among thevery top contributors.The vulnerability of small islands to natural disastersand to fluctuations in the world economy make it difficult toquantify the well-being of our people. Calculations of per -capita gross domestic product and other traditional economicindices do not accurately represent the standard of living inthe islands. Perhaps other criteria could be devised to reflectthe complexities of our situation.The Marshall Islands was one of the first countries toratify the Conventions adopted at the Rio Conference on theenvironment. Developments subsequent to the Rio summithave been closely observed by the Marshall IslandsGovernment. It is our sincere hope that the process initiatedat Rio de Janeiro will succeed  so that our islands can besaved from possible destruction by global climate change.The Global Conference on the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States will increase world-wideunderstanding of the vulnerability of our islands. TheGovernment of Barbados is to be thanked for generouslyoffering to host that Conference next year. We are however  a little disturbed by the response by some donorcountries to the Conference. It must be reiterated that theConference has its mandate from Rio and from the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly  and that it shouldbe considered as a test case for sustainable development. Itwill be an attempt to address issues that are specific to smallisland States in their quest for sustainable development. Thewill of the global community to live up to the promisesmade in Rio will face its first test  and the implications ofthe outcome of the Conference will be significant to all.Throughout history the sea has united my people andhas been vital to our lives. It provides our nourishment; itis a source of income; and our culture and traditions have inlarge part been shaped by the ocean. The majority of ourpopulation derives its livelihood from ocean-based activities and our territorial waters abound with fish that can feedpeople around the world. Clearly  our fate is tied to theocean. Today  however  our way of life is threatened by arise in the level of the very ocean that has given us life for4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionthousands of years. We are greatly appreciative of theefforts and attention given to the problem by the worldcommunity  most notably in the Framework Convention onClimate Change  signed at the Rio Earth Summit  which myGovernment is proud to have ratified.However  for a low-lying atoll like the Marshall Islandsthe Framework Convention may have come too late. We areeager that funds from all sectors of the United Nationssystem  especially the Global Environment Facility  be madeavailable for the purpose of adaptation to a rise in the sealevel. We also realize fully that changes required ofresidents of industrialized countries will entail considerablesacrifice  at least initially. However  countless studies haveshown that steps to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions wouldgreatly benefit those countries in the future.The threat to the Marshall Islands is imminent. Ourway of life is threatened. My country is threatened with aloss of identity and culture. We are powerless in the handsof others and my country may cease to exist as a result.I would like everyone in this Hall to visit our corner ofthe world before it disappears. I hope that 30 years fromtoday our islands will not have been swamped by the seaand that we will be able to invite you again  rather thanreferring you to a page in a history book. For many  theMarshall Islands may be little more than specks on the map.The peoples of the Pacific hold a very different view of theworld: that the world would be greatly diminished by theloss of even one of the diverse cultures that have beencrafted by mankind.Let us strive during the coming months to work intandem and to endeavour to fulfil the grand aspirations andlofty goals that this Organization represents. As we do this allow me to offer a Marshallese proverb to guide our work:""Jouj eo mour eo  lej eo mij eo"" - ""Alone we cannot survive but together we are strong""."
"109",4578,"MKD",48,1993,"At the outset  it is my pleasureto extend to you  Sir  my sincere felicitations on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsforty-eighth session. In discharging your important duties you can count on the support and cooperation of mydelegation. Your wide experience and diplomatic skills area valuable asset for the success of this important session ofthe General Assembly.This is the first time that my country  the Republic ofMacedonia  is attending a session of the General Assemblyas an independent State committed to making its fullcontribution to the enhancement of world peace and thepromotion of international cooperation.The Republic of Macedonia is a country with foreignpolicies based on the principles of peace  friendship andcooperation. We see the interdependence of interests andmutual respect as the future of successful internationalcooperation. An important element of our foreign policy isto promote good-neighbourly relations and to incorporate theprinciples of the new European architecture in thecrisis-ridden region of the Balkans. Such a foreign policy isconsistent with the internal development of the Republic ofMacedonia  which is oriented towards a market economy democracy  a State of law  human rights and harmony ininter-ethnic relations.By attaining its independence in a peaceful andlegitimate manner  the Republic of Macedonia has kept thepeace and forestalled a spill-over of the war into thesouthern Balkans. The comprehensive efforts of the pasttwo years have changed our historic position from a bone ofcontention to a factor for peace and stability in the Balkans.Pursuant to this  the endeavours of the delegation of theRepublic of Macedonia in the course of this session will beaimed at strict compliance with the United Nations Charter;support for all measures that enhance international peace andsecurity; the democratization of international relations in allspheres; the advancement of human rights and freedoms tothe utmost degree; the promotion and development of apolicy of good-neighbourly relations; forestalling theproliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction; andthe enhancement of preventive diplomacy in settlingdisputes.The adverse situation of the world today is a source ofconcern to all of us. We are not fully satisfied with theefforts of our Organization nor especially with the results ithas achieved in resolving current sources of tension. Weaccept the assertion that the world today is not threatened bya new world war and that the use of nuclear arms is not verylikely. But the fact remains that the number of serious andpotential military conflicts is increasing. The efforts of ourOrganization to find peaceful solutions have been enormous.Regrettably  the results have not always been productive owing to a certain extent to the absence of a widerimplementation of preventive diplomatic measures andactivities.I take this opportunity to emphasize the extraordinarysignificance of the historical accord between Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization for peace in the MiddleEast and the development of world relations. All those whohave contributed to its signing deserve our specialrecognition.In this context  I am deeply convinced that  despite alldifficulties  we will soon be speaking of South Africa as aregion of successful development and human dignity. Let ushope that the forces of peace in that region will ultimatelyprevail over the forces of regression and apartheid.I must reiterate our deep concern over the perpetuationof the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina  the threat of aspill-over and a wider destabilization of our region. In deadearnest we  a country situated in the immediate vicinity  seethis as the threat of an all-out Balkan war. The situation inBosnia and Herzegovina is extremely grave  tragic andincomprehensible. The most terrible post-cold-war drama isunfolding in the heart of Europe: massive killings  massivedestruction  over 2 million refugees  insane acts of ethniccleansing and genocide. Numerous international conferencesand activities have been undertaken in order to bring an endto this war. The Security Council has adopted numerousresolutions. Let us all hope that peace in Bosnia will finallybecome a reality.An end to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a firstand essential step. However  permanent peace in Bosnia andHerzegovina will not be possible without compliance with and upholding of  the fundamental principles of internationallaw  the United Nations Charter and the principles of theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) namely that borders cannot be changed by force; that theinternational community does not recognize or accept ""ethniccleansing""; and that the rights of minorities must berespected.Without these preconditions  not only will permanentpeace in Bosnia and Herzegovina be impossible  but aprecedent will be set which will incite new conflicts. Tocondone the use of force and military superiority forterritorial expansion and redrawn borders would exacerbateother  less heated  tensions  especially in the ethnicallymixed Balkans and the countries of Eastern Europe. Itwould in fact mean condoning the potential for permanentinter-ethnic wars.Forty-eighth session - 30 September l993 3The Republic of Macedonia is vitally interested inseeing an end to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina forestalling a spill-over and attaining peace on lastingfoundations. For these reasons  and out of concern for ourown security and for peace and stability in the region  wehave undertaken a number of timely preventive measures incooperation with the United Nations. In this context  Iwould like to stress the key role played by Security Councilresolution 795 (1992) of December 1992 for the deploymentof a contingent from the United Nations Protection Force(UNPROFOR) in the Republic of Macedonia.The decision of the Security Council  to which theSecretary- General made a great contribution  has proved tobe justified  timely and efficient. It has demonstrated theenormous advantages of preventive diplomacy. Thepeace-keeping forces of the United Nations  strengthened bythe United States contingent  are of great importance for oursecurity and for sustaining peace and stability in the region.Our cooperation with these forces is exemplary  and it willremain so in the future. This step has greatly increased thefeelings of security and trust in the peace-keeping activitiesof the United Nations on the part of the citizens of theRepublic of Macedonia.As a country and as a people  our permanent interestlies in peace and cooperation in the Balkans. In the samespirit  our efforts are aimed at establishing good- neighbourlyrelations with all our neighbours and at resolving all existingproblems with our southern neighbour. The war in Bosniaand Herzegovina  the implementation of United Nationssanctions against Serbia and Montenegro  and the remains ofbloc divisions prevalent until recently prevent the Balkansfrom functioning on natural regional principles. Economicand cultural ties  communications  the free flow of people goods and ideas have practically been severed. This isindeed a depressing situation. In order to prepare for thetwenty-first century and a Europe of open borders andcooperation  it is essential that the Balkans undergo majorchanges. This is in the interest of all the peoples and all thecountries in this region. Those are the reasons whyMacedonia has adopted policies of good-neighbourlyrelations  peaceful settlement of problems and developmentof overall economic  political and cultural cooperationamong the countries of the Balkans. We are truly convincedthat  in the interest of peace and stability  the internationalcommunity will ardently support these processes in theBalkans. The principles of the Conference on Security andCo-operation in Europe and the processes within theEuropean Community are the only options for peace stability and economic revival in the Balkans. However  thisalso implies that all the Balkan States  which have chosenthe European option  must be enabled to achieve gradualintegration into the European Community.We are all dissatisfied with the stagnation of the worldeconomy in the past year  the deterioration of the economicsituation in the world  and the economic situation in certaincountries and regions. The number of people affected byunemployment  poverty and hunger is on the rise. Fordeveloped countries  recovery from the recession has beenslower than expected  hindering their increased participationin the development of the developing countries and countriesin transition.Because of this situation  and because of our firmconviction that the period after the cold war must not growinto a period of economic conflicts  we believe that muchmore can be done to seek a way out of the world’s currenteconomic and social difficulties. In this context  I amconvinced that the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly will serve as firm encouragement for an increasein world demand and for liberalization of world trade. Avery important prerequisite for the realization of this goal isthe successful outcome of the Uruguay Round of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations encouraged by the Tokyo summit. It is also essential toresolve the issue of arrears and that of access by developingcountries and countries in transition to international financialmarkets. All of these activities support the view that onlydevelopment generates new development  while stagnationbrings only regression and poverty.Enhanced protection of human rights is justifiablyreceiving greater priority in the work of our Organization.We are concerned by the fact that in the past year  violationsof human rights have reached epidemic proportions. We feelthat the Vienna Conference on Human Rights is a verypositive step in the right direction  and we hope that theDeclaration and Action Programme adopted at thatConference will contribute greatly to ending theunfavourable developments in this area today.The negotiations in Vienna have clearly shown thatcurrent mechanisms for implementing existing human-rightsinstruments are not efficient  and that much improvement isneeded  particularly in the rights of ethnic  religious andlinguistic minorities. A significant step in this direction hasbeen taken by the adoption last year of the Declaration onminorities. The next steps which our delegation will supportare the commencement of operations of the Commission onHuman Rights according to the Declaration on the Rights ofPersons Belonging to National or Ethnic  Religious andLinguistic Minorities  and an examination of the need for4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionsetting up a United Nations high commission for minorities with headquarters in Geneva.I would like to point out that all unresolved issuesinvolving ethnic minorities can well lead to future militaryconflicts  particularly in certain regions of the world  thusendangering international peace. Hence it is essential to takeimmediate preventive measures in this area as well.The Republic of Macedonia is a European country intransition  a landlocked country  a country of transit and adeveloping country. These factors contribute to theeconomic difficulties of my country. The situation is furthercomplicated by the consequences of the United Nationssanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro. I wouldimmediately like to emphasize that we have strictly compliedwith the implementation of the sanctions. As a result  thisyear alone  our gross national product has been cut in half.External trade has been reduced considerably  transport costshave increased immensely  and other indirect damage hasoccurred as well.Today  the survival  democracy and economicdevelopment of the Republic of Macedonia arefundamentally dependent on assistance from the internationalcommunity. Otherwise  it is very possible that socialtensions  and the probable collapse of the economy  willbring about a new crisis spot. I am deeply convinced that in accordance with Article 50 of the Charter and SecurityCouncil resolution 820 (1993)  the United Nations and theSecurity Council will be in a position to provide us withconcrete forms of assistance.It is inconceivable to expect a small country to bear thedamage of an international action of this type on its own without solidarity and timely assistance. Aid should beprovided now as a preventive measure  instead of after theoutbreak of those likely social clashes which may grow intonew conflicts.In this spirit  the delegation of the Republic ofMacedonia at this session will lay out our direct proposalsregarding the problem of compensation for damage incurredas a result of implementing the sanctions  the problemsderiving from the position of landlocked countries  and otherissues related to peace and cooperation.The strengthening of the United Nations in all aspects in the post-cold-war period  is of vital importance to theRepublic of Macedonia. My country belongs to a group ofcountries that can survive and develop only in conditionswithout war  in a world where peace and stability are notthreatened  where international cooperation will be conductedwithout obstacles and discrimination  and a world whereeveryone will have respect for human dignity.In this context  the delegation of the Republic ofMacedonia will make its full contribution to the successfulwork of the forty-eighth session of the General Assemblyand to strengthening the Organization."
"110",4624,"MLI",48,1993,"Atthe outset  I should like  on behalf of the Government andpeople of Mali  to convey to the people of India ourprofound grief at the heavy loss of life and the massivematerial damage caused by the earthquake that has juststruck their country.I have pleasure in expressing to Mr. Insanally theheartfelt and cordial congratulations of the delegation ofMali on his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I wish him everysuccess and assure him of my delegation’s fullestcooperation.Let me take this opportunity also to express oursatisfaction at the exemplary manner in which Mr. StoyanGanev presided over the Assembly’s work at the last session.It is also a pleasure to congratulate the United NationsSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  on theconstant efforts he has made since he became head of theOrganization.The United Nations now consists of 184 MemberStates. This confirms its universality  gives it furthercredibility and explains the renewed interest in seeing itfulfil its promise. Our warmest congratulations go to all thenew Members. We assure them of our full readiness tocooperate with them.The world is most certainly living through times ofgreat change. Ever since the events of 26 March 1991  Malihas been resolutely embarked on a process ofdemocratization. However  this process is unfolding inespecially trying circumstances.In strictly national terms  the transition to democracy which was achieved through the elections of 1992  thoughessentially a success  is being prolonged by new44 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionuncertainties. With regard to social values  one finds aserious identity crisis and a lack of orientation among theyoung  in the workplace and among the traditional players inthe private-sector economy. There is uncertainty also aboutthe way in which the new political institutions operate  asthese need to go through a period of apprenticeship in ademocratic context  where impatience and violence coexistwith a readiness for dialogue and for solidarity. Uncertaintyis to be found also with regard to the new mission  size operation and performance of an administration in transition which must be more transparent and accessible to people atthe grass roots. Uncertainty is to found  finally  in economicdevelopment programmes characterized by the urgent needfor in-depth structural adjustment and the need to reallocatepublic resources to satisfy priority necessities: a basiceducation  public health provision  village water supplies andmaintenance of the infrastructure.At the subregional level  which for Mali encompassesboth western Africa south of the Sahara and the ArabMaghreb  we are dealing with such complex and difficultproblems as instability borne of local conflicts  followed byhuman tragedy  because the number of refugees in thesubregion has risen from approximately 20 000 in 1989 tomore than 1.2 million in 1993; the slow pace of economicintegration  despite all the very vocal declarations ofgoodwill  which is restricting growth in the subregion; andreligious questions which are daily gaining more ground andsubjecting political institutions to new trials that are moredelicate  more difficult to define and cope with and moreterrible.The Government of Mali believes that to copeeffectively and efficiently with those problems and the manychallenges in the process of democratization  we will havequickly to restore economic growth and then develop humanresources  the true way to a successful future  achievemedium-term and long-term stability and thus find theeconomic key to development. Finally  we shall have toguarantee balanced development and comprehensivefinancing for development.In all this  our Government does not forget and  indeed it is meeting its international obligations as well.By the same token  we continue to advocate and towork internationally for a world of peace and concord whereit should be possible to find a solution to all problems bydialogue and negotiation.This courageous political evolution should be stronglysupported because the adverse impact of a disadvantageouseconomic situation  along with drastic structural adjustmentmeasures and problems linked to debt  compounded bysocio-political tension  is having an adverse impact on theentire democratic process.The international environment in which this session isbeing held is marked by many uncertainties linked to the lifeof the Organization and of the international community ingeneral. The post-war period saw the emergence of newdemocracies and the strengthening of protection for humanrights the world over.Over the past three years the Organization has taken ona number of commitments. In terms of peace-keeping  thedeclaration made on 31 January 1992 at the Summit of theHeads of State or Government of the member States of theSecurity Council  set milestones to be reached in establishinga new international order.While remaining committed to the quest forinternational peace and security  we believe that any peacekeeping operation must come within a precise frameworkdefined by the Security Council. Any loss of control mayjeopardize the very credibility of the Organization.Notwithstanding the Organization’s efforts in the searchfor international peace and security  hotbeds of tension  alas persist around the world.In Bosnia and Herzegovina inter-ethnic confrontationand clashes have reached unimaginable proportions. Theinternational community seems  paradoxically  to bewatching passively the breakup of a country uponexclusively ethnic and religious grounds. That is settingalarming precedents.In Angola  despite the many efforts by the UnitedNations  the situation remains alarming. My delegationappeals to all the parties to commit themselves moreintensively to seeking a just and lasting resolution of thisconflict.The situation prevailing in Somalia is a threat to peaceand security in that region. The presence of the UnitedNations  through the United Nations Operation in Somalia(UNOSOM II)  should in principle hold out the promise ofbringing peace to the country and a negotiated politicalresolution of the crisis. Humanitarian aid has made itpossible to avoid irreparable damage being done  but webelieve that UNOSOM II must attempt to silence the gunsand create a climate favourable to reconciliation among allSomalis.Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 45Whilst areas of serious tension persist  we would dowell to welcome the positive turn of events in the settlementof other conflicts.In Liberia hope has been rekindled  with the recentsigning of the Cotonou Agreement  the entry into force ofthe cease-fire and the setting up of the high Council of State.The expansion of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) Military ObserverGroup (ECOMOG) and greater involvement by the UnitedNations in implementing the agreement might lead to therebirth of the Liberian State. This is the time and place toappeal to the international community immediately to createsupport funds and to implement the Cotonou Agreement.In Mozambique the acceptance of a new timetable toimplement the Peace Agreements will promote theimplementation of the United Nations Operation inMozambique (ONUMOZ). We pay tribute to the parties forrespecting the cease-fire.As to the conflict in Rwanda  we are reassured by thesense of responsibility being displayed by the Governmentand the Rwanda Patriotic Front. The signature in Arusha on4 August last of an agreement between the two partiesproves that a political settlement of a conflict is alwayspossible if all sides have the will. We therefore welcomethis determination of the parties concerned and encouragethem to pursue dialogue and strictly and scrupulously toimplement the requirements of the Agreement in observingthe cease-fire. The United Nations and the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) should strive  for their part  toconsolidate this major achievement.In South Africa the multiracial negotiations willcertainly see the advent of a democratic  non-racial andunited South Africa. The United Nations must pursue itscooperation with the Organization of African Unity tosupport the process. However  the Government in placemust take forceful measures to put an end to the wave ofviolence sweeping the country. The insecurity is fertileground for anarchy and disorder.We welcome the turn events have taken in thereferendum process under way in Western Sahara with thecooperation of all parties. The joint efforts of the UnitedNations and the Organization of African Unity to bring abouta negotiated settlement can  we are convinced  succeed if theparties directly concerned continue their cooperation. It istherefore necessary for their decision-making bodies to workclosely with the United Nations Identification Commissionto resolve the last remaining obstacles linked to criteria foridentifying electors and establishing proof of identity. Mydelegation reaffirms its support for the process.Mali has been following with keen interest the latestdevelopments on the question of Palestine. The mutualrecognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)and the State of Israel  followed by the signing of adeclaration of principles on Palestinian autonomy in Gazaand Jericho  mark a major step towards a just and lastingsettlement of the question of Palestine and the establishmentof relations of trust between the peoples of that region.My delegation hails the Israeli-Palestinianrapprochement  fruit of the courage and political realism ofthe leaders of both parties and the praiseworthy effortsaround the world to make the negotiations a success. Weinvite all the parties concerned to give tangible expression tothis remarkable spirit so as to bring about a definitive peacein the Middle East in accordance with the relevant UnitedNations resolutions.In Haiti the signing of the Governors Island Agreementand the New York Pact should soon make it possible for thelegitimate President of that country to return. We hail thesteps taken by the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy which have made it possible to attain the results achieved sofar.Elsewhere - in Cambodia  Afghanistan and El Salvador- we praise the efforts to bring about progressivenormalization.With regard to the dispute pitting Libya against certainother Member States  the Government of Mali reaffirms itssupport for implementation of Security Council resolutions731 (1992) and 748 (1992). We condemn terrorism in all itsforms. In supporting the resolutions adopted in this contextby the Organization of African Unity  the Arab MaghrebUnion and the Organization of the Islamic Conference among others  the Government of Mali hopes for continuednegotiation and action from the Secretary-General. A justand equitable resolution of this crisis and a rapid lifting ofthe embargo would contribute to creating a climate of peaceand security in the subregion and to removing a major factorpreventing the economic development of the peoplesconcerned.As to the Korean peninsula  my delegation encouragesthe pursuit of the negotiation process set in train andstrongly hopes that it will lead to the peaceful reunificationof the two Koreas.46 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionI now revert to development issues of particularimportance to the African continent: the situation of theleast developed countries; the problems of children andwomen and population issues; and environmental problems -in particular  desertification.The adoption in Paris in 1990 of a programme of actionfor the least developed countries rightly gave rise to a greatdeal of hope. We cannot but note  however  that three yearsafter its adoption  the economic results have not come up toexpectations. According to a 1992 report of the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD):""For the least developed countries as a whole  percapita income declined in 1990 and again in 1991.There is little hope that 1992 will be better  and theprospects for 1993 are scarcely promising.""It is therefore important to abide by the commitments madeat the Paris Conference aimed at improving the economicsituation of the least developed countries.By the same token  so far as the land-locked countriesare concerned  steps must be taken to follow through on theconclusions and recommendations of the Meeting ofGovernmental Experts from Land-Locked Countries andTransit Developing Countries and Representatives of DonorCountries and Financial and Development Institutions  heldin New York in May 1993  in implementation of resolution46/212.The Declaration and Plan of Action adopted at theWorld Summit for Children and the goals spelled out for the1990s on that occasion have set new targets for improvingthe living conditions of children the world over. Allmembers of the international community are called upon tocontribute to the implementation of commitments made atthat Summit. In this connection  we must also see to theimplementation of the Consensus of Dakar of 1992  whichemerged from the International Conference on Assistance toAfrican Children.My delegation has high hopes of international meetingsto be held over the next several years on resolving socialproblems  both at the individual State level andinternationally.The World Summit for Social Development  scheduledfor 1995 in Copenhagen  will be a key event for ourOrganization. We expect good results from that Summit andhope that it will contribute to narrowing the gap betweensocial groups within a single entity  North and South.The World Conference on Women  scheduled to beheld in 1995 in Beijing  will also afford us an opportunity toreview the various programmes and initiate further actionaimed at establishing an effective policy to bring women intothe development process.Another important gathering will be the WorldConference on Population and Development  scheduled for1994 in Cairo. This Conference will make it possible todefine a new strategy for developing human resources having regard to economic and environmental factors.Environmental problems now occupy an important placein national  regional and international developmentprogrammes. The United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development  held in Rio de Janeiro inJune 1992  laid the groundwork for sound joint managementof development.Agenda 21  the Convention on Climate Change and theConvention on Biological Diversity demonstrated thereadiness of the signatories of those historic documents tomove away from current production and consumptionpatterns. Implementing commitments made in Rio requiresmobilizing substantial financial resources for developingcountries and strengthening their scientific  technical andinstitutional capabilities.Mali welcomes the creation by the Economic andSocial Council (ECOSOC) of the Commission onSustainable Development  in accordance with resolution47/191. At its first session  held in June 1993  theCommission dealt with fundamental problems which must besolved if Agenda 21 is to become a reality.One of the chief goals is to mobilize financialresources. Restructuring the Global Environment Facility(GEF)  democratizing its management rules and decisionmaking rules and mobilizing additional resources mustfacilitate the execution of the various chapters of Agenda 21.Fighting drought and desertification is one of the maingoals that African countries have set for themselves. Mycountry  two thirds of whose surface is desert  and which hassuffered the terrible impact of drought over the last 20 years welcomes the setting up of the IntergovernmentalNegotiating Committee for the elaboration of an internationalconvention to combat drought and desertification. At thetwo substantive Committee sessions held respectively inForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 47Nairobi  in June this year  and in Geneva  in September thisyear  there was an evaluation of the problem ofdesertification. Information was exchanged and data that canbe taken into account in future negotiations were collected.My delegation hopes that the current negotiations on theconvention to fight drought and desertification will lead toa real commitment so that the international conferencescheduled for Paris will be a real success.The issues I have just raised show that the problems ofkeeping peace and maintaining international security  as wellas the problems of economic  social and environmentaldevelopment  are all major challenges that continue to facemankind as it approaches the threshold of the thirdmillennium.My delegation feels that to meet these challenges wemust  in view of the fundamental changes since the 1960s promote greater democratization and a fairer division ofinternational responsibility. Thus developing countries thathave won international sovereignty  and that represent nearlytwo thirds of the population of our planet  rightly call forrepresentation on the Security Council as permanentmembers.Meeting these challenges also requires close cooperationand real solidarity amongst all the players on the worldstage. This means that it is more than ever necessary toreflect deeply on and re-examine  the principles and rules forinternational cooperation.The restructuring exercise to revitalize the economicand social sectors of the United Nations affords us anopportunity to make our Organization more dynamic indevelopment matters and to ensure that it plays a centralrole  in keeping with the provisions of its Charter and therelevant General Assembly resolutions.My delegation  while welcoming the progress made inreforming the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) andcertain of its subsidiary bodies  believes that our thinkingmust go beyond strictly institutional terms. In any event  mycountry feels that the imperative of restructuring is tomaintain and indeed strengthen the United Nations capacityfor intervention in development matters.In implementing this policy we must pay particularattention to furthering and strengthening South-Southcooperation through socio-economic programmes based uponthe realities within the developing countries. Indeed  therevival of economic and technical cooperation betweendeveloping countries is an integral part of a strategy aimedat restoring growth and development worldwide.Finally  my country supports the efforts of theSecretary-General to make the administrative machinery ofthe United Nations more efficient by avoiding duplicationand minimizing operating costs.For several years now the world has been goingthrough major changes. If these profound transformationsare to benefit all mankind  they must be accompanied andsupported by concrete action making it possible to guidethem in the right direction. While these upheavals havebeen managed successfully by some States  their extent hastaken others by surprise  and the problems have exceededtheir ability to contain and control them. Lacking themeans  they find aid from the international communityindispensable. It is at this level that many expectintervention from our Organization  and we can indeed help.The people and Government of Mali have madeimportant  clear choices: first  to consolidate the strong suitsof a Malian nation that is united  though diverse in itscultural and racial composition  as it is carefully andirreversibly building a progressive democracy; secondly  tocarry out in-depth economic reform in harmony with theneeds of worldwide free trade and with the concerns of ourpartners in the international community; thirdly  toimplement a bold policy of involving our people inmanaging their own affairs and simplifying legislation andpublic programmes; and fourthly  to pursue long-termsustainable development in a framework of institutions forsubregional and regional economic integration and inpartnership with all our friends across Africa. We believethat the United Nations and the international communityhave everything to gain from supporting our original andexciting experiment  the hallmark of a new kind ofinternational relations  at once nobler and more rewarding."
"111",4665,"MLT",48,1993,"Before beginning mystatement  may I on behalf of the Government and thepeople of Malta express our profound solidarity with theGovernment and the people of India and with the families ofthe victims of the massive earthquake which has claimed thelives of thousands and left tens of thousands injured andhomeless.Mr. President  I wish to congratulate you on yourunanimous election to the presidency of the forty-eighthsession of the General Assembly. You bring to thisimportant post a wealth of professional experience andpersonal qualities which will undoubtedly make their markin the coming weeks and months.In recent years the office of the presidency of theGeneral Assembly has reasserted its rightful role andrelevance in the light of the momentous events that areoccurring in our time. We have always considered thepresidency of the Assembly as relevant to the structure andperformance of our Organization. The role of the President in our view  should be not only to preside over theAssembly  but also to represent it and to speak on its behalfon the basis of its decisions and resolutions.The United Nations system  with the General Assemblyat its very centre  is increasingly becoming the effectivefocal point of international life  as its founders intended.The responsibilities entrusted to the presidency of theAssembly in this context are therefore both challenging andunique.You are  Mr. President  taking over your newresponsibilities from a predecessor who accomplished histask with resourcefulness and success. I wish to take this12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionopportunity to express our appreciation to outgoing PresidentGanev for his contribution to the revitalization process of theGeneral Assembly. Earlier this year President Ganev visitedMalta on the occasion of the conference we sponsoredjointly with the United Nations on the subject of ForeignMinistries in transition.Within this context  may I welcome those States thatjoined our Organization during the forty-seventh session adding a further dimension to the global representation andresponsibilities of the General Assembly. When the UnitedNations was founded 51 States were signatories to theCharter. Today membership of the United Nations hasreached 184.Circumstances have changed  roles have changed andpersonalities have changed. However  the fundamentals ofthis Organization remain unaltered. Though situations mayat times tempt us to re-invent the wheel  the requirements ofthe United Nations are evolutionary in concept  answering tothe dynamism of world events  calling for our response toaltered situations. This makes it impellent to move towardsa second-generation United Nations which is strong in itsresourcefulness and sensitive to the need for its ownrevitalization.A review of some of this year’s international eventsreflects the acceptance of the United Nations as a guarantorof peace  able not only to withstand problems as they arise but also to absorb its own failures and mistakes.Events in former Yugoslavia reflect not only thelegacies of a past still present  but also the difficult nature ofbringing the parties to an agreement at the negotiating tablewhen so much blood has been shed  so much sufferinginflicted and crimes against man’s most cherished valuescommitted.Operation ""Restore Hope"" in Somalia did not fullyrealize this hope. Indeed  a series of events and mishaps hascontributed to the loss of life of valiant soldiers of theUnited Nations peace-keeping forces as well as the lives ofmany members of the civilian population. A message ofincomprehension has taken over the city of Mogadishu.Developments in Cambodia  on the other hand  are apositive manifestation of the growing effectiveness of theUnited Nations in its peace-keeping role - an area to whichthe Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  hasdedicated so much energy and commitment to ensure thewell-being of so many millions living under the threat ofconflict.The signing of the declaration of principles by theIsraelis and the Palestinians is a rainbow for the MiddleEast. It could well lead to a covenant of peace  breaking acircle of hatred and the legacy of death which has lasted fordecades.""I believe that these two peoples  victims of theadversities of history  require the solidarity andinvolvement of all who can help in moulding eventstowards peace in the region."" (A/45/1000  para. 95)This was one of the conclusions that I drew in reportingback to the Assembly  as its President  following my visit tothe occupied territories in those bleak days of the first weeksof January 1991. I commented that""The Arab-lsraeli conflict has a dimension whichgoes far beyond the territory of Palestine. It involvesnot only the States in the region  the security conceptof the Mediterranean  the relations with Europe and thesuper-Powers  but it also has an effect on the credibilityof the United Nations and the political will behind itsresolutions."" (ibid  para. 89)At the time we tried to explain to both the Israelis andthe Palestinians that living in peace with one’s neighbourbrings that international environment  with secure andguaranteed frontiers  that all States in the region  includingIsrael  need so much to safeguard their future. In conclusionI stated that the purpose of the visit - the first ever by aPresident of the Assembly -""was intended to pave the way for those who conscious of their political responsibilities  can help incontributing towards a lasting peace  which will give tothe peoples in the region man’s most coveted gift;peace in freedom."" (ibid  para. 98)One must give credit  in this context  to the receptiveunderstanding of the then Secretary of State James Baker with whom I had discussed my visit shortly after my return.With consummate diplomacy  he activated the Madridprocess  leading to a dialogue approach long absent betweenthe parties.The leaders of Israel and of the Palestinians haveshown moral courage which will  when pursued  send amessage of hope not only to the peoples of the region but tomany others who have endured long conflicts and seek theroad to peace.Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 13Developments in South Africa have also beenencouraging. Important progress has been made indismantling the condemned policy of apartheid and inbringing together the various communities. Malta is pleasedto see that this progress has reached the stage at whichSouth Africa can fully return to the fold of the internationalcommunity as a respected member  mindful of its obligationsboth at home and abroad. We agree that the lifting ofeconomic sanctions at this stage can and should encourageand assist the people of South Africa in completing theirjourney on the difficult road to genuine freedom  dignity andjustice.The approaching fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations provides an ideal opportunity for the internationalcommunity to take an in-depth look at the means at itsdisposal in carrying out its endeavours for peace  securityand prosperity. This anniversary must be seen as an act ofregeneration. It will highlight the universal richness anddiversity of an institution which now encompasses practicallythe whole of mankind; it will rightly bring to the fore itsqualities of resilience and perseverance  which have beentested and demonstrated time and again over the halfcentury; it will rightly recall the successes achieved over theyears  in spite of often daunting difficulties; and it will salutethe many individuals who have faithfully served  andcontinue to serve  a few with great visibility andprominence  most others quietly and silently  out of thelimelight.The process of regeneration must apply both toinstitutions and to objectives. Central to the institutionalaspect is the role of the General Assembly. As pastPresident  I remain personally deeply involved andcommitted to the revitalization of this Assembly. Eventoday  the international community has yet to fully exploitthe uniqueness and relevance of the General Assembly. Thisis the only global forum where all States are full andpermanent Members; where all States  regardless of size power or wealth  have an equal and sovereign say; where allissues  political  economic  social  cultural or humanitarian can be considered in their entirety and their inter-relatedness;and where the process of decision-making is at the sametime a process of consensus-building.The Assembly is not  and cannot be seen as  in acontest or competition with any other organ of the UnitedNations system. Its role is unique and pre-eminent  and itsdeliberations can only facilitate  enrich and  as appropriate consolidate the decisions of other organs.Some progress has already been achieved in improvingthe efficient functioning of the General Assembly. Therecent adoption of resolution 47/233 is the most recent andwelcome development. We must of course constantlyremind ourselves that there has to be a clear purpose behindmoves towards efficiency. In the case of the GeneralAssembly  the purpose lies essentially in enhancing theeffectiveness and relevance of its deliberative and consensusbuilding role  thus adding to its capacity to follow up andimplement its decisions.Mr. Fajardo Maldonado (Guatemala)  Vice-President took the Chair.The size  composition and methods of operation of theSecurity Council have in recent years become subjects ofintensive debate and sometimes speculation. The Council isa unique tool in the search for peace and security. It is ablend of the idealistic and the pragmatic; it is at one and thesame time a deliberative and a functional organ. The liftingof the cold war’s constraints has had a most visible andcreative impact  releasing and galvanizing the Council’speacemaking and peace-keeping roles. Efforts to enlarge theCouncil and expand its functions must come within theframework envisaged for the Council under the Charter.However  Malta shares with all other United NationsMembers the legitimate expectation of transparency andobjectivity as the hallmark of the Council’s work.The Council must remain conscious of the impact itsdecisions  especially the imposition of sanctions  could haveon third parties. It is important to link the application ofsanctions to a compensatory system for those countrieswhich  through no fault of their own  have to bear theburden and pay the price of sanctions. When deciding todeploy United Nations forces  the Council must also beconscious of its responsibility for the safety and well-beingboth of the forces it deploys and of the inhabitants of theareas concerned. In all its actions  the Council must beinspired by the fundamental peacemaking dimension of itsmandate and by the Charter’s emphasis on the peacefulsettlement of disputes.One of the important objectives of any enlargement ofthe Council’s membership must be to ensure balance andequity in its composition in terms of the present level ofUnited Nations membership. Account must be taken ofregional and geographical considerations; of the need tocreate reasonable opportunities for all United NationsMembers to take their turn in serving on it; and ofconsiderations relating to the size and status of individualUnited Nations Members.14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionAn aspect that requires redefining in its application isthat of regional responsibility for peace-keeping underChapter VIII of the Charter. At the Conference on Securityand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) Helsinki Follow-UpMeeting  Malta’s proposal that the CSCE declare itself theregional arrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of theCharter was endorsed by the Helsinki Summit II. We thinkthat through similar arrangements at the regional levels peace-keeping operations may be more efficiently andeconomically dealt with by countries which  because of theirregional obligations  can assume further responsibilities.This trend has already been manifesting itself in recentyears  and one can only hope that it will be further appliedand consolidated.We believe that the concept of collective securitydepends on the evaluation of a number of factors. This mustnecessarily be coupled with an ever-increasing acceptance bynations that investment in collective security should in partbe substituted for expenditure on national security. Withinthese parameters  it is essential that nations make forcesavailable for peace-keeping purposes and ensure that theyare adequately trained. Articles 43 and 45 of the Charter which have never yet been applied  must be examined to seeto what extent they respond to today’s needs.The concept of human rights has to continue to prevailin our discussions. Malta supports the proposal of having aUnited Nations high commissioner for human rights.We consider the recent establishment of theInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of PersonsResponsible for Serious Violations of InternationalHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the FormerYugoslavia to be a pledge that heinous crimes againsthumanity will not remain unpunished. However  we believethat the establishment of an international criminal court withjurisdiction to try crimes against humanity  war crimes international terrorism and global traffic in narcotics willprovide an institutional concept for dealing with theinternational dimension of such offences.In examining the institutional structure of the UnitedNations  we are repeatedly struck by the continuing absenceof a capacity within the system to deal globally andcomprehensively with the multiple issues of development.Over the last five decades the Bretton Woodsinstitutions have played a major role in the areas of moneyand finance. However  a more significant relationship mustbe built between the United Nations and these institutions.The central capacity originally envisaged for theEconomic and Social Council to bring together theunderlying issues common to all the various facets of thedevelopment debate has remained equally elusive. Thisapplies particularly with regard to entrenched disequilibrium to the availability and allocation of financial resources  totechnical assistance and to the far-reaching and often verysensitive aspects of sustainable development.Within the context of the concept of a secondgeneration United Nations we have made a proposal toactivate further and give an added role to the TrusteeshipCouncil. The Council has served the Organization in dealingwith Territories in its trust  most of which are today validMembers of the United Nations. Its present diminishedrelevance is in fact a reflection of its own success. Yet theconcept of trusteeship lies at the very core of the UnitedNations.We believe that the Trusteeship Council should hold intrust for humanity areas affecting common concerns andcommon heritage. It could have a monitoring function on theprotection of the environment  extraterritorial zones  climateand - of paramount importance - the rights of futuregenerations. These we hold in trust for humanity  and theTrusteeship Council can be the depositary.Malta has always seen its active involvement andparticipation at the regional level in Europe as anindispensable dimension of its role as a member of theinternational community. We have consistently defined ourobjective of becoming a member of the EuropeanCommunity as a logical and natural culmination of ourEuropean vocation. This definition is rooted in Malta’spolitical  social and economic realities  as they have beenshaped by our historical and cultural heritage.Malta has also consistently played an active role in theother European institutions which  together with theEuropean Community  have contributed to the formation ofa modern European consciousness. We see our role in theCouncil of Europe and in the CSCE as an expression andreinforcement of our deepest commitment to the dignity andfreedom of the individual in society. We attach equalimportance to the value of democratic principles andparliamentary practices  respect for sovereignty and mutualunderstanding between nations  respect for legality at bothnational and international levels and the need for improvedinternational cooperation relating to both security anddevelopment.Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 15It is only natural that Malta attaches relevance to theMediterranean region  a region suffering the turmoil ofproblems in its midst. The importance of having itsenvironment safeguarded  the relevance of its sea routes andits strategic role in linking three continents are all factorswith consequences which go far beyond the boundaries ofthe region. Aware of this  Malta has shown continuedinterest and involvement in promoting Mediterraneancooperation. We have supported the idea of a conference onsecurity and cooperation in the Mediterranean  and we haveproposed the establishment of a council for theMediterranean to be a forum for political  economic andsocial dialogue for the region.It was stimulating to hear President Clinton speak fromthis podium of dreaming""new dreams in this age when miracles seem possible"".(A/48/PV.4)We all have our dreams for the future. Countries  large andsmall  rich and poor  dream of a future based on thebetterment of peoples  international solidarity  mutualunderstanding and peace - peace in freedom. We who havethe responsibility of guiding nations have to dream beyondthe confines of our States and start genuinely believing inthe brotherhood of man. We have to think that frontiers arenot barriers  but signposts leading to a break-up of longstanding prejudices and great divides.In this age when miracles are possible  when man hasconquered space  let us dream of yet other miracles: that the1.1 billion people living in extreme poverty will have theirdaily bread; that the slaughter of the innocents  the tens ofthousands of children dying every day because ofmalnutrition and lack of adequate medicine  will stop; thatthe millions of refugees who wander from camp to camp uprooted from their milieu  will return to their homes; thatthe billions and billions of dollars spent on weapons ofdestruction will be dedicated to hospital research tosafeguard life; and that learning will be extended to all andthat the dignity of work will be denied to none.These dreams of miracles can come true. They are notjust dreams. The political will of the internationalcommunity and the dedication of many people to this causecan turn dreams into reality.This is our agenda for peace. We can turn it into anagenda for peoples."
"112",4711,"MMR",48,1993,"I wish at the outset to extendto you  Sir  my congratulations on your election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. Yourelection reflects the Assembly’s full confidence in you. Mydelegation feels sure that we can count on your wideexperience and personal skills to guide our deliberations toa fruitful conclusion. Allow me also to take this opportunityto express my delegation’s appreciation to your predecessor Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria  for his tireless efforts toensure the success of the forty-seventh session.I am pleased to see among us delegations from the sixnew Member States which joined the Organization this year.Their presence in this Hall reflects the momentous changestaking place in the world today and the growing confidencein the United Nations itself. My delegation feels that thesenew Members  each with its own distinctive historical cultural and political backgrounds  will have importantcontributions to make to the Organization. My delegationwelcomes them all and looks forward to working with them.It is an outstanding feature of our times that thenumber of sovereign States has increased and that the roleof the Organization has grown enormously. There is todaya remarkable growth in the demand for the services of theUnited Nations. As noted by the Secretary-General  theOrganization has in the past four years become involved inas many peace-keeping operations as it had in the previousfour decades. The United Nations is increasingly calledupon to pour oil on troubled waters. Its peace-keepingmissions are being carried out across the globe  fromSomalia to Cambodia  and its agencies for development andhumanitarian affairs have fanned out even further afield. Asthe United Nations assumes a more central role in the areaof international security  it is essential that the Organization in pursuit of the purposes stated in Article 1  act and be seento act in accordance with the principles of the Charter.Myanmar would like to believe that in the post-cold-war era States will adhere strictly to the Charter’s principles andmake concerted efforts to establish a workable system ofcollective security. Just as the prohibition of the threat oruse of force against the territorial integrity or politicalindependence of any State is fundamental in inter-Staterelations  the Charter unambiguously prohibits  in thewell-known paragraph 7 of Article 2  any intervention of theUnited Nations itself ""in matters which are essentially withinthe domestic jurisdiction of any State"". This prohibitionapplies equally to States and to other internationalorganizations. In this time of major political and economicchanges in a volatile world  extraordinary care should betaken to uphold such basic principles as respect for theterritorial integrity or political independence of States.Myanmar fully supports the Security Council’srecommendation of 28 May 1993  which states that theCouncil considers that United Nations peace-keepingoperations should be conducted in accordance withoperational principles consistent with the provisions of theCharter of the United Nations. Those operational principlesinclude a clear political goal with a precise mandate subjectto periodic review and to change in its character or durationonly by the Council itself; the consent of the Governmentand  where appropriate the parties concerned  save inexceptional cases; support for a political process or for thepeaceful settlement of the dispute; and impartiality inimplementing Security Council decisions.The experience in Somalia underscores the need toadhere to those principles in all peace-keeping andpeacemaking operations. In particular  it underscores theneed to exercise great prudence in sanctioning the use offorce in such operations and in its application on the ground.It has also shown that peace-keeping operations cannotsucceed without the willing cooperation of all the partiesconcerned.The conscience of the world has been troubled by thehorror of the ongoing conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.While it is true that the United Nations has taken someaction in response to the crisis and that negotiations havebeen initiated in Geneva  much more needs to be done tostop the fighting and find a peaceful solution. The situationis complex but it must be realized that innocent men  womenand children in the besieged towns and villages expect moreof an international Organization whose principal purpose isthe maintenance of international peace and security. Unlessappropriate actions are taken  the United Nations runs therisk of being seen as protecting only certain countries orinterests.My delegation is pleased to note that in Cambodia  theUnited Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia hassuccessfully discharged its main responsibility ofsupervising  monitoring and verifying the cease-fire and oforganizing and conducting free and fair elections asscheduled  despite the decision of one of the Cambodianparties to stay away from the elections. The United Nationsefforts to foster a democratic process and to bring backpeace and stability to a country ravaged by two decades ofcivil strife and war is an outstanding achievement. Weshould like to take this opportunity to pay a warm andspecial tribute to Mr. Yasushi Akashi  the Special6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionRepresentative of the Secretary-General  who handled a verydelicate situation with great prudence and tact. Thisachievement has made it possible for the people ofCambodia to promulgate a new Constitution restoring themonarchy and to form a broadly based Government. Theaccession to the throne of Cambodia by His Majesty KingNorodom Sihanouk  a great patriot and statesman  is ahistoric event which augurs well for the rebuilding of apeaceful  unified and democratic Cambodia. As closeneighbours  we look forward to peace and stability inCambodia and to working closely with the Government andthe people of Cambodia.The effort to end apartheid in South Africa  sustainedover decades  has produced positive results. Theannouncement of an election date  27 April 1994  for thefirst general elections in South Africa’s history based onuniversal franchise is a significant achievement. Theelections will provide the black majority the opportunity toshape its own destiny by participating in a process which ithad hitherto been denied. It is our hope that this will ensurethat the objective of the people of South Africa for ademocratic  non-racial and united South Africa will beachieved. Much  however  remains to be done to maintainthe election timetable  and the next six months will becritical in ending apartheid. We note that four pieces oflegislation - the Independent Electoral Commission  theIndependent Media Commission  the IndependentBroadcasting Authority and the Transitional ExecutiveCouncil - have been adopted by both the NegotiatingCouncil and the South African Parliament. We hope thatthese bodies will be established as soon as possible to guidethe country through the constitutional process.I am happy to note that the winds of change blowingacross our world have not left the Middle East untouched.The historic agreement between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization on mutual recognition haseffectively removed a major obstacle to peace in that region.We welcome this positive step and the signing of theDeclaration of Principles  which envisions self-rule byPalestinians in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho. We are alsopleased to note that Israel and Jordan have signed the agreedcommon agenda of the peace negotiations between them.We congratulate all parties concerned for displaying rarecourage and mutual accommodation in reaching the accords.These important steps  we hope  will open the way toreconciliation between neighbours and to the achievement ofa just  lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle Eastbased on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973).The new climate of cooperation between the UnitedStates of America and the Russian Federation opens up atleast the prospect of real progress in disarmament. This isamply demonstrated by the signing of the chemical weaponsConvention in Paris earlier this year by an unprecedentednumber of countries. Myanmar was part of the GenevaConference process leading to that comprehensiveinstrument  and continues to take an active part in thePreparatory Commission for the Organization for theProhibition of Chemical Weapons.The increased attention we have been devoting tochemical weapons should not distract us from nucleardisarmament issues  notably from the need to strengthen theinternational non-proliferation regime and to ban all nucleartesting. The enormous quantities of nuclear material thatexist in the world today and the increasing difficulty ofdetecting the clandestine development of nuclear weaponsunderscore the need to redouble efforts to strengthensafeguards against proliferation. Myanmar will work withother delegations for the success of the 1995 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) review and extension Conference.With the end of the Cold War  the case for reducing thenumber of large strategic nuclear weapons is strong. TheUnited States and Russia should reduce their forces moredrastically than they agreed to in START II and refrain fromimproving their nuclear arsenals both qualitatively andquantitatively. Meanwhile every effort must be made tofulfill the commitment undertaken in the 1963 TreatyBanning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in OuterSpace and Under Water. A comprehensive ban on nucleartesting has been a long-standing objective of the internationalcommunity  including Myanmar. We hope that thisobjective will be achieved at the earliest possible date preferably before the NPT review and extension Conferenceconvenes.The global economic recovery remains high on theinternational agenda. In a highly interdependent globaleconomy  the prosperity and growth of the developed andthe developing countries are intertwined. We thereforewelcome the statement of the Group of Seven at the TokyoSummit which recognizes that sustainable development andintegration of the developing countries into the worldeconomy is essential for global peace and prosperity. Welook forward to the concretization of the commitment by theGroup of Seven to pursue a comprehensive approachcovering aid  trade  investment and debt strategy.Debt strategy  in our view  should not be carried out ona case-by-case basis. It should be comprehensive for alldebtor countries. We are encouraged by the statement thatForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 7the major industrialized countries are determined to curbprotectionism and that no recourse will be made to initiativesand arrangements that threaten to undermine the openmultilateral system. High priority must be given to thesuccessful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. The Punta delEste Declaration is still valid  as are the provisions thereinon special and differential treatment for the developingcountries.We have always subscribed to the view that the UnitedNations occupies a unique position as a major forum for thepromotion of international cooperation for development. Ithas now been universally recognized that world peace andsecurity  to be enduring must be underpinned by economicand social development worldwide. In this regard we shareyour view  Mr. President  that ""An Agenda for Peace"" mustnow be complemented by ""An Agenda for Development"".We ardently hope that deliberations on this topic at thecurrent session of the General Assembly will lead toenhanced international cooperation for development  therebycontributing to global economic recovery and internationalpeace.In Myanmar we believe that political progress andeconomic development are interdependent and that both arevital to the well-being of the country. For this reason wehave been endeavouring to ensure political stability whilepromoting economic reforms. Last year I stated here thatsteps were being taken to convene a National Convention inorder to formulate guidelines for a firm and enduringconstitution.I am now happy to report that the NationalConvention commenced work on 9 January of this year.The Convention is an essential prerequisite for the buildingof a democratic society in Myanmar  and its significance canhardly be overemphasized. It has the participation of nearly700 delegates comprising elected representatives representatives of the national races  political parties peasants  workers  intelligentsia and technocrats  Stateservice personnel  and specially invited persons. There isuniversal agreement that the objectives of the Conventionshould be to uphold the principles of non-disintegration ofthe Union  non-disintegration of national solidarity andperpetuation of national sovereignty; to nurture the universalvalues of justice  liberty and equality; and to enable theTatmadaw  the Myanmar Defence Services  to participate ina leading role in national politics.Following intensive deliberations  agreement has beenreached on the chapter on the fundamental principles of theState  which is of paramount importance as it embodies theessence of the new constitution. Following extensivediscussions  consensus has also been reached on theseFundamental Principles. In a period of nine months muchhas been accomplished. Much of course remains to be done.The Convention is presently in recess in order to providetime for the delegates to make necessary preparations for thenext phase  which will commence on 18 January 1994.The delegates to the Convention have had theopportunity to study the Constitutions of various countries sothat they may cull the best from around the world.However  there can be no single model that can be copiedand superimposed on Myanmar. The constitution to bedrafted must be in harmony with our own conditions andreflect the wishes and aspirations of the entire nation. Thehistory of the modern nation of Myanmar is synonymouswith the history of the Tatmadaw. Since the time of ourstruggle for national independence it has been in theforefront of national politics. On four occasions sinceindependence when the country’s national sovereignty andindependence were threatened  the Tatmadaw was calledupon to shoulder national responsibilities to protect andsafeguard the nation. The Tatmadaw does not covet power.Nor does it have any desire to hold on to the reins of power.It is above party politics. However  as it represents thesingle disciplined organization in the nation it is incumbentupon it to play a leading role in national politics safeguarding the nation  national unity and nationalsovereignty.On the economic front  efforts are being made to ensurea smooth transition from a centrally planned economy to amarket economy. Now that teething pains have beenovercome the economy is on the mend. It is significant thatthe gross domestic product grew by 10.9 per cent in1992-1993. The private sector  which only a few years agowas almost non-existent  is expanding. Today there are agrowing number of investors  both local and foreign  infisheries  mining  oil exploration  manufacturing and variousother sectors. Major offshore oil and gas finds in our watershave also heightened interest among friends and neighboursin establishing mutually beneficial economic cooperation.The political and economic changes are evidenced bythe vast transformations taking place in much of the country.In both urban and rural areas  as well as in the borderregions  there is unprecedented infrastructure building:schools  hospitals and dispensaries  as well as railways roads  bridges and multi-purpose dams  are going upeverywhere. That the people’s living standards are rising isplain for all disinterested observers to see.In spite of the positive political and economic changestaking place in Myanmar  some continue to point anaccusing finger at us in regard to human rights. It bearsrepeating that when we speak of human rights  the diversity8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionof our people’s historical  cultural and religious backgroundsmust neither be minimized nor forgotten. There is no uniquemodel of implementation of human rights that can besuperimposed on a given country. Any attempt to do sowould only spell chaos. If parts of the internationalcommunity are now beginning to contemplate the use of theissue of human rights as a pretext for intervening indomestic affairs of States  they will only undermine the veryrights they wish to protect and promote.Poverty is one of the most pressing human rights issuesin our world today  and that is what we should seek toovercome. In Myanmar we are giving priority to theelimination of poverty and the narrowing of the gap betweenthe rich and the poor  the city dwellers and the rural folk.We are redoubling our efforts to ensure that all citizens haveequal opportunity in their access to food  housing transportation  employment  education and health services.On our western borders  over 40 000 returnees fromBangladesh have been systematically received and returnedto their hearth and home. This is the result of the good-neighbourly relations that exist between Myanmar andBangladesh. In accordance with the agreement reachedbetween the two countries in April 1992  we will continueto receive those who are eligible to come as soon as theircases can be processed by the authorities concerned in thecamps. The United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees  Mrs. Sadako Ogata  who visited Myanmarrecently  has been fully briefed on the important measureswe have taken. A memorandum of understanding betweenMyanmar and the Office of the High Commissioner forRefugees (UNHCR) will be signed shortly; it will providefor the latter’s presence on the Myanmar side of the border.We understand the need to find a lasting solution to thecomplex problem of transborder migration for economic orenvironmental reasons  and to that end we intend to holdconsultations with our Bangladeshi friends.It has been our consistent policy to cooperate fully withthe United Nations in every field  including human rights.Not only have we furnished information sought by variousUnited Nations bodies dealing with human rights; we alsoreceived in 1992 the Special Rapporteur appointed by theCommission on Human Rights  Mr. Yozo Yokota. We willreceive him yet again this year to demonstrate our good will.It is our hope that Myanmar’s traditional respect for humanrights as well as the remarkable changes taking placethroughout the length and breadth of the country - from thecities and towns to the border areas - will be seen andappreciated.Through the constructive measures taken in the pastfive years  10 terrorist groups have now returned to the legalfold. Just last week  as the result of negotiations heldbetween the Government and Kachin national leaders in aspirit of mutual accommodation and understanding as befitsblood brothers  the Kachin terrorist group returned to thelegal fold and has already joined hands with the Governmentin promoting peace and prosperity in the Kachin state. Justas the representatives of the nine preceding groups areactively participating in the National Convention  therepresentatives of this group  too  will enjoy the same rights.It augurs well for the peace and unity of our country thatthese 10 terrorist groups which have renounced the use offorce have been reintegrated into the national mainstream.The return of our prodigal sons from 10 differentnational races gives the lie to allegations that minoritygroups in Myanmar are being oppressed  that their humanrights are being grossly violated and that democracy is non-existent in the country. Never before in the history ofindependent Myanmar have so many terrorist groupsreturned to the legal fold in such numbers. That they havedone so is unmistakable testimony to the complete trust andconfidence which the national races have in the policy ofnational reconciliation espoused by the State Law and OrderRestoration Council and in its good will and sincerity. FewGovernments can claim such positive achievements.The problem of illicit drugs is like a cancer that posesa great threat to the stability and well-being not only of ourcountry but also of the international community. Myanmarremains steadfast in its resolve to overcome this scourge.We realize that the problem of illicit drugs and traffickingtranscends borders and is too complex to be tackled by anycountry acting alone. We have accordingly been workingtogether with the United Nations International Drug ControlProgramme (UNDCP) and neighbouring countries to expandactivities aimed at reducing the supply of illicit drugs andeventually eliminating opium cultivation altogether. In June1992 Myanmar took the initiative by signing agreementswith the People’s Republic of China and the UNDCP andalso with Thailand and the UNDCP regarding cropsubstitution  demand reduction and law enforcement.UNDCP experts are already in the country working toachieve these goals. Myanmar and Laos have also agreed tocooperate in this regard. The Governments of Myanmar Laos  Thailand and China  aware that the problems of illicitdrug production  trafficking and abuse can be addressed onlythrough concerted international efforts  will sign amemorandum of understanding with the UNDCP during thecourse of the high-level plenary meetings of the GeneralAssembly on drug control to be held in New York from 26to 27 October.Forty-eighth session - 12 October l993 9Last April  Myanmar signed a drug agreement withIndia  and a similar agreement will be worked out with ourremaining neighbour  Bangladesh. We are confident thatthis comprehensive and coordinated effort at the subregionallevel will produce the desired results. In the past year thestrategy of combining prevention  education  treatment andrehabilitation of addicts  law enforcement and border areadevelopment has borne fruit. Significant amounts of illicitdrugs and drug paraphernalia have been seized anddestroyed. United Nations personnel and other visitors havebeen given the opportunity to visit the regions where opiumis grown.In August  United States Congressman Charles B.Rangel  Chairman of the House Narcotics Abuse and ControlCommittee  and Congressman Bill Richardson visited easternShan State to acquire first-hand knowledge of the illicit drugproblem. During the visit they witnessed the destruction oflarge amounts of opium  heroin  opium oil  liquid opium andother drugs seized by the Myanmar authorities. Myanmarwill continue to give top priority to overcoming the threatposed by illicit drugs  and it is our hope that more and morecountries will join hands with us in this noble endeavour.Myanmar today is on the threshold of a new era. Thepolitical  economic  social and administrative reformscurrently being implemented herald a united  stable  peacefuland prosperous country. The new society will guarantee theunity of the national races and ensure the perpetuation of ournational independence and sovereignty. It will be inharmony with its environment  its historical experiences  andthe political  economic and social conditions of the nation.It will reflect the diverse culture and traditions of thenational races in the union.The new Myanmar nation that is envisaged by theNational Convention will be a genuine multi-partydemocratic state. It will be a nation based on the universalvalues of justice  liberty and equality. There will be socialjustice  economic justice and political justice. There will bea complete separation of powers of state  and the judiciarywill enjoy total independence. Freedom of thought  freedomof expression  freedom of belief  freedom of worship freedom to seek a livelihood and freedom of organizationwill be guaranteed. There will also be equality of status equality of opportunity and equality before the law.These conditions will not materialize of their ownaccord. The right atmosphere must be created. To this end my Government is doing its utmost to vindicate the trustplaced in it by the people. As the democratic societyenvisaged is for the people of Myanmar  it must reflect theobjective conditions of the country and be established in themanner and at the pace best suited to it.Allow me to conclude by saying that the Tatmadawhave never failed the people in their hour of need and willnot do so at this historic moment when a new nation isbeing created."
"113",4768,"MNG",48,1993,"At the outset permit me to offer to you  Sir  my delegation’s sincerecongratulations on your unanimous election to the presidencyof the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Yourprofessional experience as your country’s PermanentRepresentative to the United Nations will undoubtedly be anasset in our important deliberations.We pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev for his dedicated service. We applaud the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his bold and tireless effortsto strengthen the world Organization. We warmly welcomethe new Members and wish them well.A retrospective look at developments since the end ofthe cold war reveals the complexity of advancing towards anew fabric of international relations. On the one hand  thespirit of cooperation and interaction is becoming prevalent.The new democracies are making headway in the face of theformidable difficulties of transition. Recent events in Russiaare ample evidence of this. We are confident that thedemocratic forces  led by President Yeltsin  will overcomethe present ordeal and succeed in their endeavours. Thesignificance for the region and the entire world of thesuccess of Russia’s reforms can hardly be overemphasized.Furthermore  solutions are being found even to the mostprotracted regional conflicts. The recent historic act ofmutual recognition between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and the interim peaceagreement are a case in point. We hope that this will leadto a just and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeliconflict.An important breakthrough towards democracy and amultiracial society in South Africa has been made. Peaceand the national reconciliation that had eluded Cambodia forso long has been restored to this land of ancient civilization.Landmark agreements on the prohibition of chemicalweapons and on the reduction of nuclear armaments havebeen concluded.In the meantime  it is clear that old  deep-seatedproblems still await solutions and new ones  once held incheck by the circumstances of the time  are emerging.Indeed  no tangible progress has been registered inaddressing the issues of poverty  external debt  drugs organized crime  the widening gap between the affluent andthe poor  and environmental crises. Though the cold war isover  the ""hot wars"" have multiplied. Suffice it to mentionthe continuing tragedies of Bosnia and Herzegovina Somalia  Nagorny-Karabakh and Abkhazia.It is widely recognized today that the concept ofdevelopment has acquired a multidimensional characterencompassing not only economic growth  but also political social and environmental aspects. Moreover  greateremphasis is being placed on the human dimension ofdevelopment  as in the final analysis the well-being ofpeople stands as a true measurement of development. Webelieve that the United Nations is the only  and irreplaceable mechanism to translate this concept into reality.In this respect  the United Nations-sponsored worldconferences on population and on women and the WorldSummit for Social Development are called upon to open upbetter prospects to that end. No lasting solution to today’svarious problems can be sought unless the developmentalchallenges are adequately addressed. The concept ofdevelopment and its practical aspects will certainly beenriched by the Secretary-General’s interim report on anagenda for development and its upcoming discussion duringthis session.Now is the time resolutely to address the long-standingagenda relating to economic disparities between the Northand the South  including eradication of poverty  debt relief elimination of trade protectionism and an early andsuccessful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. In this regard Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 11Mongolia welcomes the meeting of the Chairman of theNon-Aligned Movement and the Group of Seven last July inTokyo  which represents a first step towards re-launching theNorth-South dialogue. My delegation believes it importantthat following serious consideration by the Assembly  at thissession  of the Non-Aligned Movement initiative on thereactivation of the North-South dialogue to strengtheninternational cooperation for development a positive decisionbe taken in this regard.It is of signal importance that we maintain themomentum gained at the Rio Conference on Environmentand Development through effective follow-up  at both theinternational and the national level. We commend thedynamic role of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment as a central political forum for the monitoringand review of the implementation of Agenda 21. Mongoliarecently ratified the Convention on Climate Change and theConvention on Biodiversity; our national plan of action toimplement Agenda 21 is being formulated.As a country where desertification is a major challenge Mongolia deems it necessary that a convention on thatsubject be concluded by 1995.Mongolia believes that the observance of human rightsin accordance with universally accepted norms is essential inpromoting equitable cooperation among States. Respect forhuman rights and fundamental freedoms can in no way bereconciled with biased criteria which divide countries intobig and small  developed and underdeveloped  majority andminority groups  or along ethnic  racial and religious lines.Furthermore  Mongolia proceeds from the premise thathuman rights and fundamental freedoms  as universal values do not recognize borders.It is of the utmost importance that the ViennaConference on Human Rights  held last June  was able toreach an agreement on the indivisibility of economic  social cultural  political and civil rights  and on the need to respectand implement them on an equal footing.It is gratifying to note that with the demise of the coldwar  propaganda on disarmament issues has faded away anda businesslike atmosphere of cooperation has taken shape.Earlier this year the Treaty on substantive reductions ofstrategic offensive armaments was concluded between theRussian Federation and the United States. Also  acommendable initiative with respect to a moratorium onnuclear testing took shape. The Geneva Conference onDisarmament has decided to commence negotiations on acomprehensive test-ban treaty.As a country uniquely positioned between the twonuclear-weapon Powers  Mongolia attaches exceptionalimportance to this issue. That is precisely why my countrylast year declared its territory a nuclear-weapon-free zone.In this context Mongolia welcomes the idea of turningCentral Asia into such a zone.The issue of the timely and full implementation ofagreements on the reduction of nuclear weapons and thecomplete prohibition and elimination of nuclear weaponsshould not escape the priority attention of the worldcommunity. The cessation of nuclear-weapon tests and thestrict observance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) is acquiring special importance.We support the indefinite extension of the NPT at the reviewConference in 1995. It is of great importance that theparties to the Treaty  especially the nuclear-weapon States honour their commitments and refrain from any action thatmight undermine it.Mongolia is entering its fourth year of democraticreforms. We  like many others in our position  are facingformidable challenges. As an underdeveloped  land-lockedcountry inadequately integrated into the world transportationnetwork  with a high vulnerability to natural calamities Mongolia is experiencing added difficulties in its transition.In addition to the political and economic reforms thereis the onerous task of dealing with spiritual renewal. Duringthe years of the socialist experiment  we Mongols wereforced to abandon our centuries-old traditions and culturalheritage. Suffice it to say that virtually all the houses ofworship - sanctuaries of spiritual life - over 700 in all  weredestroyed  and the traditional script of the Mongols  animportant cultural heritage of mankind  was buried inoblivion. The task is now to rectify this wrong. This is anation-wide task requiring enormous efforts and resources;we cannot leave it to take care of itself.For all the problems  Mongolia’s democratic reformsare steadily gaining ground. The new democratic system ofgovernance proclaimed in the 1992 democratic Constitutionis being consolidated. The first-ever direct presidentialelections  held last June  culminated in the choice of aPresident put forward by the new political parties. The legalfoundation of the ongoing reforms is being strengthened. Ithas come to embrace all the key aspects of societal life.The present Government has set itself the task ofchecking the economic decline within a two-year period.And the target seems to be within the realm of the possible.We associate these gains primarily with the understanding12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionand support of the international community. In recent yearsa donor community in support of Mongolia has emerged. Adonor meeting sponsored recently by the World Bank heldits third round in Tokyo  in which 23 countries and 6international organizations took part. Grants and soft loansby donor Governments significantly help in alleviating thepresent difficulties  and lay a new basis for futuredevelopment. In addition  we are keenly interested inattracting private-sector investment in Mongolia. This wouldnot only contribute to economic recovery but would alsohelp make future cooperation with our partners mutuallyadvantageous. The revised Foreign Investment Law createsfavourable conditions for such investment opportunities.Furthermore  we consider that active involvement inregional economic cooperation is an essential factor infulfilling the tasks of transition. With this in mind  we areinterested  for instance  in becoming a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC). We hopethat the States members of that organization will find itpossible to understand and support our position.The United Nations has emerged as an important focalpoint of international efforts and has assumed greatlyincreased responsibilities in the areas of peacemaking peace-keeping and peace-building. The detailed report of theSecretary-General on the work of the Organization is a lucidillustration of that point.Mongolia fully supports the efforts designed to reformthe United Nations  especially to restructure and revitalizethe activities of the General Assembly and to ensure that thecomposition of the Security Council reflects the changingrealities of the day and the dramatically increasedmembership of the world Organization.Today  the United Nations is wrestling with manyproblems and trying hard to ensure that it is able to meet themany challenges of a rapidly changing world. It goeswithout saying that the success of this undertaking willdepend on painstaking efforts and  above all  on the politicalwill and greater realism of Member States."
"114",4810,"MOZ",48,1993,"It is with satisfaction that mydelegation and I would like to congratulate His ExcellencyAmbassador Samuel Insanally  on his election as Presidentof the forty-eighth session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly. I wish him success in discharging his duties.My delegation is available and ready to cooperate with himin the task of ensuring a successful conclusion to thissession’s deliberations.To His Excellency Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria we extendour congratulations on the wonderful work he did asPresident of the forty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly.I should like to take this opportunity to address myspecial appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General of our Organization  for hisunflinching dedication in the search for solutions to themany problems that affect humankind. I wish to reiterateour gratitude and appreciation for his personal commitmentand dedication to the cause of peace and stability in mycountry.To the new Member States which have just joined thisgreat United Nations family we express our congratulationsand our readiness to work with them to fulfil the objectivesenshrined in the Charter of the Organization.When I last addressed the Assembly  in 1990  I had theopportunity to say that my Government had begun directnegotiations with RENAMO with a view to putting an endto the long war of destruction and destabilization.For my Government the dialogue had as it mainobjective - besides ending the war - to restore peace normalize life and promote understanding among all citizensof Mozambique. These conditions are essential if theprocess of national reconstruction is to gain root and prosper.It is worth indicating here that  for reasons alien to theGovernment  the dialogue with RENAMO was complex andtoo long. We wish to express our appreciation and thanksto the international community for its unwavering support which helped us to conclude the negotiations successfullyand sign the General Peace Agreement in Rome on 4October 1992.For Mozambique the signing of the General PeaceAgreement represents an important step in the life of itspeople. With it  hopes for the Mozambicans to rebuild theircountry in a peaceful and harmonious environment wererenewed. The fact that almost one year has elapsed withoutany major breach of the cease-fire is reason for joy.We are witnessing the revival of economic and socialactivity in the country. The refugees have begun to return.Displaced people are resettling in their areas of origin or inother areas of their choice. The reconstruction of roads bridges  schools and health centres is under way in spite ofthe shortage of financial and material resources with whichthe country is confronted.The flow of people and goods is increasing as the roadsare reopening to traffic. We are witnessing a normalmovement of people all over the country  except inRENAMO-occupied areas. There is a growing interest onthe part of foreigners in seeking investment opportunities inMozambique.6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe challenges ahead of us are enormous. The war ofdestabilization that ravaged the country for more than 16years has caused economic and social damage amounting toabout $20 billion. As a direct consequence of this war  6million people were displaced or became refugees inneighbouring countries; more than 500 000 children becameorphans and an equal number were traumatized. In additionto this  3000 primary schools and about 1000 health centreswere destroyed in rural areas. Together with this  powerlines  sugar plants  tea factories - among others - bridges andmines were destroyed.Many agricultural and industrial activities of primaryimportance were paralysed  thus reducing considerably ourcapacity to export. Unemployment was aggravated. Theseare the problems we are endeavouring to solve as weproceed with the implementation of the General PeaceAgreement. The demobilization of forces and theireconomic and social reintegration require a tremendouseffort on our part. As can be seen  these challenges cannotbe met successfully without the support of the Assembly.The Government of Mozambique has approved anational reconstruction plan the main objective of which isto reactivate the economic and social life of the populationso that people may go from a situation in which they surviveon emergency aid to one of rehabilitation and sustaineddevelopment. Thus  the aim of the plan is to put an end tothe structural poverty of the population by giving it themeans it needs to relaunch productive activity and to becomeself-sufficient. We believe that in the medium term this planwill contribute to a rapid expansion of essential services inrural areas as well as to that of overall economic and socialactivity in the country in general.On humanitarian assistance  it is worth noting that withthe support of the United Nations we drew up a consolidatedprogramme for action in the repatriation process demobilization of military units  supply of emergency aid re-establishment of essential services  and institutionalcapacity-building in the country. Humanitarian assistancewill be required for some years to come until the wholeprocess of resettlement of the population is completed.In spite of these challenges the Government hasproceeded with the implementation of the economic recoveryprogramme  with the assistance of the World Bank  theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)  the European EconomicCommunity (EEC) and other partners. After a decline in thegross domestic product last year we expect a slight growthof about 4 per cent this year thanks to peace and the goodclimatic conditions we are enjoying in the country.We are convinced that the success of present effortsand of the large national reconstruction plan will  to a greatextent  depend on the creative spirit  determination and hardwork of all Mozambicans. On the other hand  the successof this same project will also depend on the generoussupport of the international community.We appeal to our partners to provide timely assistance inasmuch as the delays we are observing in deliveringassistance already committed have  in many cases  beenpartly responsible for the weak performance of the economy particularly in the industrial sector.We would like to take this opportunity to recognize andexpress our thanks to the United Nations  and to all thosecountries that have contributed funds  resources andpersonnel to the United Nations Operation in Mozambique(UNOMOZ). We equally thank them and the many non-governmental organizations that have been operating in thecountry for their assistance in successfully meeting thesechallenges.We have spoken about encouraging developments inMozambique. However  we regret to say that the other faceof the situation in the country is a source of serious concern.After the international community succeeded in catchingup with the initial delay in setting up the UNOMOZoperation  RENAMO found new pretexts to further protractand delay the implementation of the Peace Agreement. Inits dilatory manoeuvres RENAMO is moving fromprecondition to precondition  though many of thepreconditions have nothing to do with the General PeaceAgreement or are a blatant breach of it.From the very inception  RENAMO delayed sendingpersonnel to fill its positions in the commissions for theimplementation of the General Peace Agreement. Atpresent  RENAMO is stating reservations concerningSecurity Council resolution 863 (1993) on Mozambique  towhich my Government fully subscribes. As members know that resolution calls  among other things  for urgentimplementation  without further preconditions  of the processof assembly and demobilization of forces and of beginningthe training of the new army.On the consultations for the adoption of the draftelectoral law  RENAMO is raising difficulties that canhardly be understood  particularly with respect to thecomposition of the National Electoral Commission. Theorganization and holding of multiparty elections is aGovernment responsibility. The Government cannot excuseForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 7itself from that responsibility at a moment when theMozambicans and the international community as a wholeare anxiously waiting to see the free and fair multipartyelections that are to be held not later than October 1994.We cannot postpone the elections indefinitely. RENAMOmust be made to understand this. The Government willcontinue to engage in consultations  and will spare no effortto make sure that the elections are held at the proper time.The overview we have just presented compels us tomake some observations on the situation in Angola andSouth Africa  given the affinities of the regional situation asa whole. We are deeply concerned over the resumption ofhostilities in Angola because they not only represent aserious threat to peace and to the future of the country butalso threaten to perpetuate tension and instability in thewhole region of southern Africa.We continue to believe that compliance with theBicesse Accords  respect for the election results and theunconditional implementation of the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions constitute a valid platform in the effortstowards a lasting peace in Angola. We are hopeful thatdialogue will prevail in the search for the best solutions tothe conflict in Angola.Within that context  my Government fully subscribes toSecurity Council resolution 864 (1993). Strict observance ofthe spirit and letter of that resolution by UNITA is afundamental condition for an end to the protracted anddevastating war which is responsible for the great sufferingof the Angolan people today. We also believe thatcompliance with that resolution will certainly lead tohumanitarian assistance being channelled to the people ingreatest need. I would like to take this opportunity toreaffirm my Government’s readiness to cooperate with theUnited Nations in the implementation of that resolution.We have followed with great interest the talks withinthe framework of the Multiparty Negotiating Forum in SouthAfrica. We would like to commend the decision taken bythat organ  specifically regarding the creation of theTransitional Executive Council soon to be established as adecisive step in preparing for the first multiracial electionsin the country’s history.The end of the apartheid system and the formation ofa democratically elected Government will greatly contributeto peace and stability in the region  thus enhancing theprospects for even more prosperous economic cooperationwithin the context of the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC). The peoples of southern Africa havehigh hopes for that organization of regional economicintegration as a special forum for harmonizing theireconomic and social development programmes. The regionpossesses enormous economic potential yet to be explored and continues to call for investment in order to become aviable  more competitive economic partner in theinternational arena.On the Middle East  we welcome the signing of theagreement between the Israeli Government and the PalestineLiberation Organization in Washington on 13 September1993. This agreement constitutes a historic and importantlandmark on the road to the solution of the issues in theMiddle East conflict.The question of East Timor  whose people shared withMozambique a common colonial history  remainsunresolved. We encourage the ongoing dialogue betweenPortugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the Secretary-General  aimed at finding a solution that will safeguard theright of the Maubère people to self-determination.We are also convinced that  through dialogue  the otherconflicts still prevailing in Africa and other continents willcome to satisfactory solutions.The world economy continues to be characterized bystagnant growth with an increasing disparity in developmentlevels. Various factors on the international scene led to thisstate of affairs. External debt constitutes one of the mainobstacles to the economic growth of developing countries.The external debt burden is aggravated by the deterioratingprices of basic export goods and by weak foreign investmentin productive areas which could have a positive impact onthe balance of payments and on domestic savings. Webelieve  therefore  that the international community shouldpay special attention to the external debt of the developingcountries and take necessary  adequate measures aimed atfinding a definitive solution to this crisis.Moreover  we have noted a decline in financialassistance to the developing countries; such assistance isbeing diverted to other countries  in Europe  at the very timewhen we are experiencing a reduction in the flow of officialdevelopment assistance. This affects the economies of low-income countries.Notwithstanding the enormous efforts undertaken in thestructural-adjustment process during the last decade  theeconomic and social situation in Africa remains very serious.The real economic growth rate in African countries remainsfar behind the population growth rates. Per capita income8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionand other development factors continue to decrease  andremain among the lowest in the world.If the alarming economic situation I have described isnot addressed by the international community  and reversed the peace dividends resulting from the end of the cold warand from the progress of the democratic process world widewill not benefit all the peoples of the world.It is in this context that we support the efforts toproduce a solid consensus on a development agenda to thebenefit during this session of the General Assembly.We also believe that a speedy conclusion of theUruguay Round of negotiations would contribute to asolution of the problems relating to international trade thataffect the world economy.With regard to environment  the Republic ofMozambique has established a National Commission forEnvironment to look after issues in this area. Theimplementation of ""Agenda 21"" in Mozambique has a legalbasis within the Republic’s Constitution  which containsprovisions relating to the management of natural resourcesand environment in general. The National Commission forEnvironment is at present working on harmonizing measuresaimed at integrating environmental aspects into economicand social programmes  and it is also producing a NationalPlan for Environment Management  whose main objective isthe promotion of the country’s sustained development. Inorder to fulfil international obligations in this regard Mozambique is making the necessary preparations to adhereto the main international Conventions and other agreementson environment.A brief appreciation of the international situation showsthat the era of bipolarity has given way to the beginning ofan era characterized by dialogue in international cooperation particularly in joint efforts to face the problems affectingpeace  international security and economic and socialdevelopment.Solving the problems we face today requires thepromotion of cooperative relations  based oninterdependence  complementarity and mutual benefitbetween nations.In various parts of the world significant steps have beentaken bearing testimony to the prevailing political will for and commitment to  political  economic and socialdemocratization. However  these efforts are faced withsocial problems deriving from the institutional and economicfragility of the States involved. It is therefore imperativethat the international community take cognizance of thesedifficulties and adopt measures in support of those efforts.The new challenges we are facing today lead us tobelieve even more in the United Nations as the mostprivileged forum for harmonizing the global interests of allpeoples of the world  with the aim of fostering aninternational environment in conformity with the nobleprinciples and objectives enshrined in its Charter.In conclusion  I should like to highlight the importanceof peace-keeping and humanitarian assistance in the world and especially in my own country. In this regard I appeal toMember States to redirect their efforts and resources in orderto strengthen further the United Nations.To this end  we should like to appeal to all MemberStates to channel material and financial resources to theUnited Nations so that its role as the guardian ofinternational peace and security may continue to bestrengthened."
"115",4855,"MRT",48,1993,"Please allow me first of all to extend toAmbassador Insanally of Guyana on behalf of theMauritanian delegation its most sincere congratulations onhis unanimous election to the presidency of this forty-eighthsession of the General Assembly. I am convinced that hisexperience and his comprehensive knowledge of theworkings of the Organization  together with his personalqualities  will be the best possible guarantee for the successof this session and the completion of its work with theresults we all hope for.It is also a pleasure for me to congratulate hispredecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  Minister of Foreign Affairsof Bulgaria  on the exemplary manner in which he conductedthe work of the preceding session.It is also a pleasure for me to reiterate to my brother Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  our confidence and great respectfor the efforts he has constantly deployed since he assumedthe duties of Secretary-General of the United Nations  toconsolidate the universal reputation of the Organization andto strengthen its credibility and capacity to act.I should also like to take this opportunity to welcomethe States which have recently acceded to the membershipof the Organization and to extend to them thecongratulations of the Mauritanian delegation. We areconvinced that their presence in our midst will consolidatethe Organization’s effectiveness in the interest of all itsmembers.The past year has not witnessed any tangibleimprovement in the international economic situation. Acombination of negative factors such as natural disasters andthe deterioration of commodity prices continues to widen thegap between developing countries and the industrializedcountries  hence the failure of efforts made by the former toemerge from the sphere of underdevelopment and poverty.This situation has continued to deteriorate because of thecrisis provoked by the growing increase of the debt burden which is a threat not only to the economic and socialdevelopment of developing countries but also to their verysurvival. It is now an acknowledged fact that Africa is thecontinent which suffers most from the deterioratinginternational economic situation  in particular because of itstremendous debt burden. How could one really believe thatcountries which have barely enough resources to meet theirown daily needs and the needs of their people might be ableto cope with such obligations? Is it not time for theinternational community  and the industrialized countries inparticular  to give thought to the gravity of such a situationand to consider the possibility of participating more activelyin the quest for realistic and effective solutions to this verycomplex and important problem? In this context  I use theterms ""realistic"" and ""effective"" advisedly  because it is thesetwo attributes which have been lacking in all the attemptsmade in this field to date.As for the economic and development situation ingeneral  for all the conventions  strategies and agreementsaimed at promoting development  that situation has remainedstatic and in many countries it has actually deteriorated.Tangible progress could have been achieved in terms of realdevelopment for these countries in general and for theAfrican countries in particular if the industrialized countrieshad honoured the commitments they made in certaindocuments - commitments such as the allocation of 0.7 percent of their national income to official developmentassistance and if those countries had implemented theprogramme adopted at the Paris 1990 Conference.In this struggle for the development of Africa Mauritania remains convinced that the more the sources ofexternal aid dry up  the greater the need will be for self-reliance and the mobilization by every country of its ownresources. That is the reason why  despite the adverseinternational situation and the unfavourable climaticconditions  we have been able to meet our basiccommitments to our partners in development  whether theybe States or institutions.In 1992  our country achieved a 2.5 per cent rate ofgrowth. It financed from its own resources 20 per cent ofits investment budget  which amounted to 17.5 billionouguiyas. Here I should like to express  in the most solemnpossible way and in the name of the Government and peopleof Mauritania  our thanks and our gratitude to fraternal andfriendly States and organizations for the considerableassistance they gave us.It is clear that there is an organic link betweendevelopment  on the one hand  and democracy and respectfor human rights  on the other. Indeed  what value could beattached to prosperity and economic progress if we do notuphold human rights and safeguard freedoms? Whatobjective for any responsible Government could be more26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionnoble than having its people participate in an effective wayin the management of their own affairs and the mastering oftheir own destiny? In contrast to the situation we have justseen which prevails in the economic sphere  the past yearhas seen a tangible improvement and an increased interest inthe field of upholding and respecting human rights. Thatimprovement and that heightened interest were made evidentin the holding of the World Conference on Human Rights inVienna  at which our country was represented by a largehigh-level delegation headed by our Prime Minister. Thathigh-level representation reflected the great importance ourGovernment attaches to the question of human rights anddemonstrated its unshakable faith in the need to formulate auniversal concept of human rights applicable to all withoutany discrimination. There can be no doubt that theimplementation of the important results of this Conferencewill strengthen the progress of peoples towards prosperityand stability.The importance Mauritania attaches to the events on theinternational scene regarding human rights bespeaks thecommitment of our Government to bring our country out ofthe emergency rule situation that used to prevail inMauritania as well as in many other countries. To that end our Government set for itself  as a priority  the guaranteeingof fundamental civil rights and the effective involvement ofits people in the management of their affairs and in theeconomic and social development policies of the country. Inthat respect  I am proud to be able to declare here that thereis not a single political prisoner in our country.The democratic process started with the organization ofmunicipal elections  which were a sort of school fordemocracy within the context of which citizens exercisedtheir freedom of expression  freedom of speech  the virtue oftolerance and freedom of choice. These stages resulted inthe adoption on 12 July 1991 of a constitution whichguaranteed all fundamental freedoms set forth in theuniversal declarations and conventions on human rights. Theconstitution guarantees a clear separation of the executive legislative and judicial powers. These various institutionswere set up and are currently operating in their respectivespheres of competence within the context of politicalpluralism and the freedom of speech envisaged in theconstitution - for the first time in the history of our country.Seventeen political parties have been set up  and more than100 newspapers and magazines have been authorized to bepublished in complete freedom.Given our awareness of the need to consolidate thisgenuine democracy and to ensure respect for freedoms andrights of all social groups  a law guaranteeing trade unionpluralism that protects  in a clear-cut manner  all the rightsof Mauritanian workers was enacted in order to protect therights of citizens in the face of administrative red tape  andan independent ombudsman  with the rank of Minister hasbeen appointed to investigate complaints relating toadministrative and social problems. To deal withadministrative problems and to complete the election ofinstitutions as set forth in the constitution  the President ofthe Republic issued a decree which brought forward the dateof municipal elections. In the field of social affairs  theGovernment  which has always attached special importanceto literacy and to the promotion of the status of women aswell as to women’s involvement in national developmentpolicies  created a department for each of these sectors.His Excellency the President of the Republic has shownon more than one occasion the interest he attaches to youthand children as an essential asset whose role is absolutelyindispensable for the present and future of our nation.In the health sector  the choice we have opted for namely health for all has been based on three essentialpoints: first  a continuation of the hygienic efforts andpreventive care in their various aspects; secondly development of specialized medical services; and thirdly making available to citizens essential medicines at reasonableprices.The satisfaction we feel at the progress achieved in thefield of consolidating democracy and respect for humanrights in our country and for our people is equalled only byour feeling of concern at the violations to which those samerights are subjected in other countries and against theinterests of the peoples in other regions of the world. Thissituation is a threat to peace and harmony in the entireworld.Does it stand to reason that the lives  property and holyplace of religions of peoples could continue to be trampledand desecrated at the very heart of a continent such asEurope with its age-old traditions of democracy and respectfor human rights? The atrocities of torture  mass murdersand ethnic liquidation are all crimes which the Serbs inparticular have been perpetrating daily in full view of andwith the full knowledge of the entire world  against theMuslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This naked defianceof the entire international community  requires that thecommunity as a whole should assume its full responsibilitiesand act accordingly. In view of this situation  we call onceagain for pressure to be brought to bear by all legal meanson the Serbs and Croats so that they may comply with thewill of the international community.Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 27Mauritania has always set as a priority the question ofPalestine. It reiterates its constant support for the fraternalPalestinian people under the leadership of its sole andlegitimate representative  the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO). It is in that spirit that Mauritaniawelcomed the agreement concluded between the PLO andIsrael  because we believe it is an important step which willlead  we hope  to a comprehensive solution to the MiddleEast problem that would enable the Palestinian people toregain all their legitimate rights  including the right to self-determination  and guarantee the withdrawal of Israel fromall the occupied Arab territories  including the Holy City ofAl Quds. It should also make it possible for all resolutionsadopted by the Security Council relating to this problem tobe implemented  and it should create conditions conduciveto peaceful coexistence between all peoples of the region.My country  which has the honour of presiding over thepresent session of the League of Arab States  would like toreaffirm here that Arabs have never been warmongers. Tothe contrary  they have always been a nation orientedtowards peace  and working for peace. Now today  theArabs  and the Palestinians in particular  have demonstratedthat for peace they are capable of going beyond hatred  thepain  the wounds of the past and the many  many sufferingsto which they were subjected during the Middle Eastconflict. Could they have made such sacrifices for peace ifthat were not the foundation  the very foundation of theircivilization  and one of their primordial values? Could theyhave done so if peace were not a way of life and an end initself in their traditions? Does not ""peace"" in their languagemean life? Those whose salutation means ""peace"" andwhose prayer ends with peace; those who  when they aretransgressed against  react by calling for peace; a peoplebearing such values surely deserves the support of theOrganization in bringing about a just and comprehensivepeace after which they aspire. It is the duty of theinternational community as a whole to respond positively tothis just aspiration for the recovery of legitimate rights.In this part of the world  the Middle East  theconsequences of the Gulf war are still there to see in everycountry of the region. Mauritania  which has alwaysaffirmed and continues to affirm its commitment tointernational legality and which expressed total rejection ofany violation of the independence of the sister country Kuwait and the safety of its citizens  rejects any violation ofthe unity and territorial integrity of Iraq. We appeal to theinternational community to alleviate the suffering of thechildren and women of Iraq.Because of the moderation  the sagacity and theobjectivity which have always characterized the postures ofthe United Arab Emirates  and also because of the legitimateposition of this country with respect to Abu Musa  GreaterTunb and Lesser Tunb Islands which belong to it  Mauritaniasupports the position of the United Arab Emirates. We hopethat Iran  the sister Muslim country and neighbour  willrespond favourably to the legitimate claims of the State ofthe United Arab Emirates.The Middle East is not the only Arab region whichsuffers from tension. In the Arab Maghreb  despitesustained efforts which have been made for almost five yearsnow  aimed at laying the foundations of a promisingregrouping which would promise prosperity for the peoplesof the region  as we have seen in the practical and importantresults reached at the summit of Nouakchott held inNovember 1992  two problems continue to be of concern toour leaders and our people. The first problem is thequestion of Western Sahara. In that respect  the UnitedNations continues to make efforts to smooth out thedifficulties  which have heretofore made it impossible toreach a solution. While expressing our hope that thesedifficulties will soon be ironed out  we will continue ourefforts together with the United Nations and the partiesinvolved to reach a just and lasting solution. That solutionwould  no doubt  be an important stage towards the buildingof an Arab Maghreb  and a factor of stability anddevelopment in the region.The second problem is the blockade imposed on thefraternal people of Libya  which is detrimental to the otherMaghreb peoples as well. In view of the willingnessexpressed by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to cooperate withthe United Nations and the parties concerned  we should liketo express our hope that the resolution on the blockade willsoon be revised  and that this question will be dealt withthrough dialogue and understanding.As for the southern part of the African continent  weshould like to record our satisfaction at the new signs of thedisappearance of the last bastion of racial segregation  andthis is a good occasion to pay tribute to the wisdom andfarsightedness of President Nelson Mandela for the path hehas followed in dealing with this question. We express hereour hope that the measures adopted will be fullyimplemented so that a democratic non-racial regime could beset up so that it may guarantee the rights of all citizens ofthis sister African country.In Somalia  a brother people continues to suffer the illeffects of internal divisions  war and famine. If operation28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session""Restore hope""  begun last December  resulted in a certainamount of progress in humanitarian terms  unfortunately  itspolitical outcome has not been satisfactory to all concerned.We hope that the international community will step up itsefforts to achieve the objective initially defined for thatoperation. We also appeal to our Somali brethren toovercome their factional differences and quarrels so that theSomali nation may survive.Turning to the question of Angola  we hope that ourAngolan people will listen to the voice of reason andcooperate with the United Nations Representative with aview to ending this fratricidal war  which serves the interestsof none of the parties.With regard to Liberia  we note with satisfaction thepeace agreement that was signed on 25 July 1993  under theauspices of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates. We have every hope that the opposing sides willimplement that agreement and put an end to this destructivewar  which has been devastating the country for severalyears.In Rwanda  there are new prospects for peace andstability as a result of the signing  in Arusha  on4 August 1993  of a peace agreement between the parties tothe conflict. We can only applaud this positive step whileexpressing the hope that it will mark the beginning of a newera for the people of Rwanda.It is encouraging that Mozambique has returned to astate of normalcy following the signing  on 4 October 1992 of an agreement that made possible the initiation of UnitedNations operations there. At the political level  PresidentJoaquim Chissano and the leader of RENAMO met on 23August 1993  thus confirming their determination to put anend to the instability that their country has been experiencingfor several decades.In Asia  the Cambodian people has achieved a majorvictory with the holding of the recent elections. AllCambodians  under the leadership of His Majesty KingNorodom Sihanouk  must now consolidate that achievementso that harmony may prevail and national reconstructionbegin. There is no doubt that the United Nations and theinternational community will stand by the Cambodians  asthey have done in the past.The United Nations  which has an indispensable role toperform in the maintenance of international peace andsecurity  deserves our full support and help. TheOrganization’s universal character  which is today givenexpression in the membership of 184 independent States requires  more than ever  a revision of its structures and itsmethods of operation - in particular  through enlargement ofthe Security Council.In that context  we should like to pay tribute to theSecretary-General for his report ""An Agenda for Peace""  thestudy and implementation of certain aspects of which hasalready begun. In this respect  I am very pleased tounderscore the fact that at its last meeting  which was heldin Cairo  the Council of the League of Arab Statesrecommended the strengthening of cooperation andcoordination between the United Nations and the League.In two years’ time the United Nations will celebrate thefiftieth anniversary of its founding. My country has thehonour of being involved in the bureau of the PreparatoryCommittee for that event  which  we feel  will be a real andimportant watershed in the life of the Organization  as wellas an opportunity for its Members to assess the progress thatthe international community has made towards achieving thenoble objectives that were set for the Organization when itwas established in 1945. Let us ensure that that assessmentwill be positive. Let us do so by redoubling our efforts toestablish justice and peace and to promote the cause of man- the means and the end of all social- and economic-development operations. For its part  the Islamic Republicof Mauritania will continue to move forward in thisdirection  in accordance with its unfailing determination toachieve development - development for man and by man."
"116",4901,"MUS",48,1993,"On behalf of theMauritius delegation  it is my pleasure and privilege toextend to Mr. Insanally our heartiest congratulations on hiselection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. We wish to assure him and members of hisBureau of our full cooperation and support in the tasks thatlie ahead of them. The election of a representative ofGuyana to the presidency of this Assembly is gratifying inmore ways than one and underlines the fact that even thesmallest of States belonging to this Organization has a roleto play on the international scene and will not shy awayfrom any responsibility that may be entrusted to it  howeverbig the challenge.We should also like to place on record our appreciationof his predecessor for the commendable manner in which heconducted the deliberations of the forty-seventh session ofthe General Assembly.Mauritius is pleased to welcome into the family of theUnited Nations its new Members: Andorra  the CzechRepublic  Eritrea  Monaco  the Slovak Republic and TheFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We are hopefulthat these new Members will uphold and strengthen theideals enshrined in the Charter of this Organization and welook forward to their active participation in our deliberations.Forty-eighth session - 30 September l993 29It is important  in my delegation’s view  that I addressin the first instance an issue of prime concern to thefunctioning of our Organization. There is at present muchdebate and ambivalence about the future role andorientations of the United Nations. While it is generallyaccepted that the United Nations as a multilateralorganization should adapt to and reflect the profoundchanges that have taken place since its founding considerable doubt exists on what proposals and practicalmeasures should be adopted to make the United Nationssystem more effective and forge it into a relevant instrumentof global governance. Is the United Nations able to respondto the new demands  opportunities and challenges that haveemerged especially since the end of the cold war and stillremain true to its Charter? That the United Nations inrecent years has already been able to play a more centralrole in world affairs and assume greater responsibilities inthe wide range of social and political problems is anindication that it has earned the growing acceptance of theworld community as a legitimate vehicle for addressingsignificant global issues.However  beneath the prestige of regained moral statureand recognition that its ideals and message are still valid isthe reality that the United Nations administrative structuresand institutions are in dire need of reform. The UnitedNations system remains ill-equipped for the scope of itscurrent operations and activities. The evolving nature of theUnited Nations will therefore have a crucial impact on thefuture shape and management of the post-cold-warinternational economic and political environment.The current debate on revitalization and restructuringhinges on whether the United Nations should become morefocused or more encompassing. Despite clearpronouncements for change at the level of the Assembly  theSecurity Council  social and economic organs and peace-keeping operations  it is evident that many Member Statesare neither expecting the process to result in any sweepingstructural reforms nor contemplating a revision of theCharter.Progress will therefore need to come from within  theresult of a balancing act between divergent interests andpolitical considerations. It would be unfortunate  however if such an agreement were merely a reflection of a lowestcommon denominator rather than the product of genuinecooperation.I concede that the reform of such an Organization is noeasy task and requires the assistance of one and all. Lastyear the Mauritius delegation to the General Assemblycommended the Secretary-General’s efforts at reforming ourOrganization. I should like to reiterate our appreciation forwhat has been achieved so far and our support for the workcurrently being undertaken by the Secretary-General torevitalize the United Nations.I remain convinced that the emerging global situationhas brought the objective of restructuring the United Nationssystem within reach. Such reform should  in the end  caterfor the aspirations of the peoples of this world and enablethe Organization to respond favourably to the emerging newexpectations.The General Assembly  we believe  ought to beencouraged  by its increased membership and a general trendtowards democratization  to assume a more preponderantplace in the affairs of the Organization. It should strengthenits policy-making role  especially in the social and economicfields  so as to exercise greater balance with the SecurityCouncil  whose mandate is now expanding beyond thetraditional delineation of threats to peace and security intosuch areas as human-rights violations and humanitarianassistance  through preventive diplomacy and innovativepeace-keeping operations. Thus  while remaining the crucialforum for discussion  the General Assembly would increaseits capacity to respond to major problems and takeinitiatives.On the other hand  greater consensus among itsmembers has enabled the Security Council to assert itsauthority and break new ground in authorizing the use offorce under Chapter VII of the Charter - for example  inSomalia  where domestic jurisdiction would normally apply or Yugoslavia  through preventive action. The Council hasalso had more frequent recourse to sanctions  using them onfive occasions since 1990. The intensification of the UnitedNations presence has undeniably enhanced the reputation ofthe Organization. But it has also raised questions about theCouncil’s composition and apprehension over its decision-making process.The new responsibilities and importance assumed bythe Council would justify  in our view  some form ofenlargement to reflect the new level of membership of theUnited Nations. A more representative Council would earnrecognition and legitimate acceptance and be able to takeaction quickly and effectively with the imprimatur offairness.The Council could  we believe  withstand changes andstill retain its main executive function  while improving at30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionthe same time its coordination with other United Nationsbodies  such as the General Assembly.Peace-keeping has become one of the majorresponsibilities of the Council. The rapid expansion ofpeace-keeping operations and the huge involvement ofUnited Nations personnel in this area have boostedconfidence in the Organization and given it a higherinternational profile. Unfortunately  peace-keeping is alsobecoming a heavy burden in terms of financial and humanresources  which threatens to curtail the Organization’sinvolvement in other priority areas. Peace-keeping shouldnot be confined merely to narrow security objectives excluding broader considerations of non-military threats tosecurity.The Security Council has  in fact  special responsibilityin shaping the future of peace-keeping as an effectivesafeguard in areas of conflict  or potential conflict  involatile domestic or regional situations where major threatsto international peace reside today.However  as the Secretary-General notes in his reporton the implementation of the recommendations of his""Agenda for Peace"" ""Peace-keeping is in a state of rapid evolution as theUnited Nations is asked to undertake increasinglycomplex and dangerous tasks."" (A/47/965  para. 26)As the mandate of peace-keeping operations extends beyondtheir traditional domain into such areas as electoralassistance  humanitarian relief activities  human-rightsmonitoring  assistance for nation-building  border-monitoringand sanctions enforcement  clearer peace-keeping guidelinesand standards  based on properly defined mandates andadequate financial support  become essential. Within theparameters of fundamental principles and their interpretation peace-keeping operations should be designed to work. TheUnited Nations has made good use of the lessons of concreteand painful experience.Mauritius  for its part  would like to suggest that whencarrying out the reform exercise we should not only addressthe issues of financial resources or expansion of themembership of the Security Council  but also look at mattersof concern raised in other forums and their attendantconsequences for this Organization. We should  hence  notfail to give due attention to the principles contained in theDeclaration on International Economic Cooperation  adoptedat the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly especially with respect to the rejuvenation of equitableeconomic growth and development. We must bear clearlyin mind other new and globally agreed programmes  such asthe New Agenda for the Development of Africa  Agenda21  which came out of the Rio Conference  and therecommendations of the second World Conference onHuman Rights.Any changes in the structure of the United Nationsshould be the product of as large a consensus as possible  inorder to preserve the credibility of our Organization  and inthis task we must be guided inexorably by the spirit of theUnited Nations Charter.However  while we uphold this spirit  it is our opinionthat serious consideration should be given to a review of theprovisions of the Charter. A rereading of the Charter wouldenable us to look anew at its contents and allow us topropose amendments in the light of new world realities. Ialso urge that the Assembly insist on greater clarity in itsresolutions. This will certainly facilitate action and preventtime lost discussing varying interpretations of resolutions.No doubt  one of the most striking events since the lastsession of the General Assembly has been the second WorldConference on Human Rights  held in Vienna in June of thisyear. The Conference was an opportunity to review theevolution of the attitudes of the peoples of the world towardsthe upholding of the rights and dignity of man since the firstWorld Conference on Human Rights  which was held inTehran in 1968. The quarter of a century that separates theholding of these two Conferences has witnessed a lot ofchanges  notably the assertion of those States which emergedfrom the demise of colonization.In Vienna  both the old and the new players in theworld’s human rights forums were able to put forward theirconcerns and aspirations. The discussions  though notalways easy  had the advantage of being frank. We inMauritius firmly believe that the end result of theConference will be beneficial to the protection of the rightsof the individual. We must see to it  however  that theprovisions of the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action areimplemented and do not become mere additional documentsin the international archives. In this context  I wish yetagain to make a special appeal to this Assembly for asubstantial increase in the resources of the Centre for HumanRights to enable it to attend to its responsibilities withconsistency and efficiency and thus contribute moreeffectively to the universal upholding of human rights.Mauritius wishes to reiterate  in the most forcefulmanner possible  its support for the recommendation of theForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 31second World Conference on Human Rights that thisAssembly address urgently the need to establish a post ofUnited Nations high commissioner for human rights. It isour sincere hope that a favourable decision will be reachedto reflect the wishes of the peoples of the world. Such anoffice would play the necessary role of coordinating UnitedNations work on human rights and would be the focal pointfor upholding human rights norms.In keeping with its stand on human rights issues Mauritius would also like to state its support for theresponsibilities assigned to the International Tribunal for theprosecution of those responsible for the serious crimescommitted against humanity in the territory of the formerYugoslavia since 1 January 1991. We would like tocongratulate all those eminent persons who have beenelected to sit on this Tribunal and wish them well in theirdifficult task.Indeed  we view with great concern and sadness theatrocities and untold sufferings endured by the peoples of theformer Republic of Yugoslavia  particularly the children.Let the impartial conclusions of the Tribunal serve as alesson to those who believe they can get away with suchdegrading actions  such disrespect for human life. Theseriousness and steadfastness with which the Tribunal carriesout its duty will bear witness to the fact that the worldcommunity does not remain insensitive and will not becomplacent in the face of such despicable and reprehensibleacts wherever and whenever they occur. Yet as this centuryof our so-called civilized world fades away  the history ofBosnia and Herzegovina will be written with the blood ofthousands of innocent men  women and children.Earlier this year the world exulted at the news thatFrance  the United States of America and the RussianFederation had voluntarily extended their moratoriums onnuclear testing. It is heartening to observe that 1993 mayyet be the year when the world will have enjoyed the longestrespite from nuclear testing and its attendant consequences despite the recent disturbing reports pointing to thepossibility of a resumption of nuclear testing by certaincountries. No one doubts the nuclear strength of thecountries which have made the moratorium a policy and itis to their credit that they have so far not been tempted toshow their might by resuming nuclear testing.It is our sincere wish that members of the nuclear clubadhere to their declared moratoriums  for the resumption ofnuclear testing by any of those States would jeopardize the1995 conference for the review and extension of thenon-proliferation Treaty  and would  to our mind  inevitablyundermine the current efforts aimed at global disarmament.It would be unrealistic on our part not to recognize that despite uncertainties and ongoing foyers of tension  theworld political climate has improved considerably. As coldwar rivalry faded  significant bilateral progress was madewith the conclusion of the START Treaties and thesubsequent agreements for reduction in the respectivenuclear arsenals of the erstwhile super-Powers. Thesepositive efforts were reinforced internationally by thedecision of a number of States  including France  China andSouth Africa  to adhere to the non-proliferation Treaty at acrucial phase in its review process.Such encouraging developments bode well for all smallnations like ours whose safety rests upon the foundations ofa reliable collective security system. The recent historicagreement between the PLO and Israel and the imminentconstitution of a democratic non-racial South Africa shouldpave the way for rapid progress towards the denuclearizationof Africa. Likewise  we note with great satisfaction theconsensus emerging in the deliberations of the Ad HocCommittee on the Indian Ocean to adopt new approaches inresponse to the changing international situation and givefresh impetus to the process of strengthening cooperation peace  security and stability in the Indian Ocean region. Theincreased participation in this year’s session suggests that theGeneral Assembly could accordingly consider broadening theCommittee’s mandate.Success at the regional level depends largely on aglobal atmosphere that is conducive to disarmament. Wewish therefore to reiterate  in this perspective  the importanceof the current negotiations for the review of the NPT and theconclusion of a test ban which should provide non-nuclearStates with firm security assurances and address the variousissues of nuclear proliferation. The threat of the spreadingof smaller nuclear weapons is compounded by theavailability of weapons-grade nuclear material producedfrom plutonium and highly enriched uranium and the relativelack of proper commercial safeguards. To these dangersmust be added the potential hazard of nuclear pollution andthe dumping of toxic wastes.Casting a glance at the world in general  we havereason to hope for the advent of peace in the various hithertoviolence-ridden regions of our planet in a not-too-distantfuture. On the African continent  we note a trend towardssolutions to difficult situations. In Mozambique  we salutethe signing of the General Peace Agreement forMozambique between the Government of Mozambique and32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionRENAMO  the Mozambique national resistance movement.We commend the positive contribution of the United Nationsoperations in Mozambique. We urge the leaders concernedto show sufficient flexibility in the current negotiationsaimed at elaborating appropriate electoral laws for thecountry.South Africa is another source of hope. We inMauritius have been following very closely the evolution ofdiscussions in the multiparty negotiating forum and areparticularly appreciative of the resolution adoptedunanimously by the Technical Negotiating Council on16 August 1993  which endorses the return of Walvis Bayand the offshore islands to Namibia. We have had theopportunity to congratulate those responsible for this verypositive step  which we also applaud as a confidence-building measure in that region.We welcome the installation of the TransitionalExecutive Council and wish to pledge our readiness - as acountry which has made  in its own modest way  its share ofcontributions to the democratization process across theworld - to help in the preparations leading to the elections of27 April 1994.The capacity to dismantle apartheid  establish the basisof a new constitution by consensus  and agree on anelection date within a few years is no mean achievement.However  whilst many rapid and positive changes are takingplace  South Africa continues to be plagued by ceaselessviolence. Time and again we have deplored the upsurge ofviolence which has cost the lives of several of Africa’s mostillustrious sons  among them the sorely missed Chris Hani.We therefore welcome wholeheartedly the proposal toestablish a national peace force in South Africa  made up ofrepresentatives of all parties  which would be entrusted withthe task of preventing violence in particularly volatile areas.The creation of this mechanism shows the determination andardent desire of all in South Africa to resolve outstandingissues and to proceed as planned for violence-free electionsin April of next year.In Somalia  we have been distressed by the senselesskilling of members of the United Nations Forces as well asSomali civilians. The skirmishes being witnessed in Somaliahave regrettably shifted world attention away from thestarving millions to manhunts. Women and children dyingdaily for want of food have been relegated insignificantly tothe backstage. Mauritius would like to call on the leaders ofthe various Somali factions to revert to the agreementreached in Addis Ababa and submit themselves to the peace-keeping process within the context of the recently establishedOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for thePrevention  Management and Resolution of Conflicts. Ourfervent appeal to all those bent on perpetuating the bloodbath in Somalia is to heed the concerns of the internationalcommunity and indeed act in the interests of the Somalipeople rather than in their own selfish interests.In our Indian Ocean region  on an issue of directconcern to us  I am happy to say that meaningful dialogueon the Chagos Archipelago is taking place with the UnitedKingdom authorities.While we hail the success of the United Nations inCambodia  we cannot but decry the atrocious situation inAngola  where thousands of lives are done away with daily.The question that must be asked is this: to what end will acountry depleted of its human resources serve those who  intheir desperation to be at the helm of affairs  are ready tosacrifice countless lives and lay waste that very country?We exhort Mr. Savimbi and his UNITA to come to termswith reality and accept the will of the Angolan people asexpressed through the ballot box.Outside the African continent  the Middle East  whichhas witnessed one of the most bitter conflicts of the century heralds a new era. There is cause for satisfaction in theknowledge that the peace process which began at the MadridConference in October 1991 has taken a decisive turn withIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)extending mutual and official recognition to each other. Letus hope that the plan for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza andJericho is but a prelude to Israel’s complete withdrawal fromthe occupied territories  a sine qua non for a just and durablepeace in the Middle East.As I said earlier  we have reason to rejoice at thethought of more peaceful days in various areas of the world.However  this prospect is marred by other concerns. In Fijithe long-awaited review of the Constitution has not yet takenplace  with the unfortunate result that the electoral system isin stagnation. We feel that meaningful changes in theConstitution  as promised by the Fijian authorities  willrestore confidence in the Fijian community and will bringabout smoother relations in the country for the benefit of all.Mauritius  as a multi-cultural  multi-religious andmulti-ethnic society  is willing  in all humility  to share withFijian authorities the benefits of its own experience ofharmonious living and to assist  should it be so wished  inthe review of the Constitution.Forty-eighth session - 30 September l993 33While there are promising developments in the world the global economy continues to evoke distress. The long-awaited economic recovery in developed countries continuesto be inconsistent and uneven; global economic stabilityremains more elusive than ever. Economic growth anddevelopment proper are the only durable  effective andequitable solution to instability and to a host of otherassociated problems facing the world. We believe  therefore that it is the concern of the entire world to ponder seriouslya new form of multilateralism which would ensuresystematic coordination of policies involving all groups ofcountries.We believe that the rapid internationalization of theworld economy points to the urgency to resume North-South dialogue constructively and in a spirit of cooperationand understanding. This dialogue should become aninstrument for the promotion of economic growth indeveloping countries and should address world economicproblems practically  instead of remaining a mere sloganinterspersed now and again by half-measures aimed more atplacating genuine concerns of the South than at evolving aworkable long-term policy to bridge the ever-widening gapbetween the North and the South with immediate medium-term and long-term solutions to the exasperatingproblems that plague most developing countries.The efforts of most developing economies arecompromised by the consequences of unbridledprotectionism  deteriorating commodity prices  acute debtproblems  declining financial flows  poverty andunfavourable terms for the transfer of technology. However in the face of the unfair competition that continues to holdsway on the international trade scene  we should ensure  forexample  that the provisions of the Lomé Convention thatbinds the European Economic Community with the Asian Caribbean and Pacific group of countries are upheld in anymultilateral trade negotiations.We in Mauritius are eager for a balanced outcome ofthe Uruguay Round and have therefore been extremelydisappointed at the scant attention paid to the interests of thedeveloping countries which are vulnerable to shifts in theworld economic order. The ongoing negotiations haveturned out to be primarily a battle of wits and nerves amongthe developed countries. We have studied the latestproposals from Geneva with attention  and our frank reactionis one of consternation and dismay.What is proposed is a cataclysmic operation which callsfor the system to be completely refounded  the structures thatexist to be razed  and the groupings within which weconduct our foreign trade to be dismantled. What issuggested by the major negotiators is a change so convulsivethat only the most resilient economies will emergeunscathed.Mauritius considers this situation to be most unfair unjust and  above all  counter-productive  in the long run.Mauritius  which has an open economy banking on export-led growth  is in favour of free trade and liberalization ofexchanges with due regard for the acquired rights of variousgroups of developing countries. We believe  however  thatsuch change must come about through an orderly evolutionary process that will give ample time foradaptation  rather than through external imposition which haslittle consideration for factors other than economic. Wetherefore appeal to all contracting parties to strive earnestlyfor a conclusion of the Uruguay Round that will take intoaccount the difficulties of the developing countries and theparticular situation of small island States.Both the United Nations Conference on Environmentand Development and the General Assembly have recognizedthe specificities of small island States and the attention thatshould be given to them in view of the special case theyconstitute in the interrelation of environment anddevelopment. These States are characterized by their limitedsize in relation to the length of their coastline  limitednatural resources  relative geographical isolation  extremelyfragile and vulnerable ecosystem and a vast expanse of seasforming part of their territorial limits. For small islandnations the ocean and the coastal environment are hence ofprimary importance and constitute a basic developmentresource.The record of the United Nations in the social andeconomic fields is a mixed one. Its contribution to globalawareness and respect for human rights and democraticvalues is undisputed. The Rio and Vienna Conferences werelandmarks of global cooperation  despite divergentperceptions on the strengthening of relevant institutions andadoption of concrete measures.Such cooperation could in our view be developed bymaintaining a strong role for the Commission on SustainableDevelopment and by choosing a feasible and incrementalapproach to implementing the commitments made byGovernments under Agenda 21. In this regard  we lookforward to the fruitful preparations for the GlobalConference on the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States and its successful outcome in Barbadosnext year  as the first test case in the ongoing Rio process.We also feel that the General Assembly should seriously34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionconsider establishing an intersessional mechanism tocomplete the work of the Preparatory Committee for theConference.We  for our part  are as committed as any of those whohave made the protection of the global environment theirleitmotif. We have ratified the Climate Change Convention the Biodiversity Convention  the Montreal Protocol and theBasel and the Bamako Conventions  among otherinstruments. Our concern is to safeguard the world andensure the well-being of those who live in it.(spoke in French)Let me pursue my thoughts on participation by smallStates in international life by calling attention to the fact thatin a few weeks Mauritius will have the honour to host thefifth Summit of French-speaking Countries and by saying afew words about the two principal themes that will beaddressed by Heads of State or Government of countries thatshare the use of the French language: human rights anddevelopment; and unity in diversity.Those timely questions illustrate our concerns at a timewhen the world is undergoing profound change and whenmost of our countries continue to face challenges ofdevelopment. My country wants to make its owncontribution  however modest  to the thought of the French-speaking world and the rest of the international communityso that mankind may see - based on the example ofMauritius - that peaceful coexistence in a multi-cultural multi-ethnic  multi-linguistic culture is no mere Utopian idea.I wish to thank the Secretary-General  a great friend ofthe French-speaking world  for having agreed  despite hisweighty responsibilities  to honour us with his presence at aSummit that will bring together  at the highest level delegations from 47 countries and from all continents.(spoke in English)As members will appreciate  we small States arenevertheless doing our best to make our share ofcontributions in order to bequeath to future generations anenvironmentally clean world  a world free of want  a worldfree of war  a world where peace and harmony will prevail.Can we expect the same from those with mightier resources?"
"117",4938,"MWI",48,1993,"The Malawi delegation ispleased to join other delegations in congratulating you  Mr.President  on your election to preside over the business ofthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. Guyana isa sister country which is held in high regard and admirationby Malawi. You are an illustrious son of Guyana and arehighly qualified and fully prepared to lead and manage theenormous tasks which must be accomplished at this sessionof the General Assembly. My delegation wishes yourpresidency great success.At its forty-seventh session the General Assemblyconsidered important and  in some cases  intractable issues.This would not have been possible were it not for thepainstaking patience  efficiency and diplomatic skills of itsPresident  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  a distinguished internationaljurist and former Foreign Minister of Bulgaria. The Malawidelegation congratulates him on a job well done.My delegation wishes to express its profound sorrowfor the considerable suffering  loss of life and destruction ofproperty caused by the earthquake which occurred on 29September 1993 in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Theheartfelt and sincere condolences of the Government and thepeople of Malawi unreservedly go to the Government andthe people of India as they struggle to alleviate the painfulafter-effects of this tragedy.We are thankful to God for giving Malawi good rainsin the season just ended. The drought experienced in thelast two seasons was severe and devastating in its effects.All of southern Africa suffered terribly from this scourge.Malawi’s economy was seriously affected by the drought beginning in February 1992. In 1991 economic growth was7.8 per cent in real gross domestic product. It declined inreal terms by 7.9 per cent during 1992  which represented aprecipitous fall in real income for the people. The volumeof maize  our staple food  was only 600 000 tonnes in 1992 down from the 1991 production level of 1.6 million tonnes.In 1993 Malawi had a good harvest of close to 2 milliontonnes of maize. However  complete recovery from thedrought will take some time.My delegation would like to take this opportunity  onbehalf of my Government and the people of Malawi  tothank the United Nations system and  in particular  theDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs  which were the majorcatalysts in the United Nations -southern AfricanDevelopment Community drought relief programme. Wealso thank the bilateral donors and the non-governmentalorganizations which  together  saved the day for Malawi andthe whole southern African region with massive imports offood  medicines and other humanitarian assistance supplies.However  the Malawi economy continues to be confrontedby a major balance-of-payments deficit problem arising fromthe large volume of maize imports during the drought.Malawi has been hosting a large number of refugeesfrom Mozambique  who started entering Malawi in largenumbers in 1986  and by 1992 the refugee population in thecountry had soared to about 1.5 million people. The Officeof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  theWorld Food Programme  non-governmental organizationsand many other interested parties that have throughout beenintimately involved in this humanitarian task will agree that despite the severe adverse impact of hosting such a largenumber of people  Malawi is managing one of the mostsuccessful refugee programmes in the world  thanks to theprevailing peace  which is due to stable political leadership good and reliable security structures and a fairly efficientadministration.Mr. Martini Herrera (Guatemala)  Vice-President took the Chair.The problem of the Mozambican refugees in Malawi which was a consequence of the civil war between theGovernment of Mozambique and RENAMO  will come to anend as all protocols of the Rome General Peace Accord areimplemented in full. Malawi  which was represented at thehistoric signing of the Peace Accord on 4 October 1992 commends President Chissano of the Republic ofMozambique and Mr. Dhlakama  President of RENAMO  forsigning the Peace Accord. We strongly encourage them tocontinue to work closely together and with the UnitedNations to ensure that peace and political stability are firmlyestablished in Mozambique. This is a prerequisite for thereconstruction of that great and beautiful country tocommence and for progress to be realized in all areas ofdevelopment. My delegation is therefore fully supportive ofSecurity Council resolution 863 (1993) and calls on all theparties to implement it speedily.The Government and people of Malawi wish to see theuninterrupted repatriation of their brothers and sisters to theirhomes in Mozambique in safety and security. We thereforecall for the specific prioritization of the de-miningprogramme  the demobilization of the armed forces and their18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionplacement in the designated assembly areas  and thefinalization of discussions on the draft electoral law. Thepeople of Mozambique demand this  and it is also in thevital interests of Malawi  which has suffered tremendouslyfrom the adverse impact of the 16-year civil war inMozambique.My delegation wishes to stress that the cost of hostingover 1 million refugees not only is very high but  forMalawi  has reached a crisis point. This cost is paid in thedisplacement of Malawians from agricultural land; inover-grazing  deforestation and environmental degradation;in tremendous pressures and strain on the Governmentadministrative infrastructure  budgetary and human resources;and  not least  in the strain on the socio-economicinfrastructure such as schools  hospitals  roads  bridges andwater supplies. My delegation is taking this opportunity toappeal to the donor community for assistance in all theseareas  which are crucial for the country’s sustainabledevelopment.The General Peace Accord in Mozambique is close tothe heart of Malawi. I therefore wish to reiterate thatMalawi will continue to collaborate with Mozambiqueclosely - at the bilateral level  between the Governments ofthe two sister countries; through the Tripartite Commission whose members are Malawi  the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) andMozambique; and through the Malawi-Mozambique SecurityCommission - until the peace process has been consolidated.Peace and the return of normal life in Mozambique willguarantee Malawi the use of its traditional  and shortest routes to the sea via the ports of Nacala and Beira. Thereopening and full use of these ports will representconsiderable savings through highly reduced transport costsand in limited foreign exchange resources.My country undertook the most historic event sinceindependence by holding  on 14 June 1993  the nationalreferendum which was initiated by our President  HisExcellency Ngwazi Kamuzu Banda in order to give thepeople of Malawi the opportunity to choose between aone-party and multi-party system of government. Mydelegation is pleased to report to this Assembly that by allaccounts  including those of the United Nations  it was apeaceful  free and fair exercise. Sixty-three per cent of thepopulation voted for a multi-party system of government.Their decision was respected and accepted by my Presidentin a landmark statement on 17 June 1993  which included anannouncement of his intention to amend the Constitution toallow for the formation of political parties  to call for ageneral election in a year’s time and to declare a generalamnesty to enable political exiles to return home andparticipate in the political process.My delegation takes this opportunity to convey to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the gratitudeof my Government and the people of Malawi for theassistance the United Nations system provided in making thenational referendum exercise a resounding success.Intergovernmental organizations such as the EuropeanCommunity and other bilateral donors also provided Malawiwith invaluable assistance during this period. MyGovernment is most grateful to all of them. What hashappened in Malawi demonstrates beyond question therepeatedly stated commitment of my President and hisGovernment to peaceful reforms  good governance  humanrights and democratization. Those who did not believe inthe seriousness of this commitment have been proved totallywrong.For the last 29 years of its independence  Malawi hasbeen preoccupied with socio-economic development  whichis rural-based in its reality  as a matter of sustained anddeliberate Government policy. The country had no otherchoice because it is completely agricultural  with a largesmall-holder agriculture component as its backbone. Thepolitical leadership consistently and untiringly preached thedoctrine of respect for the land and farming to the ordinarypeople in the villages throughout the country. This has paidoff in the disciplined commitment the Malawi people haveto farming. As a consequence  over the years a largeproportion of donor financing has focused on the agriculturalsector.Allow me to take this opportunity to thank  on behalfof my Government  all the multilateral donors - the BrettonWoods institutions and the African Development Bank among others - and the bilateral cooperating partners for theunremitting assistance they have given Malawi  enabling itto implement successfully its agricultural programmes andprojects over these past years. Without this assistance  itwould not have been possible to achieve the sense ofdiscipline and respect for farming that is now consolidatedin the people of Malawi  which confirms a vision that theMalawi leadership has carried out with practical zeal andtenacity.Regrettably  in the very recent past  Malawi’s modestachievements in the agricultural sector and the economy ingeneral have had to go through severe and unpalatableshocks well beyond the Government’s control  such as thedrought and refugee problems. But  more than that  theeconomy has had to cope in the past year with the suddenForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 19suspension of donor assistance by the Government’sdeveloped partners. Consequently  the country’s balance-of-payments financing requirements were badly affected andthis disproportionately imposed considerable negative resultson the economy’s performance. For example  private-sectorfirms performed far below capacity and the financing ofalmost all agreed development projects stopped suddenly andcompletely. Malawi is small  poor and landlocked. It isalso in the category of least developed countries  with apopulation of only about 9 million. Malawi could thereforehardly sustain or cushion this kind of massive damage to itseconomy. Its external debt burden soared  its terms of tradedeteriorated badly and the livelihood of the ordinary men women and children in the villages was badly affected.The issues of human rights  good governance and otherconditionalities that were behind these actions by the donorcommunity have now  I am happy to say  been dealt withdecisively  each one in an irreversible manner and  whereapplicable  by Act of Parliament. For example  due processof law is firmly established and in practice in Malawi.There are no political detainees in any of its prisons. TheInternational Committee of the Red Cross is workinq closelywith the Government  and has already visited all prisons andmade recommendations for improvements where this hasbeen found to be necessary. There is freedom of expressionin the country. As I speak  over 20 newspapers andmagazines are in circulation. So far  six political partieshave registered and are bracing themselves for theforthcoming general election.At present the Malawi Congress Party  which iscontinuing to rule the country until the people elect a newgovernment  has  together with other political parties in thecountry  established the National Consultative Council andthe National Executive Committee  which have clearlydefined powers to oversee the transitional process in the run-up to the general election. Each of the political parties including the Malawi Congress Party  has equalrepresentation on the National Consultative Council and theNational Executive Committee. Those institutions ensureand guarantee that there is dialogue between and amongMalawians  who discuss and resolve whatever differencesmay exist on the issues affecting the transition. Thoseinstitutions replace the President’s Committee on Dialogueand the Public Affairs Committee  which were establishedimmediately after the referendum and  in addition  aredesigned to work closely with the Government and theNational Parliament. The United Nations  particularlythrough its Electoral Assistance Unit in the Secretariat herein New York and through the Centre for Human Rights inGeneva  has been a catalyst in this whole transitionalprocess. My Government is therefore most encouraged being convinced that the peace and stability that have existedsince the holding of the national referendum will continueuntil and after the forthcoming general election  which isexpected to take place some time in May 1994.These positive and irreversible developments I havedescribed give my Government the confidence that all itsbilateral- development partners and its major multilateraldonors will fully resume development assistance flows andbalance-of-payments support to Malawi. This  we hope  willbe done without further delays  in the interests of revivingthe economy quickly and reducing the severe damage it hassustained and the unnecessary continued suffering of itspeople.The Malawi delegation is grateful to the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP)  in particular  because itwas the first to confirm  in a report to its Governing Councilat its fortieth session  in June  that there existed in Malawian enabling political  economic and social environment toimplement its Fifth Country Programme. The MalawiGovernment has no need to prove its abiding commitment todevelopment. Allow me  therefore  to take this opportunityto appeal to the donor community not to reduce its pledgesof funding to the UNDP. To do so would have catastrophiceffects on the whole democratization process  on the ongoingfield programmes and projects and also on the successfulprojects being implemented under the Fifth CountryProgramme.At this juncture the Malawi delegation wishes toreaffirm its unwavering support of the recently adoptedTokyo Declaration on African Development  whichrepresents the first concrete action and commitment of theUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africain the 1990s. Malawi  a least-developed country  would alsolike to take this opportunity to lend its unwavering supportto the Programme of Action for Least-Developed Countries which found its expression in the Declaration issued by theMinisters of Foreign Affairs of least-developed countrieswhen they met here in New York on 30 September 1993 and to the Declaration of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs ofthe Group of 77 that was adopted on 5 October 1993. Wehope that the donor community will respond positively andact accordingly on these specific problems affecting thedeveloping countries. Their decisive resolutions are pivotalto the role of the United Nations in development and integralto the call issued in General Assembly resolution 47/181 forthe Secretary-General to prepare a comprehensive report onan agenda for development and for the Assembly to discussit in its preliminary form at this current session.20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionMalawi is not oblivious of the wider politicalatmosphere that is affecting international relations andcausing serious problems with regard to peace and security.The desperate situation and horrendous scenes of the civilwar in Bosnia and Herzegovina represent one such example.It is the strong conviction of the Malawi Government thatpeace is the only answer to the unending violence we arewitnessing in the Balkans. There is an extremely urgentneed to end the suffering of the people there - innocent men women and children. My delegation strongly supports allefforts of the United Nations and the European Community and those of other parties  to resolve the problem through theongoing negotiations in Geneva and elsewhere. The problemis a human catastrophe  notwithstanding its tragic  historicalroots.With regard to Somalia  my Government is of the viewthat the Somalis should resolve their problems themselves.However  the prerequisite for realizing that objective is toestablish and consolidate peace throughout Somalia and tohelp create processes that will make it possible for thecountry to reaffirm its sovereignty. Tremendoushumanitarian-assistance achievements have already beenmade to alleviate the plight of the Somali people  who aresuffering from hunger  starvation and death in the midst ofmayhem  anarchy and the complete collapse of civilauthority. The United Nations and the internationalcommunity  through the contributions of selfless non-governmental organizations and all nations - particularly theUnited States  which has contributed troops under the UnitedNations flag - deserve to be thanked for bringing Somaliaback to life. In the view of my delegation  it is imperativethat the United Nations and the international community beallowed to complete this wholesome task by establishingconditions for peace and civil authority based clearly on theAddis Ababa agreements of 27 March 1993. The Malawidelegation fully supports the present United Nations role inSomalia.Similarly  it is the strong conviction of my Governmentthat the present situation in Angola calls for strong anddramatic action by the international community. The UnitedNations has been selfless in what it has done in Angola where the untold suffering of women  children and theelderly goes on unabated and is indeed completelyinexplicable and totally unnecessary. The Malawi delegationcalls upon the Organization of African Unity  the UnitedNations and the signatory Powers to the Bicesse PeaceAccords to compel the UNITA leadership to come to thenegotiating table with the Angola Government to establishpeace  security and stability in the country. My Governmentfully supports Security Council resolution 864 (1993)  whichhas now been put into effect. Dr. Savimbi and the UNITAleadership must not ignore international concerns and thecontent of that resolution. They must honour and respect theresults of the United Nations-supervised general election which by all accounts was free and fair.With regard to the situation in South Africa  the Malawidelegation wishes to put on record its complete support forthe historic agreement by the Multi-Party NegotiatingCouncil in Johannesburg  whose successfully negotiatedtransitional institutions have now been enacted into law bythe parliament in Cape Town. Those institutions aredesigned to oversee and control the influential factors in therun-up to the general election on 27 April 1994. I refer inparticular to the Transitional Executive Council and to theIndependent Broadcasting Authority  the Independent MediaCommission and the Independent Electoral Commission.My delegation takes this opportunity  on behalf of theMalawi Government  to congratulate all the parties on theNegotiating Council and  in particular  the African NationalCongress and Mr. Nelson Mandela  its President  and thePresident of South Africa  Mr. Frederick de Klerk and hisNational Party. It has been a very long haul to reach thishistoric stage  and the imperative is therefore clear  namely that all possible assistance by the United Nations  theOrganization of African Unity  the European Community the Commonwealth Secretariat and friendly Governmentsand people of good will must now be intensified in order toremove all forms of violence  ensure that the general electiontakes place on 27 April 1994 and that a non-racial democratic government is installed in South Africa  based onthe will of the majority of its people.My delegation welcomes the historic agreement onmutual recognition between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) which was signed on 13September 1993 in Washington  D.C. It provides aframework for lasting peace in the Middle East  and in theview of the Malawi delegation  it deserves all the support itcan receive from all well-disposed sources. History dictatesthat this should be so. This agreement is a prerequisite tointernational peace  security and political stability beyond theMiddle East.The PLO/Israel peace agreement is yet anotherdemonstration of the dramatic changes in internationalrelations that have taken place in the last three to four years following the collapse of communism and the end of thecold war. It is in this context  that my Government isoptimistic that the still unresolved major internationalpolitical issues will be similarly dealt with  issues such asForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 21the problem of North and South Korea and that of thePeople’s Republic of China and the Republic of China onTaiwan. In the view of the Malawi delegation  the time hasnow come for serious consideration to be given to theeligibility of the Republic of China on Taiwan to become aMember of the United Nations. We cannot talk abouthuman rights and the universality of the United Nationswhile in the same breath ignoring the existence of over 20million people in the Republic of China on Taiwan.Finally  allow me to make observations on twopertinent issues. First  my delegation welcomes the recentpronouncement by the United States delegation onsupporting the membership of Japan and Germany in theSecurity Council. This announcement is definite recognitionthat the time has come for representation in the SecurityCouncil to reflect the changed international political sceneand reality as well as geographical balance. The SecurityCouncil must not only be transparent in its decision-making;it is a political necessity that it also reflect what the worldis today  and not what it was 48 years ago. There is noother organ in the United Nations today which makes suchmomentous decisions affecting international peace andsecurity. My delegation is therefore strongly of the viewthat Africa equally deserves to have a permanent seat orequal and balanced representation of some kind  in theCouncil. The Malawi delegation looks forward to theexpected deliberations on this issue  which will inevitably gobeyond the life of the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly.Representation on governing councils of the respectiveUnited Nations agencies and bodies is another importantsubject before the General Assembly at this session  in thecontext of the reform  restructuring and revitalization of theUnited Nations in all its aspects. My delegation supports anegotiated approach to the points of disagreement betweenthe developing countries and their partners in developmentas a whole. The only way forward is for the two groups towork together and arrive at a consensus by the end ofNovember 1994. My delegation will support the view takenby the Group of 77 on this issue  when it comes to aconclusion in due course.I wish you  Sir  and the Assembly fruitful deliberations."
"118",4984,"MYS",48,1993,"Before I begin mystatement  I should like to extend  on behalf of theGovernment and people of Malaysia  our deepestcondolences to India for the devastating earthquake thatresulted in the loss of thousands of lives and massivedestruction of property.I would like to join other speakers in extending mycongratulations to Mr. Insanally on his election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. Hiselection to that important office is an honour to his country with which Malaysia enjoys warm and friendly relations.With his experience and ability  I am confident that he willdischarge his responsibilities well and lead this Assembly toa successful conclusion of its work.I would also like to express my appreciation of hispredecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  who discharged his dutieswith dedication and earnestness and successfully guided theefforts to revitalize the work of the General Assembly.I also take this opportunity to welcome  on behalf ofMalaysia  the six countries which have joined the UnitedNations since last fall: Andorra  the Czech Republic Eritrea  Monaco  the Slovak Republic and The FormerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Their membership willhelp to strengthen the United Nations in the execution of itsincreasingly complex role in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security and the promotion of internationaleconomic cooperation.Malaysia is a developing third world country. Weshould  according to the stereotypical Western concept of athird world country  be politically unstable  administrativelyincompetent and economically depressed. But we are notquite typical. We have actually made progress. We are16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionquite stable despite a multiracial time bomb we inheritedfrom our colonial past. We are fairly competent in therunning of our affairs. Such is our progress that we actuallycontemplate building buildings which should be thepreserves of our betters. And we dare to speak our minds.These are unforgivable sins and we are for ever beingreminded that we should not be too ambitious. We are toldthat our achievements are temporary  that next year we willgo the way of their preconception of third world countries.Of course  last year and the years before we were told thesame. But so far we have not obliged. We are  however humbly aware that nothing is permanent. Our detractorsmay yet prove right.That we do well and are not in dire need of theirdevelopment aid is apparently not praiseworthy. Yet  whenother developing countries perform badly they are chastisedand told to do better or they will get no more aid or loans.But we will soldier on. We really should not care aboutwhat is said of us. Unfortunately  these negative remarksmake life that much more difficult for us.We need foreign investments and to get them we needa reputation for stability  competence and predictability. Butwhen investors are told repeatedly that we are about toexplode in racial violence  and so on  they are likely toinvest elsewhere. Of course  what is said about us isuntrue - lies. But these people apparently subscribe to thedictum that a lie repeated often enough will be believed.We care for the well-being of our people. We want todevelop so as to give them a reasonable standard of living.But we cannot be cowed into not speaking our minds. If thepowerful nations do wrong  we will speak out against themeven if they say we are unduly suspicious  that we have anexaggerated sense of our own importance  and so on. Wecan be belittled but we will continue to speak the truth.Here at the United Nations we will say what we feel weshould say. Of course  the controlled ""free"" Western mediawill not publish it. But the few here will hear us. In anycase  it is what we achieve that counts with us. We can dowithout Western approval.Four or five years ago the world was celebrating theimpending collapse of the ""evil empire"". The Union ofSoviet Socialist Republics was still intact then  but allindications were that it had given up the fight; that it wascoming to terms with its main adversaries  the countries ofthe Western so-called free world; and that the cold war wasdrawing to a close.Peace was breaking out all over the world and therewas much talk of peace dividends. The arms race wouldend  there would be nuclear disarmament and  as the sayinggoes  swords would be turned into ploughshares. A bravenew world would emerge: equitable  just and prosperous.There would be no oppression  no terror and no poverty orstarvation. Everyone would embrace democracy and themarket economy  moving from authoritarian rule andcommand economies without a hitch. And a globalpoliceman would see to it that every country stayed in lineor faced the consequences. There was no end to the goodthings that would make up the peace dividends.It would be wrong to say that there were no peacedividends at all - the Iran-Iraq war  the Soviet occupation ofAfghanistan  the war in Cambodia  some of the CentralAmerican wars  and now the violent Palestinian-Israeliconfrontation and South Africa’s apartheid were all resolved partially or completely. But the world has not become asafer or a better place for a great many.The Soviet Union did not just become a democraticpractitioner of free trade  working with the good guys for abetter world. It broke up into a number of republics andRussia has become dangerously unstable and ungovernable.The respected great reformer of perestroika and glasnostfame was ousted and disgraced and has been replaced byanother  who seems to fare no better. The ""evil empire"" isno more. But the price in human lives and the displacementof people has been very high. And the price is still beingpaid.In Georgia  Moldova  Armenia  Azerbaijan andTajikistan  much destruction and many killings have takenplace and are still taking place. The old economic structurehas been destroyed but the new one is far from being inplace. Chaos  bloody chaos  prevails in many places.Far from achieving universal peace  the world is treatedto a spectacle of unparalleled brutality by the Serbs inBosnia and Herzegovina. In many countries of Europe fascism has once again reared its ugly head. Houses aretorched and people burned to death. And the voters actuallyapprove.During the cold-war days the protagonists constantlytried to provoke uprisings against Governments of thecountries they were opposed to. They would providefinancial and material help and would promise that theywould protect the rebels or provide them with asylum.Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 17With the collapse of the Communist bloc  the peoplethere expected help when they overthrew their CommunistGovernments and established democratic  free-marketsocieties  or they sought independence for their countries.In some instances they found their expectations justified.The Slovenes and the Croats enjoyed the full support of theEuropeans and were able to mould new nations. But theIraqi Kurds and the Bosnians learned that they thoughtwrong. It is only coincidental that both are Muslimcommunities.The most tragic case is that of Bosnia and Herzegovina.The crime of the Muslims is that they wish for a nonMuslim  religiously heterogenous State. They were viciouslyattacked by the Serbs  who openly declared that they weredoing so - and they are still doing so - to ensure that Europeremains Christian. And they are not being prevented fromproceeding in this way by the Europeans.The cruelties committed by the Serbs defy theimagination. In one case  which caused officials in one ofthe powerful countries of the West to resign in protest overtheir Government’s passivity  a six-year-old child wasrepeatedly raped in front of her mother  who not only had towatch but was prevented from giving any help  and the littlechild died after two days of exposure. That is not anisolated incident. Muslim women  old and young  and littlegirls have been raped  brutalized and killed by the tens ofthousands at the hands of the Serbs  and now the Croats.Hundreds of thousands of Muslims have died and are dying and some 2 million have been forced to flee from theirburning towns and villages.And what do the erstwhile champions of freedom anddemocracy do? They actually prevent the victims fromdefending themselves. Instead  they try to force the victimsto accept the partitioning and surrender of their territories which have been ethnically cleansed by the Serbs and theCroats. Thus are the rapists and murderers to be rewarded.Only the most gullible will still believe that the vociferouschampions of freedom and democracy will risk their necksfor other people’s freedom and democracy.Malaysia would like to record its satisfaction over theacceptance of Malaysian troops to serve in the UnitedNations forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We regret however  the exclusion of certain Muslim countries fromparticipating in the United Nations Protection Force(UNPROFOR). Apparently  the distrust of Muslims is quitewidespread. Malaysians are prepared to serve underwhoever is appointed by the United Nations in Bosnia andHerzegovina. We hope that our troops will be wellsupported. We will not protest if the United Nations decidesto increase pressure on the Serbs  even through the mountingof a military offensive  provided due preparations are made.When we add things up  the peace dividends accruingfrom the ending of the cold war have not been reallysubstantial. If there has been any change  the debit side ismuch bigger than the credit side. The most glaring exampleis the reneging on the much-needed development assistanceto poor developing countries.Still  when drawing up the balance sheet since the endof the cold war one cannot but highlight two significantitems on the credit side. The recent signing of the peaceagreement between the Palestine Liberation Organization(PLO) and the Israelis and that between blacks and whitesin South Africa must be regarded as the biggestachievements of the post-cold-war period. Admittedly  thereis still a great deal to be negotiated before justice can berendered to all sides and before true peace becomespermanent. But the most crucial obstacles have beencleared. I should like to congratulate all the partiesconcerned for their good sense and their boldness. Theextremists on both sides will not be happy. There will bemore violence. But I am sure that those who are for peaceand good sense will be as brave in peace as they have beenin war.I commend these accords to the good people ofNorthern Ireland. It is brave not to surrender even one inch but it takes real bravery to compromise.One may well ask why  in the face of the muchpublicized failure of the United States-sponsored peace talksbetween the PLO and Israel  there should be this suddenbreakthrough. The answer is to be found in the pressstatements. Good sense cannot prevail when the mediademands that statements be made by each and everyonebefore and after each negotiating session. The negotiatorsare forced to take public stands  to demonstrate how toughthey are and that they will not give even an inch. Havingtaken those stands  they were no longer able to accommodategood sense.At the peace talks in Norway  there was no press  andgood sense was able to prevail. There is this greatdemocratic principle of ""the need to know."" But do we allreally need to know every detail of every negotiation? Doesevery Israeli settler or Gaza Strip Arab  or  for that matter every Tom  Dick and Harry in every part of the world  needto know everything about the negotiations? Must18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionPalestinians continue to be killed and be made homelessbecause everybody needs to know what was said by whom?This need for transparency  this right to information  isan invention of those who want to make money from theinformation industry. We should know about the bestialityof the Serbs in Bosnia so that we may react  but thatknowledge is largely denied us. On the other hand  day inand day out we are shown this parade of negotiators to apeace conference. Can the average man do anythingworthwhile as a result of seeing the daily TV report?We live in the information age. There has been andthere will continue to be an unending explosion in the fieldof information technology. Today  we can sit in our homesand watch and hear a war as it is being fought  witness witheyes and ears a beauty contest as it is being judged  and lookthrough a microscope at a bug as it swims  all via the TVscreen. We see all these things as they are  where they are without a second’s delay. We can watch murder as it isbeing committed  in all the gory details  and we can beshocked by it. But  then  we can also watchMichael Jackson doing his moon walk at the very momentmass murder and massacres of the most brutal kinds arebeing committed.What we see and hear and witness is what the mediadecide we should see and hear and witness. If the mediawants us to be shocked by a massacre  it can broadcast luriddetails of that massacre. But if it chooses to broadcastMichael Jackson at the time the massacre was taking place we will be stomping our feet in total enjoyment.Clearly  the people who decide what we should see andhear hold terrible power. They can have us dancing in thestreets or they can have us rioting in the streets withfirebrands in our hands  burning  looting and killing. Canwe doubt that such people are powerful? Make no mistake:the people who control the media control our minds  andprobably control the world. They can make or breakpresidents  and they have done so. Countries can be isolatedor accepted despite violations of human rights  depending onhow the media present them.And who controls the powerful world media? Not thenational governments of tiny developing nations; not eventhe governments of powerful nations. A very few people inthe West control all the international media. Some arejournalists  but quite a few are not. Collectively they areBig Brothers.Now they have an even more effective weapon in theform of the worldwide television network. Today theybroadcast slanted news. Tomorrow they will broadcast rawpornography to corrupt our children and destroy our culture.They are already doing that in Europe.Today we can still control the reception. The day isfast approaching when only a coat-hanger will be needed toreceive television broadcasts from across the world. We willhave nowhere to retreat. Already the small nations are beingaccused of being undemocratic and limiting freedom becausewe do not allow reception of international televisionnetworks. We hope this is because our accusers believe inthe freedom of the press  but we suspect it is because theymonopolize the world media and stand to profit substantiallyfrom the freedom they insist every nation should have.Malaysia believes in press freedom. But that freedom as with other freedoms and rights  must be accompanied byresponsibility. We will continue to expect the Malaysianmedia to be responsible. We will not forgo the need toenforce that responsibility. But as to the international press we can only hope and pray that they will realize the damagethey are doing. We will not interfere with them. They arefree to report and to write any number of lies but we hopethat occasionally they will cover the truth as well. Powercorrupts  but power without responsibility is the mostcorrupting influence of all.We have heard often enough of the need forrestructuring the United Nations. We need this because theworld has changed. It is not the world of the immediatepost-Second-World-War period that we have today. Thepeople who plunged the world into a horrendous war arenow the good guys  telling the world how to be humane.The rapacious invaders of the past are now the goodSamaritans  distributing aid to the needy. Will there alwaysbe no room for the reformed?We talk of democracy as the only acceptable system ofgovernment. It is so good that we cannot wait for thedemocratic process to bring about its own acceptance byevery country. It must be forced upon everyone  whetherwelcome or not. Yet when it comes to the United Nations we eschew democracy. And the most undemocratic aspectof the United Nations is the veto power of the fivepermanent members of the Security Council. We can acceptsome weighting in their favour  but for each of them aloneto be more powerful than the whole membership of theUnited Nations is not acceptable; it was not before  it is notnow  and will not be in the future.Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 19For the time being  there can be some permanentmembers. But the veto must go. A formula must be foundfor new permanent members of the Security Council.Whatever the other qualifications may be  they must includea genuine and sincere interest in international welfare.At the ministerial-level World Conference on HumanRights held at Vienna this year  a more comprehensivedefinition of human rights was presented. Many countrieslike Malaysia were smeared in Vienna for allegedly refusingto accept the universality of human rights. We subscribe tothe universality of human rights  but not to the irresponsiblevariety propounded by the West. Human rights is not alicence to do anything without regard to the rights of others.The rights of the majority are just as valid as the rights ofthe minority or the individual. A society has a right toprotect itself from the unbridled exercise of rights byindividuals or a minority  which in the West has contributedto the collapse of morality and of the structure of humansociety.If individual and minority rights are so totallyinviolable  then you must allow the resurgence of nazismand its violently racist activities in Europe and elsewhere.But it is apparent that the West at least still thinks that racistviolence is wrong. We hope they will also accept thatfreedom from poverty and the wish to develop are essentialelements of human rights.Finally  countries like Malaysia must take exception topreaching on human rights from people who willinglycondone  and to a certain degree aid  ""ethnic cleansing"" inBosnia and Herzegovina. Until they redeem themselvesthere  all their talk of human rights will sound hollow.This litany of the woes of the developing countries andthe world may seem endless. Actually  the list is far fromcomplete. Trade and protectionism  aid and debts  theUnited Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment and pressures on environmental issues Antarctica and many more have not been touched upon.The world of the post-cold-war period is not athoroughly bad place  but for the developing countries including Malaysia  there is really very little to crow about.A statement in the General Assembly is not going tochange the world. But there is really nowhere else that thewoes of the third world can be aired. Not to air them is toencourage supercilious arrogance on the part of those whoare most responsible yet who still presume to extol their ownvirtues and to preach to others. Even if the benefit isminimal  the truth must be told sometimes."
"119",5011,"NAM",48,1993,"On behalf of theGovernment and people of Namibia  I wish to extend ourdeepest sympathy and heartfelt condolences to theGovernment and friendly people of India on the heavy lossof life and destruction of property that resulted from thedevastating earthquake. I trust that the internationalcommunity will give them a full helping hand.Namibia welcomes all the newest Members of theOrganization and assures them of its readiness to interactwith them in the spirit of friendship and solidarity.The President of the Assembly hails from a friendlycountry  Guyana  which did so much to spearhead thestruggle of the Namibian people for self-determination liberation and democracy. The Government and people ofGuyana spared no effort in manifesting  in word and deed their unswerving support for and solidarity with theNamibian cause in different world forums. I know all thisbecause I have spent many years at the United Nations andduring this time I visited Georgetown  his nation’s capital and other parts of Guyana on more than one occasion. Thehospitality and camaraderie of his brotherly people alwaystouched me very deeply. In his past and present incarnationsin the service of his great country  he and I havecollaborated on various issues of common interest. It isagainst this background of mutual friendship and solidarity therefore  that I congratulate him most warmly on hisbrilliant election as President of this challenging session ofthe Assembly. His sterling stewardship is already soeffectively manifest that the successful conclusion of ourdeliberations is assured.I also wish to place on record our sincere appreciationto his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev ofBulgaria  for the effective leadership he provided lastsession.Our illustrious Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  has since his appointment been spearheadingan effective and innovative global campaign aimed atstreamlining and strengthening the role of the United Nationsin peace-keeping operations and in economic andhumanitarian issues. His ""Agenda for Peace"" has provideda useful framework for discussing these and other pressingissues relating to the maintenance of world peace andsecurity. Namibia commends the Secretary-General for histireless efforts.On the threshold of a new millennium  and as we areabout to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  it is an appropriate time to reflect and take stock.This is a period of great hope and confidence in the efficacyof the United Nations. New vision and foresight are thuscalled for; bold and imaginative decisions are required.At its forty-seventh session the General Assembly  inresolution 47/62  on the ""Question of equitable representationon and increase in the membership of the Security Council"" recognized that in the changing global situation there was aneed to reorganize  revitalize and democratize the SecurityCouncil. The end of the cold war has created newexpectations that the Security Council will take on largerresponsibilities and a greater role in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. But if the Security Councilis to be a credible organ of the United Nations  it must fulfilthese expectations of a changing and demanding world. Itis with this in mind that the ""Question of equitablerepresentation on and increase in the membership of theSecurity Council"" should be addressed. Changes towards amore representative Council would  no doubt  enhance itscredibility  legitimacy and authority.Namibia supports the view that the membership of theSecurity Council should be increased and more permanentand non-permanent members added  taking into considerationequitable geographical representation. Africa itself needs aneffective presence on the Council  as do Asia and LatinAmerica. The outmoded and undemocratic veto powershould be abolished altogether.Likewise  there is a compelling need for therestructuring of other organs  such as the General Assemblyitself and the Economic and Social Council. The memberStates of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  workingin close partnership with the Group of 77  should involvethemselves fully in the ongoing discussions on therestructuring of these vital organs of the United Nations.Today we are witnessing a new phenomenon ininternational relations  characterized by a sense of consensusderiving from shared interests  in which the credibility andcentrality of the United Nations in dealing with globalconflicts has been greatly enhanced. Indeed  we havewitnessed the Organization fulfilling its mandate in the areaof the maintenance of international peace and security.We in Namibia believe that now is the opportunemoment to establish a new role and purpose for a conflict-resolution mechanism which is appropriate to the post-cold-war era and to the needs and aspirations of succeedinggenerations. The renewed commitment towards conflictresolution must be transformed into a realistic programme ofaction  relating to preventive diplomacy  peacemaking 20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionpeace-keeping and peace-building. Humanity is yearning fora peaceful  just and prosperous world. On this score Namibia envisages a meaningful partnership and enhancedcooperation between the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations and the Secretary-General of the Organization ofAfrican Unity in the field of conflict resolution andhumanitarian relief operations in Africa.Now more than ever  much is expected of the UnitedNations in the area of conflict resolution. The Organizationhas a golden opportunity to ensure that those expectationswhich ""We the peoples"" set forth in the Charter  are met byfurther enhancing its effectiveness.It is an accepted fact that peace and stability arenecessary  albeit not sufficient  conditions for economicdevelopment. Therefore  peace-keeping  peacemaking andpeace-building should go hand in hand with economicdevelopment.For peace-keeping operations to be effective  MemberStates should pay promptly their assessed contributions tothe regular budget and to peace-keeping operations. In thiscontext  we support the establishment of the reserve fundaimed at improving the start-up financing of peace-keepingoperations.In Cambodia  the United Nations Transitional Authorityin Cambodia (UNTAC) accomplished its task satisfactorily.Namibia was happy to have contributed polling officers anda staffed contingent of reinforced vehicles  called wolves  toUNTAC. We did this because it was  after all  in Namibiathat a United Nations peace-keeping operation scored its firstlarge-scale victory. Namibia will favourably considerparticipation in future United Nations peace-keepingoperations.Unfortunately  other peace-keeping operations have notas yet achieved the same positive results. It is our hope thatthe United Nations will continue to help resolve the conflictsin Somalia  Angola  Rwanda  Liberia  Mozambique  Haitiand Bosnia and Herzegovina  among others.With regard to Angola  Mr. Savimbi’s rejection of lastyear’s election results was a major set-back. It has plungedthat sister country further into a most horrible humantragedy. The horrendous carnage there continues to claimabout 1 000 innocent lives a day. It is further reported thatfrom 2 million to 3 million innocent Angolans are at risk ofdying of either direct or indirect effects of this senselesswar.The international community must exert concertedpressure on Mr. Savimbi to accept the will of the Angolanpeople without any further delay. What is now expected ofMr. Savimbi is the speedy implementation of the BicesseAccords  the relevant Security Council resolutions  theAbidjan Protocol and last year’s election results  which taken together  provide the framework for resumingnegotiations with the Angolan Government.It is the view of the Namibian Government that theresumption of negotiations should lead to an early cease-fire which will allow the delivery of humanitarian assistance tothe suffering Angolan people  reconciliation andconsolidation of the Government of National Unity.To this end  and in the face of Mr. Savimbi’s persistentintransigence  the Security Council had no other alternativebut to impose sanctions against UNITA. Namibia  therefore supports Security Council resolution 864 (1993) which  interalia  calls for the prohibition of all sale or supply to UNITAof arms and related materiél and military assistance  as wellas petroleum and petroleum products  and urges all MemberStates to implement these measures. We believe also that ifUNITA continues to flout Security Council resolutions additional forms of punitive sanctions should be imposed.Concerning the situation in Somalia  Namibia supportsthe United Nations peace-keeping operation there. Mydelegation holds the view that disarming the various factionswould allow the people of Somalia to build genuine bridgesof reconciliation and bring about the restoration of a civilsociety.Under the present circumstances  and in spite ofprovocations by General Aidid’s faction  the United NationsOperation in Somalia should continue to carry out itsmandate. Our hearts go out in sympathy to all thosecountries whose nationals  including innocent Somalis  havemade the supreme sacrifice in the service of the UnitedNations and human brotherhood. Any precipitouswithdrawal  however  would be to the detriment of innocentSomali people and is likely to reverse the whole process.This should not be allowed to happen.In Mozambique  we are encouraged to note that thecease-fire continues to hold and that the process appears tobe moving forward. I can hardly overemphasize that it isabsolutely imperative for elections to be conducted in anatmosphere of peace  trust and cooperation - and this meansthat the armed forces must first be confined to base anddemobilized  in accordance with the General PeaceAgreement agreed to last year by the two parties.Forty-eighth session - 6 October l993 21Namibia welcomes with satisfaction the recentencouraging developments that have taken place in SouthAfrica. For the first time in the history of that neighbouringcountry  all the people of South Africa will finallyparticipate in a free and democratic election on 27 April nextyear. We would like  nevertheless  to urge all the people ofSouth Africa to ensure that this process remains on course and we call upon all the parties to participate in the work ofthe Transitional Executive Council. In the same vein  wecall upon them  with the assistance of the internationalcommunity  to put an immediate end to the ever-escalatingviolence. Violence and the ballot box do not go together.Namibia  along with the other members of the Ad HocCommittee on Southern Africa of the Organization ofAfrican Unity  supports the call made by the President of theAfrican National Congress  Mr. Nelson Mandela  to lift allremaining economic sanctions against South Africa.Namibia further supports the lifting of the oil embargo afterthe establishment and commencement of the work of theTransitional Executive Council  as well as the establishmentor restoration of full diplomatic relations with South Africa following the installation of an elected Interim Governmentof National Unity  pursuant to democratic elections nextyear.The Middle East  the cradle of some of the world’smajor religions  has witnessed bloody conflicts for thegreater part of this century and has been on the agenda ofthe United Nations since its inception. Namibia welcomesthe historic breakthrough represented by mutual recognitionand the declaration of principles signed between Israel andthe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on Palestinianself-rule in Gaza and the city of Jericho. Despite their longenmity  the leaders of the State of Israel and the PLOsummoned the political courage to embrace peace. We canonly hope that the historic handshake between Mr. Rabin Prime Minister of Israel  and Mr. Arafat  Chairman of thePLO  will usher in a new era in that region.Granted  this is only a first step  but it constitutes afirm basis for building a comprehensive  just and lastingpeace in the Middle East. However  for this undertaking tosucceed  the infusion of large-scale and sustainedinternational financial and humanitarian assistance isrequired.Encouraged by the historic and momentousbreakthrough in the Middle East and the positivedevelopments in South Africa  and also taking intoconsideration the emerging climate in favour ofrapprochement in inter-State relations  we believe that thetime has now come for the leaders of the United States ofAmerica and the Republic of Cuba to travel the shortdistance of 90 miles to reconciliation and peacefulcoexistence. We are convinced that this can be done in theinterest of the children of the two countries  who  like thoseof South Africa  Israel and Palestine  hope for a peaceful andbrighter future.Peace and stability in the Middle East are criticallyimportant not only to that region but also to the world as awhole. In this context  Namibia associates itself withSecurity Council resolution 833 (1993) of 27 May 1993 dealing with the territorial integrity of Kuwait andinviolability of its borders. We reiterate our full support forthe right of the people of Kuwait and its Government todefend their sovereignty and independence. Namibia is asmall State  and we understand the predicament of smallStates.During the last session  I updated this august Assemblyon the progress made in our bilateral negotiations with theGovernment of South Africa on the issue of the transfer andreintegration of Walvis Bay and the Offshore Islands intoNamibia. Today  I am happy to report that the matter hasfinally been resolved. On 28 February 1994  the transferand reintegration of Walvis Bay and the Offshore Islandsinto Namibia will take place. This will  at last  mark thecompletion of the decolonization of Namibia and theunification of our nation. I take this opportunity to expressour deep appreciation to the Member States for theirconsistent support  over the years  of Security Councilresolution 432 (1978) on Walvis Bay. I would also like tothank  in particular  the South African Multi-PartyNegotiating Forum for adopting an important resolutionwhich speeded up this process.The Rio Earth Summit marked an historic turning-pointin the long struggle to increase international awareness aboutthe true nature of the global environmental crisis. TheSummit effectively moved a long way towards a betterunderstanding of how future economic development isinextricably linked to sound policies aimed at promoting andprotecting the environment.22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionTo this end  and in line with the provisions of ourConstitution  Namibia has launched a countrywideprogramme of tree planting to prevent further deforestationand degradation of the environment. Naturally  Namibia like the other developing countries  is anxious to seegenerous financing and implementing of Agenda 21.Let me now turn to the socio-economic problems weare facing today. Despite the promise world leaders madeto children at the World Summit for Children here in NewYork in 1990  education  health  water  shelter and foodsecurity remain inaccessible to millions of children in thedeveloping world - and Namibia is no exception.In Africa  problems of hunger  malnutrition  disease and so on  continue to thwart the commitment we made lastyear at Dakar during the International Conference onAssistance for the African Child  to place children first. Infurtherance of this commitment  and convinced that theproblems of the Namibian children can be addressed only ina comprehensive manner  we have already integrated theNational Programme of Action on children into the overallNational Development Plan. This National DevelopmentPlan constitutes the basis for social and economicdevelopment in Namibia. In this context  primary healthcare  education  provision of water and rural developmentare among the priorities of our National Development Plan.The 20/20 Vision programme we adopted at Dakarmust be implemented if we are to achieve tangible results bythe year 1995  when we shall review progress made sincethe 1990 World Summit  including in particular the fate andwelfare of those children engulfed in war situations.The recent World Conference on Human Rights inVienna has further exposed the unmitigated violence andother forms of injustice being perpetrated against womenthroughout the world. The Namibian Constitution containsspecific provisions on protection of the rights of women andpromotion of their welfare. Furthermore  Namibia is a partyto the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms ofDiscrimination against Women.It is against this background that we in Namibia havetaken measures to raise women’s awareness of their rightsby translating this Convention into indigenous languages. Inthe same vein  we applaud the appointment of the SpecialRapporteur to study the issue of violence against women. Itis with this in mind that Namibia looks forward to theFourth World Conference on Women  in anticipation that itsdecisions will further advance the cause of women in theworld  especially in Africa.These are some of the many concerns on the socialagenda of all nations. Thus to us  the appointment of aUnited Nations commissioner for human rights makes muchsense  and we support the idea. At the same time  we wouldlike to urge everyone to ensure that the mandate and statusof such a high-level international civil servant should beconsidered carefully and realistically.In order to meet the acute shortages of housing  theGovernment has embarked upon a programme to provideadequate housing to the Namibian people by the year 2000.In recognition of this national effort  Namibia was awardedthe Habitat Scroll of Honour for 1993 for our NationalHousing Programme  called ""Build Together"". This awardwas received by my distinguished colleague  the HonourableMrs. Libertine Amathila  Minister of Local and RegionalGovernment and Housing  two days ago. I would like toecho the words of my colleague by thanking Habitat for thisoutstanding honour.In conclusion  I wish to reiterate my Government’sbelief that the United Nations  as a unique internationalbody  can live up to its lofty ideals of creating a peaceful secure and just world for us and for generations to come.To this end  Namibia pledges its total commitment."
"120",5056,"NER",48,1993,"On behalf of the Niger and its people  I wish to extend mywarmest salutations to this distinguished Assembly. It istruly with great pleasure that I am taking part in the generaldebate of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly.As the first democratically elected President of theNiger  I have come to bring members and all the peoplesrepresented here a message of esteem and friendship goodwill and cooperation from the people of the Niger. Ihave come to express the pride of the people of the Niger inbelonging to the great family of the United Nations. I havecome to reassert its powerful and sincere faith in the idealsand principles expressed in the United Nations Charter. Ihave come to share its anxieties and concerns with membersand to state our determination to join with all the membersof the Assembly in the efforts to build a better world forpresent and future generations.First  however  may I join the speakers who havepreceded me in extending to you  Mr. President  our sincere6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioncongratulations on your well-deserved election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.By unanimously giving you the heavy task of guidingits work  the General Assembly pays a well-deserved tributeto your skills and to your country  Guyana  for its invaluablecontribution to the efforts of the United Nations to achieveits noble ideals. Of course  I also congratulate the othermembers of the Bureau  who I am certain will spare noeffort to support you in the successful accomplishment ofyour difficult functions. I also assure you of the fullcooperation of the Niger delegation.To your predecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria  Iexpress the compliments of the Niger delegation for thecompetence  efficiency and tact with which he presided overthe work of the last session.Finally  I pay a special tribute to our Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the fresh dynamic he hasbrought to the United Nations  with a firm commitment tointernational development  peace and security. This worksince his election to the head of the world Organizationclearly reflects our concerns. On behalf of Niger  I warmlycongratulate him.From 29 July to 3 November 1991 the active elementsof the nation of Niger held a National Supreme Conference which was a historic opportunity to consider the results ofNiger’s 30 years of independence and lay the foundations forfurther efforts to strengthen the cohesiveness and unity ofour people and guarantee them the conditions for sustainedand harmonious development.Following that Conference  Niger resolutely set forth onthe path of democratization  to build for our people a Stateof law founded on the principles of pluralist democracy andcommitted to observing and guaranteeing respect for humanrights as defined in the 1948 Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights and in the 1981 African Charter of Humanand National Rights.As a prelude to the democratization process  the peopleof Niger  by an overwhelming majority  adopted in areferendum on 26 December 1992 the Constitution of theThird Republic  which guarantees the human rights set outin various international instruments and enshrines theseparation of powers between the executive  legislative andjudiciary branches. Furthermore  the Constitution containsmany other innovative elements  such as providing for theestablishment of a high council of communication  anindependent administrative body to ensure and guarantee thefreedom and independence of the communications media andfair access for political parties  associations and citizens toofficial means of information and communications.The Constitution of 26 December 1992 proclaimsNiger’s commitment to spare no effort to achieve the idealof African unity  as well as its willingness to cooperate infriendship and equality with all peoples devoted to peace justice and freedom.Once the Constitution was adopted the people of Nigerwent to the polls on 14 February 1993 to elect the 83Deputies of the National Assembly  the legislative body ofthe Third Republic. This Assembly is in every wayrepresentative of the ethnic diversity of our people and itspolitical points of view. Indeed  through the creation ofspecial districts during the elections  in addition to theregular administrative districts  every ethnic group in Nigeris today represented in the National Assembly. Thegovernment majority is made up of an alliance of ninepolitical groups  while the opposition is made up of agrouping of three parties holding 33 of the 83 seats in theNational Assembly.The democratization process undertaken by my countrywas completed by the holding  from 14 to 27 March 1993 of two-stage presidential elections  in which eight politicalgroups took part. The result was that the people of Nigerentrusted me with the onerous task of leading them into thefuture. It is important to note that throughout the processthe people of Niger demonstrated great maturity and behavedin an exemplary manner. Tens of thousands participated travelling great distances and braving the extremetemperatures that are typical of Saharan Africa. They tookpart in a calm  peaceful and disciplined manner  alwaysmaintaining the very powerful feelings of brotherhood andof belonging to a single nation that unite them. Suchconduct  which I am happy to praise once again here  earnedthe people of Niger the esteem  consideration and respect ofthe hundreds of international observers from all over theworld who monitored the elections and attested to theirfairness and openness.The people of Niger thus made its choice  deciding thatdemocracy would be the framework of its future. Thischoice is  to be sure  in keeping with the changing times  inkeeping with the direction of history. But we know thatdemocratization is a long-term undertaking requiring patienceand selflessness. The great democratic nations of todaythemselves travelled a long road before reaching theircurrent stage of development.Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 7Young nations such as Niger which have firmly chosenthis path must overcome many obstacles and difficultiesresulting from the weakness of their socio-economicstructures and the international environment.For my country  one of the most important difficultiesis the armed rebellion in the north  which poses grave risksto its unity. This inherited situation is in large part causedby the drought in the Sahel  which is making livingconditions precarious for its nomadic peoples  who alreadyface a most hostile and arid environment. The situation isa cause of great concern to Niger. Therefore  immediatelyit took office on 23 April 1993 the new Governmentknuckled down to finding ways and means to allow a fairand speedy solution to the problem to prevail in peace andbrotherly trust.The Government has been helped in this undertaking bythe valuable assistance of friendly countries  to which Iextend our sincere thanks and deep gratitude. Thanks tothese efforts  on 11 June 1993 the negotiations resulted in athree-month truce which was scrupulously respected by theparties and whose terms were recently renewed. There areencouraging signs of a speedy solution to this problem beingfound  and we intend to devote the needed energy to it.From this rostrum dedicated to peace I express the hopethat all the sons of the Niger nation will work together tosurmount their present difficulties and build a fraternal democratic and prosperous Niger.The World Conference on Human Rights held atVienna from 14 to 25 June 1993 reaffirmed that the right todevelopment is a basic human right. It affirmed thatdemocracy  development and basic human rights areinterdependent  reinforcing each other  and it stressed theoverriding need to support the process of democratization indeveloping countries if we wish to ensure its success.Niger remains convinced that freedom and democracyneed water to grow  just as fish need water to swim  and thatthey need to be buttressed by economic and social progress.Similarly  we are convinced that international peace andsecurity cannot prevail in the world unless we take intoaccount the vast mass of mankind’s legitimate yearnings foreconomic and social progress.Thus  development is a major challenge for thefledgling democracies. They must give an urgent andcompelling reply to the question: how can we maintain andcultivate our faith? That is the ardent question of millionsof men and women who went to the ballot box to vote andwho  after the euphoria of victory  find themselvesconfronted with the harsh realities of their lives  the endlessproblems of survival.I know that the Assembly has a broad awareness of thecountless difficulties that paralyse our peoples in their dailylives and impede their development.I know that the Assembly is fully informed about theunspeakable hardships our peoples have endured for decadesand our thoughts about them. Indeed  for year after year andsession after session  we have been constantly seized of suchgreat topics as the deterioration in terms of trade  thebuttressing of protectionism  the debt crisis  the continuingdeterioration of the environment  the growing shrinkage ofpublic development assistance  population growth  andreforms in structural adjustment.The listing of those great topics is but an imperfectsummary of the fate and the enormous poverty that is the lotof a large portion of mankind.The economic situation of the African continentprovides an edifying example of that state of affairs. Africahas been experiencing a widespread economic crisis ofunprecedented severity  the result of a long period ofeconomic recession. For years now  the continent hassuffered from this prolonged recession and from a decline inliving standards and a breakdown in the social fabric that isso widespread and so deep that many of the benefits gainedin the early years of independence have now beenirretrievably lost. Today  real per capita income has sunkbelow the 1980 level.The relationship between investment and gross nationalproduct continues to deteriorate. Our economies are markedby budgetary and trade imbalances and large importreductions  aggravated by the drop in the price of rawmaterials.According to some estimates  the ability of somecountries to repay  based on exports  is diminishing. Thus the debt-export relationship  which stood at 97 per cent in1980  fell to 233 per cent in 1985 and stood atapproximately 333 per cent in 1992.In any event  economic indicators give only anincomplete picture of the situation and do not enable us tovisualize the consequences of drought  famine and thedeterioration of the environment. The slump means that insome regions of Africa the standards of living  which hadalready been among the world’s harshest  have deteriorated8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioneven further  reaching levels that are unacceptable for amodern civilization.Yet the Governments of those countries haverecognized their own weaknesses and laid out areas ofresponsibility. They have courageously undertaken harshreforms and adopted painful austerity measures for theirpeople aimed at improving their economic and financialenvironment.For a number of reasons  these adjustment policies havenot produced the expected results. I should point to two ofthem.First  there is the inadequacy of financial and materialmeans  which has prevented us from achieving results andconsolidating our gains.Secondly  there is our States’ burden of foreignindebtedness  which has reached an intolerable level andwhich continues to weigh ever more heavily upon them worsening their economic and social difficulties.In those circumstances  how can we expect the poorcountries to develop?Underdevelopment is making daily headway  and thelist of countries eligible for the soft conditions of theInternational Development Association is growing.For that reason  from this rostrum Niger is calling uponthe developed countries to give proof of greater solidarity byagreeing to a blanket cancellation of the debt of the least-developed countries.Niger had hoped to hear of this decision following themeeting of the Group of 7  but  unfortunately  the sevenmost-industrialized countries did not move to improve therepayment abilities of the debtor countries.Hence  we must curb this development  which has anegative impact on our countries. We must find ways andmeans to reverse present trends. We must act in order torestore hope to Africa  Asia and Latin America.Niger earnestly hopes that the first Copenhagen summiton social development will not be another meeting with nofollow-up.Similarly  the international conference on populationand development planned for 1994 should provide anopportunity for rich and poor to join efforts against hungerand malnutrition.Closer to home  in a few days an internationalconference on African development will be held on theinitiative of the Government of Japan. Niger hopes that thatmeeting will come up with the necessary radical measures tosolve the problems of the African continent.The world is now enjoying one of those propitiousmoments for peace that history occasionally provides us.Prospects today enable us to hope for a better future.The end of East-West antagonism has given rise to apowerful movement towards peace and has simultaneouslyawakened great hopes for sustainable development.Disarmament  as set forth in the United NationsCharter  must entail a system of collective security designedto avoid any excessive stockpiling of weapons. Indeed  it isof primary importance to establish confidence betweenneighbouring countries that share a similar destiny owing tothe many ties joining their respective populations. It is alsoessential that States without weapons of mass destructionhave guarantees that their territories will never serve astesting grounds. We believe it is essential that the resourcesthus freed be devoted to eradicating poverty  which still  atthe end of the twentieth century  is creating conditions ofshocking poverty intolerable to the human conscience.Another ground for hope is the recent United NationsConference on Human Rights  which has declared the rightto development to be a universal and inalienable right  anintegral part of fundamental human rights.Hope was also created by the last Rio summit meeting which focussed world attention on the threats to ourenvironment  highlighted the existing interrelationship ofdevelopment and the environment and thereby stressed theoverriding need to ensure its preservation in the interests ofpresent and future generations.Pledges to finance the programmes of Agenda 21 havealready been recorded. Niger hopes that the fine hopesawakened in Rio will very soon be translated into concreteactions. That is why we welcome the creation of operationalmachinery such as the Commission on SustainableDevelopment and the intergovernmental committee to draftan international convention on desertification and drought.Niger  which has had to deal with the galloping andfrightening encroachment of the desert  is following withclose interest the work of this committee.Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 9I have spoken at length about Niger and about ourconcerns and our hopes. However  I should not like to givethe impression that the great problems of the world arematters of indifference to us. Notwithstanding the difficulttimes through which we are passing  Niger is attentive towhat is going on in the rest of the world. We areencouraged by developments in the situation in South Africa and we were relieved to hear the announcement that the firstfree  democratic elections there would be held on 27 April1994. In this regard  we join in the appeal of our brotherNelson Mandela that the international sanctions imposed onSouth Africa be lifted. We believe that the adoption of sucha measure would help to create in that country theatmosphere of détente and trust that is necessary if theemergence of a multiracial  egalitarian and democraticsociety is to be promoted. This would lead to SouthAfrica’s entry into the African arena and its return to theconcert of the civilized nations of the world.It was with real relief that we received the results of theGeneva negotiations between the various parties to theconflict in Liberia  which led to the signing of the Cotonouagreements in Benin. This outcome suggests that peace isbeginning to return to that country. Niger supports action bythe Economic Community of West African States with aview to securing respect for these agreements by all theparties concerned.We also welcome the talks in El Ayoun on WesternSahara. These talks open up new prospects for a finalsettlement of this conflict  which has lasted far too long.Now more than ever before  other regions of theAfrican continent require our close attention and action.This is true of Angola  Mozambique and Somalia.Representatives may rest assured that Niger unreservedlysupports all Security Council resolutions that promote thereturn of peace to this long-suffering country.I wish now to praise Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali’sdynamic work towards elimination of the numerous sourcesof tension and conflict in Africa and in the world at large.We wish to thank him  in particular  for the insights andthoughts contained in the report entitled ""An Agenda forPeace"". We have familiarized ourselves with the many wiseproposals that the Secretary-General has put forward in thatdocument. In particular  we share his views regardingpreventive diplomacy. It was in this spirit that theOrganization of African Unity  at its 29th summit meeting inCairo  equipped itself with machinery for the prevention management and resolution of conflicts in Africa.Away from the African continent  we welcome thesigning by the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel on 13 September 1993 in Washington  of the agreements onmutual recognition and on autonomy for the Gaza Strip andJericho.We hope that the momentum for peace that isbeginning in certain parts of the world will move to Bosniaand Herzegovina  which has suffered far too long.It is on this hopeful note that I shall conclude mystatement. But first I should like  on behalf of Niger  towelcome the arrival in the great family of nations of Eritrea the Principality of Monaco  the Principality of Andorra  theCzech Republic  the Former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia and the Slovak Republic. Their presence amongus strengthens the universality of the United Nations andtestifies to the value of the Organization’s action in supportof the widespread progress of mankind."
"121",5102,"NGA",48,1993,"It is a great honour andprivilege  Sir  for me to address this Assembly under yourpresidency. Your election is a tribute to you and to yourgreat country  Guyana. It furthermore attests to theinternational community’s confidence in your ability to carryout the duties of President of the General Assembly duringthe next 12 months. I have no doubt that  given yoursterling qualities  you will guide this session to a successfulconclusion.I also wish to commend your distinguished predecessor His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of the Republic ofBulgaria  for the able and outstanding manner in which heconducted the affairs of the forty-seventh session.I would also like to express my delegation’sacknowledgement of the dedicated manner in which theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  has beendirecting the work of our Organization during this crucialperiod.On behalf of the Government and the people of Nigeria I welcome all the new Member States  fully confident of theuseful contribution they can make in furtherance of the nobleobjectives of the United Nations.The relevance of our great Organization to the solutionof the common problems facing humanity is more manifesttoday than at any time in our history. The complexity ofthese pressing concerns and the need to act rapidly and withresolve demand a greater degree of concerted efforts bymembers of the international community. Events happeningaround us demonstrate the urgency of this imperative. In thelast few years  the international landscape has witnessedunprecedented transformations and rapid changes. The coldwar has become a thing of the past. Progress has been madein nuclear disarmament. The wave of democratization whichhas been sweeping across the world has not diminished inintensity or breadth. The search for greater prosperitythrough emerging regional economic arrangements isspreading.In spite of the inherent benefits of all thesedevelopments  no sooner do we succeed in resolving one setof problems than we are confronted with new and morechallenging ones. Indeed  the promise of global peace andsecurity and the vision of a new world order are inhibited bypolitical and ethnic conflicts  economic and social disorder and deepening poverty  particularly in developing countries.In this connection  the consequences of feeble gesturesor inaction are just too frightening to contemplate. It istherefore necessary to draw attention to the major concernsso that they can be fully addressed with a view to findinglasting solutions which are just and beneficial to everymember of the international community.In view of the positive changes in the internationalpolitical environment  the United Nations has been placed atthe centre of conflict resolution  having been accorded itsrightful place in the promotion and maintenance ofinternational peace and security. Unfortunately  ourOrganization is being overwhelmed by the avalanche ofconflicts which it is suddenly called upon to resolve.Practically all regions of the world are embroiled in oneconflict or another. No region  however  is as afflicted asAfrica  either in the number of conflicts currently raging orin their unimaginable negative effects on people. In oneconflict alone - that of Angola - as many as 1 000 people arereported to be dying each day. Angola is not alone in theunenviable situation created by civil conflict: Sudan Somalia and Liberia can be cited.Regional conflicts constitute a key threat to theachievement of global peace and security. This is why wewelcome the active and increased involvement of the UnitedNations in peace-keeping and peace-building efforts. Therole of our Organization in these areas will continue toexpand as more States call on it for assistance in preventingor containing conflicts. Member States have the duty tosupport fully the work of the Organization in this veryimportant role. They must be prepared to provide theOrganization with the resources and the personnel it requiresto cope with ever-growing peace-keeping demands. Theprice of peace may be high; we must be conscious  however that it is a far better bargain compared with the price of war.In this connection  the recent mammoth and multifacetedpeace-keeping operation in Cambodia gives cause for greatoptimism.The United Nations must direct its peace-keepingoperations in a manner that does not jeopardize its integrityor expose its peace-keepers to avoidable danger.Furthermore  it must be made clear to those who commitacts of aggression against United Nations peace-keepers thatthey will be adjudged guilty of crimes against theinternational community. The safety of United Nationspeace-keepers is of utmost concern to countries which  likeNigeria  participate in many operations within and outsideAfrica.I recall that  while on peace-keeping duty in the formerYugoslavia  Nigerian troops were subjected to attackresulting in casualties. The same is happening in Somalia where Pakistani  Italian  Nigerian  American and Malaysianpeace-keepers have been brutally killed. The nationaltrauma occasioned by the loss of lives in United Nationspeace-keeping missions gives rise to anxieties and doubts.However  I wish to assure this body that Nigeria willcontinue to demonstrate its commitment to the UnitedNations by continued participation in its peace-keepingoperations.It is in this same spirit of service that Nigeria is seekingelection to the Security Council this year. I hope thatMember States will give their valuable support to Nigeria’scandidature.In Africa  we have also made great efforts to containand resolve conflicts in our continent. Nigeria has beeninvolved in many of these efforts to bring peace to embattledareas. At the bilateral level  we hosted peace conferences ofthe parties to the conflict in the Sudan. We have  throughthe Organization of African Unity  joined other AfricanStates to monitor the cease-fire in Rwanda. In Liberia Nigeria has been the moving force in the regional effort tobring peace to that war-torn country through the MilitaryObserver Group (ECOMOG) of the Economic Communityof West African States.Because of positive developments in Liberia  we haveindicated our intention to withdraw our troops at theappropriate time. This decision was based on the successfulconclusion and acceptance of the Cotonou Agreement. Allthe parties to the conflict and the international communityaccept the Cotonou Agreement as the basis for durable peacein Liberia. If  as we hope  the accord is faithfullyimplemented  a democratically elected Government will havebeen installed in Liberia within the time-frame envisaged forthe withdrawal of our troops. While we do not  therefore contemplate a premature withdrawal  through this forum Icall upon the international community to bear in mind thatNigeria has expended and continues to expend a significantamount in the peace-keeping operation in Liberia. Urgentinternational support to the ECOMOG effort has becomecrucial. Nigeria therefore welcomes Security Councilresolution 866 (1993) of 21 September 1993  which set upthe United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL)and called upon Member States to support the peace processin Liberia by contributing to the Trust Fund beingForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 3established by the Secretary-General. Early implementationwill be absolutely necessary to sustain the process.A cheering development in our continent is taking placein South Africa  where a democratic Government is nowwithin sight. The doyen of South African nationalists Nelson Mandela  confirmed the irreversibility of the marchtowards an apartheid-free society in his statement in thisHall two weeks ago. As evidence of his conviction  hecalled for the lifting of the remaining economic sanctions onSouth Africa. I wish  in the name of Nigeria  to congratulateSouth African leaders  black and white  who in the past twoyears have shown great statesmanship in the negotiations thathave resulted in the establishment by law of the TransitionalExecutive Council.South Africa has come a long way out of its apartheid-induced isolation. The international community should assistthe South Africans in completing the process of fullintegration into the international system. To this end  thoseresponsible for the mindless violence occurring daily shouldbe unreservedly condemned. All South Africans shouldrealize that the watchful eyes of the international communitycontinue to be focused on their country.Nigeria will take immediate steps to respond toNelson Mandela’s call for economic cooperation with SouthAfrica. We shall also commence such contacts with theTransitional Executive Council  when it is physicallyestablished  as will facilitate diplomatic interaction at theappropriate time.The road to democracy and the nurturing of democraticinstitutions in Africa have not been smooth. Indeed  thedemocratic enterprise in Africa faces many problems.Africa’s economic underdevelopment and high level ofilliteracy constitute major impediments to our attainment ofdemocracy in its modern concept.But such has been our fascination with democracy as avalue deeply rooted in our culture that we in Africa havewillingly decided to face up to the challenge of putting inplace an enduring system of democratic governance in ourrespective countries. I can say confidently that this is anenterprise my country has taken seriously. Our programmeof transition from military to civilian rule has not beenwithout its difficult moments. However  we have notallowed them to deter us from our cherished goal. We aredetermined not to repeat the mistakes of our earlier attemptsto evolve a system that would preserve the corporate unityof our country. It was  therefore  to ensure that thedemocratic process could be completed within the shortestpossible period - indeed  by March 1994 - that the InterimNational Government  which I have the honour and privilegeto lead  was seen as the most viable option to ease themilitary out of power without bloodshed.We in Nigeria fully understand and appreciate theinterest and concern shown by the international communityregarding recent political events in our country. After all democratization has become a major component of theemerging new world order. We therefore appeal for theunderstanding of the international community in this difficultperiod in our nation’s history. I can assure this Assemblythat we are working very hard to find a just and generallyacceptable solution to our problem. In this connection  I amhappy to state that only yesterday I inaugurated ahigh-powered Commission of Eminent Persons to look intothe circumstances leading to the annulment of the 12 Junepresidential election and submit a report within 60 days.Nigeria has always respected the purposes andprinciples contained in the United Nations Charter and theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. Aware that thehuman person is the central subject and main beneficiary ofhuman rights  we fully believe that every citizen shouldparticipate actively  within legal limits  in the realization ofthese rights. We welcome the Vienna Declaration on humanrights and will  therefore  continue to be committed to thefreedom of all citizens and institutions that are engaged inhuman-rights activities.One of the sad consequences of human-rights violationsis the incidence of refugees and displaced persons - peoplefleeing from insecurity to safe havens  either within oroutside their national territories. Today  several countries including Nigeria  cater for the needs of millions of refugees.We urge the countries of origin of these people to create anenvironment conducive to their return. This would help toreduce the severity of the impact of refugee flows on hostnations  particularly in Africa  which are themselves facedwith excruciating economic difficulties.Nigeria notes with great satisfaction that the situation inthe Middle East has taken a definite turn for the better. The4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionhistoric signing of the peace agreement by Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is a welcome andimportant landmark. We are convinced that this will lay thefoundation for peace between Israel and the Palestinians andwill constitute an indispensable element for the peacefulresolution of the entire Middle East problem. We againcongratulate the Government of Israel and the leadership ofthe PLO  whose spirit of conciliation made the agreement areality. We also commend the Governments of Norway  theUnited States of America and the Russian Federation fortheir efforts and their encouragement and support  whichmade the peace agreement possible.The debt crisis remains the most serious obstacle to oureconomic development. The various attempts of creditorcountries to address this problem have been limited in scopeand have failed adequately to deal with the debt problem ofmiddle-income countries. Therefore  while noting withappreciation the relief provided under the Trinidad  Torontoand Houston terms  we must emphasize that the fundamentalcrisis in the economic development of developing countrieshas not been effectively addressed. The fact that the debt ofAfrican countries in 1992 amounted to $275 billion - about73 per cent of the total output of the African continent -demonstrates clearly the seriousness of the situation.Moreover  when it is borne in mind that debt-servicingobligations are estimated at about 30 per cent of the value ofour exports  the crippling effect on our economies becomesapparent. We therefore propose a dialogue involving all theparties to enable the issues to be properly addressed.The various dimensions of Africa’s economic problemsare worth repeating  as we who are at the receiving end ofthe economic dislocation of varying degrees that affects mostAfrican countries realize the necessity of continuing to drawour economic plight to the attention of the rest of the world.This matter must not be regarded lightly. The Africaneconomic crisis  as well as being a major source of theprevailing social and political turmoil in many countries ofthe region  must be seen as a serious threat to the longer-term prospects for the global economy.Let me be so bold as to say that the persistence of thecrisis is not due to inaction on the part of the AfricanGovernments concerned. On the contrary - taking theexample of my country - the truth is that our determinationto face up to the challenge of development is obvious fromthe policy reforms we have been implementing for nearlyseven years in order to restructure and revitalize theeconomy. These reforms are already yielding some positiveresults  but not of the magnitude that we regard as necessaryif there is to be a significant upturn in the economy.It would not be far-fetched to suggest that the fact thatthe economic reforms that have been put in place haveenjoyed only limited success is apparently due to lack ofadequate support from the international community tocomplement our genuine efforts to revamp our respectiveeconomies. For instance  the flow of external finance toAfrican countries still leaves much to be desired  despite theefforts made in recent years by countries like mine to ensurea climate conducive to foreign investment. We thereforeurge a change of heart on the part of our developmentpartners  as this will be mutually beneficial. We also call onthe United Nations system to mobilize its machinery fully sothat lingering African economic problems may be addressedeffectively.Today  Africa faces daunting environmental problemstoo. Desertification  drought  soil and marine erosion andshortage of fresh water are new difficulties confronting thecontinent. Two fifths of Africa’s land mass has turned intodesert. African countries continue to make efforts to arrestthis threat to our livelihood. However  we do not havesufficient resources to combat the scourge. We thereforeurge the speedy conclusion of an international convention complete with a funding mechanism  to combat drought anddesertification.In the aftermath of the cold war  appreciable progresshas been made in the field of disarmament. It is comfortingto note that  to a greater extent than during any other periodin recent history  significant efforts have been made byStates to achieve openness and transparency with regard tosecurity issues. The unilateral decision of the nuclear-weapon States to halt nuclear testing was universallyapplauded. Needless to say  therefore  we were disappointedat the breach of the moratorium that occurred a few daysago. We appeal once again to all nuclear-weapon States torefrain from resuming nuclear testing and  thereby  enhancethe prospects for the non-proliferation Treaty review andextension Conference in 1995  which will be crucial toefforts to halt nuclear proliferation.Since the creation of the United Nations 48 years ago the world in which the Organization exists has undergonemany changes. These changes are reflected in itsmembership  which  since 1945  has almost quadrupled. Thedistribution of power and influence in the world haschanged. The institutions of the United Nations cannot andshould not be immune to the changes. Indeed  in order tomaintain its relevance  the United Nations must reflect thechanges in its environment. We renew our call for a seriousreview of some of the institutions of the Organization -particularly the Security Council. We have always stressedForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 5the need to expand the membership of the Council by theadmission of additional permanent members so that allregions of the world would be represented. It is our hopethat negotiations on this crucial issue will be advancedduring this session of the General Assembly.Notwithstanding the several positive developments ofthe past few years  the world still faces many challenges. Inaddition to the continued disruption of the peace and stabilityof many States by raging internal conflicts  there areproblems that require urgent action. The spread of povertyand the increasing imbalance between the developing and thedeveloped countries are two of the more spectacular of theseproblems. We are convinced that correction of thisunacceptable situation is an attainable objective.However  the solution requires a commitment by allStates to accept and vigorously practise the concept ofinternational cooperation. My country remains an activepartner in this cooperative endeavour to make our worldsafer and more prosperous.As we look forward to the celebration  in two years’time  of the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the UnitedNations  there is in the air much optimism about the futureof the Organization. The new world order  if it is to fulfilits promise  must be constructed on the solid foundation ofthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Thus our Organization is bound to play a central role in sustaininga world of the sovereign equality of States; a world ofrespect for fundamental human rights; a world of globalinterdependence and of cooperation for development.Let all Member States demonstrate the determination toensure that our world body justifies the expectations ofhumanity."
"122",5147,"NIC",48,1993,"Allow me to congratulate you sincerely  Sir on behalf of our Latin American and Caribbean region  onyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly atits forty-eighth session.Some nations  like Nicaragua  are in transition from warto peace. We are in the process of shaking off aninheritance of 50 years of right-wing dictatorship and10 years of left-wing dictatorship. At the same time  we aremoving from a centralized economy to a social marketeconomy. Each one of these three transitions is anenormous challenge requiring fluid and timely internationalpolitical and economic cooperation.Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 11Nicaragua is a special case. My country has had toendure this triple transition. We are overcoming a post-warera  building democracy and restoring our economy’sstrength and dynamism  all in the midst of a polarizedsociety. I sincerely believe that few societies incontemporary history have had to confront so manychallenges at the same time and in such difficultcircumstances.The Governments and organizations that have beenfollowing closely the critical situation in which I found mycountry when I took office - with a gross national productsimilar to that of an economy of the 1940s and anunprecedented rate of hyperinflation - can easily understandthe magnitude of our efforts.We need to build a democracy  reconstruct a woundedsociety and compete economically with the world  all whilefollowing an economic adjustment plan that leaves us noresources for social investment. There is hunger in mycountry. There is hatred. There are many weapons. Butthere is also an absolute desire to build a society at peace.Nicaragua has been a symbol of war and of hope in thisdecade. Nicaragua should continue to be a symbol of hope.We will achieve this only with international assistance.With great effort  we have limited inflation to3.5 per cent annually  but with such difficulty that we wereable to achieve economic growth of only 0.2 per cent in1992  after eight years of a falling gross national product.I recognize that the international community has triedto understand the immense complexity of our process. In1990  the General Assembly granted Nicaragua specialtreatment  and called upon the international community toprovide us with effective and timely support. Since then my country has fulfilled all agreements and commitmentsundertaken with multilateral institutions and the internationalcommunity. We are engaged in creating the necessaryconditions so that private  national and internationalinvestment can contribute to the economic growth of thecountry and hence initiate the reconstruction process and thesustained development needed by Nicaragua.After paying for oil imports and external debt  myGovernment has received international assistance amountingto an average of less than $12 million a year  which does notcover the costs of such a difficult and complex transition.Our economy has stabilized; however  this has been a slowprocess and it does not satisfy the aspirations of animpoverished people demanding the attainment  in a shortperiod of time  of levels of well-being that they deserve.The economic problem is our greatest source ofinstability  because it creates tensions in the political andsocial environment  jeopardizing national and regionalstability. If foreign aid arrives late  if strong conditions areplaced on it or it becomes a political tool  as happened in1992 and is happening now  democracy in Nicaragua couldcollapse.My country depends on the financial support of theinternational community. Our exports are equivalent to only$250 million a year  and we need $850 million to financeour imports and service our inherited external debt.I have come to the General Assembly  to this forum offraternal nations  to ask the international community tocontinue helping Nicaragua. We need the United Nations tohelp us to maintain and to guarantee economic bilateralcooperation at current levels for my country. We needadditional resources to reactivate economic production andgrowth  to strengthen the creation of social networks and torenew the process of conciliation.We must not forget that on 25 February 1990  to thesurprise of the entire international community  we held thefirst free and participatory elections in all the history of mycountry. On that day  Nicaraguans laid down their weaponsand we all celebrated the triumph of peace  aware that wewere choosing the path of democracy  freedom  peace andrespect for human rights.When the time came to vote  every citizen voted againstdecades of violence and bloodshed  and as we voted  wethought about erasing from our minds the sad images of10 years of war  the orphans  the widows and the maimed.We voted in the determination to put an end to the tragicparade of soldiers  many of them children  combatants in awar between brothers.This was my first mandate: to generate a policy ofnational reconciliation; not an easy task in a societyaccustomed to political polarization and to confrontation.Today  three years later  I continue to be committed topursuing national dialogue as the only viable way to solveour problems. The call to achieve this nationalunderstanding has been met with solidarity and support fromcountries and international organizations.In the national dialogue  we rely on the presence  whichgreatly enhances the validity of the process  of12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionrepresentatives of the Presidents of Central America  aregion that can envision its future only in the larger prospectof integration and unity with Nicaragua.The sincere gratitude of my people and Governmentgoes to my Central American colleagues  to therepresentatives of the Secretary-General of the Organizationof American States  to the Catholic Church and to theSecretary-General of the United Nations  who havecontributed so much to peace and reconciliation inNicaragua.I especially wish to thank the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations for his support in the formation of an activegroup of donor countries  friends of Nicaragua  which within the context of the United Nations  will help usidentify our requirements for external cooperation and themeans for channelling this necessary assistance.I believe that countries in transition from war to peace which have signed international agreements to attain totalpacification  democracy and reconstruction  should haveaccess to a special fund to enable them to stand again ontheir own feet and go forward.Nicaragua and other countries in Latin America  suchas Haiti and El Salvador  need exceptional treatment becausewe cannot compete with nations that have not suffered thepain of the political  economic and social destruction causedby war.When we appeal to the international community  we doso in the conviction that the principal efforts for thereconstruction of our country are our own responsibility asNicaraguans  as the actors in our own development. TheGovernment of which I am President assumes this level ofresponsibility in order to prevent our democracy fromregressing. I reaffirm once more before the Assembly thecommitment I made to the Nicaraguan nation not to restuntil democracy has been consolidated.I shall continue to work to ensure that freedom ofexpression  assembly and association are never againrestricted. My commitment to human rights is firm andunalterable.My decision to achieve the institutionalization of thearmed forces in Nicaragua is irreversible. For that reason in addition to drastically reducing my country’s army  I amintroducing reforms and laws that will guarantee the totalsubordination of the military to civilian authority and clearlyestablish fixed terms of office in the upper echelons.We are in the process of building a democraticinstitutional structure  including a small  professional non-partisan army at the service of the nation as a whole.Similarly  we are making great efforts to disarm civiliangroups and to prevent the thousands of weapons alreadyconfiscated from being used once again to undermineNicaragua’s democratic achievements and so undermine theregional stability of Central America. Weapons confiscatedby our authorities are burned in public for all to see.In consultation with other countries of the internationalcommunity  my Government has decided to host in ourcapital city of Managua  in May 1994  the secondinternational conference on new and restored democracies.We want to share experiences  closely examine the structuresof the new democracies and adopt proposals that willcontribute to their self-betterment.The United Nations must respond positively to thechanges in the world today. Nicaragua supports recognitionby the United Nations of the rights of the Republic of China -Taiwan. We believe it is only right to recognize thefundamental rights of the 21 million people who live on thatterritory. Nicaragua firmly supports this noble initiative.Finally  I share the joy of all our countries at thehistoric signing of the declaration of principles between theGovernment of Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization. This agreement clearly demonstrates thatpeace is possible when the will for dialogue and negotiationexists. It should serve as one of the great lessons of ourtimes and a source of new hope for global peace.We Nicaraguans trust in God  in the solidarity offriendly nations and in cooperation by internationalorganizations; the generous  fraternal  sincere hand theystretch out to us will enable the Nicaraguan people toachieve the new society of which it dreamt when it voted inour general elections on 25 February 1990.We in Nicaragua know that the century that is comingto an end leaves us some hard lessons. Yet it allows us toface with courage the great challenges that will enable us toconsolidate a world society inspired by peace  freedom andprogress. For that reason  on the threshold of the newcentury  I would like to reaffirm  in the name of theNicaraguan people  our deep commitment to contribute tothe development of a more prosperous and more just worldorder. That is the commitment I make to democracy and toall the peoples of the world."
"123",5194,"NLD",48,1993,"First of all  pleaseconvey to His Excellency  Ambassador Insanally  mycongratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly.This session of the General Assembly is being held at apoint in time in which the United Nations is being asked toplay a constructive role in many fields. The onerous task ofhelping to respond to this challenge rests on his capableshoulders. I should like to wish him every success in histask and I pledge the full support of the delegation of theKingdom of the Netherlands.The world is balancing between great hope andimmense suffering. Walls have tumbled not only in Europe.In the Middle East two courageous leaders  Prime MinisterRabin and Chairman Arafat  have set out on the road toreconciliation between their people. In South AfricaMr. Mandela and President De Klerk showed similar couragein breaking with the past and ushering in a new democraticSouth Africa. At the same time  we see violence of manykinds raking the face of the Earth. From Angola to Bosniavillages are being destroyed and innocent people areslaughtered in cold blood.The future of Russia as well is crucial to our hopes. Ademocratic Russia at peace with itself and its neighbours isa major element of international stability. In Russia  too  wesee a courageous statesman trying to break with the past:President Boris Yeltsin. I join many others in expressing myfull support for his efforts to consolidate democracy inRussia.The end of the cold war created a historic opportunityto shape a more just and peaceful world. History will judgeus severely if we let this opportunity slip through our hands.Strengthening international peace and security involvesa broad range of efforts. It is now widely recognized that""security"" cannot be viewed in military or political-militaryterms alone. A broader definition is called for. Indeed  lastyear’s summit meeting of the Security Council emphasizedthat non-military sources of instability in the economic social  humanitarian and ecological fields can be threats topeace and security as well. The traditional distinctionbetween conflicts between States and conflicts within Statesis also becoming blurred. Bloodshed within a State tends sooner or later  to spill across national borders. This  ofcourse  raises the issue of sovereignty. How do we definesovereignty at a time of increasing interdependence andincreasing mutual vulnerability? Sovereignty is certainly animportant principle of international law. But this principlecan never have been intended to shield from the outsideworld dictators who massacre their own people. Nor can itbe intended to allow the perpetuation of large-scale sufferingand death in a State that has collapsed into anarchy. Attimes the international community can indeed have a moralduty to intervene. And at times it can be necessary for theUnited Nations to take over the de facto exercise ofsovereignty in such a shattered State to allow it to be rebuilt.We must hope that this will succeed in Somalia. We cantake heart from current developments in Cambodia  whichprove that such ambitious ventures can succeed.A number of recent resolutions of the Security Councilhave broken new ground by extending internationalresponsibility to encompass the plight of individual countriessuch as Somalia and Bosnia. Thus the definition of whatconstitutes a threat to international peace and security hasgradually been widened.In his recent speech in Quebec  Secretary-GeneralBoutros Boutros-Ghali discussed the issue of ""conflictsituations within nations"". He said:""It is these new conflicts which are mostthreatening to international peace today and whichare most damaging to the rights of individuals"".On that occasion the Secretary-General called for ""anew diplomacy for democracy and human rights"". I believe22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionthat this idea is a valuable addition to our ""Agenda forPeace"".Let me mention here the United Nations Conference onHuman Rights  which opened up new possibilities forimproving the protection of human rights. After a difficultstart  the outcome of the Conference was certainly gratifying.The Final Document contains important recommendationsfor further steps  which should now be implemented.Thus  the Kingdom of the Netherlands would like tounderscore the urgent appeal of the Conference to theSecretary-General and the General Assembly to increasedrastically the funding of the United Nations Centre forHuman Rights. It is of crucial importance that in the courseof this session of the General Assembly the post of highcommissioner for human rights be created  and the broadoutline of the mandate established. This session will alsoprovide us with an opportunity to tackle one of the mostheinous categories of human rights violations - that of gravewar crimes - through the establishment of the InternationalWar Crimes Tribunal. The Kingdom of the Netherlands with its rich tradition in the field of international law  isproud to have been asked to host the Tribunal in The Hague.The increasing responsibilities that the United Nationsis called upon to shoulder emphasize the twin requirementsof legitimacy and effectiveness. This brings us to the heartof the debate on enlargement of the Security Council.Clearly  we must be careful not to jeopardize thedecision-making ability of the Security Council by makingit unwieldy. However  I would favor extension of theCouncil by the inclusion of a few major countries  providedthat they were willing and able to carry the share ofcollective responsibility that went with their membership.The ""Agenda for Peace"" invites us to take a broaderview of the task of maintaining peace and security. Itrightly stresses the need for early warning and early actionwith regard to a crisis; or - even better - preventive action.Developments in the former Yugoslavia and in other troublespots of the world have once again confirmed that the longera crisis is allowed to fester  the more difficult it is to bringit under control  and the higher the cost of such action.I believe that  in this light  we should try to rethink theinterrelationship of the various instruments of crisismanagement. Diplomatic efforts  economic sanctions andmilitary pressure should not necessarily be viewed assequential but  rather  as an integrated set of instruments.Peacemaking  peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-buildingrequire the full range of United Nations instruments including those of the humanitarian and socio-economicsectors.The enormous increase in the number and scope ofUnited Nations peace-keeping operations confronts us allwith a daunting task. Moreover  in many cases theenvironment in which these operations take place haschanged: whereas  previously  peace-keeping operationstended to be conducted in a benign environment  where allparties benefited from the implementation of a limitedmandate  now peace-keepers often operate in a hostileclimate  where one or more parties frown upon the UnitedNations presence and the Organization’s mandate. Thismeans that many operations these days are fraught literallywith physical danger for United Nations personnel - civilianas well as military - and that privileges and immunities areoften violated. No longer does the blue flag automaticallycommand respect  and this directly affects the credibility ofthe United Nations. Consequently  mandates now tend to bestronger than before  and often they are explicitly basedupon Chapter VII of the Charter.The changing character of peace-keeping operationsrequires personnel with different qualifications. Well-trainedsoldiers used to be able to do the job; today we require alsospecialized units in the field of logistics  staff officers withexperience in multinational operations  mine-clearing experts and so on. On the civilian side  police officers  electoralexperts  administrators and human-rights specialists areindispensable for integrated operations.Increasing recourse to the United Nations  particularlywhen it comes to initiating peace operations  is pushing theUnited Nations to the limits of its organizational andfinancial resources. This means that in the future the UnitedNations will have to rely more on regional organizations andstructures to carry out peace operations and other missions.The Charter makes provision for this  and theSecretary-General has advanced a similar proposal in his""Agenda for Peace"". On one hand  this will relieve theUnited Nations of some of its commitments; on the other  itwill enable regional organizations or structures with greaterfirst-hand knowledge of the conflicts in their parts of theworld to contribute more effectively to resolution of theunderlying problems.There are no standard formulas which dictate how theseinterlocking institutions should interact  and each case willhave to be looked at individually to determine which formof cooperation is most suitable.Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 23The Kingdom of the Netherlands has consistentlyendeavoured to make a high-grade contribution to effectivepeace operations  to which we feel committed as a Memberof the United Nations. The present reorganization of theNetherlands armed forces is specifically geared to enablingour country to participate even more broadly  speedily andeffectively in future peace-keeping operations.The Netherlands believes that adequate preparation andefficient supervision are crucial to the success of peaceoperations and has accordingly made a number of militaryofficials available to the United Nations.As peace operations increase in number and scope  sodoes the need for support from the Secretariat. TheSecretariat should be able to expand - and to contract - inproportion to the need for peace-keeping tasks. Wheneverexpansion is required it should take place at an early stage.The preparation  planning and budgeting that precede theactual operation are precisely the elements that are essentialto its success. The budgets currently proposed to theGeneral Assembly for setting up new peace operations areinadequate. This not only makes it difficult for the MemberStates to reach decisions on the funding of operations  butalso indicates that  at the time the budgets are presented there is no complete picture of the way the operation is to beset up. Obviously  if the number of peace operationsdecreases  the additional staff at the Secretariat will also nolonger be necessary. What I am suggesting here is that anyreinforcement be temporary  flexible and prompt.Apart from proper planning and training  adequatestaffing and a satisfactory level of supervision - all of whichare indispensable to the success of a peace operation - it isimportant that United Nations peace forces be on the spot assoon as possible after the decision to deploy them has beenmade. Otherwise  there is a danger that hostilities will beresumed and thus that the basis for successfulimplementation of the Security Council mandate will havedisappeared before the forces are in position. Speed istherefore of the essence if the use of greater force is to beavoided.This is possible only if there is a clear picture of theforces that can be made available to the United Nations atshort notice. In this connection  the Netherlands welcomesthe formation of the stand-by forces planning team  which isengaged in formulating a concept and drawing up aninventory of rapid deployment forces. The Netherlands hasundertaken to communicate by the end of 1993 which Dutchunits could be eligible for designation as stand-by forces.The final decision concerning possible deployment of troopswill of course always rest with the Netherlands Government.The growing demands on the United Nations systemcan be met only if standards of management  administrationand accountability are high. The responsibility fordetermining and maintaining these standards lies first andforemost with ourselves as Member States. It is ourresponsibility to indicate clear priorities  to ensureconsistency in the decisions taken by different UnitedNations commissions and governing bodies  and to providethe financial resources required to meet agreed priorities.Much criticism levelled against the Organizationindicates a genuine need to improve the functioning andmanagement of the Secretariat. Part of this criticism has itsroots in the way Member States discharge theirresponsibilities: the failure of Governments to set priorities the adoption of resolutions with unclear objectives and thefailure to pay assessed contributions cannot be blamed onthe Secretariat.I am convinced that the vast majority of United Nationsstaff members are dedicated and loyal international civilservants. We owe them our respect. In areas ranging fromthe direct provision of health care to non-proliferation ofnuclear weapons  many of them work under difficultconditions  some even risking their lives.But despite the quality and commitment of its staff  theSecretariat should take a long hard look at its ownmanagement structure. Key phrases such as management byobjectives  transparency and accountability must becomehousehold words in United Nations vocabulary. Linemanagers must be given greater responsibility and should beheld accountable for the attainment of predeterminedobjectives.Moreover  the Secretariat should respond to criticism ina more satisfactory manner: first of all  by ensuring thatjustified criticism is acted upon and that corrective measuresare taken without delay; and  secondly  by promptly refutingfalse allegations. In short  the public relations of the UnitedNations need improvement.The Secretary-General has taken several commendableinitiatives to restructure the Secretariat. The first changeswere introduced in the political sectors  and this year thesocial and economic sectors were reorganized. Thisrestructuring has provided a solid basis for improvingeffectiveness and coordination. But further measures arerequired. It is important to maintain the momentum and to24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionprovide clear perspectives for United Nations staff members:they should not be kept in the dark about their future statusand about the direction of reform. Lingering uncertainty hasaffected staff morale and thus staff effectiveness.I have already said that Member States have aresponsibility to provide financial resources for agreedpriorities and mandated activities. The United Nationscannot be run on a shoestring. Year after year theOrganization suffers from long delays in the receipt ofassessed contributions. As a result  mandated activities canbe implemented only in part or after substantial delay. Inthe area of peace-keeping  troop contributors unfortunatelyhave to be prepared and able to provide long-term advancefinancing for peace-keeping operations.This lack of discipline among Member States forces theSecretariat to spend a great deal of energy attempting tosolve incessant liquidity problems. The painful paradox isthat the Secretariat’s relative success at shoestring budgetingseems to contribute to a further deterioration in paymentdiscipline among Member States. Moreover  the burden ofkeeping the United Nations in business now lies unfairlywith those Member States who make their paymentspromptly and in full.A number of Member States appear to make partialpayments as an expression of their dissatisfaction withcertain aspects of the Organization’s work. The UnitedNations does not serve an à la carte menu: dissatisfactionshould be voiced in debate and by force of argument  not bywithholding assessed contributions.We shall be considering the recommendations of theVolcker-Ogata report on the financing of the United Nationssystem during this session. The merits of many of therecommendations are obvious  but generally speaking theycan only help to alleviate the immediate problems; they donot go to the heart of the matter. Ultimately  the onlysolution to the Organization’s financial problems - and thiscannot be stated often enough - is prompt and full paymentof assessed contributions by all Member States.While we insist that Member States meet their financialobligations  we also expect the Secretariat to use its financialresources in an efficient and effective manner. SomeMember States have suggested the establishment of newfinancial control mechanisms. These proposals may havemerits  but we should not lose sight of the fact that a numberof control mechanisms already exist. I believe that a criticalreview of the functioning of the present mechanisms is inorder before we decide upon new structures.But auditing alone is insufficient. The structure of theOrganization must be such that financial and administrativemismanagement is prevented. Line managers  for example must be held accountable for budgets under their control. Inrecent years the Netherlands delegation has presented severalideas aimed at the improvement of the management ofUnited Nations programmes  and these have subsequentlybeen adopted by the General Assembly.In addition  I advocate greater cost-awareness  not onlyamong United Nations staff but also  and especially  amongMember States. It is relatively simple to request theSecretary-General to undertake new activities  call additionalmeetings or produce reports on a variety of issues. But wemust ask ourselves each time whether these requests meet areal need  as they compete for strained financial and staffresources.Although the resources of the United Nations arelimited  genuine priorities must be met. In this respect  atthis session the General Assembly will face a particularlydifficult task. It will have to determine which activities willreceive priority under the regular budget for 1994 and 1995.As new priorities emerge  a number of activities will have tobe reduced or even eliminated altogether. We have to livewithin our means. The Netherlands believes that additionalresources are needed most to strengthen the capacity of theUnited Nations in the area of human rights  to improve theSecretariat’s capacity to plan and manage peace-keepingactivities and to ensure the effective coordination ofhumanitarian and emergency operations.So far I have addressed a number of conditions thatwill have to be fulfilled if the United Nations is to respondeffectively to the new challenges confronting it. A soundfinancial basis  effective management and the availability ofqualified personnel  both at the Secretariat and in the contextof peace operations in the field  are the materialrequirements which must be met. However  no less crucialis the determination actually to implement the resolutionsadopted by the Security Council. Decision-making in theCouncil should reflect the combined political will of itsmembers - acting on behalf of the United Nations MemberStates - actually to translate their words into action wherenecessary  once the material conditions have been fulfilled.Too often in the recent past  there has been a failure to takedecisive action despite a declared willingness to do so whensuch action was both necessary and justified.Irrespective of the detrimental effect this can have onpeace operations themselves  it can also cause irreparabledamage in the long term to the standing and credibility ofForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 25the United Nations as a whole. Let me be clear about this:I am not advocating resort to military action at the drop ofa hat. But if the Security Council draws a line and says thatif the line is crossed military action will be taken  it must beprepared to fulfil this pledge. If such a course provesimpossible  then the mandate was not adequately tailored tothe situation. If  on the other hand  the mandate is adequatebut the Council lacks the will to carry it out  its apparentdetermination is nothing but an empty threat. Either way the credibility of the Organization is dealt a severe blow. Ifthis occurs too often  we run the risk that the new decisiveUnited Nations of the post-cold-war era will become a papertiger  making decisions that it cannot or will not put intopractice. This must not be allowed to happen.Now  more than ever  we need a decisive UnitedNations and a firm commitment on the part of the MemberStates. The United Nations needs Member States that paytheir dues  provide the Organization with the necessaryhuman resources and have the political will to carry out thedecisions which they have collectively arrived at. TheMember States need a United Nations which is able toperform those tasks  which operates efficiently andeffectively and which can be made accountable for theresources entrusted to it. It is the wish of the Kingdom ofthe Netherlands that this forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly will bring us closer to achieving these aims."
"124",5239,"NOR",48,1993,"It gives me greatpleasure to congratulate Ambassador Insanally on hiselection to the high office of President of the GeneralAssembly.I should also like to welcome the new Members of ourOrganization: Andorra  Eritrea  the Czech Republic Monaco  the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  andSlovakia.The historic and courageous breakthrough in the MiddleEast tells us that even the deepest trench can be bridged.Conflict has tormented that entire region for most of thiscentury. It has brought super-Powers to the brink of war.It has placed enormous burdens on the United Nations itself.It has deprived families of their dear ones and held peopleunder the ominous spell of fear.Now we must seize the moment. Now we are at aturning point for the United Nations as well. Now we mustanswer the clarion call and mobilize our collective politicaland financial resources to help move the peace processforward.The time has come to let the divisive  acrimoniousMiddle East debates and decisions of the past fade intohistory. Israeli and Palestinian leaders have made reality ofthe seemingly impossible. We would fail abysmally in ourduties should we falter now in our efforts to support theprocess of prying peace out of the knot of conflict  a processwhich men and women of vision have dared to think  daredto do.Due to our long-standing relations with the parties  bothour friendship with Israeli leaders and the mutual trust wehave established with the Palestine Liberation Organization(PLO)  Norway was privileged to contribute to thesedefining dramatic events.In this spirit  we shall go to Washington on 1 October committed to help in building peace. For the peace processto succeed  it must be consolidated and stabilized by theeconomic development the two parties have agreed toundertake together.The fruits of peace must become tangible and real forthe women  men and children of Gaza and the West Bank.The process of implementation could change the perspectivesand expectations of the parties  convert interdependence intoa sense of community  and make possible solutions andvisions which today seem beyond reach.The economic situation in Gaza and on the West Bankis dramatic and calls for immediate and extensive economicaid. Now we must respond to the just but unfulfilledaspirations of the Palestinians: for job opportunities and forschools  hospitals and universities. Now we must assist inbuilding houses  roads and water supplies  and makereconciliation pay  so that new generations of Israelis andPalestinians may grow up without fear  as good neighbours in a life of dignity.A period of healing is needed in which all peace-lovingcountries  the United Nations itself  the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  other financial institutions and the EuropeanCommunity join financially - and substantially - in acoordinated  immediate investment-for-peace programme. Ipledge and confirm that Norway’s assistance will besubstantial and that we shall be honoured to play acontinuing political role should the parties so desire.A period of renewal and change must also embraceSouth Africa and our relations with that country. SouthAfrica is in desperate need of peace and reconciliation.Fixing a date for democratic elections in April next year isa beacon of hope that the post-Apartheid system will finallygain the democratic legitimacy which the South AfricanGovernment cannot claim today.Until the day when black South Africans can enjoy thehuman rights of which they have been oppressively deprived until the day when violence is ended and joint politicalcontrol has been established over the military and policeforces  until that day South Africa will remain a country inimperative transition.The outside world and the United Nations must  intime  recognize the potential of post-apartheid South Africa -at peace with itself and endowed with immensely richnatural and human resources - for the whole region ofsouthern Africa. Education and training are needed forgenerations which are now ready to assume an equal role inthe economy of their country. We must now act forcefully encouraging proponents of peace and transition  andForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 21discourage the shrill voices of hatred and interposition sothat one day - soon - the South African man and womanmay be free at last.We must never lose hope that peace can be achieved.But our hope has been severely tested by the protractedatrocities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There seems to be nolimit to the brutality that human beings are capable ofmobilizing in the service of a nationalistic goal. Such actshave been committed in the name of a doctrine - thedoctrine of the ethnic state - and thus prolong the sinisterexistence of doctrine as a source of war and contention inthis century.Ethnic nationalism is a threat to peace and stabilityeverywhere. The ethnic mosaic of Europe does not lenditself to such reduction. A doctrine of the ethnic state is aprescription for war. Our task is to build communitieswhich include rather than exclude and to make allmulti-ethnic regions safe refuges of enlightened diversity.A military victory in which aggression appears to payin Bosnia will be noted in those parts of the world wheredifferent nationalities are sharing territory and politicalorganization. In the former Soviet Union alone  ethnictensions are reaching critical mass or have already erupted as in Nagorny-Karabakh and Abkhazia.The authority of the United Nations is seriouslyundermined if there is vacillation on where and how to usethe ""Blue Helmets"". We should admit that there have beenfailures along the way and learn from experience. Our mainthrust must be to aim for a negotiated solution based onknown elements. The alternative to a negotiated settlementis continued bloodshed. The alternative to peace is war.Norway fully supports the efforts of Thorvald Stoltenbergand David Owen. All parties must now cease hostilities andallow time for the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina toheal so that we can start slowly to build a foundation forpeace. Let us be inspired by the Israelis and thePalestinians  and let us all send a message to the parties inBosnia: enough! Peace is possible.The time for a settlement is long overdue. Thesituation is already disastrous  and another winter of war isbound to take a severe toll of lives. Norway is among themajor providers of humanitarian assistance to the area.International attention is focused on the terrible ordeal of theMuslims  but there are Croats and Serbs who suffer greatlyas well. We should be even-handed in our humanitarianassistance  making a clear distinction between  on the onehand  warlords and war criminals and  on the other  those onall sides who are without a voice and without a choice  thosewho are victimized and whose only hope is the assistancewe can provide from the outside.It is absolutely imperative to improve on thecoordination and cooperation between United Nationspeace-keeping operations  United Nations humanitarianagencies and non-governmental humanitarian organizations.Somalia is an obvious case in point. For Norway it is apriority issue to move such coordination forward. We shallconvene a conference before the end of the year with theaim of improving our capacity to organize real peaceoperations incorporating both humanitarian and militarytasks.We should all support our Secretary-General’sproposals for a necessary strengthening of the Department ofPeace-keeping Operations. The management organizationfor United Nations peace-keeping operations here in NewYork is manifestly inadequate. The result is that troop-contributing nations exercise direct control  which radicallyreduces coherence and effectiveness. The situation isaggravated by the Security Council’s propensity to makeambitious decisions but fail to provide the Secretariat withthe means to implement them. Failing to provide financial human and technological resources undermines both peaceand the authority of the United Nations.We know what needs to be done. We must focus onthe following: There must be realistic mandates for newUnited Nations peace-keeping operations whose goals andmeans must be clearly defined. We must have properstand-by arrangements for troops and equipment fromMember States  and Norway is prepared to contribute inconcrete terms to a collective stand-by effort. We needimproved training and analysis of past experience; ourtraining facilities should be linked in a consortium for UnitedNations peace-keeping training. There must be animmediate and substantial increase in the United Nationsreserve fund for peace-keeping; moreover  a unified peace--keeping budget must be introduced which allows theSecretary-General to obligate at least 20 per cent of theestimated cost of peace-keeping operations once they havebeen approved by the Security Council. We need improvedfinancing for peace-keeping operations and financialdiscipline among Member States.Indeed  the whole financial situation of the UnitedNations is disgraceful. As the eighth-largest contributor tothe United Nations system in absolute terms and by far thelargest in per capita terms  we find it exceedingly difficult to22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionunderstand how so many countries fail to honour theirobligations.The Secretary-General has said that ""the Organizationlives from hand to mouth."" (Statement by the Secretary-General to the Fifth Committee  26 August 1993). Thepermanent members of the Security Council have a specialresponsibility. But we should also ask ourselves if countriesshould be eligible at all for the Security Council if they havenot paid their contributions.The post-cold-war patterns of risks and uncertaintieshave brought about a wider recognition and understanding ofthe need to address the serious economic and socialinequalities in the world and their implications for globalsecurity. Core issues such as environment and developmentused to be seen as side issues by the prime movers ofinternational affairs. There is a new hope that this could bechanging.The Secretary-General points out in his report thatwithout sustainable development peace cannot long bemaintained and that political  social  educational andenvironmental factors must all be part of development.Unsustainable production and consumption patterns stillprevail and can be counteracted only by changing how andin which fields our economies continue to grow. If currentforms of development were employed  a further fivefold totenfold boost in economic activity would be required overthe next 50 years to meet the needs and aspirations of 10billion people.Currently  the vast majority who are poor make only aminimal claim to our natural resources  while the morevoracious North is consuming in a few decades what it hastaken the planet billions of years to accumulate. TheNorwegian Minister of the Environment raised the issue ofproduction and consumption patterns in the industrial part ofthe world at the first session of the Commission onSustainable Development. Early next year Norway will hosta meeting on these issues as a contribution to the nextsession of the Commission.The rapid population growth in many parts of the worldis a ticking time-bomb. Ninety per cent of this increase istaking place in developing countries  many of which areunable to feed their present populations. We may soon befacing new famine of a magnitude dwarfing even Malthus’gloomiest predictions. There may be mass migration and thedestabilization of countries and regions as people competefor ever-scarcer land and water resources.The International Conference on Population andDevelopment  to take place in Cairo in September 1994 must address the complex root causes of the populationexplosion.The agreements reached at the United NationsConference on Environment and Development in Rio lastyear  however imperfect  set a sound  ambitious agenda foraction to ensure sustainable development. Yet  I regret tosay  the momentum generated in Rio has been allowed tolose some of its force.The world will not forget  and our children will longremember  that the industrialized countries committedthemselves in Rio to providing new and additional fundingto combat climate change and safeguard biological diversity.So far  however  contributions have been small-scale.The aid fatigue continues despite enormous needs anda more fertile ground for development in countries whichhave made sacrifices and taken the bitter but crucialmedicine of structural adjustment  and despite the reductionof military budgets to levels where countries again should bedeemed creditworthy.Far  far more serious  and not only for the developingworld  is the gambling with the Uruguay Round holding theprospects of global free trade hostage to narrow nationalinterests. For most countries  strongly dependent as they areon international trade  an agreement  even if each and everyprovision may not be ideal  is absolutely necessary. I urgethe major parties to live up to the expectations created at theGroup of 7 meeting in Tokyo that before the end of the yearthe deal will be closed.Environment and trade must be the next agenda item.We should be more outspoken about conflicting interests andmore receptive to the fact that we do not have the option togo our separate ways.We must develop a sound  scientific basis for managingour natural resources in a sustainable way. In a politically culturally and socially diverse world  science and knowledgecan be the only basis for sound and lasting cooperation inthis field.And while we reduce our strain on finite naturalresources  the environmental agenda is constantly widenedby the unveiling of the ecocide almost committed by theformer Communist countries.Forty-eighth session - 27 September l993 23The nuclear threat is not confined to that inherent in theremaining arsenals of nuclear weapons. Increasingly  oursecurity is threatened by the enormous deposits of nuclearwaste on land and at sea. Large-scale internationalcooperation is required to eliminate this threat.Nuclear weapons have not disappeared  and the capacityto make them is broadly present. Proliferation of weaponsof mass destruction and the means of their deliveryconstitutes perhaps the greatest threat to international peaceand stability. It is a matter of utmost priority to broaden anddeepen the non-proliferation regime to comprise a broaderpattern of commitments and cooperative behaviour. In thisconnection  Norway urges the nuclear-weapon States toredouble their efforts to conclude a comprehensive test-bantreaty. We expect that they will refrain from any testingwhile negotiations proceed. We also urge North Korea tosubmit fully to the safeguard regime of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency and to adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.Development without democracy and respect for humanrights will never be sustainable. Democracy is indispensablefor promoting and upholding respect for human rights  forsocial and economic development  for peace and security and for liberating the human creativity which is so vital toany social and economic development.I urge this Assembly to create the post of highcommissioner for human rights and to agree on a quantumleap in the allocation of resources for the United Nationshuman-rights activities. This is a modest price to pay forstrengthening the basis for peace and stability.The lines between foreign and domestic policies havelong since vanished. Narrow-minded forms of nationalismwill not serve us. We must move towards an inclusiveenlargement where the powerful are just and the weaksecure. Only the United Nations can provide the frameworkof a better-organized world  which today is too fragmentedand uncoordinated. More and more causes are common  as indeed  is our whole future.The Middle East breakthrough gives us the hope that nochallenge is too difficult and the belief that we can makethis world a civilized place."
"125",5285,"NPL",48,1993,"I have the honour to conveyto the General Assembly greetings from the people andGovernment of Nepal and the best wishes of His MajestyKing Birenda Bir Bikram Shah Dev for the success of itsforty-eighth session.As I stand before members today  my thoughts go backto 1960  when the first elected Prime Minister of Nepal  thelate B.P. Koirala  addressed the Assembly and declared thatthe foreign policy of Nepal was inspired by the purposes andForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 11principles of the United Nations. He said then that Nepallooked upon the Organization as an instrument for promotingpeace and justice among nations.The late Prime Minister’s visit to the United Nationswas an event of historic significance for Nepal. Arevolutionary transformation had then taken place in mycountry. As a result  a conscious and coherent foreignpolicy  with centrality given to the principles of the Charterof the United Nations  had started to take shape.Similar revolutionary changes again took place in mycountry in 1990  after a gap of more than three decades. Inaccordance with the wishes of our people  multipartydemocracy has been restored in Nepal. Now there is aconstitutional guarantee of human rights and fundamentalfreedoms. As the second elected Prime Minister to addressthis body  after 33 years  I must say that this moment has adeep personal overtone for me.Restoration of multiparty democracy and respect forfundamental human rights does not necessarily mean that wehave solved all our problems. The expectations of thepeople are naturally high  but the means at our disposal areextremely limited.Faced with such problems  my Government has beenmaking every effort to ensure a better standard of living forour people in larger freedom. Our development plans arebased on the premise that it is the individual citizen and notthe State which has the right to development. Along witheconomic liberalization  we are pursuing a people-orienteddevelopment policy focused on poverty alleviation. Toachieve our goals we have increased investments in human-priority areas. Given the enormous constraints upon us ranging from lack of resources to the high cost ofinfrastructure  a shortage of skilled personnel andinstitutional deficiencies  our problems are daunting. Welook forward to greater understanding from donor countriesand multilateral agencies in helping us to implement ourpeople-oriented development programmes  in upgrading localskills and in building the capacity to accelerate humandevelopment.The foreign policy of Nepal is guided by the objectiveof ensuring its sovereignty  political independence andnational security while promoting international peace andcooperation. Inspired by the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations  the policy of non-alignment  and respect forhuman rights  we seek friendship and cooperation with allcountries of the world  and in particular with our neighbours.We have reason to be satisfied with the excellent relationswe enjoy with the countries in our immediateneighbourhood. We are partners with our friends in SouthAsia in an effort to forge a mutually beneficial scheme ofcooperation for the welfare of our people under the aegis ofthe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.With the sudden end of the cold war the world is at thethreshold of a new era of shared responsibility for globalpeace and development. The post-cold-war world is verymuch in need of order  but it is a world that cannot beordered by military and economic Powers alone. At thistime of historic transition  political leadership in all countriesmust show a higher order of statesmanship. It is time toshed old prejudices and parochialism. We should be able topool the best of every civilization and culture for the greatergood of mankind.Changes in international relations have also createdopportunities to devise new partnership in globalresponsibility. The world today is poised to consider newapproaches to international law based not on unilateralismbut on multilateralism. The United Nations is anorganization of the powerful and the weak  the large and thesmall  the wealthy and the poor  each contributing its shareto the common interest. It is in the interest of all to makethe United Nations an effective and influential agent ofconstructive change in a turbulent world.If the United Nations is to fulfil its Charter obligationsit must deal with the root causes of conflicts and instability.The mechanisms and processes at its disposal for achievingthat goal must be strengthened and refined. In this context there are four areas which demand immediate attention:first  international cooperation to combat poverty; secondly strengthening of the role of the United Nations in themaintenance of international peace and security; thirdly progressive reduction and finally elimination of weapons ofmass destruction and  fourthly  universalization of humanrights.Democracy and human rights are easily eroded whenwidespread poverty prevails. Poverty undermines humandignity  contributes to environmental degradation andundermines the cohesion of a society. It also poses a lastingthreat to peace and stability. The search for collectivesecurity cannot  therefore  be separated from the sustainedefforts to improve the economic and social conditions ofpeoples everywhere. Agenda 21  adopted at the RioConference on Environment and Development  is acomprehensive blueprint for sustainable development. Toturn that vision into reality there is an urgent need for12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionresumption of the North-South dialogue and for economiccooperation between developing nations.The President returned to the Chair.In this context  I look forward to theSecretary-General’s agenda for development. We sincerelyhope that an agenda for development will form the basis ofaccelerating international cooperation to the mutual benefitof developed and developing countries alike. The upcomingInternational Conference on Population and Development the World Summit for Social Development and the FourthWorld Conference on Women should also be occasions tofocus on the human dimensions of socio-economic problems.In speaking of social and economic issues  I recall theinitiative taken by countries of South Asia under the aegis ofthe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation towork together for the cause of children. That initiativeprovided the major motivation for the holding of the WorldSummit for Children. The mid-decade review in 1995 mustbe an occasion to evaluate the implementation of thepromises the international community made to children atthe World Summit. Despite conflicting demands on ourlimited resources  we in Nepal are allocating an increasingportion of our national budget to child and maternal healthand welfare and on other basic human-services areas. Weare in favour of the proposal for matching resourceallocations by donor countries for such national initiatives.The dramatic increase in the demands on andheightened expectations of the United Nations is nowheremore compelling than in the area of peace and security.With experience spanning over 35 years in United Nationsmissions  Nepal welcomes the expansion in the mandates ofpeace-keeping operations. The recent successes of themissions in El Salvador and Cambodia are testimony to thepotential of a United Nations operation with a clearlydefined and practicable mandate. The joint venture of theUnited Nations and the Organization of American States inHaiti is breaking newer ground in international cooperationto restore a democratically elected Government and toprotect and promote human rights.Without minimizing the enormity of the problems theUnited Nations has to take into account in Somalia  I feelthat the emphasis on military action will overshadow thelarger goal of the mission in that country. I urge theredoubling of efforts to seek lasting political solutions to theproblems in Somalia.I appeal to the parties concerned in Bosnia andHerzegovina to respond immediately to the successiveresolutions of the Security Council and halt the senselesscarnage of innocent people. The continuing tragedy in theterritory of the former Yugoslavia presents a test-case forviable cooperation between the United Nations and regionalorganizations in the maintenance of peace and security.Nepal will continue to support the further developmentof preventive diplomacy by the Secretary-General and theSecurity Council. In the maintenance of peace and security the implementation of enforcement measures under theCharter should be the step of last resort. It should be theexception to rather than the rule of the game. The realstrength of collective security lies in the ability to implementthe provisions of the Charter relating to peaceful settlementof disputes.The grounds for the intervention of the SecurityCouncil have also raised questions of consistency. As theprincipal organ entrusted with the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  the Council must act in aneven-handed and impartial manner and must be perceived asdoing so.The recent comments of the Secretary-General on thefinancial situation of the Organization should be a cause ofconcern to all. Investments in peace-keeping  peacemakingand preventive diplomacy are investments in collectivestability. It is not possible for the United Nations to play itsrole without adequate resources.Along with other non-aligned countries  Nepal hasalways subscribed to the call for a more active UnitedNations role in arms control and disarmament. Since mutualfear is the source of any arms race  confidence-buildingmeasures must be seriously pursued in order to achieve thegoals of disarmament. Nations should pursue a culture ofensuring security at the lowest possible level of armaments.Successes in bilateral negotiations on nuclear weapons conventional forces in Europe and chemical weapons provethat it is a feasible goal.Nepal deems it extremely significant that all fivenuclear-weapon States are now parties to the nuclearnon-proliferation Treaty. We have long advocated an earlyconclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Meaningfulprogress in this area will have important implications for thereview and extension Conference on the non-proliferationTreaty.Forty-eighth session - 13 October l993 13Protection of human rights has emerged as an importantfactor in the development of friendly relations among States.The United Nations must spare no effort in establishing aninternational norm of human rights. The World Conferenceon Human Rights was a major step in this direction. Humanrights cannot be secure without a universal conscience on thepart of all peoples to uphold each other’s rights in fullunderstanding of the just demands of the individual  thecommunity  the State and the international order. Humanrights cannot be secured unless there is an absolute freedomfrom fear from any source. There is a direct correlationbetween the status of human rights  the democratic processand an evolution of a culture of peaceful settlement ofdisputes. The threat to peace is the greatest when humanrights are denied.The world is at a vital turning-point. The old order hascome to an end while the new has yet to take shape. Whilesome old contradictions persist and new ones appear  someunexpected bright areas have also dawned. Nepal welcomesthe agreement reached by the negotiating parties in SouthAfrica to hold an election in April 1994. We share the deepconcern of the international community over the continuedviolence which threatens the peaceful transition of SouthAfrica to a non-racial democratic society.Nepal has long enjoyed friendship with both the Israeliand the Palestinian peoples. We welcome the Declaration ofPrinciples as well as the exchange of letters of mutualrecognition between Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO). The statesmanship shown by theleaders of Israel and the PLO promises a new beginning forthe Middle East and  indeed  the world. We earnestly hopethat this historic breakthrough will facilitate the search for acomprehensive and lasting solution of the Middle Eastproblem.As I come towards the end of my statement  I wish toextend to you  Sir  my hearty congratulations on yourelection to the high office of President of the GeneralAssembly at a time when the United Nations is passingthrough a very important phase in its history. I also takethis opportunity to express our sincere appreciation toMr. Stoyan Ganev for his stewardship of the forty-seventhsession of the General Assembly.I must also take this opportunity to pay our warmesttribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.His efforts to reform and strengthen the United Nations withthe courage of conviction have been universally appreciated.We are impressed by his vision and dynamism  which arenecessary for the United Nations to cope with the newrealities and challenges of our time. Mr. Boutros-Ghali wasa well-known figure in my country even before he becamethe Secretary-General of the United Nations. We considerhim to be a sincere friend of Nepal.Although small in military and economic strength Nepal is fully alive to its responsibilities as a Member ofthis world Organization. Nepal will not hesitate to take anindependent and objective stand in favour of larger good andjustice. For us  the Charter of the United Nations capturesthe highest ideals of mankind. I take this opportunity torededicate the commitment of the people and theGovernment of Nepal to the United Nations."
"126",5349,"NZL",48,1993,"The United Nationsis our Organization; we are its custodians  and we have toadjust to change. We have a huge responsibility to pass iton in better shape than we found it. Historians in futureyears will acknowledge this period of radical change.But what are the objectives of this Organization of oursin 1993? Well  they are not very difficult to enumerate because they are set out for us and by us in the Preamble tothe Charter  and they remain as valid today as they werewhen they were agreed in 1945.The first  of course  is peace  because without peaceand security no human society can flourish; then humandignity  because if we do not treat each other with respect asindividuals  we will not do so as nations; justice  becauseunless relations between nations are grounded in law  thepowerful will always be able to triumph over the weak;social and economic progress  because without the sustainedand sustainable development of our economies  all our otherachievements will be as nothing.I believe that to this list we must now add themaintenance of a clean and attractive environment. We arelearning  painfully  that our planet also has rights. Weignore them only at our peril.These are the foundations for the vision of what theworld should be. In New Zealand  we would say that theygive opportunities to all. When the United Nations cameinto existence almost 50 years ago  the vision was sharperthan the reality  but the founders of the United Nations werecertainly not deterred. They were at the watershed in theaffairs of the world. They had just experienced the awfulreality of a global conflict in which millions had died  andthey were determined to do everything in their power tomake sure that such a conflict could never occur again.They did build well. They embodied their vision not onlyin this Organization but also in a whole series of economic financial  social and humanitarian institutions  and they gaveit the only strength that counted: their sheer determination as men and women from very different countries  to makeit happen.Only the utmost patience and perseverance has kept thatdream and that determination alive through most of the50 years since 1945. Progress has been slow and it has beenhalting. Some great things were done  but too often theMembers of the United Nations could agree only at thelowest common denominator  a reflection of the politicalgaps and strains within the United Nations membership.There are  however  four reasons why I believe that thatlong  grey era has closed.The first is that the cold war  that shadow and threat ofa global conflict  is now over. Freed of that constraint  theUnited Nations can operate  as it was intended that it should as the ultimate guardian of the security of all its Members the ultimate arbiter of world peace.Secondly  democracy  one of the most effectiveguarantors of peace between nations  is spreading. Wewelcome the establishment of democratic institutions andprocesses in countries that have for too long been withoutthem.The third point is that in the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade Uruguay Round of multilateral tradenegotiations  the world has a major opportunity to turn itsback on protectionism and lock in the prospects foreconomic growth through trade and other forms of economicintegration. Freedom and free trade go hand in hand.Fourthly  and last  the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiroand Agenda 21 contain a global consensus  a universaldetermination to act to preserve our environment.This combination of developments marks a newwatershed; if we are to keep faith with the founders of thisOrganization  we must do what they did in 1945 at theirwatershed  and build well  not just for ourselves  but ofcourse for those who follow.On the issue of security and peacemaking  the firstpoint that I raised was that the elimination of confrontationbetween the super-Powers has opened up new possibilitiesfor the practice of collective security and peacemaking. Theunfortunate consequence of 50 years of super-Powerconfrontation is  paradoxically  that we are not yet very goodat working together: like a novice sports team  we are reallyrather uncoordinated  sadly lacking in strategy  sadly lackingin team skills or knowledge of the new rules  and sadlylacking in collective determination. We cannot correct thesedeficiencies overnight  but we must keep on trying toimprove.Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 39The other paradox is that peace has not broken outsimply because the former Soviet Union and the UnitedStates have stopped squaring off against each other. Therehave been unexpected consequences: some would liken theresult to taking the lid off a pressure-cooker. Conflicts internal and between neighbours  seem to have burst outeverywhere. These consequences  in human terms  arehorrific.So here we are  in the United Nations  underresourced undertrained and facing an enormous peacemaking  peace-building and peace-keeping challenge. We really have noalternative to learning as we go  and I believe that we aredoing so.During the past year  I have spoken to soldiers andrelief workers in the field in United Nations missions aswidely spread as Somalia and Croatia  and I pay my highesttribute to their dedication under some of the most adversecircumstances. United Nations people are trying there  aselsewhere  to create conditions where their work willultimately no longer be required. They are actually trying todo themselves out of a job.The Secretary-General’s document ""An Agenda forPeace"" is now in a consolidation phase. The problems areclear: rising expectations; machinery due for reform; lack offunds; and the lack of ready  well-trained and well-equippedforces. Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has already made somethoughtful proposals  including sending teams to MemberStates to help identify in advance resources available for theUnited Nations operations. New Zealand is willing torespond positively to this approach.The Secretary-General has also made organizationalchanges in the Headquarters departments that support peace-keeping. The revamping of the Department of Peace-Keeping Operations is a very good start  providing werecognize that we need more than just a shifting of theresources. The new philosophy of peace-building andpeacemaking must work in tandem with the well-tried andsuccessful peace-keeping philosophy of the past.On the issue of safety and security of United Nationspersonnel  recent peace-keeping operations have highlightedthe risks to United Nations personnel working in dangerousand unstable situations. That does not help the recruitmentof peace-keepers  and it does not help the recruitment ofcontributing countries. The United Nations must have themeans to hold personally responsible and accountable thosewho attack or commit other acts of violence against theUnited Nations and associated personnel.Earlier this year the New Zealand Government took theinitial step of calling for all possible measures to ensure thesafety of United Nations personnel. We asked the Secretary-General to report on the adequacy of existing arrangements.His report makes a number of positive recommendations.He has highlighted the need for the General Assembly toelaborate a new multilateral instrument on the role theSecurity Council might play in setting the appropriateconditions designed to improve the safety of personnel.I was very pleased just this afternoon to participate ina Security Council meeting that adopted a resolutionwelcoming the Secretary-General’s report and spelling outthe conditions the Council will impose in the future for theprotection of United Nations personnel. I was also delightedthat the General Assembly last week agreed to NewZealand’s proposal to include a new item on the safety ofpersonnel in this year’s agenda. I hope that the SixthCommittee will establish a working group to consider theissue and make urgent progress. I hope the subject will alsobe very fully discussed in all other relevant United Nationsbodies.Of course  any mechanisms for protecting peace-keepersmust also require that parties to any conflict respect theintegrity of those personnel that have been deployed on theirbehalf. Such an undertaking should  in principle  form partof the mandate for any peace-keeping operation. The recentpractice of the Security Council of establishing clearmandates for peace-keeping operations at the outset ofdeployment is especially welcome  but there remains an onuson a host State both to explain carefully to its people thereason for the United Nations presence and also to takeactive steps to ensure the safety of United Nations personnel.But the purpose of peace-keeping or peacemaking andpeace-building is not solely to deal with conflicts that havealready arisen  urgent though that task is. We must improveour capacity to prevent conflicts before they break out  andI should like to acknowledge here the importance andtimeliness of recent improvements in conflict-resolutionmechanisms and the ongoing work on preventive diplomacy.I welcome very warmly the contribution made by myAustralian colleague  Senator Gareth Evans  to the debate onthis subject. He has given us much food for thought andsome helpful suggestions for concrete steps we can take toimprove our performance in this area.40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionDisarmament measures remain a key element in conflictprevention. This year  as the international communitymoves towards the extension - I hope for an indefiniteperiod - of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons  the Assembly will have non-proliferation as oneof its major themes. In this regard  North Korea’s continuedevasion of its responsibilities under that Treaty demands afirm international response.We welcome very strongly the restraint being shown bythe nuclear-weapon States on testing and their positiveattitude towards the launching of negotiations for acomprehensive test-ban treaty. It is not before time. NewZealand has sponsored a draft resolution on comprehensivetest-bans for many years. Its purpose now is on the brink offulfillment. The subject needs to be taken up in theConference on Disarmament. Given the importance of thetasks now on the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament membership of the Conference must be open to all who havethe will to participate constructively.In respect of conventional weaponry  we applaud theenhancement of controls through the commencement of theRegister of conventional-arms transfers. We now have achemical weapons Convention in place alongside thebiological weapons Convention.It is timely to consider what similar work can be donein respect of conventional weapons. As disarmament movesfrom the realms of Utopia into the achievable  we must lendevery effort  here in the United Nations and outside it  toensure disarmament’s more rapid progress. No sensibleproposal should be discarded simply for outdated ideologicalreasons.The spread of democratic institutions to every corner ofthe globe is  I believe  one of the most encouragingphenomena of recent years  and the pace is astonishing. Inthe space of just 24 hours last week  the Parliament of Israelapproved a Declaration of Principles on Palestinian self-government; the Parliament of South Africa enactedlegislation establishing the Transitional Executive Council totake charge of that country until a democratically electedGovernment is in office; and a constitutional Governmenttook office in Cambodia.We welcome these historic events and the promise theyhold for a more just and prosperous existence for the peoplesof those nations. As delegations will remember  the MiddleEast and South Africa dominated the political agenda of theAssembly for many years. These positive developments inboth regions will give a new cast to the Assembly’sdeliberations.We can also take heart from progress on another frontof long-standing concern to the Assembly. The UnitedNations is now three years into the International Decade forthe Eradication of Colonialism. The good news is that weare already seeing evidence that the goals and objectives ofthe United Nations in this area are almost completelyrealized. The number of Self-Governing Territories on theUnited Nations list is now very small  and many of these areexploring innovative ways to complete the decolonizationprocess. The recent United Nations Seminar on Colonialism held in Papua-New Guinea in June  confirmed this trend. Italso revealed that in some cases some very small Non-Self-Governing Territories do not want fundamental constitutionalchange thrust upon them.New Zealand has always been a strong advocate of theprinciple that in all cases decisions on self-determination are of course  for the local people to make. We are comfortablewith the notion that certain Territories  such as the Tokelaus may finally choose to develop concepts of self-governmentand free association that further develop models that havealready been successfully employed for other very smallformer Territories.In that connection  and consistent with New Zealand’sprincipled approach to all matters of decolonization  I ampleased to confirm that the New Zealand Government andthe people of the Tokelaus have extended an invitation to theUnited Nations to send a further visiting mission to theTokelaus early in 1994 to meet local leaders and  of course discuss recent developments.Democracy is a sure foundation for peace betweennations. It is the political expression of that universalrespect for human rights to which we are all committed.The Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action arising out ofthis year’s World Conference on Human Rights gives somedirection to steps the Organization can take to strengthen theobservance of human rights.I believe we should move quickly to approve a highcommissioner for human rights. The United Nations needsan officer with a mandate to play a constructive role inpreventing  monitoring and alleviating human rights abusesthroughout the world. The Centre for Human Rights shouldbe given the resources to match the immense task it willhave before it. There is a clear need for an enhancedprogramme of advisory services and technical assistance toForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 41help countries build up their national human rightsinfrastructure.Human rights is also about recognizing the rights ofpeoples to self-identity. In this  the International Year forthe World’s Indigenous People  I would like to support aproposal that the United Nations declare a decade forindigenous peoples. We need to build on what has beenachieved  first at Rio de Janeiro and subsequently during theInternational Year world wide. This is a long-term task. Itwill require a sustained and very coordinated effort.Unhappily  our task is not just to enhance theobservance of human rights. In this last decade of thetwentieth century  we seem at times to be actually movingbackwards  witnessing the abuse and deprivation of humanrights on a scale that we really believed we had put a longway behind us. The suffering of millions of refugeesdisplaced by conflict is beyond our comprehension butcannot and should not be beyond our compassion. Thisdimension is starkly evident in nearly every issue nowbefore the Security Council. Last June  the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees put thefigure at 19 million people - 19 million displaced peoplearound the world - and it continues to rise.It is appropriate to pay a special tribute to Mrs. Ogataand her staff for the way in which they are meeting  often indangerous and trying circumstances  the challenges whichthis problem brings. New Zealand has responded to theseincreased demands by making a special provision forrefugees from Bosnia  Somalia and Cambodia byestablishing special programmes for particularly vulnerablegroups  such as women at risk  and by providing aid. Wenow have one of the highest per capita resettlement ratios inthe world. But this is  of course  addressing the symptoms not the cause. The ultimate objective must be to create orrecreate conditions that allow refugees to return in safety anddignity to their own homes and homelands.Nor can we neglect the need to bring to justice thosewho have brought about such suffering. The establishmentof a war crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia iscertainly a central pillar in the international response to thisparticular conflict. The full achievement of the Tribunal’smandate is of the highest priority. At the same time  and ina broader context  New Zealand also welcomes theconsideration being given to the creation of an internationalcriminal court. We would like to see further progress onthis issue made during this session of the Assembly.Sustainable economic growth for all countries isessential for stability and peace in the world. A principaldeterminant for that is an open  healthy and internationaltrading system  a system that encourages closer economicrelations and strengthened North-South exchanges. There isno greater assistance developed countries can give to thedeveloping countries than to open their markets. Asatisfactory conclusion to the Uruguay Round of multilateraltrade negotiations would be of immense benefit to us all andhas been mentioned  I believe  by just about every speakeron this rostrum during this debate.Progress to that end in the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade  of course  has been slow  as we know.Many deadlines have come and many deadlines have gonewithout resolution. We should not be under any illusion.Come this December  after seven years of negotiations onthe Uruguay Round  either we will have the liberalization ofmultilateral trade with a benefit to all or the prospects ofavoiding global economic warfare will have suffered themost serious setback. The New Zealand Government seesthe purpose of these negotiations being to lock in placetoday the politically attainable  and to build on what mightbe possible tomorrow. In preparing for that  we also haveto focus our attention on what is needed to ensure that allcountries are placed where they can reap the benefits of thefuture.We still have much to follow up from the RioConference on Environment and Development. But time isnot on our side. Environmental degradation continues topose a serious threat to the planet and its resources  and nocountry - no country - is immune from its impact. Thelevels of responsibility for environmental damage may differfrom country to country  but we must face up to theirconsequences together. We must meet the objectives ofAgenda 21 and the Rio Declaration. All countries shouldmove to ratify the climate and biodiversity Conventions  astep that New Zealand took just recently. New Zealand willcontribute to the global environmental facility that is to fundboth of those Conventions. We have begun work to reducecarbon dioxide emissions and are developing acomprehensive strategy for reducing net greenhouse gasemissions. We are also making excellent progress onphasing out consumption of ozone-depleting chemicals.New Zealand is ready to share its expertise on biologicaldiversity with other countries to assist them in meetingobligations under the Conventions.I suppose that one of the most useful exercises that wecan conclude here is to draw some lessons from theexperiences and views that I have set out. The most obvious42 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionone to me is that  however important it is to deal with theparticularities of human aspirations for peace  respect for theindividual  economic well-being and a good  cleanenvironment  one should never lose sight of the connectionsbetween them all. The Secretary-General has pointed outhow peace  development and democracy form a mutuallyreinforcing circle  and we agree. Getting the linkages rightcan be as important for success as the elements of each.Peace and security are not likely to be soundly based ifpeople are hungry. Economic growth cannot last if thenatural resources used to create it are not conserved. Peopleare not likely to make the effort required by economicrestructuring if the important choices are made for them.Economic growth cannot be sustained if countries keepcoming up with new pretexts  such as environmentalprotection  to justify excluding outside competition fromtheir own markets.Human aspirations and human security must be seen inthe round. That is one of the major challenges facing themembership of this Organization. The work done by theUnited Nations in post-peace-keeping situations  I believe deserves renewed attention. For those countries where thereis still a need to foster economic  political and socialdevelopment  we should look at establishing a partnershiparrangement between the United Nations and the sovereignGovernment. A coordinating body comprising theGovernments and a group of friends of the Secretariat couldhelp to ensure that the gains of peace-keeping are takenthrough to reconstruction. I believe that we need a newinstitutional framework to graduate problems out of thesecurity area and into a forum more able to cope with theneeds of redevelopment and reconstruction.The second lesson is that we need to keep looking athow well the United Nations is fitted to meet the challengesit is facing and be prepared to change it where necessary.Membership of the United Nations has continued to growand I warmly welcome the newest Member States.Many speakers have referred to Security Councilreform. The Security Council is in need of early reform.We support a modest increase in membership and a freshlook at the institution as a whole. The possibility of somemembers representing regional groupings for  say  a 10-yearperiod is worth considering. New Zealand will continue tooppose any extension of veto rights.Another imperative is for the Council’s work methodsto be improved. Wider consultation with the broadermembership of the United Nations is essential. UnitedNations agencies are also ripe for restructuring. The GeneralAssembly has made a good start on itself. We havestreamlined the Committees  but we also must streamline theoverall workload. It is unmanageable at present.For several years now  we have been looking hard atways to fund new demands on the Organization by makingcompensating savings elsewhere. We still need to ask hardquestions about whether all that has been done traditionallystill needs to be done. I welcome the fact that the Secretary-General’s budget proposals already envisage some majorsteps in this area. He has also identified better contractingas a source of further savings.At the end of the day  however  all that can be done toincrease efficiency and cut costs will come to naught if thefinancial commitment by Member States is lacking. NewZealand pays its dues on time; most others do not. I urgethem to do so. Let us certainly go on talking about financialreform  but let us also secure the financial basis of theOrganization while we are doing so.But what is the real dream that all of us have? I wouldurge all members to keep making  from year to year  realprogress towards satisfying those basic human aspirations Imentioned at the outset and to do so with a strong  well-equipped and well-focused United Nations. Specifically  Iwant to see a reshaped Security Council  a more tightlyfocused General Assembly  better peace-keeping practice  aSecretariat equipped to handle peace-building and partnershiparrangements  and financial arrangements built on efficiencyand punctuality. Would that not give a point to the fiftiethanniversary celebrations that lie ahead in 1995  and would itnot make the United Nations of the next 50 years a moreeffective  more dynamic and exciting place to do the world’sbusiness in than the conditions of the last 50 years haveallowed? The deprived of this world expect no less. Thewell-off know the world is too small for the huge gap thatnow exists amongst all people to remain."
"127",5394,"OMN",48,1993,"Onbehalf of the Government of the Sultanate of Oman  allowme at the outset to convey to your Excellency our sincerecongratulations and to express our pleasure on your electionas President of the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. I am confident that thanks to your well-knowncompetence and diplomatic skills  our deliberations willreach a successful and meaningful conclusion.Permit me also to take this opportunity to extendprofound gratitude and appreciation to your predecessor  Mr.Stoyan Ganev  for the exemplary manner in which he steeredthe work of the forty-seventh session.At this point  I feel it is important to refer to theSecretary-General’s comprehensive report (A/48/1) issued inSeptember 1993  which dealt with the activities of theUnited Nations and the issues and concerns on its agenda.In particular  I wish to refer to paragraphs 353 to 366regarding the situation between Iraq and Kuwait.We highly commend the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his great efforts  and weshall be looking forward to contributing  with all MemberStates  in achieving a unified stand that will ultimately leadto an integrated approach of coordination  understanding andcooperation towards the advancement of our goals ofdevelopment  peace and stability.This session is convened at a time when the hopes andexpectations of all peoples are geared towards a new phaseof constructive international cooperation between theMembers of the United Nations  whose number has beenincreasing annually. In this context  our country welcomesthe admission of Eritrea to the membership of the UnitedNations after its accession to independence through itspeople’s decades-long struggle. Eritrea is a country withwhich we have cultural and historical ties and with which weshare aspirations after stability and peace. My country alsowelcomes the admission of the Czech Republic and theSlovak Republic as Members of the internationalorganization and commends them for having settled theirpolitical problems peacefully and avoided conflicts bloodshed and suffering. We also welcome the admission ofthe Republic of Macedonia  Andorra and Monaco to ourOrganization. We are confident that the enlargement of ourinternational family will give us more strength andconfidence in undertaking further innovative internationalcooperation.These countries joined the United Nations after theyhad gained their independence through the long and painfulstruggle of their peoples during the cold war and the periodthat was overshadowed by conflict between the greatPowers. Today  in the post-cold-war world  we see positivepolitical developments taking place. In addition to theemergence of several sovereign nations  we have seen greatpolitical developments which give us renewed hope that anew world will be established on the basis of brotherhoodand cooperation instead of conflict and bloodshed  a worldin which wounds are healed.Our presence here underscores our conviction that theGeneral Assembly is the unique international forum fordiscussing and exchanging views among all Member States regardless of their size or strength. As Members of theUnited Nations  we must engage in positive talks andnegotiations with the purpose of settling internationalproblems.This forty-eighth session of the General Assembly isheld under circumstances that should encourage us toestablish a set of advanced rules that would governinternational relations. This we should do by takingadvantage of the newly acquired capability of the UnitedNations to enforce the rule of the law in peacemaking andpeace-keeping the world over. We are confident that ourOrganization  which shoulders a heavy burden of seriousForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 5responsibility will be able to rise to the challenges that faceit  so long as the international community continues to becommitted to and redoubles its efforts in supporting theUnited Nations and the principles it stands for.There is no doubt that  the success of the UnitedNations depends on the coordinated efforts of Member Statesin addressing the outstanding issues and crises which mustbe solved collectively in the cause of building our new worldorder. There is an urgent need for the organs of the UnitedNations to provide positive conditions and effectivemechanisms before the United Nations is required to dealwith any regional or international crisis. We are convincedthat no matter how far apart the positions of the parties toany conflict are  they will not reject intervention by theUnited Nations if the intervention is timely and appropriate.In any case  the tasks of the United Nations should beexclusively in the areas of achieving peace and providinghumanitarian assistance.The march towards peace between the two peoples ofPalestine and Israel has just begun. The first important stephas been taken towards the comprehensive solution forwhich we have long waited. The United Nations which together with all its organs  played a prominent role in theArab-Israeli conflict should feel a sense of satisfaction atwhat has been achieved. However  much work lies aheadfor the United Nations and its organs in pursuing andpreserving this historic agreement that will benefit not onlythe people of the Middle East  but the entire world as well.It is high time the Palestinian people put behind them theirlong-drawn-out suffering and looked forward to economicand social development under the new world order.The Palestinian-Israeli agreement has paved the waytowards other agreements between the Arabs and Israel.However  we should not be over-optimistic. The residues ofbitter conflict are there  and unless the peoples and States ofthe Middle East are fully taken care of  those residues willconstitute real obstacles which will make difficult theachievement of the goal we all aspire after.The leaders of the Palestinian and Israeli peoples haveshouldered their responsibilities and have done what wasexpected of them. Now it is the responsibility of all Statesof the world to maintain and preserve this achievement. Itis not enough to extend congratulations to those leaders orto give them our moral support. The United Nations musttake positive complementary steps towards sponsoringprojects from which they could benefit economically andsocially.My country has voiced its support for this agreementbetween Israel and Palestine. We are very pleased towelcome this accord and look forward to a comprehensivepeace agreement that would guarantee the mutual interests rights and benefits of all parties on the basis of theimplementation of United Nations Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973)  425 (1978) and theprinciple of land for peace.Thus  we call upon all States Members of the UnitedNations to support this process. We look forward to anypositive contribution to any role played by the UnitedNations in making the peace we hope for.Regional cooperation in the area of economic and socialdevelopment will always be an indispensable prerequisite ofany new order in the Middle-East region. In order for thenew dawn of peace which has just emerged with thesignature of the historic agreement between the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel to continue develop and become a reality  the international communityhas assisted in rehabilitating the countries that suffered fromthe war situation which  until recently  prevailed in theregion. In this context  while we pay special attention tosupporting the Palestinian people’s progress toself-determination  we must also bear in mind the urgentneed of the Lebanese people for assistance and help themrebuild their economic and social infrastructures. Whateverassistance the international community can offer by way ofeconomic and administrative support will provide thefoundation for hope in a future of peace.The Middle-East region is not the only part of theworld where optimism is diluted by fear. In many otherparts of the world  the United Nations is deploying effortsthat aim at tipping the scales in favour of optimism againstanxiety and fear.In this context  while we value the United Nationsefforts in Somalia  we believe that such efforts should bebased on concordance between the United Nations and thedifferent Somali factions. The success of the United Nationsoperations in Somalia depends on the cooperation that canbe achieved between the United Nations and the Somalifactions. The restoration of peace and stability cannot beachieved unless all Somali factions commit themselves tocooperate effectively with the United Nations in addressingthe problems and difficulties that face the Somali people.On the European continent  the international communitycontinues to witness another serious and highly sensitiveproblem  namely the situation in the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina. There is no doubt that it is the European6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioncountries that bear the responsibility of addressing thehumanitarian  political  security and economic aspects of thisproblem.The principles of human rights  justice and equalityhave always been the lofty ideals that civilized Europepreached and called upon the world to adhere to.Paradoxically  the world has yet to see those lofty principlesbeing put into practice and translated into measures thatwould rescue the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina fromtheir agony and from injustice and persecution. AlthoughEurope is making efforts to steer the warring factionstowards reconciliation  the fact that Europe has failed to takea decisive stand on the basis of justice and equality hasmade the continuing tragedy of the people of Bosnia andHerzegovina doubly dangerous as its persistence may verywell encourage the forces of evil and oppression in otherparts of the world to take heart and follow in the footstepsof the aggressors in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a matterof fact  we are beginning to witness examples of suchbehaviour  in the strife between Azerbaijan and Armenia  inthe continuing plight of Georgia  in the explosive situationin Tajikistan  and in the continuing civil war in Angola andin many other war-stricken areas  hotbeds of tension whichmay explode at any moment and threaten world peace andsecurity.Some of those problems  as well as many others  areleft-overs from the cold war conflicts. They persist invarious forms and put a heavy burden on the United Nationsand its organs. As I said earlier  this internationalOrganization  with its present capabilities  cannot shoulder itsresponsibilities as vigorously as it should if it is to achievefull success in restoring stability whenever one of thoseproblems explodes. Therefore  we believe that the UnitedNations should concentrate on issues of a humanitariannature which attract a measure of regional and internationalconsensus that would support United Nations action. It mustbe realized that if the United Nations goes on taking it uponitself to address the world’s problems all in one go  it willsquander its capabilities and will risk failure. It is thereforemost important to establish a mechanism that wouldcoordinate the efforts of the United Nations and the regionalorganizations in addressing such problems and crises.We  as members of this international Organization  areenthusiastic and eager to develop the current mechanisms ofthe United Nations so that the Organization may be able tocontinue to play an essential and dynamic role in the worldof tomorrow that should be built on the principles ofdialogue and cooperation between countries and regionaleconomic groups. Economic development and scientificprogress will be principal features of that future world.Hence the pressing need for re-examining the economicstructures of the various regimes that existed during the coldwar era. Such re-examination should be guided primarily bythe principles of free-market mechanisms and orientedtowards freeing the potential of third-world countries toacquire advanced technology in order for those countries tobe able to develop their resources and market their productswithout any economic barriers or restrictions. This  in ourview  will help consolidate the world economic order andcontribute to the world economic recovery from therecession that is currently wreaking havoc on the economiesof the developed countries.Cognizant of the growing interdependence andglobalization of the world economy  the Sultanate of Omancontributes vigorously in this direction. For instance  incooperation with large international institutions  the Sultanateof Oman has been involved in petrol resources developmentprojects in Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation with theaim  inter alia  of assisting in the development andimprovement of the economies of these countries which webelieve could ultimately lead to greater general security andstability.The Sultanate of Oman believes that the increasinglyinterdependent nature of the world economy is a majordevelopment in the post cold war era. We shall  therefore work with our neighbours and partners to promote mutualeconomic prosperity. Our initiative towards building astrategic pipeline to transfer natural gas to the peninsula ofthe Indian subcontinent aims at fostering the economicgrowth of fraternal countries in that region. We call uponthe world to take collective action towards alleviatingpoverty and hunger  which are the two main sources ofregional tensions and political upheavals.Allow me to take this opportunity to convey  on behalfof my Government  my sincere appreciation to the membersof the Asian Group for their support and endorsement of thecandidature of the Sultanate of Oman for membership in theSecurity Council during the period of 1994-1995. By thesame token  my heartfelt gratitude goes to those countriesand other groups which supported the candidature of mycountry. I should like to assure our supporters and allMember States that from the very beginning of itsmembership  the Sultanate of Oman will do its utmost tocontribute to the achievement of the objectives of the UnitedNations  particularly in the area of establishing andmaintaining peace.With the desire for membership in the Security Councilcomes a strong awareness of the special responsibilitiesentrusted to the members of the Council. We commitForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 7ourselves to work collectively to achieve the effectivenessrequired for the implementation of the Security Council’sresolutions and the success of the Secretary-General’sefforts.The Sultanate of Oman feels special responsibilitytowards its youth and their future  as they are the futuregeneration that will work to maintain the new world order.For this reason  my country  based on its demographicprofile  has given priority to the promotion of youthprograms in its developmental  social and economic plans.We look forward to cooperating with other States throughthe United Nations in pursuing activities particularly aimedat the welfare of the youth of our communities.In this context  I am delighted to highlight theSeptember 1993 report of the United Nations Children’sFund (UNICEF) which describes the achievements ofcountries in the spheres of health and welfare of children.The report states that the Sultanate of Oman ranked firstamong Middle Eastern and North African countries andsecond world wide in the reduction of the child mortalityrate for under fives. Moreover  the Sultanate of Omanoccupied the first place among Middle Eastern and NorthAfrican countries in the provision of vaccinations againstmeasles. In the field of education  91 per cent of our five-year-old children are attending elementary school  a statisticwhich exceeds regional and international averages.We shall continue to improve on these achievementsthrough the fruitful cooperation between the Sultanate ofOman and the organs of the United Nations  especiallyUNICEF  in the field of health programmes that wouldensure children’s welfare and development to oursatisfaction. We view such efforts as good examples of howinternational cooperation can be seen to bring positive andbeneficial results to our communities. We shall endeavourto achieve even better results in this area.While we continue to focus on our youth  we also worksimultaneously and enthusiastically to conserve theenvironment in order to ensure a healthy and better place forthe next generation. In this regard  I should like to informthe General Assembly that my country has recently becomepart of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of theOzone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances thatDeplete the Ozone Layer. This is in line with our convictionthat the international agreements on the environment and ourcommitment to such agreements are the right way to protectthis planet and its resources.The environment  on which survival on this planetdepends  is still beset by pollution and the exhaustion ofessential resources. Such a situation undermines theprosperity of the inhabitants of the planet. Withoutoperational and effective economic plans for theimplementation of  and the relevant special procedures for the environment conservation programme  the prospects ofsuccess for our efforts will be meagre indeed.As in other areas  the differing levels of economicdevelopment from one country to the other lie behindenvironmental problems. We believe that the prevailingchronic recession in the world has not made it feasible to re-examine and redefine our economic priorities. However there is a pressing and urgent need for such re-examinationto be carried out against the backdrop of the environmentaland economic challenges now facing us.The recession that now plagues the industrializedcountries has resulted from the deterioration of growth ratesin the Third World countries. We hope that the developedcountries will realize the importance of allowing thedeveloping countries to revitalize their economies so that theeconomic order may regain the balance between the supplyside upon which the economies of the industrializedcountries depend and the demand side which constitutes thebasis of the economic growth of the Third World countries.We are concerned that if the developed countries arenot fully responsive to and supportive of the essentialrequirements of economic recovery in the Third Worldcountries  the present world economic situation willultimately lead to a cancerous recession that will affect thewhole world and lead to disastrously negative consequences.Finally  it must be said that despite all this  we shouldtip the scales in favour of optimism regarding the prospectsof building a new world of peace  brotherhood andprosperity. Regardless of the many hotbeds of regional andethnic conflicts  we are confident that our constructivediscussions at this session and at all levels will ensure theemergence of a better world in the coming century that willbe free of all the tragic negative residues of the past. Ourbest guarantee that it will be so is that our common futurewill depend on positive cooperation between all countries inthe interests of international stability and prosperity underthe rule of law and in consonance with the behests of justiceand sagacity."
"128",5440,"PAK",48,1993,"It is with great pleasure thatI extend to the President of the General Assembly thefelicitations of the Pakistan delegation on his election topreside over the forty-eighth session. His diplomatic skillsand wide experience  particularly in the United Nations  willbe a valuable asset for the success of this important sessionof the Assembly.We express our appreciation and gratitude also to theprevious President  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  for his memorablecontribution in guiding the forty-seventh session of theAssembly.A special tribute is due to the Secretary-General of ourorganization  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his dedicationand dynamism. We agree with the Secretary-General thatpeace  development and democracy are interlinked and that""Cooperative global integration is now an inescapablefact and requirement for all the world’s peoples.""(A/48/1  para. 13)Pakistan is happy to welcome the Czech Republic Slovakia  Eritrea  the former Yugoslav Republic ofForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 13Macedonia  the Principality of Monaco and the Principalityof Andorra as Members of our Organization. We lookforward to close cooperation with them in efforts toaccomplish the aims of the United Nations.To that objective  and to the noble vision of theCharter  Pakistan has been committed ever since itsindependence. We have throughout sought to abide by itsprinciples  and we reaffirm our faith in their timelessvalidity. As in the past  so also in the future Pakistan willextend its wholehearted cooperation to all other States incommon efforts aimed at realizing the ideals that inspiredthe establishment of the United Nations.Nearly half a century later retrospection evokes mixedfeelings. The Organization’s failures and acts of omissionhaunt and depress; yet Members of the United Nations havemuch to celebrate. Some of the achievements during thesedecades have been monumental.Over 130 nations have emerged from the dark era ofcolonialism and alien domination  each bringing its uniquegenius to enrich world civilization  and to advance the causeof human dignity.The nightmare of a nuclear Armageddon has beenaverted. Weapons of mass destruction are being reduced.Ideological rivalry and confrontation have yielded to peaceand cooperation.Democracy continues to triumph. People in large partsof the world have achieved economic and social progress and better standards of living in peace and freedom.In moments of optimism  we even perceive the glimmerof a new dawn  of a more equitable and tranquil era  whenpower will have been civilized  when differences anddisputes between States will be resolved  not throughaggression or intimidation  but by peaceful means on thebasis of law and justice  as they are between individuals.That vision appears tantalizingly close  yet it eludes ourgrasp. The world community’s progress towards peace andprosperity is both slow and meandering. We have witnessedmany setbacks and reverses. At such times the vision ofpeace seems to recede to the far horizon.Respect for fundamental rights has been severelyundermined. Some States have exhibited blatant disregardand contempt for international norms  allowing and evenencouraging their forces to perpetrate barbarous acts thatoutrage the conscience of decent people.Instead of civility and the practice of tolerance beingpromoted  chauvinism and the evils of bigotry and hatred areencouraged in some countries. The consequence has beenpogroms against minorities and destruction and desecrationof their places of worship.The number of people in the world who have beenforced to flee their homes as refugees has risen to a recordlevel  straining the resources available for their relief.The problem of poverty has intensified. A billionpeople live in penury  without adequate food and shelter.For them  life is short and brutish.Manifestly  the United Nations has a long road totravel  and many old and new obstacles to overcome  beforeit fulfills the aims and purposes set for it in the Charter. Buteven as we count the multifarious challenges  we can drawsome solace from recent successes.A remarkable transition has taken place in Cambodia a transition in which the United Nations TransitionalAuthority in Cambodia (UNTAC) played a pivotal role. Thecommendable contribution of the Secretary General’s SpecialRepresentative  Mr. Yasushi Akashi  and his collaborators is a source of satisfaction for the Organization and itsmembers. Committed to the promotion of peace andstability  Pakistan is happy to have provided 1 500 personnelfor UNTAC during the transition.The Declaration of Principles signed by the PalestineLiberation Organization and Israel is a positive development.Implemented in good faith  it could go down in history as animportant first step towards peace and coexistence in theMiddle East. Vital to the realization of that aim will berespect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people andan equitable settlement of the outstanding issues. The statusof Al-Quds-el-Sharif remains a crucial issue of interest to usin Pakistan and  indeed  to Muslims all over the world.We hope that the Declaration  evolved with thecommendable contribution of Norway  and the agendaagreed between Jordan and Israel will give a fillip to thenegotiations for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East for which Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and338 (1973) provide an agreed and necessary basis.14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionIn Afghanistan the accommodation achieved by themujahidin leaders  and the formation of a coalitiongovernment  is reason for satisfaction. Consolidation ofpeace will allow the Afghan people to enjoy the fruits oftheir epic victory. Meanwhile  a programme for thereconstruction of this war-ravaged country needs to belaunched immediately. By providing employment  it willreinforce the peace process. Pakistan is prepared to join ininternational efforts for the reconstruction of Afghanistan.Assistance is needed also for the million and a half Afghanrefugees in Pakistan who are still unable to return to theirhomeland  pending the creation of conducive economic andpolitical conditions.The political evolution in South Africa holds thewelcome promise of peace and freedom for all its people.They and the world at large applaud the valiant freedomfighter and statesman  Nelson Mandela  for his sagaciousleadership. Pakistan will respond positively to his proposalsto bring South Africa back into the comity of nations. Theformation of a pluralist  democratic Government is in sight.Pakistan looks forward to developing close and friendlyrelations with the new South Africa.In Somalia  too  notable progress has been madetowards the restoration of law and order and therehabilitation of its polity  though  regrettably  the processhas been slow and painful. We in Pakistan are deeplygrieved because our troops have suffered heavy casualties onaccount of the misguided acts of a Somali faction. YetPakistan will not abandon the United Nations Mission. Ourcontingent will continue to hold high the United Nationsflag  assist relief operations and promote the re-establishmentof peace and harmony in Somalia  for whose people wecherish abiding goodwill and fraternal affection.We welcome the progress achieved in Mozambique Liberia and Rwanda  and hope that the relevant agreementswill be implemented in letter and in spirit. The unfortunatedevelopments in Angola must be reversed. We urge theparties concerned to seek dialogue and nationalreconciliation. The international community must assistthese countries in restoring peace and normalcy.The optimism generated by the end of the cold war hasbeen blighted by the colossal tragedy in Bosnia andHerzegovina. A member of the United Nations has beencarved up by the use of force and its people brutalizedthrough aggression and cold-blooded genocide. Crimesagainst humanity have been perpetrated on a scale not seensince the Holocaust. The conscience of mankind has beenoutraged. Yet the community of States failed to act indefence of a small State. It has succeeded  instead  indenying the inherent right of a State to self-defence. Indeed some of the members of the Security Council evenobstructed moves to assist the victims of aggression andslaughter  knowing full well that the perpetrators ofaggression were being aided and abetted by their ethnicneighbours.With their hands tied behind their backs  the Bosnianshave been forced to negotiate a so-called agreement. Theyhave been obliged to submit to a diktat in disregard of equityand even the resolutions of the Security Council. A planthat would reward aggression and legalize acquisition ofterritory by force cannot  and should not  win theapprobation of the world community.The General Assembly can still act  even at thiseleventh hour  to salvage the hope that has been invested bythe people of the world in the United Nations. Its voicemust rise in defence of law and justice  in order to preservethe sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina; to ensure anequitable apportionment of territory among its differentethnic components; to strengthen the United Nations force sothat it can keep and enforce the peace; to protect the safeareas to provide relief against hunger and the rigour of theapproaching winter; and to punish those responsible for thebestial crimes committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina.Azerbaijan is yet another victim of aggression.Armenians have occupied Azeri territory and expelledhundreds of thousands of people from their homes. We callfor an end to this aggression and for the withdrawal ofArmenian forces. Also  the Azeri refugees need theassistance of the world community for the relief of theirsuffering.The crisis in Kashmir calls for urgent action by theUnited Nations. India has unleashed a brutal reign of terrorand repression in the occupied State in an unconscionableattempt to bludgeon the Kashmiri people into submission andto thwart their legitimate struggle for the realization of theirright to decide their own future. This is  of course  aninherent right  but in the case of Kashmir it has beenspecifically pledged to them by Pakistan  by India and by theUnited Nations. It is sanctified in the resolutions of theSecurity Council pertaining to Kashmir.Internationally respected non-governmental humanrights organizations have graphically documented the brutalcrimes committed by the Indian occupation forces.Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 15Since 1990 Amnesty International has been reporting onthe massive violations of human rights in Kashmir by Indianforces  on the practice of arbitrary imprisonment  torture andkillings of Kashmiris in custody  and on the perpetration ofrape as a matter of policy.""Rape is not uncommon and there is evidence of itsemployment as an instrument of terror""  saysP. M. Vandarajan  a University of Oxford lecturer  whovisited Kashmir in September 1992. In his report published by the International Federation of HumanRights  Paris  the author recalls:""The infamous mass rape by the Indian Army atKunan Poshpora was reported widely in the press  bothin India and abroad. It is  to date  the most sickeningexample by far of the brutal excesses of the SecurityForces against the women of the region"".It is the most sickening  but it is by no means a solitaryincident.Also catalogued in the report are cases of""disappearances"" of people  and of young men who ""aretortured in Kashmir every day""  and of extra-judicial  orillegal  executions  which ""are alarmingly frequent"".The very titles of the reports issued by internationalhuman rights organizations and by reputable journals depictthe grave conditions in Kashmir. Headlines and titles ofreports issued during 1993 include: ""Heaven on Fire""  areport by Tim Gopsill on behalf of the British ParliamentaryGroup; ""India’s Shame""  a London Sunday newspaper  17January 1993; ""The crackdown in Kashmir - Torture ofDetainees and Assaults on the Medical Community""  AsiaWatch and Physicians for Human Rights; ""Extra-JudicialExecutions  Rape  Arbitrary Arrests  Disappearances andother violations of Basic Human Rights by the IndianSecurity Forces in Indian-administered Kashmir""  a report bythe International Federation of Lawyers for Human Rights;""Violations of human rights committed by the Indiansecurity forces in Jammu and Kashmir""  by the sameOrganization; ""Rape in Kashmir: A Crime of War""  by AsiaWatch and Physicians for Human Rights.The report by Asia Watch  a division of Human RightsWatch  New York and Washington  and Physicians forHuman Rights  Boston  released in June 1993  concludes:""In their efforts to crush the militant separatistmovement in Kashmir  Indian government forces havesystematically violated international human rights andhumanitarian law. Among the worst of these violationshave been the summary executions of hundreds ofdetainees in the custody of the security forces inKashmir. Such killings are carried out as a matter ofpolicy ...""Methods of torture include severe beatings electric shock  suspension by the feet or hands stretching the legs apart  burning with heated objects sexual molestation and psychological deprivation andhumiliation. One common form of torture involvescrushing the leg muscles with a heavy wooden roller ...Tens of thousands of Kashmiris have been killed byIndian forces in the nearly four years since India began thebrutal repression in January 1990. Many more have beenmaimed and incapacitated.No statistics can illustrate the agony of a people orportray their anguish and pain. But they do illustrate theiron resolve of the people to recover their birthright. Now in the fourth year  the Kashmiri struggle continues to gatherinternal strength. It has been established beyond doubt thatthe Kashmiri people have not acquiesced and will notacquiesce in Indian occupation. They have not accepted andwill not accept Indian rule.India’s position on the Kashmir question  and its policyin the occupied territory  constitute a fundamental defianceof international law and morality. India claims that Jammuand Kashmir is part of India; this claim is legally andhistorically baseless. The future of the State remains to bedetermined. The resolutions of the Security Council on thisquestion  providing for a plebiscite to decide the accessionof the State to India or Pakistan  have yet to beimplemented. A member of the United Nations cannot beallowed to refuse to implement a resolution of the SecurityCouncil. The resolutions in question were  moreover accepted by Pakistan as well as India. Law does not permita party to unilaterally renounce an international agreement.The struggle of the Kashmiri people to recover theirfreedom of choice is a righteous struggle for a fundamentalright. It merits the support of all members of the UnitedNations. For Pakistan  a party to the dispute  such supportis a matter of duty as well as right. The Government andpeople of Pakistan remain steadfast in their adherence to theSecurity Council resolutions and in our strong support forthe Kashmiri right to self-determination. Pakistan calls uponIndia to fulfil its obligations under law. We request all othermembers of the United Nations to take appropriate action tohalt the Indian violations of human rights in Kashmir and to16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionensure the implementation of the Security Councilresolutions.Recent reports testify to an alarming escalation inhuman rights abuses by the Indian forces in Kashmir. Inorder to investigate this human rights emergency  weaddressed a letter to the President of the Security Councillast week and reiterated our suggestion that a fact-findingmission be dispatched to Jammu and Kashmir. If India hasnothing to conceal  it should accept our suggestion.Along with the resolution of conflicts  disarmamentoffers a real option for States  large and small  to enhancetheir security and expand the frontiers of regional and globalpeace. The end of the cold war has removed the threat ofnuclear Armageddon. We welcome the agreements on thereduction of strategic arms. Even so  thousands of nuclearweapons will remain in the arsenals of the nuclear-weaponStates. We hope they will act to further reduce andeventually eliminate all nuclear weapons. The GenevaConference on Disarmament should renew its work on aprogramme for nuclear disarmament to be achieved withina specific time-frame.Until nuclear disarmament is realized  the non-nuclear-weapon States have the right to be assured by the nuclear-weapon States that there will be no use or threat of the useof nuclear weapons. The disappearance of the rival militaryblocs which relied on nuclear deterrence for security againsteach other should make it possible for the nuclear Powers toundertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weaponsagainst non-nuclear States.For over 20 years Pakistan has advocated theconclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. Weare therefore happy that negotiations are to open in Genevafor the conclusion of such a treaty. Pakistan will participateactively in this endeavour. We have also consistentlysupported a global ban on the production of fissile materialwhich should be realized on a non-discriminatory basis.The regional approach has proved to be an effectiveavenue to promote nuclear non-proliferation. The concept ofnuclear-weapon-free zones is finally being translated intoreality. The Latin American nuclear-weapon-free zone cameinto force this year. Mutual arrangements fornon-proliferation have also been worked out by Brazil andArgentina. The dramatic reversal in South Africa’s nuclearweapons programme has created the conditions forestablishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa. In theMiddle East  too  the progress towards peace may createpolitical momentum for non-proliferation.Unfortunately  the hopes for non-proliferation in SouthAsia received a serious setback when India exploded anuclear bomb in 1974. Nevertheless  Pakistan has continuedto advocate efforts to eliminate the danger of proliferation inSouth Asia. To that end  we have put forward severalproposals. These include a South Asia nuclear-weapon-freezone; the simultaneous signature of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) by India andPakistan; mutual verification by these countries of eachother’s nuclear facilities; a bilateral nuclear-test-ban treaty;a conference with the participation of India  Pakistan  theUnited States  Russia and China to elaboratenon-proliferation and security arrangements in our region.Regrettably  these proposals have not yet been accepted.Conventional disarmament can also be promoted mosteffectively in the regional context. The Geneva Conferenceon Disarmament should elaborate principles to promote suchregional arms control and disarmament in the conventionalfield. The United Nations arms transfer Register has provedto be a successful experiment. Pakistan has provided therequired information on its arms acquisition and sales.However  this Register may not provide a complete pictureof the dangers to peace in various regions. It is only whenboth the transfer and the indigenous production ofarmaments are taken into account that a comprehensiveevaluation of arms balances or imbalances can be made.To promote peace and prosperity  it is essential tofacilitate rather than restrain the application of moderntechnology for economic and social development. TheUnited Nations should consider preparing a comprehensivestudy of the impediments placed arbitrarily in the way of theapplication of advanced technology for the promotion ofeconomic and social development in the developingcountries.The global recession of the past few years has broughtsevere hardship to many of the poorest countries andespecially to the poorest within these countries. Thegrowing number of people living in absolute povertythreatens political stability in many developing countries. Acomprehensive programme for development should beaccorded high priority by the world community.The forces of protectionism must be resisted. TheUruguay Round must be concluded by the end of 1993.Adequate official resources should be channelled to thosedeveloping countries which are implementing far-reachingeconomic reform and liberalization measures. The desperateneeds of Africa require urgent attention. A new flow ofofficial assistance should be directed in particular to theForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 17eradication of poverty  to human and social developmentprogrammes and to sustainable growth in the developingcountries.The developing countries need urgently to address theinexorable and unsustainable growth in their populations.We greatly appreciate the dedication and efforts of Mr. NafisSadik  the indefatigable head of the United NationsPopulation Fund. We hope the forthcoming populationConference in Cairo will devise a comprehensive long-termstrategy to meet the challenge of burgeoning populations. Atthe same time  the needs of the world’s children mustassume priority on national and international agendas.With the collapse of the Iron Curtain  there are now nopolitical or ideological obstacles in the way of creating atruly global economy based on the principles of the market.We hope that regional economic groupings will produce amomentum towards global economic interaction andintegration  and not the reverse. Pakistan stands at thecrossroads of South Asia  Central Asia  West Asia and theGulf  and can serve as a link for mutually beneficialeconomic  commercial and industrial cooperation betweenthese adjacent regions.The United Nations is the only forum where the nationsof the world can concert their policies to construct the newstructures for global peace and progress. The SecretaryGeneral has pointed in the right direction in his reportentitled ""An Agenda for Peace"".It is essential to strengthen the mechanisms fordispute-settlement and the resolution of conflicts providedfor in the Charter of the United Nations. At the same time the Security Council must exhibit a more uniform andconsistent resolve to implement its own decisions andresolutions. Only thus can the goal of collective securitybecome a living reality.Pakistan agrees that an appropriate enlargement of themembership of the Security Council is required to enhanceits representative character. Its procedures should also bemade more transparent. The guiding principles for reformmust be democracy and the sovereign equality of MemberStates. We cannot contemplate according privileged statusto those countries which have a record of defying theprinciples of the United Nations Charter and refusing toimplement the resolutions of the Security Council.The demands made on the United Nations forpeace-keeping and peacemaking have increased significantly.Today there are 80 000 United Nations peace-keepersengaged in some 17 operations. Their missions are oftendifficult and dangerous. Yet the Members of the UnitedNations have to accept the risks and assist States andcommunities threatened by more powerful neighbours andadversaries. Pakistan is among the largest contributors toUnited Nations peace-keeping operations  with more than6 000 personnel committed to United Nations operations atpresent.If the United Nations is to discharge its growingresponsibilities  it must be assured of stable and adequateresources to finance its activities. The cost of alternativeswould be immensely higher.The forty-eighth session of the General Assemblyshould mark a watershed - a transition from the habits of thecold war to an endeavour to construct peace and universalprosperity in a new multipolar era. To succeed in thisendeavour  we shall need to arrest the dangerousproliferation of national and ethnic conflicts and disputes;establish the supremacy of human rights  democracy andfreedom; prevent the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction and move towards nuclear and conventionaldisarmament  and arrest the forces of trade protectionism andmercantilism to foster global and sustainable development.The challenges that the Member States of the UnitedNations confront are imposing indeed. Yet  the opportunitiesfor genuine peace and universal prosperity are also mostpromising. With goodwill and cooperation  Member Statescan make significant progress at this session towards thevision of peace  progress and human solidarity envisaged inthe Charter."
"129",5483,"PAN",48,1993,"Please accept my warmest congratulations  Sir upon your election to preside over the General Assembly atits forty-eighth session. I am certain that your election willcontribute to its success.This session of the General Assembly takes place twoyears before we are to celebrate the Organization’s fiftiethanniversary. We long had to navigate through the stormywaters of the cold war and ideological confrontation. It wasnot an easy task. However  today’s world is different fromthat of the signatories of the United Nations Charter. East-West détente has given us renewed hopes  though we havestill not won the war against poverty and socialmarginalization. Our main goal should be to make thosehopes a reality  if we wish to build a society where not onlya just peace but peaceful justice prevail.Obviously  the reorganization of the Security Councilis not an easy task  and it becomes even more difficult if wetake into account the fact that  since the very moment theSan Francisco Charter was signed  the Council has beenmade up of permanent and non-permanent members  and thatthe right of veto extended to the permanent members hasgiven rise  among other things  to their being accused  withsome justification  of attacking the principle of the legalequality of States.The Republic of Panama is of the opinion that if theSecurity Council is to be reorganized  the reorganizationmust be carried out in such a way that the representation onthe Council of all United Nations Members is equitable.Therefore  any reorganization must promote fair participationfor the developing States  as the situations that used to begiven as explanations for the way the Council was composedand for the right of veto have disappeared now that there isEast-West détente.Drug addiction has become the main scourge ofhumanity. The Republic of Panama  like all States  thereforehas the duty to repress drug trafficking and the resultingmoney-laundering activities on its territory  and to helprepress these illegal activities in all States. Panama  awareof these responsibilities and of the fact that the effectiverepression of drug-related crimes makes internationalcooperation necessary  on 11 April 1991 Panama and theUnited States of America signed a Treaty on MutualAssistance in Criminal Affairs  which was ratified by thePanamanian Legislative Assembly on 11 July 1991. TheTreaty is currently awaiting the consent of the United StatesSenate before the effects we expect from it can begin to befelt.On 1 March 1993  Panama and the United Kingdom ofGreat Britain and Northern Ireland signed the Agreement onMutual Legal Cooperation on Drug Trafficking  which mustfirst be approved by the Panamanian Legislative Assemblybefore it too can be ratified. In addition  and at Panama’sForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 5request  the Central American countries have agreed to signa similar treaty  which will be opened to accession by all theLatin American countries. Also  the Panamanian ExecutiveBranch has submitted the United Nations Convention againstIllicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substancesto the Panamanian Legislative Assembly for itsconsideration; we are convinced that  once it is ratified  weshall have at our disposal a valuable instrument in ourstruggle against drug-related crime.Human rights and fundamental freedoms do not comeas a generous concession from a State or its authorities.They are inherent to the human person  regardless ofpolitical  social  racial  religious or any other factor. Thoserights and freedoms are therefore inseparable  and must berecognized and respected. The fact that those rights andfreedoms are inherent to the human person affords them auniversality and indivisibility that must be strengthened.Violations of human rights and fundamental freedomsdo not only attack the person whose rights and fundamentalfreedoms have been trampled on; they also attackinstitutional stability  the constitutional order and the rule oflaw. This is so because the person whose rights andfreedoms have been disregarded is inclined towardsinsurrection or at least towards personal revenge  the privatevengeance of the eye-for-an-eye principle.Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  orviolations of them  must therefore be examined not only asa problem that affects individual interests but rather in amuch wider context  as a problem that affects society ingeneral. This is why most of the insurrections  rebellionsand fratricidal conflicts have their origins in violations ofhuman rights and fundamental freedoms to the detriment oflarge swathes of the population. Such violations often stemfrom a lack of democracy  from the absence of the rule oflaw  from extreme poverty and from social marginalization.While on the subject of lack of democracy  I wish tostate that  under the United Nations Charter  a purpose ofthis Organization is""To develop friendly relations among nations basedon respect for the principle of equal rights andself-determination of peoples ..."".In conformity with the principle of self-determination  allcountries can adopt the form of government that best suitsthem. However  by allowing dictatorial regimes to exist  theinternational community takes away all the principle’s force.The thing is that sovereignty - and the same can be saidof self-determination - can be harmed otherwise than by theacts of outside States. They can also be violated by aState’s own nationals  when they place themselves above thepopular will  as has often occurred; dictatorships havedisregarded just this principle of self-determination and haveso violated human rights. This is so because the only sourceof public power is the people.When a dictatorship disregards the principle of self-determination or the peoples’ sovereignty - which occursevery time a people is denied its inalienable right to adoptthe form of government that best suits its interests - itviolates sovereignty  and the principle of self-determination inasmuch as the State’s power to act does not have itssource in the people: it has its source in those who holdpublic power with no more legitimacy - if it can be called""legitimacy"" - than the force of arms. In addition  when adictatorship disregards human rights  it deprives theinhabitants of the State  the people  from whom sovereigntyand self-determination flow  of rights that every State mustaccord its citizens simply because they are human persons.I have allowed myself to briefly address the principle ofself-determination because I am convinced that a clearunderstanding of this principle will contribute towardsstrengthening its legal force  to the benefit of democracy andthe rule of law.The situation Haiti is going through is worrying. TheGovernors Island Agreement provides that  by the 30th ofthis month  the constitutional President  Jean-BertrandAristide  must once again occupy the presidential throne.However  the de facto Government would appear to be moreintent on provoking violence than promoting the re-establishment of the constitutional order. Since 3 July 11 people have been given their quietus  including the pro-democracy activist Antoine Izmeri  whose struggle meritsrecognition throughout the Americas.The Republic of Panama believes that the agreementbetween the constitutional Government and the chief of theHaitian Army must be fulfilled  and hopes that theOrganization  striving to live up to the principles that inspireit  will ensure that it is.Recognition of the State of Israel within secure andrecognized borders and the establishment of a PalestinianState are acts of justice restored which international peaceand security make essential. Therefore  the Republic ofPanama cannot be indifferent to the Declaration of Principlessigned by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session(PLO) on 13 September  or to the agreement on provisionalautonomy for the Gaza Strip and Jericho.Since the formation of the State of Israel  Israelis andPalestinians have been victims of all the damage thatincomprehension and intolerance can cause. Theconfrontational relationship between these two peoplesblinded by hatred is summarized in the 45 years of tears pain and death. However  the wars and exoduses of 1948 1956  1967 and 1973  with their consequences of grief andsuffering  should now serve as evidence of the benefits ofpeace. Therefore  a peace agreement between Israelis andPalestinians should become a goal for the United Nations.The atmosphere of détente to which I have alreadyreferred should foster the universality of representation inthis multilateral Organization. Consequently I am gratifiedto see that many States that have never traditionally had anactive international life  such as Andorra  Liechtenstein Monaco and San Marino - to mention only a few Statesenclaved in the European continent - have felt the need tojoin and support us in the important tasks we are resolved toaccomplish. It is in that spirit of universality that Panamahas supported and continues to support the initiativedesigned to study now and in the future  with innovativeideas and goodwill  the situation of the largest human groupthat has no voice in this body: the 21 million inhabitants ofthe island of Taiwan.The Central American countries are striving to build apeaceful  free  democratic and developing region. For thatreason  the efforts to bolster peace that have been initiatedrequire actions capable of solving our economic  social cultural and humanitarian problems in order to strengthenour peoples’ faith in democracy.The endeavours to achieve democracy  nationalreconciliation and development in the region are obvious.But in order to continue making these efforts we require thecooperation of all States that believe in democracy  justiceand freedom. Therefore  associating myself with theinitiative presented by the Ibero-American Heads of Stateand Government in Salvador  Brazil  I call on States andinternational organizations to cooperate effectively with theCentral American Integration System (SICA) so that it canpromote and strengthen sustained subregional cooperationand attain its fundamental goal.The ability of we who inhabit the vast territories southof the Rio Bravo to communicate with each other and withSpain in the same language - a Nicaraguan poet once calledthem the countries that love Christ and speak Spanish - hascreated an Ibero-American community which today  inmeetings of Heads of State and Government  and togetherwith Brazil and Portugal  is determined to focus its strengthon the future  guided by the desire to take full advantage ofthe similarities which bring us together to consolidateopportunities for cooperation and solidarity.This should be gratifying to the whole of theIbero-American community  since our faith in the future isbecoming increasingly obvious at each Summit. The firstSummit  in Guadalajara  created the forum of Heads of Stateand Government; at the second and third Summits  inMadrid and Salvador  respectively  we saw the initial resultsof these commendable initiatives. It is also appropriate hereto note that the Final Document of the third Summit states:""Without prejudice to the spheres of competence ofspecialized international forums  the United NationsGeneral Assembly should focus its internationaldevelopment cooperation policy on securing greateraccess for developing countries to world markets adequate forms of finance and modern technology.This will make it possible to overcome the obstacles todevelopment and  while benefiting the developingcountries  will also open up economic opportunities forthe industrialized countries  thereby easing themigratory pressures exerted on them by thoselegitimately seeking ways to improve their standard ofliving."" (A/48/291  para. 14)I would feel most fortunate if the General Assemblywere to listen attentively to the demands of theIbero-American community  which feels that most of theproducts of its member States have been repeatedly deniedincreased access to markets which have been traditionallyaccessible  as in the case of bananas in the EuropeanCommunity  as well as access to financing and moderntechnology. For our part  the Ibero-American States shouldbe resolved to put our financial situations in order and notdepend on the marketing of a few products  and we shouldimprove the quality of our educational systems  in order toattain greater economic stability. The Ibero-Americancountries should also resolve to turn the cooperation andsolidarity mentioned in the Final Document into sincere andhonest cooperation and solidarity  and not mere rhetoric  asis so often the case. Only in that way will we be able toprofit to the full from the affinities that we share.Panama will be the host country of the Summit of theIbero-American Heads of State and Government in the year2000. This event will unquestionably have great significancefor my country. It will take place precisely at a time whenForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 7the Panamanian people have attained their most importantlegal and political objective: recovering their rights over thePanama Canal and freeing their territory from thejurisdictional limitations imposed by the ill-fated Hay-BunauVarilla Treaty. That is so because the present Panama CanalTreaty will expire on 31 December 1999. Consequently  theRepublic of Panama will then manage  operate and maintainthe Panama Canal. All the real estate  fixture improvementsand equipment that the United States of America will beusing until the end of the validity of the Treaty will revertto Panama. One of the Panamanian people’s greatest wisheswill thus come true on 31 December 1999.However  as important as achieving this legal andpolitical objective may be  it is the good or bad use we makeof the Canal and the areas that revert to us that will markour future in a positive or negative way. Thus  it is our dutyas a nation to manage the Canal wisely and to use in thebest possible way the areas that revert to us.For that reason Law No. 5 of 1993 created theAuthority of the Panamanian Interoceanic Region  with theobjective of improving the use of the assets that arereverting and will revert to Panama between now and theyear 2000. Similarly  on 6 September 1993 a draft bill forconstitutional reform was submitted to the PanamanianLegislative Assembly; it is designed to add a new article toPanama’s political Constitution which will create the PanamaCanal Authority  whose main function will be to manage andoperate the Canal. That will ensure that the Authority willnot be affected by any political shifts. Thus  the Republicof Panama is preparing to manage  operate and maintain thePanama Canal from 31 December 1999. This task will beall the easier because the current Canal Administrator  and87.7 per cent of the Panama Canal Commission employeesare Panamanians  not counting those with dual nationality.On the basis of the Panama Canal Treaty  Panama andthe United States agreed in 1982 to create the PreparatoryCommission to prepare the points of reference for thefeasibility studies of a sea-level canal in Panama and otheralternatives to the Panama Canal. They also agreed to inviteJapan to be a full member of this Commission  an invitationJapan accepted. These three States created the Commissionfor the Study of Alternatives to the Panama Canal.On 20 September last  this Commission presented itsfinal report  a Joint Statement of Commission Members which indicates that the ""current Panama Canal with thewidening of the Gaillard Cut seems to be able to meet theneeds of international maritime trade until the end of thesecond decade of the twenty-first century. However "" thestatement continues  ""before the year 2000 measures shouldbe taken to prepare the canal for the time when the currentPanama Canal will not be able to take care of the projectedtraffic."" Such measures include ""future studies to firmlyestablish the dates when improvements will becomenecessary in order to start planning the requiredenvironmental studies involved in the final engineeringdesign and the initiation of the construction"".According to the aforementioned report  the results ofthe study indicate that the alternative of high-level locks with one lane of maritime traffic at the Gaillard Cut operating jointly with the current canal and capable ofhandling ships of 200 000 dead-weight tonnage  ismarginally feasible.In order to handle the projected traffic with the sameefficiency during the twenty-first century as it has beenhandled since the opening of the Canal on 15 August 1914 if not with even greater efficiency  the aforementionedsystem of high-level locks will have to be built in time tobegin operating by the year 2020. As it does not have thenecessary resources to complete such a project  Panamabelieves that the cooperation of the members of theinternational community - primarily those who use the Canal- is essential. We hope to receive that cooperation  for thesake of the well-being of the Panama Canal users who sourgently require it.At the beginning of my statement I referred to the factthat we are two years from the golden anniversary of thisOrganization. We should prepare to celebrate that greatevent by affirming  as its founders in San Francisco wished ""faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worthof the human person  in the equal rights of men and womenand of nations large and small"" and by promoting ""socialprogress"" and ""better standards of life in larger freedom""."
"130",5530,"PER",48,1993,"In 1990 the Peruvian people - heirs to an ancient culture who  like other peoples of the third world  suffered theconsequences of colonialism and later various frustrationscaused by our history - began to ask themselves more andmore why they had not reached a truly dignified level ofexistence comparable to that of the developed countries.Why was it that a rich nation  known for itshard-working population and enjoying apparent democracy should have to suffer from hyperinflation  isolation from theinternational financial community  terrorism  drug-trafficking corruption and internal and external debt? In short  why wasit ungovernable?The so-called traditional democracy  which solved noneof Peru’s serious problems  had been nothing more than astruggle between privileged minorities  the elite and partyleaders who took turns in power while the country sankdeeper and deeper into misery.Nations  however  do not disintegrate in such crises;rather  they are roused to carry out moral and materialreconstruction. Such has been the case in Peru.I ask myself  and I ask all those present  therepresentatives of all the nations of the world  ""Which is thefirst priority: the narrow  blind defence of an institutionalformality that is now worthless and obsolete  or a betterdestiny for millions of human beings?""Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 7We in Peru have experienced this disjunction which theGovernment of President Boris Yeltsin in Russia isexperiencing so dramatically today.Why should we fear making corrections in the courseof our history  however radical they may be? To govern isto confront problems firmly  and not to defer  much less toevade  decisions.In exceptional circumstances  when the civilizedexistence and survival of a nation is at stake  each countryhas to find its own course and its own solutions and thenreconstruct its democracy in touch with its own reality.Failing this  it will simply become ungovernable - a situationthat most often leads to anarchy  which in turn inevitablygenerates violence.The institutions of Peru’s incipient political systemproved to be among the most inefficient on the continent.That was the context within which Shining Path and theTupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement came into existence.The model for Shining Path is Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge.This is why  for 10 years  that group’s activities weredirected toward destroying the existing system: industries laboratories  electrical towers  machinery  bridges  highwaysand public buildings  costing the country US$ 25 billion inmaterial damages and losses. New York learned whatterrorist insanity is all about with the criminal attack on theWorld Trade Center - an isolated case  thank goodness.We had reached a clear and elemental disjunction:either we stopped the crisis and the terrorism which steadilynourished it  or the country would collapse completely. Myresponsibility was to govern  not to serve as Peru’s undertaker.Our anti-terrorist strategy has led to the reinstatementof the principle of authority throughout the country particularly in places as dissimilar as state universities andpenitentiaries.After being captured a year ago  Abimael Guzmánmade a fiery proclamation to all his followers to continuerelentlessly the war against the Peruvian State and itssociety. Today  in a 180-degree turn  he appeals to yourspeaker  the President of Peru  in order to retract hisprevious atrocious objectives. This shows essentially that hehas inevitably come to terms with the total defeat of histotalitarian project.In fact  I recently received a revealing communicationfrom the leader of Shining Path  Abimael Guzmán  who isin jail  in which he asked for ""a peace agreement"". I repeat Abimael Guzmán Reynoso has asked the President of Peruto talk about a ""peace agreement"". But a ""peace agreement""implies negotiation between two belligerent groupsconsidered to be equal - equal not only militarily but alsofrom a moral and ethical standpoint. This is inadmissible for there can be no negotiations with a genocidal terrorist group -described as such by the United Nations itself - whoseleader  having been captured  tried and sentenced last yearto life imprisonment  has absolutely no power to negotiate.Moreover  there is no correlation of forces between thePeruvian State and these criminals that could put them on anequal footing. There can be no doubt that it has beencompletely recognized that the State  the Armed Forces  theNational Police and the people of Peru are prevailing overterrorism.The Government of Peru is fully aware of its obligationto respect the international principles of the GenevaConvention. Nevertheless  it will make no concession in anyway that would jeopardize the process of restoring peacecompletely to Peru. Through the attainment of peace in ourcountry and the definitive eradication of terrorism  we arealso preventing the spread of terrorism to the rest of theSouthern Cone of our continent.The Peruvian Government and its people will tirelesslycontinue their effort to fight terrorist violence  with orwithout requests from the heads of these organizations. Ifthey really wish peace to be achieved as soon as possible they should immediately and unconditionally stop terroristactions and their methods of propagation  as a preliminarystep enabling the Peruvian State to prevent further bloodshedand suffering for the Peruvian people and to take the furthersteps required to facilitate the process by which theGovernment will fully consolidate national peace before thedate I promised to my fellow citizens  that is  1995.Twenty-five thousand deaths; hundreds of thousands ofrefugee peasants displaced from their villages; thousands ofwidows and orphans; hundreds of handicapped and maimed including civilian  police and military; thousands of childrenwho have grown up in the middle of a cruel war; $25 billionof material waste; an entire country paralysed by terror anduncertainty: this is the sum of 13 fateful years  duringwhich a State considered to be democratic appeared not toexist in the face of totalitarian terror. The end of thisvicious circle is approaching after 17 months - barely 17 months -of the counter-terrorist strategy developed by my8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionGovernment. Now we can talk about the State anddemocracy in Peru.In our country  a new and exemplary democracy isbeing devised. It has some unusual elements: the commonman’s awareness of his chronic exclusion from themainstream of civic life; his experience and sacrifice as asurvivor of one of the century’s worst economic crises; andhis equally successful involvement in the war against thenation’s terrorist threat - within the framework of the fullexercise of his right to self-defence and the universal rightsof the individual and of every citizen.Peru can once again see the light of day. Thenightmare of war is now behind us. Those who doubted thatthis was possible must now admit that it has happened andmust recognize that the decisions taken in April 1992 wereabsolutely necessary. Peru is beginning to be a viablecountry again - an attractive country visited by thousands oftourists  who can confidently bear witness to its new look a country with hope  one into which foreign capital isflowing  thereby generating more employment and wealth.In the near future  the Peruvian people will have the historicopportunity to decide upon a constitution incorporating thethoroughgoing reforms that will guarantee peace andprogress in our country. This will be the end of a grimcycle. Peru is now a country open to the world - one which like other countries all over the planet  is beginning fully toexercise its right to be a free and prosperous nation throughthe implementation of a true democracy and of a system ofgovernment that will benefit our people."
"131",5577,"PHL",48,1993,"I am most pleased toconvey to Ambassador Insanally my congratulations andthose of my delegation on his election as President ofGeneral Assembly at this session. At the same time  I wishto express our sincere appreciation to Mr. Stoyan Ganev ofBulgaria for guiding with skill and dedication the work ofthe Assembly at its previous session.Let me pay a tribute to our Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the vision and the energy hehas devoted to the leadership of our Organization at adifficult but exhilarating moment in history.Allow me to express at this point the deep sympathiesof my delegation for the people of India in connection withthe tragedy visited upon them by the earthquake thatdevastated parts of the state of Maharashtra.The President is presiding over the work of theAssembly in a world that continues its amazing politicaltransformation. Since we met in this same Hall last year  aperiod that is but the twinkling of an eye in the long historyof mankind  the world’s political landscape has been furtherand radically transformed. That transformation is  above all reflected in and exemplified by two of the majorpreoccupations that have exercised the Assembly and theinternational community for decades - namely  the situationin South Africa and the problem of Palestine.The abhorrent system of apartheid  long the evilfoundation of the South African State  has finally crumbledbecause of the unremitting efforts of the people of SouthAfrica and of the international community  not least of theUnited Nations. In its place  multiracial negotiations - inthemselves an amazing phenomenon in that country - haveled to a specific programme with a precise timetable for theconversion of South Africa  in the words recently uttered inthis Hall by that authentic leader of the South Africanpeople  Nelson Mandela  ""into a united  democratic non-racial and non-sexist country"".The whole situation in the Middle East  too  has beentransformed  a transformation symbolized by a singlehandshake in Washington. That historic gesture resultedfrom complex combinations of circumstances anddevelopments and presages further arduous negotiations anddetermined efforts by the Israeli and Palestinian peoples andtheir neighbours. But there is now  more than ever before reason to trust that in that long-afflicted part of the world thepolitics of intolerance  hatred and despair is being replacedby the politics of accommodation  enlightenment pragmatism and hope.Thus  the international community’s political agenda and the substance and content  if not the item-titles  of theAssembly’s agenda  have radically changed.The global economy is being transformed no lessradically. Everywhere  obsolete obstacles to trade arecoming down  if not yet globally  then within the variousForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 13regions of the world. To be sure  economic barrierscontinue to be propped up by atavistic hands that seek toreverse the tide and hold back the march of global economicprogress. The most obvious victim of these rearguardactions is the Uruguay Round  which  after years offrustrating negotiations and painstaking bargaining  has yetto come to a conclusion. The ultimate victims are the globaleconomy and the livelihoods and standards of living of theworld’s peoples. Here  the accusing finger of history pointsat certain developed countries  with their short-sightedsubsidies and protectionist devices. Nevertheless  the trendtowards trade and economic liberalization gathersmomentum. More and more nations recognize that thattrend can be reversed only at the peril of the well-being ofthe world’s peoples.Our region of South-East Asia has been a vital part ofthe global political and economic transformation.The conflict in Cambodia and the agony of theCambodian people long preoccupied this Assembly as wellas the Security Council. Going beyond the expectations ofso many  the Cambodian people have made their historicdecision for peace and reconciliation. We now call upon theinternational community to extend its support to theCambodian people and their new Government so that theywill find surcease not only from war  but also from povertyand want  and so that they will find not only peace  but alife of dignity and freedom.The Declaration by the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN) on the South China Sea  which was issuedin Manila last year  has received the strong endorsement ofthe United Nations and of individual Governments  and wein South-East Asia have continued our measured effort tobuild a regime of peace  cooperation and mutual confidencein that disputed area.Earlier this year we in ASEAN  joined by the othernations of East Asia  including Viet Nam and Laos  and byothers with interests in the region  agreed upon an ASEANRegional Forum in which questions of regional security canbe periodically examined and discussed together.In East Asia  the rapid advance of economicliberalization has propelled the economies of the region toachieve some of the highest growth rates in the world. Thecommitment to the free market has found its most forcefulexpression in the decision of ASEAN’s leaders to establishan ASEAN Free Trade Area through the steady reductionand eventual elimination of trade barriers within ASEAN.Happily  the dawning of a new era of peace and thepromise of prosperity in our region have found a brightreflection in my country. President Ramos’ policy ofnational unity and reconciliation has replaced the politics ofdivision. Dissident elements have been drawn back into thefold of society. Peace talks with the remaining disaffectedgroups are being held. Amnesty has been offered to all.The economics of selfishness and greed is beingreplaced with reforms to secure economic fairness and socialjustice. The Philippine economy is ruled no longer by thetyranny of excessive regulation or of corporate monopoly butby the invigorating regime of market forces and freecompetition.Global competitiveness  in place of politicalcontention  is now the watchword throughout the land.All this is being carried out with the most meticulousrespect for human rights in accordance with the nationalconsensus and the deepest convictions of our people. It isbeing achieved within the framework of our democraticinstitutions. For we are convinced that there is no substitutefor respect for human rights and democracy in theachievement of long-term stability and progress  as well asin the assurance of human dignity and the fulfilment ofhuman aspirations.The new situation in the world gives us new hope anda brighter promise. But grave dangers and tragic situationsremain. Old scourges continue to torment the human family;new agonies confront it.Religious intolerance and the rise of nationalistambitions have supplanted ideological fanaticism as the fuelfor the fires of conflict that now burn in too many places inthe world. The collapse of empires has let loose the savageimpulse to settle historical scores  redress ancient ethnicgrievances  and set right real or imagined injustices overnational borders  the treatment of minorities  or the controlof resources.The tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of theworst and most dangerous of these barbarities.Despite - in certain cases  because of - the onset of aclimate of peace  trafficking in the weapons of warsometimes continues unabated  dissipating resources endangering people  imperilling the peace. The Philippinessteadfastly supports measures to promote greatertransparency in arms transfers and military expenditures including the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms.14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe Philippines urges the nuclear-weapon States  in thestrongest terms  to restore the recently broken moratorium onall nuclear testing  and hopes that the internationalcommunity will decide  through a comprehensive test-bantreaty  to cease for ever the testing of nuclear devices  whichso gravely threaten the very existence of the human family.The Philippines favours the extension of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and calls upon all toabide strictly by its provisions  including the safeguardsagreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency.At the same time  we urge the nuclear-weapon States tofulfil their own obligations under the Treaty and furtherreduce their stocks of such weapons until they are no more.Amid the rising tide of economic liberalization  thesiren song of protectionism continues to entice nations withits fraudulent promise. Legitimate concerns over health food safety  the environment  workers’ welfare  and evenhuman rights  including the rights of indigenous peoples -and now ""social dumping"" - are being invoked to clothe invarious guises policies of naked protectionism.Decisions on global finance continue to be made by afew  with the rest of the world standing by even though it isvitally affected. The burden of foreign debt continues to bea millstone round the necks of many developing countries and the problem is often aggravated by decisions on interestrates and exchange rates in which those countries have novoice.The Philippines continues faithfully to fulfil its externalfinancial obligations  regardless of the extent to which thatpolicy holds back our economic growth  constitutes a burdenon our people  and imposes a heavy domestic political coston our leaders. But we wonder whether the world has triedhard enough to devise creative solutions to this economicplague upon the developing countries. After all  somenations have been favoured with decisive - even radical -measures to alleviate their foreign debt  such measureshaving become politically useful to the creditor countries.The ravages that the profligacy of man has wroughtupon the Earth’s delicate environment continue to endangerour fragile planet and many nations. The Philippines haskept faith with the commitments made by us all at theUnited Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment because of its conviction that developmentcannot be sustained if the world’s - and thecountry’s - natural riches and the balance between them aredestroyed.No less destructive is the accelerating increase in theillicit trafficking in drugs  which destroys the lives of ourpeople in the vigour of their youth. It gives rise tolawlessness and crime. It knows no national boundaries.We therefore appeal for the full and effectiveimplementation of the United Nations International DrugControl Programme and the Global Programme of Action.In situations of conflict  women  as well as children become the most tragic victims by virtue of their inherentvulnerability. The systematic rape and murder of womenand girls in Bosnia and Herzegovina is only the mostoutrageous instance of this abhorrent reality.Similarly  in situations of extreme poverty  women -particularly migrant workers - are the most vulnerable toabuse. Detached from the family  away from theirhomeland  often living in their employer’s home  unprotectedby the country where they work  women migrant workers areespecially susceptible to maltreatment. The abuses to whichthey are exposed  and often subjected  are a veritable litanyof woe - denial of their rightful wages  excessive deductionsby their employment agencies  intolerably long workinghours  insufficient food  lack of medical care  the absence ofany avenue for the redress of their grievances  physicalattack  rape and other forms of sexual abuse.We call upon the Assembly to keep among the areas ofits concern the condition of women  who make up half ofthe world - in particular  the migrant workers among them.And we call upon the Governments concerned to enact lawsand other measures for the protection of these migrantworkers. We ask these Governments to cease the calloustreatment of migrant workers as commodities that are subjectonly to the law of supply and demand.These scourges of mankind - mass poverty  externaldebt  environmental damage  illicit drugs  abuses againstwomen  the mistreatment of migrant workers - would bemore effectively addressed if Governments  societies and theinternational community were to place people at the centreof development and international cooperation. This is whatthe World Summit for Social Development is intended to do.We urge the world’s leaders and their Governments toensure maximum participation in this milestone event inCopenhagen in 1995.The world has changed radically  largely for the better.But old problems remain  and new challenges confront us.To respond to these problems under the new circumstances and to deal with these new challenges  our Organization  theUnited Nations  must renew itself.Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 15In few aspects of the work of the United Nations is thisneed for renewal more evident than in the Security Council.The structure of the Security Council was formulated at thevery birth of the United Nations  at the end of the SecondWorld War and the beginning of the cold war. Forty-eightyears have passed. Massive changes have occurred in theworld  particularly in recent years. Empires have crumbled.The ideological division of the world has melted away. Thecold war has ended. The membership of the United Nationshas multiplied from 51 at the time of its founding to 184today.And yet  apart from the enlargement of its membership30 years ago from 9 nine to 15  the Security Council has notchanged. It has remained small  unrepresentative undemocratic  opaque. We recognize the reality ofcontinuing imbalances in world power and the necessity forthe Security Council to reflect this reality. But  surely  wemust also recognize the reality of the worldwide trendtowards  and the people’s desire for  democratization andtransparency in political affairs. Surely  the SecurityCouncil  the United Nations body with the greatest impacton international peace and security  must also reflect thisreality in its size  in its structure  in its procedures  in itsrelations with other United Nations bodies  including theGeneral Assembly.We are  therefore  in favour of a searching reassessmentof the structure  role and procedures of the Security Councilwith a view to its reform. And we urge that  in view of therepercussions that such a reform would have on other UnitedNations bodies and activities  this reassessment be carriedout within the context of a thorough review of the Charter.The sober  rational andrealistic proposals propounded yesterday by the ForeignMinister of Singapore might serve as a useful starting-pointfor our consideration of this important matter.The entire United Nations is  in fact  in need of reform.In the new international situation  the enlarged demandsupon the United Nations and the constraints on the availablemeans require that the resources of the United Nations becarefully husbanded for their most efficient use. Theconcept and substance of management - and by that I meanthe science of management - must be imposed upon theUnited Nations bureaucracy. Funds and other assets must bemost meticulously safeguarded and effectively utilized.Duplication must be avoided  costs drastically cut  wasteradically reduced  and corruption abolished.I am sure that many developing countries share ourdesire that the United Nations should impose upon itself theausterity and discipline that are required of many of us bythe international financial institutions.We pay a tribute to the Secretary-General’s attention tothis aspect of his work. We welcome in particular thecreation of the new post of Assistant Secretary-General forInspections and Investigations as an indication of hisdetermination to address this problem.The Philippines is up to date in its contribution to thefinances of the United Nations. It may be a small amountin the totality of the Organization’s resources  but it issubstantial in proportion to our financial capacity. Wewould not want to see it squandered. We cannot afford it.Neither can the United Nations.May I propose  then  that a group of men and womenwith both extensive experience and skill in corporatemanagement and extensive exposure to the specialrequirements and problems of the United Nations becommissioned to study this question in greater depth anddetail and with greater objectivity  and to make theappropriate recommendations. There are many in this Hallright now who would be eminently qualified to perform thistask. The Philippines will explore the possibility of a draftresolution to this effect at a suitable time.This is a matter of great and urgent necessity. Forreforms in the United Nations will place the Organization ina better position to deal with the demands upon it in thesecond half-century of its existence and to fulfil in the nextmillennium the vision that its founding fathers had for thisgreat and indispensable Organization."
"132",5637,"PNG",48,1993,"On behalf of thepeople and Government of Papua New Guinea  I should liketo congratulate Ambassador Insanally of Guyana on hiselection to preside over the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. In so doing  I should like to recall - and toexpress my delegation’s sincere appreciation for - the even-handed and efficient manner in which his predecessor  Mr.Stoyan Ganev  the Foreign Minister of Bulgaria  presidedover the Assembly at its forty-seventh session.His outstanding example has maintained and therebyhelped to strengthen a high standard which we are confidentMr. Insanally will match. His election brings us particularpleasure because of the many important interests whichGuyana shares with Papua New Guinea and the increasinglystrong relations which have been developing between ourtwo countries  mainly through cooperation in the context ofmultilateral organizations such as the Commonwealth  theAfrican  Caribbean and Pacific group of Governments partiesto the Lomé Convention  and the United Nations itself.The Government of Papua New Guinea is also pleasedto welcome the further progress towards the universalmembership of the United Nations marked by the admissionof the Czech Republic  the Slovak Republic  Eritrea  TheFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  Monaco andAndorra. We look forward to cooperating with theirGovernments and delegations in advancing the objectives ofthe United Nations.In welcoming the new Members  I feel bound toobserve that my Government is concerned that other smallStates  including a number in the South Pacific  which findit difficult to afford to join and send missions to the UnitedNations  should be provided with the means of keepingabreast of developments and of having proper account takenof their interests  perhaps through such arrangements as aregional observer  as a number of Governments haveproposed to the South Pacific Forum.I turn now to the proposed United Nations initiative onopportunity and participation. When I addressed the GeneralAssembly 12 months ago  I said that I had chosen""opportunity and participation"" as the main theme and goalof my policy as Minister for Foreign Affairs. I also forecastthat my Government would be formally proposing aninitiative for the United Nations bearing the same name.The proposal is now listed as item 151 on the agendaof the current session of the General Assembly. Theinitiative is  of course  important for Papua New Guinea -opportunity and participation are  in fact  among the nationalgoals and directive principles embodied in our nationalConstitution. It is also important to other developingcountries where increasing opportunity for  and participationby  citizens is a public issue and an official aim. It is moreover  directly relevant to countries where previouseconomic arrangements are in transition to markets. In anincreasingly interdependent world  where issues and ideasoften have global implications  it should be of interest andcertainly deserves support worldwide.Papua New Guinea became independent on the verysame day  16 September 1975  as the General Assemblyadopted a consensus resolution - 3362 (S-VII)  on""Development and international economic co-operation"" -directed  in the words of its first preambular paragraph  ""toaccelerate the development of developing countries"". Thetiming was  almost certainly  coincidental. But it is none theless worthy of notice because of what it suggests about thecircumstances  including a continuing need to achieve thesame aim on the part of countries such as Papua NewGuinea both then and now.In the early l990s  Papua New Guinea has beenenjoying an unprecedented rate of economic growth measured  in the standard terms employed by bodies such asthe World Bank  at something more than 9 per cent per year.But few would suggest that the living standards of most ofour people have improved at anything like the same rate.The measure is quite seriously misleading  as many of ushave known for a very long time. But so are governmentpolicies and processes of economic development that fail topay adequate attention to questions of distribution  includingwho benefits and who takes part. I refer here  I should add to distribution not only of Government services but ofopenings - and even more to effective access - for people tobenefit by taking part in economic development.In certain sectors of society in many countries including my own  people - particularly those living in ruralareas - are still trying to enter the cash economy for the firsttime. In other sectors and even more countries  people whohave long been engaged in monetary transactions are tryingto increase openings  access and mutually beneficialinteractions. Increasing opportunity and participation is  inmany respects  a universal goal. The urgency of the need toaddress the means of achieving it comprehensively systematically  thoroughly and critically now arises out ofconcern at several features of the current internationalsituation.The first is the difficult and often worseningcircumstances of and in many developing countries. Asecond is the problems being encountered in the transition tomarkets in countries where economic arrangements werepreviously State-centred. Another feature results from atendency among economic policy-makers in widely scatteredparts of the world  including developed countries and themajor international financial institutions  during the 1980s tofavour reducing the economic role of the State and to leavequestions of access and distribution of benefits to markets.Complicating the effects of so-called ""aid fatigue"" indeveloped countries are the increasing need and demand foraid  investment and commercial loans arising from thechanges occurring in Eastern and Central Europe  the formerSoviet Union  southern Africa and the Middle East. Newopportunities for scarce capital and other resources are alsoopening up in the same and other areas. Furthermore expensive and urgent needs will have to be met when theterrible conflicts currently raging in the former Yugoslavia the Caucasus  parts of Africa and elsewhere are resolved andrehabilitation can get under way.In other words  resumption or continuation ofdevelopment in many parts of the world will require thatmore must be done with less. Opportunity  access andbeneficial participation in economic development must bequite dramatically increased if living conditions are to bemaintained  let alone improved.The proposal which the Papua New Guinea Governmentis therefore making is for the United Nations to establish asmall panel of distinguished  expert and experienced personsbroadly representative of the international community toreview what has already been done and to identify optionsto increase opportunity and participation  with particular though not exclusive  reference to the economies ofdeveloping countries. We propose not an academic study but one that draws on actual experience and makesrecommendations for practical action. We do not have anyfixed ideas about what it should say. Rather  we want it tomake a close  critical examination of what has beenattempted  what has been proposed and what has been - forwhatever reason  or for none - overlooked.We emphatically do not want the project to begin withdoctrinaire assumptions; rather  we want it to ask questions -for example  about when and how it is best for the State tolimit its involvement in the economy or to withdrawcompletely  and when and how the State should act tomaximize opportunity and participation. Above all  we wantit to investigate and to provide advice on the best way oflinking opportunity  via effective access  to participation.Thus  the panel  the project and the report ought to bemultidisciplinary in approach and scope  examining criticallyboth experiences and ideas about ways in which legal administrative  economic  social and other arrangements helpor hinder increasing economic opportunity and participation.While the focus should be on the particular difficultiesof developing countries  the project should  we believe  lookfurther afield. It will  in fact  have to do so if its researchand findings are to stimulate the world-wide informationexchange  and  above all make the practical difference whichwe hope will result.Forty-eighth session - 11 October l993 3In my statement to the General Assembly a year ago Idescribed the proposed United Nations initiative onopportunity and participation as being in some respects ""theeconomic counterpart"" to the Secretary-General’s mostsuccinct and constructive report  ""An Agenda for Peace."" Itshould also be seen  I believe  as a complement to  and anecessary filling-out of  other important United Nationsresolutions and documents that have been concerned withdevelopment issues more generally  such as the reports ofthe Pearson and Brandt Commissions  and ""The Challengeto the South"".The panel and the report envisaged in our proposeddraft resolution should  in addition  be viewed ascomplementing and helping to fill out the Brundtland Report particularly in so far as they manage to identify options notonly for maintaining increased opportunity and participation but for continuing to increase them so as to allow livingstandards to go on being raised for and by futuregenerations.While we await publication of the Secretary-General’seagerly anticipated report outlining an agenda fordevelopment  the proposed initiative on opportunity andparticipation should not be seen as a rival or a duplication.The proposal ought to be seen instead for what it is intendedto be  namely  a constructive start and a practicalcontribution to setting objectives and specifying means fordevelopment into the twenty-first century.Like other supporters of the proposal  the Governmentof Papua New Guinea has been gratified by the strong andpositive response with which the proposed United Nationsinitiative on opportunity and participation has been greetedby Governments  non-governmental organizations andinternational bodies in diverse parts of the world.We have particularly appreciated the expressions ofsupport we have received from the Government of theAssembly’s President  the Chairman of the GeneralAssembly’s Second Committee  and organizationsparticularly concerned with advancing the common interestsof developing countries  the Group of 77 and the Movementof Non-Aligned Countries.In our own immediate neighbourhood  we have beenassured of strong  individual and collective support bymembers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN)  the Melanesian Spearhead Group  and the SouthPacific Forum  which includes the Governments ofdeveloped countries in the region.With assistance from the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  my Government has convened both a nationaland a regional Workshop  in which highly respected variously experienced and diversely skilled persons gavetheir time on an honorary basis to help develop and refinethe proposal. The proceedings of both Workshops are beingcirculated to all United Nations members.When the proposal is debated in the Assembly on 15November  we look to all members of the United Nations forcontributions to its further development and refinement  and of course  for their votes. As it did with the resolution(47/441) on development and international economiccooperation  adopted on Papua New Guinea’s independenceday  my Government hopes that the General Assembly willendorse the proposed United Nations initiative onopportunity and participation by consensus.Believing as we do in the importance of the proposedinitiative  but conscious of the severe strains currentlyimposed on the United Nations human and financialresources  and bearing in mind the recommendation made toall members by the Second Ministerial Meeting of theStanding Committee on Economic Cooperation of theNon-Aligned Movement  my Government has decided tomake a special pledge to contribute K100 000 - theequivalent of a little more than $102 000 - to assist inrealizing the proposal. While we believe thatimplementation of the proposal must not depend on specialdonations  we call upon others to do the same in accordancewith their means.With regard to conferences on development and relatedissues  consistent with Papua New Guinea’s obvious interestin development issues generally  and in those that pertain tosmall island countries in particular  my Government looksforward to the first Global Conference on SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States  which is tobe held in Barbados in April 1994.We shall remain actively involved in preparations for and the proceedings of  what we regard as a most importantoccasion for sharing experiences and ideas  including bothproblems and hopes  with island States in our own and otherregions.For closely related reasons  we also look forward to theInternational Conference on Population and Development  tobe held in Cairo in 1994.Having taken a close interest in the deliberations andoutcome of the World Conference on Human Rights inVienna in June  we shall contribute as best we can to the4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionpreparations for the World Summit for Social Development to be held in Copenhagen  and the Fourth World Conferenceon Women  scheduled for Beijing  both in 1995.I turn to the subject of apartheid and sanctions againstSouth Africa. Successive Governments of Papua NewGuinea have always been strongly opposed to apartheid  bothin principle and in practice. We have consistently appliedsanctions  backed by the force of Papua New Guinea law against those who have upheld it. Even as apartheid hasbeen dismantled  and progress towards a democratic multi-racial South Africa has been observed  my Governmenthas been conscious of the special perspectives and interestsof African States. We have accordingly taken the view thatwe would remove our sanctions against South Africa only inconsultation  conducted through bodies such as theCommonwealth and the United Nations  with such States.Despite the economic interests which might have beenserved by allowing links between Papua New Guinea andSouth Africa  we have willingly paid the price our policy hasrequired.I have been personally moved in recent days by theaddresses made by the President of the African NationalCongress  Mr. Nelson Mandela  before the United NationsSpecial Committee against Apartheid as well as the JointAssembly of the African  Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)Group of countries and the European Community.Following the recommendations made by Mr. Mandela  theOrganization of African Unity and the CommonwealthSecretariat  as well as the resolution adopted by consensusin the General Assembly on Friday 8 October  myGovernment will now take steps to remove legally enforcedsanctions. But in doing so we remain conscious of thecontinuing - and unfortunate - relevance of Mr. Mandela’spointed reminder to the Joint Assembly of the ACP Groupand the European Community that:""the white minority Government and its institutions ...should not be ... treated as though they were therepresentative of all the people of South Africa.""The struggle for real equality for the African citizens ofSouth Africa is certainly not over. In some respects  it hasscarcely begun. My Government believes very strongly thatthe achievement of a genuinely stable  democratic andmulti-racial South Africa requires increasing opportunitiesfor access to and participation in all areas of society including the economy  by the country’s African population.My next subject is the progress towards peace in theMiddle East. Successive Governments of Papua NewGuinea have consistently followed a policy of supportingthe right of Israel to exist within secure borders  whilerecognizing the Palestinian people’s right to a homeland.We are accordingly both impressed and encouraged by thedramatic  bold and hopeful agreements reached by the IsraeliGovernment and the Palestine Liberation Organization.We commend the steps that have since been taken including the diplomatic and material support provided byother Governments to facilitate implementation of thoseagreements. As our Prime Minister  the Right HonourablePaias Wingti  has already announced  the Government ofPapua New Guinea will do what little it can to further theprocess  by acknowledging the constructive role being playedby the Palestine Liberation Organization and examining waysin which we might seek to strengthen relations with thelegitimate representatives of the Palestinian people.I come now to the reform and revitalization of theUnited Nations and the recharging of its resources.The welcome developments in southern Africa and theMiddle East  particularly those related to Israel  the occupiedterritories and the Palestine Liberation Organization  revealboth strengths and weaknesses in the United Nations  andsuggest that while there are situations in which the UnitedNations can play an important  even vital  role  there are alsosituations in which it cannot.We must recognize that when the United Nations itselfcannot  for whatever reason  be effective  then individualGovernments  such as Norway’s  regional organizations  suchas the Organization of African Unity  or some other bodymay be able to initiate or facilitate a positive outcome.The Government of Papua New Guinea welcomes thereforms which are gradually being made to the UnitedNations system: in the Secretariat and other organs  and inthe manner in which our deliberations are organized. Wealso welcome the generally revitalized role that ourOrganization aspires to play in international relations. Butwe must remember that internal reform and reorganizationare only as important as their eventual outcome.A revitalized United Nations must not be allowed tobecome an instrument of sectional interests or ill-plannedadventurism. In the context of the contrast between theevidently satisfactory outcome of United Nations efforts inCambodia and the uncertainties of the situation in Somalia my Government feels a need to sound a cautionary warning.The terrible events unfolding in the former Yugoslavia particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina  and the mountingtoll of human death  injury and suffering resulting fromconflicts in parts of the former Soviet Union reinforce myForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 5Government’s reservations about aspects of the currentdebate over the part that the United Nations can and shouldplay in the post-cold-war international order.The Government of Papua New Guinea is alsoconscious of the selectivity and costs of United Nationspeace-keeping  peace-observing and peacemaking operations and of the need to ensure that the Organization is reformed revitalized and re-endowed with sufficient resources to makea difference to the very basis of peace in developingcountries: development itself.My next topic is decolonization  indigenous people andnatural resources. In this  the United Nations InternationalYear of the World’s Indigenous People  my Government hadthe rare privilege of hosting a Regional Seminar of theSpecial Committee of 24 on decolonization  chaired byPapua New Guinea’s Permanent Representative at the UnitedNations. The occasion gave us an opportunity to reaffirmour commitment to the decolonization of New Caledonia with special safeguards for its indigenous people  theKanaks. The Government of Papua New Guinea is stronglyopposed to any suggestion that the Matignon Accords mightnot be fully honoured. The same position has been adoptedby our partners in the Melanesian Spearhead Group and theSouth Pacific Forum.In addition to the question of New Caledonia  theRegional Seminar also focused attention on other relics ofEuropean colonialism  including French Polynesia  wherePolynesian demands for independence seem to be gainingstrength.Elsewhere in the South Pacific  the negotiatedsettlement between the Governments of Nauru and Australiahas been widely welcomed for the redress it provides for along period of colonial exploitation of Nauru’s principalland-based natural resource and the destruction of much ofits natural environment.The settlement is also arousing considerable interest asto its possible implications in other former Trust Territoriesand colonial dependencies. The Government of Papua NewGuinea is only one of a number of interested parties whichhave the matter under close examination. My Governmentis also only one among many in welcoming  and wishing toencourage  efforts to recognize the rights and to improve thesituation of other indigenous people in the South Pacific andelsewhere.Together with our partners in the Melanesian SpearheadGroup - the Governments of Solomon Islands and Vanuatu- we have signed a Declaration on Cooperation inDevelopment of Natural Resources. One of the explicitobjectives of the Declaration is to facilitate implementationof the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development.Another objective  which has yet to be realized  is tosupplement existing efforts in relation to regional fisheriesby broadening and deepening cooperation between theGovernments of countries in the South Pacific where othernatural resources are being developed  often by outsiders.The crisis in Papua New Guinea’s North SolomonsProvince is an unfortunate and costly internal affair of PapuaNew Guinea. It continues  still unresolved  even asGovernment and other services are being restored. I amtherefore pleased to report that my Government has recentlybeen engaged in productive exchanges with the Governmentof the Solomon Islands  particularly concerning the spill-overeffects of the crisis on and near the common border.Following these exchanges  I have issued an invitationon the Government’s behalf to the Joint Assembly of theAfrican  Caribbean and Pacific Group of States party to theLomé Convention and the European Community to send avisiting mission to Papua New Guinea  including the NorthSolomons Province  to assess the situation and torecommend how it might assist in rehabilitation.The Government has also announced its intention towork towards an All-Bougainville Leaders’ Conference totry to resolve the crisis by political means. The Governmentof Solomon Islands has offered its cooperation in what hasbeen  at times  a rather difficult situation. We hope tocontinue our dialogue over long-term measures to strengthenbilateral relations.With respect to regional and global economiccooperation  the Government of Papua New Guinea  likemost other Members of the United Nations  is concerned atthe possibility that reform of the international trading systemmight fail as a result of the apparent intransigence of vestedinterests in certain developed countries during the finalstages of the Uruguay Round of negotiations of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). We also do notbelieve that regional trading blocs can be an adequatesubstitute for an equitable and orderly international tradingsystem.The Government of Papua New Guinea does not seethe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC) asa replacement or a rival for an updated version of GATT.But we do regard APEC as being important to our interests.More than 80 per cent in value of exports from Papua NewGuinea go to the existing APEC member countries. Nearly90 per cent of our imports come from exactly the same6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioncountries. Other aspects of Papua New Guinea’sinternational economic relations are just as deeply enmeshedwith APEC members. With encouragement from existingmembers  my Government has therefore applied to joinAPEC. We believe that it would not be right for such abody to continue without a single member from the centreof a region whose name it bears: the Pacific. We lookforward to an early - and positive - response to ourapplication.In conclusion  I should like to say the following:No human being can have failed to be deeply movedby  or to feel the utmost sympathy for  people affected bythe disastrous earthquake which occurred in India in lateSeptember.No one who has been following the developmentsconsequent on the changes in the former Soviet Union canhave failed to be both excited and concerned by the dramaticpolitical and military confrontations which have beenoccurring in the Russian Federation. All of us must surelybe concerned at reports that nuclear testing has beenresumed  at the possibility that more tests might follow  andthat weapons of mass destruction might grow in number power and circulation.In short  notwithstanding the progress made towardsfinding lasting solutions to some long-standing issues sincethe cold war ended  we continue to live in a rapidlychanging  often fragile and uncertain world. Able by virtueof our membership of the United Nations at least to let ourviews be known on what are some of the most importantand pressing issues of our time  the Government of PapuaNew Guinea has  therefore  chosen to give close attention toan issue of particular concern to developing countries  toexplore avenues of cooperation with other States  and topropose a United Nations initiative on ""Opportunity andParticipation"". Let me end by repeating my previous call formembers’ support for a proposal intended to assist inidentifying what the people and Government of Papua NewGuinea believe to be common interests  global problems andpractical solutions."
"133",5683,"POL",48,1993," I extendcongratulations to His Excellency Ambassador SamuelInsanally of Guyana on his election to the presidency of thissession of the General Assembly. May I also thank HisExcellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria for hiscontribution to the success of the previous session. Inaddition  I should like to stress the deep appreciation of thePolish Government for the work and accomplishments of theSecretary-General of the United Nations over the past year.Let me first speak about some of the timely goals andtasks of our Organization. I should like to start bydiscussing the role of the United Nations in organizing peaceafter the cold war. In the post-cold-war era  the UnitedNations is facing growing expectations and responsibilities.That trend will continue over the coming years. In anincreasingly interdependent world the United Nations despite its shortcomings and limitations  offers the bestavenue for addressing those global problems that are stillunresolved and for meeting new challenges as well. TheOrganization faces the task of creating a better  moredemocratic and just world. In fact  we badly need a visionof such a world. More often than not  we have to askourselves these questions: Are we rising to the occasion?How should we resolve the present crisis of leadership  bothwithin individual States and on the international level?The United Nations provides an appropriate platformfor shaping the vision I am talking about. To begin with  itshould be based on the assessment of geopolitical andgeoeconomic conditions  in particular on the assumption thatthe world has become pluralistic  whatever the size andweight of States in international affairs. It should alsoreflect an increased awareness of the need for a multilateralapproach to solving problems.Four years have elapsed since the end of the cold war.We must not merely adjust to the new situation  but mouldit  in order to arrive at a comprehensive solution. Thepresent crisis has many facets. Today  its primary source isunresolved economic and social issues  as well as suchpolitical problems as territorial disputes and ethnic tensions.But we have to remember that the process of findinganswers to these issues will unavoidably lead in the futureForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 37to a new alignment of power among States and  as a result we shall then face the prospect of recourse to force. Thatquestion has been partly addressed by the Secretary-Generalin his ""Agenda for Peace."" The matter has very broadramifications  and we still have not elaborated a grandstrategy of democratic transformation. I think that theUnited Nations should start exploring  in a more systemicmanner  its role in the world as it is now and as it will bebeyond the year 2000. One of the preparatory steps mightbe the preparation of a report on the United Nations as aleader of global change and the promoter of a new worldorder after the cold war. Such an assignment could beentrusted to most-knowledgeable individuals  researchinstitutes  transnational corporations and others. The reportwould serve as a basis for spelling out the futureresponsibilities of the United Nations and the MemberStates.We need a thorough re-examination of the priorities ofthe United Nations and  consequently  of the whole UnitedNations system. The main purpose of reform would be toadapt the United Nations to the requirements of peace afterthe cold war. Reform should take into account ongoingchanges in Member States. This applies  in particular  tocountries in transition  not only in Central and EasternEurope but also in various parts of other continents. Let metake this opportunity to add that Poland is firmly andirreversibly committed to the political and economictransformation it started in 1989  and that its foreign policyhas stable priorities.The fate of the countries in the process oftransformation is not their problem alone. Their success orfailure is unavoidably going to exert a strong impact onother States. The international community should not fail toback up the transformation process and to assist the newdemocracies in their continuing efforts to achieve reform economic recovery  social progress and full participation ininternational exchanges. Such an approach would assistthem in their swifter integration into the world economicsystem.The military factor of security retains its significance although it differs from that of the cold-war era. The UnitedNations has developed a disarmament agenda. The signingof the chemical weapons Convention by almost 150 Statesshows how the new political climate facilitates long-awaitedagreements and brings us closer to a world free of weaponsof mass destruction. We hope that there will be similarpositive developments in nuclear disarmament. Theinitiation of negotiations on a comprehensive ban on nucleartesting constitutes a big step in that direction. The UnitedNations should also deal with the threat posed by thepossible spread of nuclear-weapon capabilities and theproliferation of other weapons of mass destruction. Polandattaches great importance to thorough and constructivepreparations for the 1995 Review Conference of the Partiesto the Non-Proliferation Treaty.I should now like to turn to the subject of human rights.There are a number of reasons why  after the ViennaConference  the Organization should devote much of itsattention to human rights. In doing so  I believe  it shouldreflect on these words used by Secretary-General BoutrosBoutros-Ghali in addressing the high-level segment of theEconomic and Social Council:""The United Nations is  by its very essence  universal global and inclusive. It is made up of sovereign States yet crucially concerned with the well-being ofindividuals. Its concern with individuals  with theirsocieties and with world society is not  as some wouldclaim  inherently contradictory.""There are differences of opinion on the scope of humanrights  on State responsibilities in regard to their observanceand on the role of the international community in monitoringthem. The United Nations organs must expand theirnegotiating and mediatory capacities and show much skill inovercoming these divergences. The essential criteria aremorality  the inherent dignity of the human person and therule of law. Human rights must express the common valuesof the international community. Their implementation isbecoming one of the preconditions of worldwide stabilityand security.Fundamental human rights are universal; their substanceis absolute and unrelated to circumstances. But saying thisdoes not mean that we are closing our eyes to the existenceof many different cultures and traditions in the historicaldevelopment of the various regions of the world. Thisshould be duly taken into account; however  it cannot justifyany violations of human rights or non-execution of therelevant instruments. There is no room for treating criticismof such unlawful policies and lawful attempts to redressthem as an infringement of the sovereignty of States. Inpromoting  developing and effectively defending humanrights  the United Nations should make these activities partof its cooperation with States.International peace and security  sustainabledevelopment and human rights are the three closely relatedareas on which the United Nations should concentrate. ""AnAgenda for Peace""  Agenda 21 and the forthcoming agenda38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionfor development should  in my view  be complemented byan agenda for human rights. With the results of the ViennaConference kept in mind  the Agenda for Human Rightswould constitute a plan of action for setting standards andimplementing rights and preventing violations.Individuals need better and easier access to internationalprotection of their rights and freedoms. The Organizationshould revise the grievance procedures and make them moreuniversal. While assuming that the Second and ThirdCommittees will merge into one Economic and SocialCommittee  Poland would suggest the establishment of aHuman Rights and Humanitarian Affairs Committee as oneof the main Committees of the General Assembly. Werecommend expanding the responsibilities  competence andrank of the Commission on Human Rights. We alsosupport  as a matter of urgency  the proposal to create anoffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.Further  we should explore means of promoting humanrights on a regional level. A small bureau  which might belocated in Warsaw  could be entrusted with monitoringhuman rights observance in Eastern Europe. This is asensitive region. Such a bureau would be part of the Genevaoffice. I have suggested Warsaw because bodies of theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and theCouncil of Europe already operate there  a fact that couldfacilitate cooperation between the United Nations and theEuropean institutions in that field. The region providesmuch insight into how democracy and human rights arebeing implemented in States that are undergoing democratictransformation.One aspect of human rights has become very critical oflate. I am referring to the increasing violations ofhumanitarian law in armed conflicts  whether international ordomestic. As the President of the International Committeeof the Red Cross emphasized during the recent InternationalConference on the Protection of Victims of War  held inGeneva  the practice has undergone a change for the worse.With even greater frequency  civilian populations arebecoming the hostages and primary targets of fightingwarlords. Each and every day the mass media bring usscenes of the atrocities of war. We in the United Nationsmust not be indifferent to these facts. Poland joins the callfor urgent action to revive the observance of humanitarianlaw and to uphold the authority of the Geneva Conventionsas well as their additional Protocols. The PolishGovernment strongly endorses the Declaration adopted bythe Conference on the protection of war victims. In ourview  the international community should pay particularattention to the observance of human rights and humanitarianstandards in internal strife. War crimes should not gounpunished.The third task to which I wish to draw the attention ofthe General Assembly is development. The growing gapbetween rich and poor nations is a significant source oftensions and conflicts. Even Europe has not been spared threatened as it is by the emergence of a new ""curtain""  thisone economic. I am confident that the agenda fordevelopment under preparation will comprehensively dealwith the various aspects of this potential danger. We needa new development paradigm that is people-oriented: humanrights have their economic dimension. Economic and socialdifficulties have a decisive impact on international securityand global stability  and often lead to human rightsviolations. The main thing is to create a spirit of partnershipand solidarity. We expect the World Summit for SocialDevelopment  to be held in Copenhagen in 1995  to specifythe necessary tasks in social development and therebyreinforce sustainable economic development.I shall now discuss some procedures and methodswhich are particularly topical in view of the goals and tasksI have enumerated. I will speak first of the settlement andmanagement of disputes. The new world situation calls forrenewed and growing attention to international law  itsimplementation and application. Poland welcomes theenlargement  limited though it still is  of the compulsoryjurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. It wouldalso be highly desirable if further withdrawals ofreservations to the jurisdictional clauses of treaties followed.Poland supports the Secretary-General’s call upon allMember States to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of theCourt before the end of the United Nations Decade ofInternational Law in the year 2000. By means of itsadvisory jurisdiction  the Court might deal with suchquestions as the legal components of political decisions  thereview of administrative action or the relationship betweensome of the main organs of the United Nations.The peaceful settlement of disputes requires a newapproach. Traditional means  as listed in Article 33 of theCharter might  depending on the merits of each case  becombined with peace-keeping  peace-building or evenenforcement measures. We must distinguish betweenvarious phases or component parts of the same conflictwhere each phase will require a different approach or adifferent procedure. And let us not forget that there are agrowing number of conflicts which cannot simply be""settled""  at any rate in the foreseeable future. They should Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 39rather  be ""managed"". All this opens up new vistas for theskilful use of various United Nations mechanisms.Now I wish to say a few words about peace-keeping.It is a subject that is high on the United Nations agenda.The success and therefore the image of the United Nationsare at stake here. The ""Agenda for Peace"" has set out aconceptual framework. Preventive diplomacy peace-keeping  peacemaking and  in particular  enforcementrequire sound guidelines  procedures and detailed planningin operational terms. Though a great deal of work hasalready been accomplished  much more remains to be done.The problems with the clarity of the mandate of thepeace-keeping operations  their time frame  management andfrugality also require the special attention of the UnitedNations.Bearing in mind the alarming number of casualtiesamong both military and civilian peace-keepers  Poland fullysupports the idea of the expeditious elaboration of auniversally binding legal instrument  possibly in the form ofa convention on the safety and security of the personnel ofpeace-keeping operations. The United Nations should notundertake new operations without clearly identifiedobjectives. What is involved is trust in the Organization andits prospective contribution to the security of all of us.Regional conflicts figure prominently on the UnitedNations agenda. In specific cases regional institutions couldbe helpful  as not all regions have such ready mechanismsfor dealing with conflict situations. However  they couldstrive to establish them. The Security Council  also  couldplay a role in appropriate instances. The importance of theregional effort is particularly relevant to Africa  which isfacing many specific difficulties and problems. We shoulddevote more attention to that continent. Poland supports theinitiatives and programmes that aim at the peacefulsettlement of conflicts and at the creation or strengthening ofdemocratic institutions in Africa.In view of the fundamental constitutional reforms nowunder way in the Republic of South Africa  Poland favoursthe lifting of sanctions and other restrictions imposed on thatcountry.Recent developments in the Middle East have shown agenuine will to arrive at a compromise and achieve apeaceful settlement. Poland shares the view that it would beappropriate for the General Assembly to endorse the peaceprocess and call for regional cooperation in the Middle East.At the same time  the Assembly should refrain fromrepeating such resolutions as could harm this delicateprocess.We believe that the present scale of the conflict inBosnia and Herzegovina could have been avoided had theinternational community  especially Europe  reacted whenthere was still time. Obviously  I am aware of the fact thatin a conflict whose components are both internal andinternational  the influence of non-parties is rather limited and the solution must finally come from within. Polandrejects the policy of appeasement and imposed territorialsettlements.Finally  there is the issue of sanctions. I should like todraw your attention to the implementation of Article 50 ofthe Charter. I think that Member States which suffer heavyeconomic losses as a result of applying sanctions should beentitled to something more than mere consultations and ageneral - hence ineffective - appeal to the internationalcommunity to take account of their burden. As sanctionshave now become more frequent  the resulting problem ofeconomic losses by third countries cannot be ignored  as  infact  it now is. A satisfactory mechanism should be workedout as a matter of urgency to resolve this issue.In conclusion  the United Nations  like the world aroundit  is experiencing a dynamic period of transition influencedby fundamental reassessments and re-evaluations of thepotential for peace  development and cooperation amongnations.The Organization is gearing itself to contribute its sharetowards forging a better future for the world and improvingthe human condition. It has every opportunity to establisha comprehensive agenda within the trinity of peace andsecurity  sustainable human development  and democracyand human rights. It can thereby fulfil the Charter promise""to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in theattainment of these common ends""."
"134",5709,"PRK",48,1993,"On behalf of the delegation of the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea  I should like  first of all  tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly for the current session. It is our hopethat your efforts will crown the session with success.The common task facing the international communitytoday is to build a new  independent  peaceful andprosperous world. Our planet’s people have an identicalaspiration: to build a new and independent world  free fromall forms of domination and subjugation  aggression and war.All countries and nations should have unrestricted freedomto choose and develop their own political  economic andsocial systems on the basis of their sovereign rights including the right to self-determination.Independence is the life and soul of each country andnation  and the common right of mankind. A steadfastcommitment to independence enables each country tosafeguard its national dignity and rights  to maintain andconsolidate international relationships on a sound basis  tobring about genuine democratization of international societyand  furthermore  to help to accelerate the creation of anindependent world. The absence of independence will leadto failure to safeguard national sovereignty and dignity or tosecure a country’s prosperity and well-being.It is an ineluctable fact that where independence isviolated  there will be domination  subordination  subjugationand inequality. We draw this lesson for mankind from the5 000-year history of the Korean nation  and it applies to thepresent tumultuous era  with the twenty-first century justround the corner.The developments and events of recent years in theinternational arena serve to demonstrate clearly once againthe correctness of the independent lines and policies of ourRepublic. We regard independence as our life and soul. Itis the cornerstone of the internal and external policies andapproaches of our Republic. It is our people’s strongcommitment to independence and their principled positionthat have enabled our country to advance along the road ofSocialism. They have chosen this road themselves  underthe banner of the Juche idea  without any confusion or twistsand turns  without any upheaval or instability.Our Republic has steadily consolidated and developedits foreign relations and has contributed to the commoncause of mankind. We derive great satisfaction and pridefrom the fact that we have stood fast on the independentposition that we took up. Our stand is one of principle andconsistency: we are not at anyone’s beck and call  nor dowe dance to anyone else’s tune. In addition  we havealways maintained an independent position in our efforts toachieve peace and peaceful reunification of the country.12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionNational reunification is a cause to realize theindependence of our nation  while the principle of nationalindependence is the inalienable fundamental principle ofreunification. Great national unity is part and parcel of theprocess of the independent and peaceful reunification of thecountry. Great national unity is a fundamental prerequisiteto  and an essential factor in  the country’s independent andpeaceful reunification.Therefore the Government of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea has consistently subordinated everythingto the goal of national reunification through great nationalunity incorporating the principle of national independence.The whole history of the efforts for national reunificationand in particular the prevailing situation teach us that theKorean people should move towards greater national unityof the whole nation based on the principle of independencein order to attain the country’s reunification.Of course  there still exist differences in ideologies ideals and political systems within the nation  but thesedifferences could be overcome without much difficulty  sinceour nation has its own intrinsic common identity that hasbeen shaped and consolidated through the time-honouredhistory of 5 000 years. Our nation remains closely knittogether by kinship as a homogeneous people  a uniqueentity in the world  and the whole nation  whether in thenorth  in the south  or abroad  is united by the commondesire for national reunification.Members of the Korean nation should not be vieweddifferently based on whether they live in the north  south orabroad  nor should distance be put between Korean nationalsjust in order to curry favour with foreign forces. We can nolonger engage in antagonism and confrontation at thesacrifice of our great cause.The inter-Korean dialogue has made such epoch-makingprogress that the Agreement on Reconciliation Non-Aggression  and Cooperation and Exchanges and theJoint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the KoreanPeninsula were adopted and effectuated in our country. Thisis intended to serve our nation’s effort to end the antagonismand confrontation and promote reconciliation and unity andbreak down the wall of division to pave the way forreunification.Our nation is unanimous in its desire and aspiration toachieve unity  transcending all differences  and to make atangible contribution to the country’s reunification and theprosperity of the reunified country.The respected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung  Presidentof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  haspersonally authored and published the ""Ten-PointProgramme of Great Unity of the Whole Nation forReunification of the Country"" reflecting the desire and willof our nation to terminate the history of division andconfrontation and reunify the country.This historic programme provides clarification on howto establish a confederal State through the application of thethree principles of independence  peace and great nationalunity  without any bias against either the north or south  onthe basis of coexistence and the equal representation of thetwo regional governments. The confederal State would beindependent  peaceful  non-aligned and neutral  maintaininga balanced posture towards the major Powers. It alsoenvisions the protection of private or corporate capital andassets  and joint stock interests with foreign capital beforeand after reunification. The Ten-Point Programme of GreatUnity of the Whole Nation for Reunification of the Country which aims to bring about the country’s reunification on theprinciple of the spirit of national independence  is a charterof national unity and reunification which reflects mostcomprehensively the will and the aspirations of the Koreannation and takes into full consideration the currentinternational situation. It calls not only on the supporters ofreunification but also on those who have feared or remainedonlookers to reunification to take a stand for the cause ofnational unity and reunification. The programme also opensup positive prospects for achieving the historical cause of thecountry’s reunification within the 1990s. Although obstaclesand difficulties still stand in the way of reunification  theentire Korean people will definitely achieve nationalreunification in great unity  by displaying patriotism and thespirit of national independence.At present  the relaxation of tension and establishmentof peace on the Korean peninsula presents itself as an urgentissue  the solution of which allows for no further delay.With a view to easing tension and achieving a durablepeace on the Korean peninsula  the Korean ArmisticeAgreement should  inter alia  be replaced with a peaceagreement. In reality  the Korean Armistice Agreement hasalready become outdated and the armistice mechanismremains in fact paralysed. The continuance in place of theout-of-date armistice arrangements is primarily responsiblefor a series of complicated and sensitive issues  including thenuclear issue on the Korean peninsula - issues still remainingto be resolved.Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 13The fact that the state of cease-fire and the armisticearrangements of the 1950s remain unchanged even after 40years is in itself abnormal. It is thanks to the peace-lovingpolicy and the will of the Government of the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea that peace and security havebeen maintained so far on the Korean peninsula. Only thereplacement of the Korean Armistice Agreement with apeace agreement will lead to a full and satisfactoryresolution of all the issues  including the nuclear issue  willremove hostility in inter-Korean relations and will work infavour of peace in Korea and its peaceful reunification.Such being the case  if the United Nations continueslosing sight of the fundamental issues related to peace on theKorean peninsula and instead preoccupies itself with non-essential issues  it will only throw obstacles in the way of asolution of the Korean question. The United Nations shoulddirect its primary attention to the replacement of the KoreanArmistice Agreement with a peace agreement  and play itsdue role in terminating the armistice system and establishinga new peace arrangement.We believe this is the right time for the United Nationsto make an innovative decision to dissolve the UnitedNations Forces Command in south Korea and to replace theKorean Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement inaccordance with resolution 3390 (XXX) B adopted by thethirtieth session of the United Nations General Assembly.In this connection we maintain that negotiations among theparties concerned should begin at the earliest possible timeto work out a new peace arrangement that will replace thepresent armistice system.The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is anotheressential factor in building a durable peace and securitythere.The Government of the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea remains committed to its consistent position ofturning the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free  peace zone.As we have made clear more than once  we have no nuclearweapons; we have neither the intention nor the need todevelop these weapons  nor the financial resources to supporttheir production. We would not object to inspection of ournuclear facilities  but only when impartiality is fullyguaranteed.As shown by the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea-United States of America talks  the nuclear issue onthe Korean peninsula is a political issue to be resolvedbetween the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and theUnited States of America. It is to be recalled that here inNew York last June the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea and the United States of America issued a jointstatement containing their policy commitments related to afundamental resolution of the nuclear issue on the Koreanpeninsula.The joint statement clarifies  in unambiguous terms principles of assurances against the threat and use of forceincluding nuclear weapons; peace and security in anuclear-free Korean peninsula  including impartialapplication of full-scope safeguards  mutual respect for eachother’s sovereignty  and non-interference in each other’sinternal affairs; and support for the peaceful reunification ofKorea.At the second round of talks in Geneva  the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea delegation put forward aproposal on replacing its existing graphite-moderatedreactors and associated nuclear facilities with light-watermoderated reactors  thus demonstrating with more clarity thetransparency and integrity of its non-nuclear policy.If all the commitments the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea and the United States of America haveagreed upon are translated into practice - includingassurances against the threat and use of force  includingnuclear weapons  and the peaceful use of nuclear energythrough light-water moderated reactors  plus the negativesecurity assurances - then the prospects will open up for afundamental and final resolution of the nuclear issue on theKorean peninsula and the basis for the improvement ofDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea - United States ofAmerica relations will be laid down. Furthermore epoch-making progress will be made in reducing tensions onthe Korean peninsula and in ensuring peace and security inAsia and the rest of the world.Initial and meaningful progress in the efforts to resolvethe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is the outcome ofthe negotiations by the responsible parties. This vividlyproves that the only way to resolve the nuclear issue on theKorean peninsula lies in dialogue and negotiations.However  we regret to note that a certain amount ofpressure has been renewed by those forces that still remainobsessed with an outdated way of thinking at the time whenthe talks between the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea and the United States of America aimed at resolvingthe nuclear issue are under way and consultations betweenour country and the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) have been conducted.14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe so-called resolution on our ""nuclear issue"" wasadopted at the thirty-seventh session of the GeneralConference of the IAEA  which was held some time ago.This act cannot but be viewed as the product of politicalconspiracy to impede  by all means  the solution of nuclearissues through negotiations and to stifle our Republic.We regard the adoption of the ""resolution"" itself at theGeneral Conference of the IAEA as a wanton violation ofour Republic’s sovereignty and part of sinister politicaloffensive aimed at forcing international pressure upon us.The whole process of the General Conference of theIAEA held recently has eloquently shown that the measurestaken in the past by the secretariat and Board of Governorswere unjustifiable  and  accordingly  the agency has lostface and integrity in the process of solving the ""nuclearissue"".The ""nuclear issue"" of the Korean peninsula can beresolved only through talks between the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea and the United States of America  eitherin the light of its political character or its origin.Accordingly  two rounds of such talks have been held so far which is well known to the world. This notwithstanding  itis absurd that the Japanese Prime Minister and the SouthKorean Foreign Minister picked a quarrel with us in thisaugust Assembly a few days ago  clamouring about""implementing the safeguards agreement"" and ""internationalconcern about development of nuclear weapons"". Japanshould not mention the fictitious ""development of nuclearweapons""  but should give up its attempt to become amilitary Power and to realize its aim of nuclear armament which it is accelerating under this pretext.The south Korean authorities should discontinuenuclear-war exercises with foreign forces against fellowcountrymen and should not pursue so-called internationalmutual assistance systems either.Our country  as a member of international society  willimplement its commitment to the just and early solution ofthe nuclear issue.I hope that all the States Members of the UnitedNations will lend encouragement to the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea’s position in favour of a negotiatedresolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula andfully cooperate in taking practical measures to helpimplement the points agreed upon at the talks between theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the UnitedStates of America.The peace-loving position of the Government of theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to turn the Koreanpeninsula into a nuclear-free peace zone remains unchanged and we shall continue our sincere efforts in the future  too to remove the nuclear threat fundamentally and resolve thenuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.Today the world situation and international relationscall for an early liquidation of the legacies of the cold-warera that have been negated by history and the prevention ofall sorts of attempts to reverse the forward movement ofhistory.Universal disarmament and the abolition world wide ofnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction aremost urgent in eliminating the residue of the cold-war eraand attaining peace and security in the world. Everythingthat threatens the survival of mankind and the devastation ofsociety’s treasures should be abolished.The recent moratorium on nuclear testing introduced bycertain nuclear-weapon States can be called a step forward in the light of the fact that nuclear testing itself is the mostdangerous nuclear arms race among the nuclear Powers anda major source of nuclear proliferation. It is our view that along with the permanent ban on nuclear testing  epoch--making steps should be taken to destroy a colossal numberof the nuclear weapons accumulated on the globe and allsorts of nuclear weapons deployed in other countries. Inparticular  nuclear weapons deployed on the Koreanpeninsula and its surrounding regions should be dismantled.Without this solution  any talk about international nuclearnon-proliferation and world-wide nuclear disarmament issenseless.The existence of military blocs and the presence offoreign military bases and troops in other countries are theproducts of cold-war policy and are permanent factorsthreatening world peace and security. Now that the oldstructure of the cold war has collapsed  there is nojustification whatsoever for the existence of the militaryblocs and their means for waging wars of aggression. Themilitary blocs established under the pretext of the so-calledbalance of forces during the cold-war era should bedissolved. Furthermore  the presence of foreign militarybases and troops in other countries is a violation of thesovereignty and territorial integrity of those nations. Thisruns counter to the trend towards independence of thepresent era. We demand the closing of all foreign militarybases in various parts of the world and the unconditionalwithdrawal of foreign troops therefrom.Forty-eighth session - 5 October l993 15The peaceful settlement of disputes between countriesand nations is one of the important issues in safeguardingworld peace and security at present. In different parts of theworld we are now witnessing the trampling underfoot ofnational sovereignty and the escalation of regional  religiousand ethnic disputes into full-fledged wars. This has beendisturbing peace and security in some regions  and somecountries are suffering from severe disasters. Disputesbetween countries should be resolved through negotiationsbetween the parties concerned in order to meet their mutualinterests and serve the cause of world peace.As long as the structure of the existing inequitableinternational economic order remains the same  it isimpossible to eliminate the ever-widening gap between richand poor  between the developed and the developingcountries and save the developing nations from poverty disease and disasters. The developed countries must acceptresponsibility for this and refrain from any actionsdetrimental to the economic development of the developingcountries. This was specifically highlighted in the resolutionand recommendations adopted by the Tenth Conference ofHeads of State or Government of the Non-AlignedCountries. Constructive measures should be taken to resumedialogue between the developed and developing countries reform the inequitable international economic order andestablish a new  equitable international economic order.Along with this  the developing countries should adoptpractical measures to realize South-South cooperation starting from such priority fields as food  agriculture  publichealth and so on  in an effort to overcome their economicpoverty and establish a South-South economic order.The historic tasks and responsibilities the UnitedNations has assumed before mankind are growing heavierwith each passing day  and the world watches the role of theUnited Nations and its activities. The United Nations shouldbe democratized to meet the requirements of the presentsituation and the aspirations of its Member States  accordingto the principles of independence  equality and impartiality.The important point here is that all Member Statesshould be left to fully exercise their sovereignty  regardlessof differences in size of population or territory  whetherstrong or weak  rich or poor. All countries and nations areequal members in international society and are entitled toequal rights.In the world there are big and small countries  but therecannot be senior or junior countries; there are developed andless developed nations  but there cannot be dominatingnations and nations destined to be dominated by others.We stand against any privileges being given to anyparticular nation in international relations. We call foruniversal adherence to the principles of mutual respect andnon-interference in the internal affairs of others  for equalityand mutual benefits  and for friendship and cooperationamong all the countries to be based on these principles.In the international arena today  some forces areresorting to anachronistic actions; in violation of impartialityand international justice  these forces connive at actions onthe part of certain countries that violate international normson a number of issues  including the nuclear issue  thehuman rights situation and terrorism  while pretending to beignorant of them. At the same time  they accuse thosecountries that disobey them of a ""nuclear threat""  of ""humanrights violations"" and of ""State-sponsored terrorism"" imposing unacceptable pressure on them.Unjustifiable and unreasonable actions by a fewcountries that resort to strong-arm tactics and high-handedbehaviour while interfering in the internal affairs of othersand applying a double standard to the practice ofinternational relations must no longer be tolerated.The United Nations should undergo restructuring andimprovement. Such important measures are needed to meetmore effectively the changed reality and new challenges.Primary attention should be paid to reviewing andreadjusting the composition of the permanent membership ofthe United Nations Security Council. As the non-alignedand other developing countries form a majority of the UnitedNations membership  they should exercise their voice on anequivalent basis and should not be denied the opportunity totake part in the process of resolving major internationalissues. We hold that the third world countries should  as amatter of course  be included in the permanent membershipof the United Nations Security Council  in proportion to thenumbers of their members in the Organization.At present  Japan is launching a public relationscampaign to gain a seat as a permanent member of theSecurity Council. But Japan is not assuming its dueresponsibility for the acts of aggression and war crimescommitted during the Second World War and has so farfailed to make a clean slate of its past. Therefore  it is not16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionreasonable to talk about its qualification for permanentmembership.Only when the United Nations measures up to its ownresponsibilities and role on an unprejudiced basis can it takeits rightful place as the international Organization that servesinternational justice and champions world peace; only thenwill it be able to meet the expectations of its Member States.The destiny of each country and nation is closelyinterlinked with the common destiny of mankind.The world’s people advocating independence shouldwork together in unity to consolidate their respective nationalindependence  to further their countries’ independentdevelopment  and to contribute actively to a stronger worldpeace and security.We fully support the Cambodian people in their effortsto promote national reconciliation  unity and rehabilitation as we do the peoples of the member States of theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations in their endeavoursto establish a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality inSouth-East Asia  and we support other Asian people in theirstruggle to build a new  independent  peaceful andprosperous Asia.We would like to express our firm solidarity with thePalestinian and all the other Arab peoples who are engagedin efforts towards a fair and lasting solution of the MiddleEast question  including the Palestinian question; to theentire African people in their struggle to overcomesocio-economic difficulties and achieve the independentdevelopment of their countries; to the Cuban people in theirstruggle to defend the country’s sovereignty and dignity andthe gains of socialism; and to the Latin American peoples intheir efforts towards peace and prosperity.The Government of the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea and the Korean people will offer active support andfirm solidarity to the people of all countries throughout theworld who are struggling to oppose all sorts of dominationand subjugation  to build a new society and to promote thecommon cause of mankind.The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is guidedby its consistent ideals of independence  peace andfriendship in international relations  and these ideals coincidewith the ideals of international society.The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea willcontinue to hold fast to independence  to further strengthencontacts and cooperation with United Nations MemberStates  and to remain faithful to the common cause ofmankind for global independence.The delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea wishes  in conclusion  to express its hope that at itscurrent session the General Assembly will have a successfuldiscussion of all the agenda items placed before it at thissession through the concerted efforts of all therepresentatives of the various countries  thus contributing tobuilding a new  free and peaceful world."
"135",5754,"PRT",48,1993,"Mr. President  I should like to begin by congratulating youon your election to the presidency of the General Assemblyand by expressing our confidence in your ability to steer theproceedings of the present session.I also express our gratitude to the outgoing President Mr. Stoyan Ganev  for the dedicated way in which hefulfilled his mandate and contributed to the rationalization ofthe work of the Assembly.I also congratulate the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whose initiative and commitmenthave already made it possible to take important stepstowards a thorough reform of the United Nations andtowards strengthening its international credibility as anirreplaceable instrument of peace.The universal calling of the United Nations  enshrinedin its Charter  gives special meaning to the accession of sixnew Member States  Andorra  the Czech Republic  Eritrea the Slovak Republic  Monaco and the Former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia; they have reinforced the legitimacyof this forum and assumed  before the internationalcommunity  the responsibility entailed in the full exercise ofnational sovereignty.My Belgian colleague  in his capacity as currentPresident of the Council of Ministers of the EuropeanCommunities  has already had the opportunity to make astatement on behalf of the 12 member States; Portugal fullysubscribes to that statement. I should  however  like to referto a number of issues that are of particular importance to mycountry.The period of global transition now before us is markedby particularly contradictory signs.On the one hand  the détente that surfaced with the endof the cold war has led to an increase in regional integrationand the strengthening of cooperation between States  and hasbrought to life the concept of complementing the activitiesof the United Nations with those of regional organizationsand arrangements.On the other hand  violent nationalistic claims havere-emerged and old and seemingly forgotten antagonismshave resurfaced  leading to an unexpected outbreak ofconflicts that threaten the internal cohesion of States andinternational peace and security.In this context  and more so than ever  the role of theUnited Nations collective security system  now back on thefront line of international relations  seems decisive. For thisreason  we attach great significance to the ongoingrestructuring of the Secretariat. We also deem particularlyimportant the reform of the Security Council  which hasspecial responsibilities and is now free to accomplish itsoriginal mission and to emerge as the driving force behindthe Organization’s political activities in maintaining stabilityand peace.Other organizations  such as the European Community the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) have  in their turn  an important role to play in consolidatingdemocracy  maintaining stability and promoting developmentin the entire European region.It is essential for close cooperation to be establishedbetween those bodies and the United Nations - which has aprimary and universal responsibility - so as to avoidduplication and to enhance what each can contribute to thesearch for peace and stability.Peace-keeping operations have recently undergone aconsiderable expansion  and we are witnessing thedeployment of large numbers of men and women insituations of various natures  including the protection ofhumanitarian assistance missions and preventive diplomacyinitiatives. The involvement of military contingents in thoseoperations requires clear political aims as well as unity ofcommand and close and permanent coordination between theSecretariat and the interested parties  namely the contributingStates and those States that may be able to offer  in aconstructive manner  a political contribution to the peaceprocesses.Resolving the conflicts of today  building peace andpreventing the conflicts of tomorrow will be no simple task.The demands and expectations that fall upon the UnitedNations have no historical precedent  and so every effortmust be made to turn ""An Agenda for Peace"" into a reality.Only then will the Organization be able to cope withthe present and future challenges of maintaining peace 12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessiongiving humanitarian assistance and providing aid fordevelopment.Unfortunately  as I speak  the United Nations isconfronting its greatest financial crisis in 48 years ofexistence and is facing the risk of not being able to assumeits responsibilities in the important domain of maintaininginternational security.This question remains the cornerstone of the futureactivity of the United Nations. If it remains unanswered  theconsequences for the United Nation credibility and for worldpeace will be dramatic.An important development that has resulted from theend of the cold war concerns respect for human rights which are inalienable and universal and figure above allother considerations when we look at a particular politicalregime or model of society. We believe that it is necessaryfor the international community today to judge violations ofhuman rights without double standards.In this respect  I should like to stress the importance ofthe final declaration of the Vienna Conference  whichemphasizes fundamental ideas and principles  specifically those that concern the responsibilities of the internationalcommunity in this area and define human rights as a priorityfor the United Nations. With this aim  it is now urgent forthe General Assembly to discuss  without delay  theestablishment of the post of high commissioner for humanrights.A commonality of values that reflect the dignity of thehuman person is an indispensable component of a betterinternational order allowing the development of peaceful andlasting international relations. Thus  together with peace development and democracy  we consider human rights to beone of the basic principles that should govern internationalsociety.It is precisely because of the imperatives of humansolidarity  and because we believe that the internationalcommunity has an important role to play  that Portugal  bothas a State and as a member of the European Community  isfollowing with deep concern the conflict that  for the lasttwo years  has been devastating parts of the territory of theformer Yugoslavia. Portugal reiterates its firm position thatonly a settlement accepted by the three parties can put anend to this blood-stained chapter in European history.The Portuguese Government truly regrets theinterruption of the latest negotiating round in Geneva at atime when an agreement seemed within reach.We once again urge all the parties involved in theconflict to show the necessary good will and flexibility so asto put an end to the suffering of the affected populations.Portugal considers that it is extremely urgent for a viableand just peace agreement to be signed: Only thus will theconditions for a return to peace be met.Lastly  I wish to pay a tribute to the United NationsProtection Force - in which Portugal has the privilege ofbeing included - to the European Community monitoringmission and to all humanitarian organizations operating inthe area of the former Yugoslavia for the tasks they haveperformed under circumstances of particular hardship.Portugal  a country which is historically and culturallylinked to Africa  is profoundly aware of the unparalleled appalling and ever-deteriorating living conditions prevailingin vast regions of the continent. Today  Africa certainlydeserves the international community’s special attention. Itis in Africa that we should concentrate our principal effortsto end wars that are sometimes forgotten  but that are layingwaste to large areas  and it is to Africa that we should bedirecting economic resources in quantities commensuratewith the unparalleled scale of the problems it is facing.Only by increasing trade flows  economic ties andhumanitarian assistance can we provide a degree of certaintyfor the success of democratization and progress.I should like to refer also to the utmost importance thatwe attach to the work of the Organization of African Unityin the search for solutions to bring an end to the conflictsthat overshadow Africa.In Africa  there are five countries that officially usePortuguese. With these countries we have steadily deepenedour ties in all areas. Based on a common culture and values we are developing  together with Brazil and these Africancountries  a true community of Portuguese-speaking nationsthat is characterized by solidarity and tolerance.It was precisely because of these special ties that myGovernment interceded in the Angolan conflict. Themediation efforts it deployed there  together with the UnitedStates and Russia  resulted in the signing in Lisbon of theAcordos de Paz on 31 May 1991. The year and a half ofpeace that followed those agreements raised in all theAngolan people the legitimate expectation that almost30 years of war were coming to an end. It also revealedForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 13stimulating signs of economic recovery and the advent of anew era of democracy and national reconciliation. Angolanstherefore participated massively in the elections of lastSeptember. The resurgence of war in Angola cause byUNITA’s failure to accept the results of the elections callsfor a new effort from the international community to re--establish the cease-fire and to safeguard the democraticprocess  in accordance with the legitimate wishes for peaceand democracy of the Angolan people.Portugal welcomed the adoption on 15 September ofSecurity Council resolution 864 (1993)  in which theCouncil  in the wake of previous resolutions and underChapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations  decidedupon a set of important measures.I remain convinced that dialogue is possible  and thatonly through direct negotiations between the Government ofAngola and UNITA can a lasting solution and a durablepeace be found. I therefore once again urge UNITA toreturn to the negotiating table  on the basis of the Acordosde Paz and full acceptance of the outcome of theSeptember 1992 elections and the Abidjan guidelines  whichwere reached with the invaluable help of PresidentHouphouet-Boigny and the Government of Côte d’Ivoire.I applaud the peace initiatives undertaken by the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General  to which Portugal together with the two other countries of the troika ofobservers  the United States and Russia  has given itsstrongest support.Only with the restoration of peace will it be possible tobring about an end to the suffering of the Angolan peopleand make possible the provision of the much-neededhumanitarian assistance that the international community isready to provide. In this respect  the efforts already madeby the specialized agencies of the United Nations and theInternational Committee of the Red Cross are to becommended.Regarding Mozambique  the role of the United Nationsin conducting the peace process is for us a source ofsatisfaction. In this context  we welcome the adoption ofSecurity Council resolution 850 (1993)  which is a sign ofthe Organization’s unequivocal commitment to bringing thisprocess to a satisfactory conclusion.Portugal is deeply involved in the Mozambique peaceprocess  not only through its active contribution to theUnited Nations Operation in Mozambique but also throughits participation in the structures created by the GeneralPeace Agreement and through our contributions pledgedduring the donors’ conference last December.We also welcome the results of the recent meetingbetween the President of Mozambique and the leader ofRENAMO  which represented a breakthrough and gavereason for hope in a future of peace and prosperity inMozambique.The positive outcome of that meeting  namely  theagreement on the issues of territorial administration andpolice  has been recognized by Security Council resolution863 (1993)  in which all parties are urged to implementwithout delay all the provisions of the General PeaceAgreement so that the elections can be held in October 1994at the latest.Concerning South Africa  we are following events thereclosely  in particular the multiparty negotiations  which wehope will meet with success and constitute the foundationsof a new  multiracial reality.The withdrawal of significant forces in South Africansociety from those negotiations is a cause for concern  andcould have a negative impact on the normal course of thetransition process  which  as we all hope  will end with theholding of elections next year.The spread of violence in South Africa provides aspecial cause for concern  as pointed out by the EuropeanCommunity observer mission in South Africa and theGoldstone Commission  in both of which Portugal isparticipating actively. We deeply regret the violence  whichcannot but jeopardize the path to national reconciliation.We must stress  however  the positive aspect  namelythe progress achieved with the 7 September agreement at themultiparty negotiations on the creation of the TransitionalExecutive Council. This was achieved by the efforts of thevarious parties that believe in a consensus solution for thepolitical transition in South Africa.I should also like to refer to Mr. Nelson Mandela’spraiseworthy appeal  before the Special Committee againstApartheid  for an end to the economic sanctions imposedagainst South Africa  an appeal which constitutes a valuableencouragement to the process of political reform initiated byPresident F. W. de Klerk.Leaving now the African continent  I would say thatPortugal  because of its very important legal  moral and14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionhistoric responsibilities in the case  continues to devote  asa matter of priority  particular attention to the question ofEast Timor  a Non-Self-Governing Territory recognized bythe United Nations as being under Portuguese administration its decolonization process not having been completed.I should like to reaffirm  at this rostrum  my country’sposition of principle on this question: Portugal accepts infull the relevant resolutions adopted by the GeneralAssembly and Security Council regarding East Timor.These resolutions reaffirm the need to apply  in the case ofEast Timor  the essential principles and rules adopted by thisOrganization on decolonization; those contained not only inthe Charter  but in the historic resolutions 1514 (XV) and1541 (XV) as well. The rejection of military conquest as thebasis for claiming territorial enlargement  the need to respectEast Timor’s territorial integrity and the right of its peopleto self-determination are clearly established in thoseresolutions.We remain firmly committed to achieving  in a peacefuland negotiated manner  a just  comprehensive andinternationally acceptable settlement to this question. Thatsettlement must not fail to meet the standards ofinternational law and must fully respect the legitimate rightsof the East Timorese  who are those most directly concernedand who have been the principal victims of this painful andlong-protracted problem.I should especially like to applaud the efforts of theSecretary-General - and those of his collaborators - underwhose auspices talks have been held with Indonesia aimedat settling this issue. We do recognize how very difficultthis task is as a result of the wide gap between the positionsof the parties on the substance of the question  which is theconclusion of the process of the decolonization of theTerritory. Three rounds of discussions have already takenplace at the Ministerial level  and we are in the process ofadopting a set of confidence-building measures in order toimprove the atmosphere of dialogue and to foster theadvancement of the process.Allow me to quote  in this context  a passage of theprogress report submitted  just a few days ago  by theSecretary-General to the General Assembly:""Equally important and intrinsically linked to thepeace process is the human rights situation in EastTimor. The improvement of the conditions in EastTimor is sine qua non to progress in the talks"".(A/48/418  para. 5)I am sorry to have to say that  unfortunately  the humanrights situation prevailing in the territory continues to elicitcondemnation on the part of the international community.The resolutions adopted this year by the United NationsCommission on Human Rights and by its Subcommission onPrevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minoritiesare a clear demonstration of this. We sincerely hope thatsteps will be taken that will bring about a tangible andgenuine improvement of the situation in the territory and thatthis can be monitored without obstruction. I therefore callupon all Governments and human rights organizations tocontinue to keep a close eye on the situation in East Timor.We are witnessing events of great significance in otherparts of the world. Allow me to emphasize those whichmerit our particular attention.Portugal remains faithful to the construction of anenlarged and strengthened Europe. We are close  therefore to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and  guidedby that objective  we propose to contribute through ourparticipation in the framework of the European Communitywith a view to enhancing dialogue as well as political andeconomic cooperation. This approach will ensure peace stability and economic well-being.In this context of the joint responsibility of all actors onthe international scene  we should encourage the ongoingpolitical and economic reforms in the States that haveemerged from the collapse of the former Soviet Union aimedat a peaceful evolution towards democratic societies basedon the rule of law and fundamental human rights. Wesupport their progressive integration into the internationaleconomy  which will prevent the political division of thepast from being replaced with a new economic gap.Allow me to salute at this point President Yeltsin forhis courage and determination to carry on withoutinterruption the process of political and economic reformthat is indispensable for the complete democratization anddevelopment of the Russian Federation.We lend our unequivocal support to all the efforts madeby the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe(CSCE) and the United Nations - which constitute a goodtest for cooperation between regional organizations and theUnited Nations - to reach peaceful settlements to thedisputes that have arisen on the territory of the former SovietUnion.Regarding nuclear arms control and disarmament Portugal considers the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 15Nuclear Weapons to be an instrument of major importance and looks forward to its indefinite extension at the 1995Review Conference. Portugal urges all the parties that havenot yet done so to ratify it  and reiterates the need for all thenuclear-weapon States that have emerged from the formerSoviet Union to implement and comply with the obligationsresulting from the START I and START II Treaties and theLisbon Protocol.At this point  allow me to stress the importance myGovernment attaches to the work of the Conference onDisarmament  to which my country has recently presented itscandidature for full membership.I wish to refer here to the current negotiations that areseeking to conclude the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade talks. While we hope for their successful conclusion which we consider to be fundamental for the worldeconomy  we also believe that the result should reflect aglobal and balanced solution based on an opening of marketsand a reinforcement of the rules of international trade.I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate theGovernment of Israel and the leaders of the PalestineLiberation Organization for the realism  lucidity  courage andalso imagination they displayed with the conclusion of therecent agreement  which represents a historic step towardsthe achievement of a just  lasting and comprehensive peacefor the Middle East based upon the relevant resolutions ofthe United Nations. The agreement will certainly lend a newand encouraging vitality to the peace process in both itsbilateral and multilateral tracks  irreversibly consolidating thelatest developments.Geographical proximity and historic and cultural tiesjustify the genuine attention with which my country isfollowing the evolution of the situation in the Maghreb.Portugal has stressed  within the European Community andin other international forums  the importance of that regionto security and stability in the Mediterranean. In this sense the declaration of the Heads of State and Government at theLisbon meeting of the Council of Europe set out a newapproach to a political  economic  social and culturaldialogue between the European Community and the Maghreb.Portugal has centuries-old relations of friendship withLatin America. Our special relationship with Brazil cannotbe overemphasized. We are therefore in a position  in thespirit of the recent Ibero-American Summit in Salvador daBahia  to enhance dialogue and cooperation with this region.In this respect  I should like to stress the importance weattach to an agenda for development in the advancement ofa constructive and effective dialogue aimed at identifyingand exploring new forms of solidarity in encouraginginternational cooperation for development.In respect of the activities of the European Community we have been striving to strengthen European ties with LatinAmerica  through the San José process and the Rio group by encouraging the efforts - which have already madeprogress possible - aimed at increasing respect fordemocratic institutions and human rights and developing newforms of economic integration.I should also like to mention the current negotiations onthe preservation of natural resources and the maintenance ofenvironmental balance. The obligations of States go beyondthe mere signature of multilateral treaties. At stake is alegacy to future generations of sufficient  conserved andrenewable resources to ensure their well-being.All efforts in that direction deserve the commitment ofthe international community as a whole  through theimplementation of policies of a continental or even globalscope. The Rio Conference was merely a step on the longroad to convincing the world of the need to preserve theenvironment and to maintain the balance between the meansof production and the human component without resorting todestruction and waste.It is now important to put into practice the decisions ofthe Rio Conference in order to give expression to themeasures decided on there. Portugal will not fail to do itspart  in the full realization that only then shall we be able tobuild a future for coming generations.At this point in its history  the United Nations is facingan unprecedented opportunity and  for the first time  canplay the role originally intended for it  without restriction  inthe resolution of conflicts and the maintenance ofinternational stability and as the custodian of respect forhuman rights.We are all committed to providing a positivecontribution to meeting this challenge. Portugal  for its part will do everything possible to achieve these ambitious goals."
"136",5800,"PRY",48,1993,"This is the first occasion on which I have had the honour toappear before this lofty international body to speak on behalfof my country  Paraguay. I do so with the profoundsatisfaction of representing a genuinely democraticGovernment that has emerged from free elections  and as thefirst civilian citizen who has held the presidency of theRepublic in 39 years.I wish to congratulate you  President Insanally. Yourelection  based on your solid professional knowledge andyour long political career  is a tribute to you personally andto your country  Guyana  which you so worthily represent.I am pleased to recall in this context that Paraguay  since itentered the United Nations as a founding Member in 1945 has always championed the right to the self-determination ofpeoples and the independence of political communitieswhich  like Guyana  came to self-government in fulfilmentof the obligations imposed by the Charter of the UnitedNations.I welcome very warmly the new Members that havejust been admitted: the Czech Republic  the Republic ofSlovakia  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Eritrea  the Principality of Monaco  and Andorra. Thiswelcome is not simply a matter of protocol; it involves therecognition of their respective Governments that I amexpressing on behalf of the Paraguayan Government.A little more than a month ago I inaugurated myGovernment with the firm resolve to strengthen our foreignrelations with all the members of the internationalcommunity  within the natural limitations set by domesticfinancial circumstances and contingencies. I would nowventure to offer some thoughts for the consideration of theGeneral Assembly.The new world order broke suddenly upon the world.The bipolar structure of power has now ceased to exist  andthe change has taken place peacefully. Paraguay haschanged in the same way and with the same rhythm. Todaythe Paraguayan people is the champion of its own destinyand the will of the people prevails. We live in a conditionof respect for human rights  a market economy and Statereform. We have successfully and peacefully carried outextraordinary reforms in the political  economic and socialfields without external assistance  relying solely on ourcitizens’ faith and aspiration to live in peace  with justiceand freedom.The Government of Paraguay respects freedom andpromotes justice; it is striving to widen the opportunities forhuman development and well-being.Economic activity  and in particular the marketeconomy  cannot exist in an institutional vacuum. On thecontrary  a security system must be established that ensuresthe fiscal integrity of all persons  individual initiative and theinviolability of private property  through a stable monetarysystem and efficient public services.The priority of the Paraguayan Government is toguarantee this security  this stability and these services  sothat those who wish to work and produce can enjoy thefruits of their labour and feel motivated to do their workhonestly and efficiently.The Paraguayan people is now aware that it hastriumphed over its many vicissitudes. We have heard manypromises about the advent of the new man. We havewitnessed many tragedies and dashed hopes.Today  we believe that the only path towards the greattriumphs of collective well-being is that of democracy andfreedom. The men and women of Paraguay wish to live intheir own way  respecting the law and prospering inharmony and concord.I would consider my activities of strengthening andconsolidating democracy incomplete if in future mycompatriots could not continue freely to form politicalparties and to elect governments without coercion  if theycould not live in peace with their families and enjoy thehonest fruits of their work  if they could not live fruitfullives and at the end of their days reflect proudly on theirsuccesses and achievements.But as we view the Paraguayan future  we must reflecton a situation fraught with dramatic realities. We haveovercome a domestic political situation which for threedecades had been met with indifference  marginalization and ultimately  condemnation by the international community.We endured that situation because of the labour theingenuity and the great sacrifice of the Paraguayan people.Today we must consolidate our victory and institutionalizedemocracy as the only possible choice.We have run into two main obstacles to the attainmentof that objective: an increasing rate of population growthand a lack of resources to finance our development with therapidity required by the rapid increase in our population andthe pressing need to raise the standard of living and thewell-being of all Paraguayans.We believe that we must be able to count on thecooperation of the industrialized countries in order to ensurethe continued primacy of the values we share with thecommunity of nations.To accelerate our development we call for an extensionof the magnificent collaboration of the United Nationssystem and its many institutions  such as the United NationsDevelopment Programme  which now has a new  dynamicAdministrator and in which the developing countries placegreat hopes; the effective traditional programme of theUnited Nations Children’s Fund  which champions the rightsof children and adolescents; and the United Nations Fund forPopulation Activities  which plays a very important role inregard to the crucial question of population.We call also on the specialized agencies of the UnitedNations system - each of which has in its field greatlyassisted in our countries’ development plans - to redoubletheir efforts  increase their effectiveness by means of greatercreativity  and lower their expenditures by exercising greatercontrol.This cooperation should go hand in hand with domesticefforts to attract assistance on favourable terms and greaterflows of private foreign investment.The financial institutions  especially the World Bankand the Inter-American Development Bank  should speed uptheir assistance by reducing their bureaucracies and shouldprovide the fullest possible support to developing countries’projects and programmes. We recognize the great assistancethey have provided in the past  and we urge them to exceedeven their past achievements in order to ensure a betterfuture for all our countries. If the developing countries donot receive such cooperation  the consequence will be  on theone hand  a prosperous and democratic world with freedomand an abundance of goods for all and  on the other  a worldcorroded by ignorance  poverty and the enslavement of thepoor. It will be difficult for democracy to survive if povertypersists.Establishing economic progress with equity in Paraguaymeans strengthening democracy. My greatest desire as Headof State is to establish the democratic system once and forall in my country.In order to achieve that aim  my Government will actvery responsibly  ensuring that its administration does notForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 3engage in irregularities  and it will be very strict in enforcingthe law. We wish to have the greatest possible transparencyin the whole of the governmental process  in both domesticand international affairs.We believe that the stability of democratic countrieslies  among other things  in the integrity of their civilservants  in the independence of the judiciary  in individualand collective security  and in the State’s efficiency inpromoting development. That is why my Government willpursue and punish anyone who engages in corruption. Inthat way we intend to eradicate corruption.We have undertaken to fulfil these purposes in thecertainty that the international community will be preparedto support us in so doing.Nationalistic passions have flared up in many parts ofthe world  challenging borders and jeopardizing internationalcoexistence. Age-old conflicts still seethe  as can be seenfrom the terrible bloodshed  and havoc in former Yugoslavia.The United Nations has set up more peace-keeping missionsin the last three years than it did in its first 45 years ofexistence.At the same time as we are witnessing these eventswith distress and sorrow  we are rejoicing in the signing ofthe statement of principles between the Government of Israeland the Palestine Liberation Organization. This valuablecontribution to world peace is due to the courage and theclear-sightedness of the leaders on both sides  who havebeen able to overcome the burden of ancestral prejudice toenter into a new harmonious relationship. We also applaudthe participation of countries as mediators in thesenegotiations. They all deserve the world’s admiration.My Government believes that  in compliance with theSan Francisco Charter  the Organization will accept asMembers all those States that fulfil the requirements set outin the Charter.We congratulate the United Nations on the tremendouswork that is being done in its peace missions. Thisdemonstrates not just that the Organization is alert to theneed to find a solution where any event may cause a breachof the peace but also that  in doing so  it tries to realize thehope of peace for suffering peoples  meeting their basicneeds and alleviating their difficulties.The peace to which we aspire cannot come from sterileimmobility or from armed respite. It cannot be imposed. Itmust be dynamic  sincere and generous and must be basedon the principles of solidarity between nations.Let me refer to a contribution from my country reflected in our universal feeling of friendship. A few yearsago  in a small town called Pinasco  a doctor who was adistinguished member of the community proposed that 30July be designated as a day dedicated to friendship. Thisidea spread throughout the Latin American continent and toother regions of the world. For this reason I am pleased tosuggest that the United Nations adopt that date as the worldday of friendship.Events are giving rise to a higher and higher level ofworld and regional interdependence. With the Treaty on theIntegration of the Common Market in the Southern Cone known as MERCOSUR  we in the southern cone -Argentina  Brazil  Paraguay and Uruguay - are seeking animprovement in our economies.The purpose of MERCOSUR is to harmonizeeconomies  to reach better and broader understandings withother economic groups through the provision of mutualfacilities. We hope that the negotiations that have begunwith the European Economic Community  the future NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the AsiaPacific countries will bear fruit.Paraguay gives its fullest support to the creation of thisCommon Market of the South. We hope fervently that therewill be frank and full cooperation in all the negotiationsbetween the four countries involved. All our actions shouldbe really consistent with our aims. It is our sincere desirethat we may reach an understanding that is just and fair andof benefit to everyone.While dealing with economic affairs  I should like alsoto express our desire and hope that full agreement will bereached in the Uruguay Round negotiations. We hope thatthe markets will open up increasingly. We wish to see tradeflowing more freely  without any tariff or other barriers andwithout subsidies  which undermine the competitiveness ofour MERCOSUR products.We fully support the principle of free trade. Onecannot hamper trade by protectionism while professing beliefin the principle of free trade.I have just visited Bolivia  a sister country with whichwe have signed joint agreements and I made an offer to itsGovernment that Paraguay would serve as a link for its entryinto MERCOSUR. I also requested that they themselves  intheir turn  shall serve as a link between MERCOSUR andthe Andean Pact. Through the system of MERCOSUR andthrough the Andean Pact  we have established a fresh and 4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionwe hope  promising arrangement. Today - 29 September -we commemorate the battle of Boquerón  a symbol of thevalour of both peoples which we hope will be a landmarkfor the future in our search for cooperation  understandingand peace.This new era represents a challenge in relationsbetween nations. In the process of the globalization ofeconomies  countries must avoid selfishness. They mustshare their prosperity and technological advances in order toensure effective progress for all mankind. The EuropeanCommunity  the NAFTA countries and the Asia-Pacificcountries should be a dynamic force in economic relations and should not set new limitations on world trade.International coexistence requires that we seek toestablish mutually supportive understandings and agreementsthat will strengthen the collective economy and  thus  everycountry’s individual economy.North America provides a very promising example ofthis. Mexico  Canada and the United States are proposinga zone of free trade between countries that have differentcultures  histories  languages and lifestyles. In spite of thesedifferences they have taken a praiseworthy decision to maketheir economies complementary.NAFTA represents an undertaking to ensure sharedprosperity through collective arrangements. As we enter anew century  these three countries realize that economicprosperity depends  as never before  on the opening of newmarkets across the world and increasing the volume of worldtrade. We hope that when this arrangement is established itwill be of great benefit to the whole of Latin America andthe Caribbean.Economic development should not run counter to thepreservation and protection of the environment. Bothconcepts are valid for everyone  irrespective of differencesin countries’ levels of economic development.Environmental degradation will continue if we keep onapplying such ambiguous criteria as ""environmentalconditionality"". The great meeting on the environment heldat Rio in 1992  after very lengthy deliberations  points us inthe direction of ""sustainable development"" - developmentthat can be made compatible with protection of theenvironment.We need to fulfil the agreement that was reached atRio. We must not go back on the commitments undertakenthere. Neither should there be double standards - differentstandards for industrialized and for developing countries.The latter need the cooperation that was promised at thatmemorable international meeting.With regard to social problems on a world scale  drugtrafficking threatens the economic and political stability ofsome countries. In this area too the United Nations shouldtake the lead in order to combat the scourge of drugs  withall its disastrous consequences for young people and themoney laundering and terrorism that are its ramifications.Paraguay is totally committed to the battle against drugtrafficking  the money laundering resulting from it and allthe other crimes that are associated with drugs. Thisstruggle requires total international cooperation if drugtrafficking is to be eliminated. It has to be recognized thatresponsibility for this undertaking must be shared byproducers  consumers and also intermediaries.The United Nations is preparing for a conference in1995  which will be a special landmark in the whole ofinternational coexistence. I refer to the World Summit forSocial Development that will be held in Copenhagen. TheGovernment of Paraguay applauds this initiative and offersits fullest cooperation at the preparation stage and in thestudies. We are also willing to take an active part in theevent itself.Initiatives of this kind and the 1994 Cairo Conferenceon Population and Development deserve our fullest support.Although  as I have said  the issues to which I referredearlier are of great significance to my country  I wish tomake the point that the raising of educational standards inmy country is my obsession. For this reason  we are tryingto improve human resources so that we may make use of thenew technology which we sorely lack.Education is not simply a commitment on the part ofthe State; it is a challenge shared by all the productivesectors of the country. Technology may provide fresheconomic opportunities resulting in new sources of labour.That is why Paraguay believes that the BolívarProgramme is a good precedent for what can be donebetween countries determined to face the future by sharingtechnologies  innovations and industrial competitiveness.We also hope that the industrialized countries  or thosethat have achieved a high technological level  will show thenecessary will to promote the presence of their companies inour countries  so that their capital and new technology canaccelerate progress in our developing countries.Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 5We shall always stress the need for a more balancedtreatment of the social and economic issues on theinternational agenda. Attention must not be given to socalled new global issues at the expense of the problems ofdevelopment  the struggle against poverty  the defeat ofignorance  and the promotion of international cooperation.After 48 years  men and institutions are able to concedetheir mistakes and can strengthen their convictions in orderbetter to achieve their purposes. The United Nations hasdemonstrated such abilities by renewing and adapting itselfto the demands of our changing world. Paraguay is infavour of this and supports the necessary reforms to adaptthe Charter to the challenges of a new age. In this way willthe United Nations be able to live up to the high ideals andhopes with which it was created.To that purpose  it is vital that it redistribute functionsand responsibilities among its bodies  increase coordinationand streamline its processes. The United Nations should bethe forum for the genuine expression of the aspirations of allMember States and the primary instrument for genuine andpeaceful understanding among all peoples of the world.We must confront and settle the financial crisis whichweighs so heavily on our Organization. It is not logical toassign it tasks without providing adequate means to carrythem out. Let us avoid being moved by political motives totransform that inadequacy into administrative negligence andfinancial paralysis. Let us do the opposite - let ourOrganization be the great forum of the international scene.Let it be renewed  better  more effective and more equitable.With timely intervention  the United Nations hasbrought lengthy conflicts to an end and achieved theirsettlement. This praiseworthy work must be recognized andif  in some cases  the success has not been great  that hasbeen due to struggles between different power centres. Buttoday we are all equally ready to work to achieve moreeffective disarmament and to establish new internationalstandards for the use of nuclear energy to benefit mankindand not to destroy it. We have made considerable progressbut there remains a long way to go before we have full andcomplete security in this area. Paraguay will support adisarmament policy as a commitment to the internationalcommunity.We continue to believe and have always maintained thatthe United Nations should assume leadership  with thesupport of all Member States  in carrying out the necessarychanges to establish the rule of peace and the humandevelopment to which we all aspire.My country wishes to underscore the outstanding workof the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and toexpress its appreciation for his activities aimed at making theUnited Nations and its entire system more efficient.Paraguay has faith in these positive solutions. Wepledge to uphold the legal principles of internationalcoexistence and appeal to the loftiest sentiments and thehighest sense of responsibility of all leaders of the world.My country believes that this can be achieved and urges thatit be made a reality.No more fratricidal wars. Let us all unite in the waragainst underdevelopment  against unemployment  andagainst ignorance  which is the worst of all slaveries.Reiterating our commitment to full support for theUnited Nations  we also reaffirm our resolute cooperationwith the international community and express our deepestdesire for peace  prosperity and development for all thepeoples of the world.I should like to conclude with a message in my nativelanguage  Guaraní:""Ja johayjhú  ñaño pytyvó  icatú haguaicha ñaséténondé oñondivepá. Aguiyéveté.""This means: ""Let us love one another  brothers. Let us helpeach other to move forward together""."
"137",5865,"QAT",48,1993,"It gives me great pleasure to begin my statement bycongratulating Mr. Insanally of Guyana on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session- the ""session of peace"". This choice reflects the confidenceof Member States in his political ability and diplomatic skilland their regard for his country. He will have our fullcooperation and support. We are confident that  with hisexperience and wisdom  he will lead us to success in ourwork.I should like also to express to Mr. Insanally’spredecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  our deep appreciation andgratitude for the excellent manner in which he conducted thework of the General Assembly during its forty-seventhsession.It also gives me great pleasure to welcome  in the nameof the State of Qatar  all the States that recently joined thisForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 17international Organization  which  session after session  hasreaffirmed its universal character. We look forward to thecontribution of these States in an Organization thatrepresents all nations of the world  without exception.On this occasion  I should like to convey to theSecretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  my Government’s deep appreciation for hiscommitment and dedication to the principles of the UnitedNations  for the political ability and diplomatic skill that hehas demonstrated  since he assumed this high position  indealing with international problems and crises  and for hisunremitting efforts  his discernment and his farsightedness inrevitalizing this world Organization so that it may face up tothe challenges posed by a changing world and achieve peaceon earth. This is reflected in part by his praiseworthy reportentitled ""Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  which containsimportant proposals in the areas of preventive diplomacy peacemaking and peace-keeping.The new phase the world has embarked on after the endof the cold war and the emergence of new complexities ininternational relations  side by side with the deterioration ofthe economic situation  especially in developing countries now face the United Nations with new burdens andresponsibilities  which necessitate the restructuring andrevitalization of the Organization in order for it to be able tomeet successfully the demands of a changing world. Assuch restructuring and revitalization should include theactivities of the United Nations in the areas of security andsocial and economic development  the State of Qatarbelieves that it is necessary to consider an increase in themembership of the Security Council in order to make theCouncil more representative of the international community since the number of Member States in the Organization hasrisen  on the one hand  and the balance of power andeconomic weight of some States have changed  on the other.Such an increase should include both permanent andnon-permanent members of the Security Council  and thereshould be adequate representation of each of the fivecontinents. It is necessary  however  that the membership ofthe Council should remain within the manageable limits thatmay enable it to maintain its effectiveness in dealing withworld crises that are constantly increasing in gravity.Since the end of cold war and the disappearance ofEast-West confrontation  major steps have been takentowards arms limitation at the international level. Nucleararsenals have been reduced  nuclear tests have been frozen a Convention on the Prohibition of the Development Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons andon Their Destruction  has been opened for signature andQatar was among the first to sign it. In this respect however  I should like to stress a very important point namely that arms limitation  particularly with respect toweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East  should begiven a high priority in the interests of the peace andstability of the States of the region so that the funds releasedthereby may be channelled to development and theachievement of economic and social progress. This however  must apply to all the States of the region withoutexception. Consequently  it is my country’s view that it isimportant for all the States of the Middle East  withoutexception  to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons. Qatar supports all initiatives aimed atmaking the Middle East a region free from all nuclear andother weapons of mass destruction and their systems ofdelivery  especially as we enter upon a new era of peacewhich  by its nature  contradicts the very idea of developingand stockpiling weapons of mass destruction.The State of Qatar is very much concerned about theinternational economic situation  believing that a stableinternational economic situation is the cornerstone for thebuilding of a new world order that could be characterized bystability  security and prosperity. We are particularlyconcerned about the economic situation of developingcountries  most of which are suffering from a heavy burdenof indebtedness  the service of which exhausts a largeportion of their limited resources which are hardly sufficientto meet the needs of their struggling peoples. We thereforebelieve that addressing the problem of indebtedness is thefirst essential step towards strengthening the economies ofthose countries. We know that there are numerous studiesand propositions on this issue  but what is needed more arethe political will and genuine desire on the part of richcreditor States to solve once and for all the problem ofindebtedness in favour of developing countries  particularlythe African least-developed countries. Needless to say continuing civil wars in the countries of the third world andconflicts among them have taken a heavy toll in the case ofthose countries and their economies. Among those countriesare those of the Gulf region which have had their share ofsuffering because of recent crises and events in the MiddleEast.The security and stability of the Gulf region are theforemost objectives that the State of Qatar seeks to achieveby its efforts and contacts. Security and stability  as we allknow  are important not only to the States of the region  butalso to the entire world because of the region’s strategicimportance and its energy resources that the world needs.The State of Qatar believes that this security and stabilitycannot be achieved other than by cooperation between the18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionStates of the region themselves on the basis of goodneighbourliness  mutual respect  non-interference in internalaffairs  respect for sovereignty and independence  respect forrecognized international borders and for the agreementsconcluded among themselves  and the settlement ofdifferences and of disputes by peaceful means  particularlythrough negotiation  mediation and international adjudication.From this perspective  the State of Qatar supports allefforts being made to solve the dispute over the three islandsof Abu Mousa  Greater Tunb and Smaller Tunb between theUnited Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iranthrough negotiation and by other peaceful means  in the hopethat these peaceful efforts will result in settling alloutstanding issues between the two States. In thisconnection  we welcome the recent statements by officials ofboth countries in which they expressed their desire to resolvethe dispute by peaceful means through bilateral channels.By the same token  the State of Qatar reiterates its fullsupport for the sovereignty of the State of Kuwait and itsterritorial integrity within its international boundaries asdemarcated by Security Council resolution 833 (1993) on theKuwait-Iraq boundaries. The State of Qatar also reaffirmsits concern for the preservation of the territorial integrity ofIraq and calls upon the United Nations and the internationalcommunity to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people especially in basic civilian and humanitarian areas. Thisrequires full compliance by Iraq with all the relevantresolutions of the Security Council  first among which isresolution 687 (1991) in all its provisions.The State of Qatar is following with great interest thesuccessive and positive developments in the march towardspeace in the Middle East. These developments in ouropinion turn a new page in the history of the region. Wehave welcomed the agreement reached by the PalestineLiberation Organization and Israel concerning self-government in the Gaza Strip and Jericho  as a first steptowards a just  complete and lasting solution to thePalestinian question and the Arab-Israeli conflict on the basisof Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) the principle of land for peace  full Israeli withdrawal fromall occupied Arab territories including the holy city of Al-Quds and the Golan Heights  southern Lebanon as well asthe occupied Jordanian territories  and the implementation ofthe legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people including the right of self-determination. This will lay thefoundation for security and stability in the Middle East. Inthis respect  Qatar reiterates its continued support for thepeace efforts undertaken according to and on the basis of theprinciples agreed upon. It looks forward to seeing theongoing negotiations make fundamental and parallel progresson all tracks. Short of this  no real peace  in our view  couldbe achieved in the region.We also follow with hope and admiration the efforts byour sister country  Lebanon  towards political stability security and reconstruction. The State of Qatar will spare noeffort in supporting Lebanon’s sovereignty and sharing in thereconstruction of that country in response to the call ofbrotherhood. In this context  Qatar calls for full andunconditional implementation of Security Council resolution425 (1978).The State of Qatar  which condemns terrorism in anyshape or form  values greatly the question of human rights.This stems from Qatar’s belief in the dignity of man and itsadherence to the eternal principles of Islamic Sharia  whichuphold the right of the individual to a decent life of freedom justice  peace  brotherhood and the equality of all men.Given this belief  Qatar views human rights as a high moralvalue that should not be used as a means of or a pretext forinterference in the internal affairs of other States  and anissue that should not be addressed by varying standards thatdiffer from the case of one State to the other. In view of theuniversal character of human rights  their basic principlesshould include the right to self-determination and theinherent link between human rights and the right todevelopment. In view of the fact that each society has itsown customs  traditions  culture and principles which itcherishes and adheres to in line with its creed and outlook consideration should be given to the historical and culturalframeworks of the Arab and Islamic world as well as tothose of other cultures and civilizations. Here I should liketo point out with justified pride that Islam  14 centuries ago upheld the right of the individual to live in peace  freedomand dignity. This is the true picture of human rights inIslam.The international community  as represented by theGeneral Assembly and the Security Council  has condemnedthe Serbian aggression in the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina and the unprecedented practice of ""ethniccleansing"" of which the Bosnian Muslim people was thevictim. But what use condemnation? Condemnation hashad no effect whatsoever  as it has not been backed byaction: the successive resolutions adopted by the SecurityCouncil have remained ineffective; aggression did not stop;""ethnic cleansing"" continued  the safe areas have not beensafe and even relief assistance did not reach the people inthe besieged cities and areas. Yet  the Security Council hasnot taken the necessary steps to enforce compliance with itsresolutions as it has done in other cases. Even the armsForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 19embargo the Council imposed on the former Yugoslavia wasnot lifted in the case of the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina regardless of the fact that lifting it wouldenable the Bosnians to exercise their legitimate right ofself-defence; nor were the offers of some Islamic States tosend forces to take part in protecting the safe areas accepted.Now  if this painful situation does not change and if thenecessary measures to enforce these resolutions are nottaken  history will record our disgraceful failure to upholdthe principles of the Charter and to force aggressors torespect the norms of international legality. Besides  we mustnot forget that it is important not to allow such graveviolations to continue to be committed with impunity. Theseviolations are crimes against humanity and  therefore  theState of Qatar fully supports the resolution relating to theestablishment of the International Tribunal to prosecute warcrimes in the former Yugoslavia.The State of Qatar follows with great interest thedevelopments in the Russian Federation. We hope that thatFederation will overcome its crises so that it may continueto perform its important role in resolving global crises in itscapacity as a permanent member of the Security Council  aco-sponsor of the peace negotiations in the Middle East anda participant that has taken significant steps in the area oflimiting nuclear armaments.Qatar supports the United Nations operation in oursister country  Somalia  and welcomes the determination ofthe world Organization to continue this operation  whichaims at restoring peace and security in that country and atthe reconstruction of its State institutions in spite of all thedifficulties. We call upon the Somali leaderships to continuethe process of national reconciliation  to support the UnitedNations efforts  to play their role in the process of politicalreconstruction and to refrain from doing anything that wouldobstruct that process.The State of Qatar follows with interest the historicpositive developments taking place in the Republic of SouthAfrica  and welcomes the progress that has been madetowards the final dismantling of the hideous system ofapartheid and the establishment of a democratic system forthe first time in the history of that country. Whilewelcoming these important developments in the politicalarena in this Republic  Qatar supports the call by Mr. NelsonMandela  president of the African National Congress  forlifting the economic sanctions imposed on his country andfrom which its people have been suffering for years. This in our opinion  would promote the democratic process andconsolidate economic development in that country.Stability of the situation in South-East Asia was amongthe positive results we have witnessed in the peacefulsettlement of conflicts. This was achieved by resolving theconflict in Cambodia  drafting the new constitution andrestoring the monarchy. This peace was achieved after longyears of persistent struggle under the leadership of NorodomSihanouk for establishing peace and security in the countryand restoring its territorial integrity and its sovereignty overits whole territory. In this connection  we commend thecontinuous efforts made by the United Nations and itsSecretary-General  efforts that paved the way for electionsand led to success of the peace process in Cambodia.The last decade has witnessed increasing interest inenvironmental issues at both the official and popular levels.Indeed  the environment has become a high priority on theagendas of States and an integral part of their nationalinterests and security. This is a positive and necessarydevelopment. It is  however  most important in this respectto identify precisely the sources of pollution and therelationship between the environment and economicdevelopment. The imposition of an energy tax at the presenttime would limit the possibilities of development in the Stateof Qatar and other oil-exporting States. It would affectadversely their ability to meet their obligations and limittheir ability to finance the exploration and productionoperations that would enable them as producers to satisfy theincreasing demand on oil. In an independent world  suchnegative effects will not be limited to the oil-exportingcountries but will extend to other countries and to othereconomic sectors all over the world. It is obvious that theidea of an energy tax on exporting countries is unfair bothin its proposed rates on the sources of environmentalpollution and in comparison with other sources of pollution such as coal. The negative environmental effects of the useof coal far exceed those of the use of oil. Notwithstandingsuch facts  however  we find that the tax rates have beenproposed in the reverse ratio to the effects of the pollutants.On the other hand  the proposed tax does not take intoconsideration the amount of pollution caused by everyindividual State. A single major industrial country may verywell pollute the environment to a far greater extent than anynumber of oil-producing countries put together. Regardlessof this  however  the tax targets the latter in a manner thatsuggests objectives other than the preservation of theenvironment.It is no exaggeration to state that the world we all livein faces numerous challenges. The economic  social andpolitical problems which face many countries in today’sworld have become so enormous and so complex that theymay well seem intractable. However  if we let ourselves be20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionguided by the spirit of the Charter and the principles of ourworld Organization  and if we stand as one behind theUnited Nations  we are bound to find proper solutions tothose problems  which have become a common denominatorto all the States of the world. There is no other way but towork harder in the context of world solidarity andinternational cooperation towards the building of a worldwherein the lights of peace  security  stability and well-beingwould shine brightly."
"138",5911,"ROU",48,1993,"There can be no doubt that today ""transition"" isthe key word that defines the process that my country  alongwith others  is undergoing. The inclusion in the agenda ofthe General Assembly of an item on countries in transitionexemplifies the Assembly’s capacity to respond swiftly tothe concerns of its members.Last year  my predecessor stressed to the GeneralAssembly the importance of Romanian society’s capacity tolearn. Since then  my country has continued to learn thatdemocracy  the rule of law  political pluralism  a marketeconomy  and respect for human rights and fundamentalfreedoms are necessary conditions for individual potentialand aspirations to be fulfilled.We have also learned that the transition will last longerthan expected  that the challenges it presents are greater thanwe imagined and that its social costs are heavier than wefirst estimated. However  these bitter lessons do not in anyway dissuade us from our irreversible choice: democracyand a market economy.As the Assembly may know  during 1992 free and fairlocal  general and presidential elections took place inRomania. The first stage of restructuring the political lifeand strengthening the rule of law has thus been completed.Clearly  the political process is still undergoing changes.Eleven parties are now represented in Parliament. Moreover a special provision of our electoral law guarantees a seat inthe legislature for each national minority  even if theirpolitical organizations did not obtain the required minimumof votes. At the same time  there is a slow but steady trendtowards a clearer shaping of political diversity into strongerand better defined political forces.As for economic restructuring  in March 1993 theGovernment formed after the general elections presented itsstrategy for economic and social reform to the RomanianForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 21Parliament. The central idea of this strategy is that thetransition to a market economy should be as fast as possible.While focusing on privatization and structural changes  atboth the macro-economic and micro-economic levels  theGovernment also pays particular attention to their socialcosts.This year we have taken some decisive steps. On 1May the Government ended all subsidies for the productionof consumer goods and as of 1 July the value added taxbecame the sole fiscal instrument.We already note a growing interest on the part of somemajor Western companies in investing in and cooperatingwith viable Romanian companies. This augurs well for thestimulation of economic activity.However  our economy still faces some majordifficulties  inherent in the transition period. At the sametime  unfavourable external circumstances have during thelast three years triggered a dramatic fall in the output ofimportant economic sectors. They include the reduction ineconomic cooperation with neighbouring countries and theadverse effects of the successive United Nations embargoesimposed on Iraq  Libya and the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia  all strictly observed by Romania.Our experience over recent years has shown thatinternal efforts can be decisively catalyzed by foreignassistance  both financial and managerial. Therefore  webelieve that international assistance in the next few yearscould speed up our reform process and boost industrialproduction  while improving the Romanian economy’sintegration into the world economy.To sum up  we can state at this juncture that theessential lesson we have drawn from this period of transitionis that - in spite of undeniable difficulties - there is noturning back. We shall respect and follow the irreversiblechoice of the Romanian people to join the family ofdemocratic nations.In our view  democracy and the new role of the UnitedNations are not only complementary  but mutuallystrengthening. In this respect  I should like to quotePresident Woodrow Wilson in his Address to the UnitedStates Congress on 2 April 1917  as follows:(spoke in English)""A steadfast concert for peace can never be maintainedexcept by a partnership of democratic nations. Noautocratic Government could be trusted to keep faithwithin it or observe its covenant. It must be a leagueof honour  a partnership of opinions"".(spoke in French)These ideas are still valid  and constitute precisely theobjective we must strive for  devoting all our efforts tostrengthening and giving new substance to the role of theUnited Nations. While remaining loyal to its basicprinciples and goals  the Organization must naturally adaptto the new political climate. Deeply and sincerelycommitted to the spirit of the United Nations Charter Romania intends to support fully the ideas andrecommendations contained in the Secretary-General’s report""An Agenda for Peace"". In so doing  my country regardsthe United Nations  as described in the report of theSecretary-General on the work of the United Nations ""as the instrument of the body of Member States and ... as more than the sum of its parts."" (A/48/1 para. 512)Mindful that implementing the lofty ideals of the UnitedNations requires adequate resources  we are ready to supportfully every effort to make better use of resources  with thecontributing nations having stricter control. Firm measuresare needed. Accountability must become the watchwordboth for the Organization’s daily work and for its futureprojects.Enlargement and diversification of programmes foreconomic and social development and for protection of theenvironment are imperative. It is  however  important tomake sure that money allocated to these programmes is notwasted on piles of paper and unnecessary travels around theworld.Peace-keeping operations  which have undergone suchan impressive expansion in recent years  have similarrequirements. Increased attention should be given to theratio of costs to benefits and control of the use of resources.The new political climate  which has brought anenhanced role for the Security Council  has made possible amore effective use of the United Nations potential forcontrolling and resolving conflicts.22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionRomania is determined to contribute to the best of itsability to United Nations peace-keeping operations  and tothis end has already started a special programme to increaseits capacity to respond adequately to the requirements of theOrganization or of other institutions. A first battalion ofprofessional military personnel is already being trained forsuch operations; we estimate that it could becomeoperational at the beginning of next spring.Given the need to enhance the capacity of the UnitedNations in this dynamic exercise of its functions  the supportand cooperation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationand the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europeare all the more needed and welcomed. In this regard  thecontributions of other regional agreements and organizations and particularly the praiseworthy work carried out by theNorth Atlantic Cooperation Council  are of great importance.At the same time  in order to preserve the prestige andcredibility of peacekeeping operations and to ensure theconfidence of the international community  such operationsmust strictly observe the principles and premises which havecontributed to their success thus far. Therefore  we must becautious in granting any unilateral authority that somecountries might be tempted to assume in areas where theyhave special interests. This applies especially when there aredoubts about the impartiality of forces involved  or when thenecessary consent of the host country may be prejudiced byany kind of pressure.Wisdom and caution are all the more necessary in thisrespect  since we recognize the United Nationspeace-keeping operations as an important dimension of afuture new world order.Human beings and their creative potential must alwaysremain the central focus of all our endeavours. We welcomethe encouraging results of the World Conference on HumanRights  and we hope that these conclusions  including thoseconcerning the creation of a post of High Commissioner forHuman Rights  will be implemented as soon as possible.We also hope that the World Summit on SocialDevelopment  to be held in 1995  will be even moresuccessful.I am very pleased to reaffirm that respect for the humanperson has become a generally accepted norm in our strategyfor social development. Romania is now a party to almostall the major international agreements on human rights andis engaged with all openness in the relevant internationalprocedures.International commitments to uphold human rights andthe rule of law are closely linked to national legislationthrough a constitutional clause that enshrines the primacy ofinternational regulations over domestic law. The admissionof Romania as a member of the Council of Europe  as wasrecommended earlier today by an overwhelming majority inthe Council’s parliamentary assembly  will complete thispicture. In short  international standards and norms are atthe same time our standards and norms.Certainly  progress  particularly in the field of humanrights  is not just a matter of drafting and passing new lawsand regulations: it is also a matter of their implementationin a social environment. No less important is the economicaspect. Standards of living and quality of life have aconsiderable impact on human rights. That is why we arestriving to make social protection a basic dimension of ourreform programme.The protection of the rights of people belonging toethnic minorities is an integral part of the protection ofhuman rights. In Romania there are 14 national and ethnicminorities registered as such through their political parties ororganizations. All together they represent about 10 per centof the population. Since 1989 we have been making steadyefforts to institute measures to protect the rights of personsbelonging to national minorities.The establishment this year of the National Council ofMinorities broadened the institutional framework  enablingeach and every national minority in Romania to take part inthe decision-making process regarding the protection of theirethnic  cultural  linguistic and religious identity. It is truethat we have not responded completely to all their demandsand aspirations. The explanation for this lies  not in a lackof will  but in the difficulties confronting the entirepopulation.Yet we would underline that the excessive use ofminority-related issues is harmful to the interests ofminorities themselves  those of the majority of thepopulation  and those of the international community as awhole. Unfortunately  such tendencies  expressingaggressive nationalism as well as xenophobia  racism andanti-Semitism  are still significant destabilizing factors anda threat to international peace and security in Eastern andCentral Europe as elsewhere. Caution is therefore needed indealing with these phenomena  as well as with the so-callednew concept of the right to self-determination  in order toprevent any debasement of its legal content.Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 23The Romanian delegation would like to avail itself ofthis opportunity to reaffirm its great satisfaction over theIsraeli-Palestinian declaration of principles on Palestinianself-rule in Gaza and Jericho  signed on 13 September 1993in Washington  D.C. In the view of the RomanianGovernment  their mutual recognition and the declaration ofprinciples represent a triumph of the reason and political willof both the Israeli Government and the Palestine LiberationOrganization  thus opening up new possibilities for peacefulcoexistence and collaboration  not only between their twopeoples  but among all the peoples in the region. The lion’sshare of the credit certainly goes to the two parties directlyinvolved  but we cannot overlook the contribution of theinternational community  of the United States Government and of the Governments of other countries. In thisconnection  I am very pleased to recall the constant effortsdeployed by my country for peace and understandingbetween the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.With regard to the conflict in the eastern region of theRepublic of Moldova  the conclusions expressed last year bythe Romanian delegation are  unfortunately  still valid inlarge part. No progress whatsoever has been made towardsthe political solution of the conflict. Moreover  we arewitnessing a strange situation in which the commander-in-chief of the 14th Russian army - a foreign army on thenational soil of an independent country without the consentof that United Nations Member - was recently ""elected"" asa member of the so-called local parliament.In our opinion  the withdrawal of foreign troops is thekey to the solution of the conflict in the Transdniestr area.We note with full satisfaction that a similar viewpoint isshared by the international community. A resoluteaffirmation of this position at the current session of theGeneral Assembly would be instrumental in upholding theindependence and territorial integrity of the Republic ofMoldova. The recent positive developments on thewithdrawal of the Russian troops from the Baltic countries an item which is to be debated at the current session of theGeneral Assembly  could serve as a useful precedent.Within the same framework we should like toacknowledge the efforts of the mission of the Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and to assure itof our full support for the accomplishment of its tasks. Wefavour the resumption of the quadripartite mechanism ofmeetings between the Ministers of Foreign Affairs from theRepublic of Moldova  Romania  the Russian Federation andUkraine.The Republic of Moldova needs both the understandingand the support of the international community. A verypromising sign in this respect is the prompt internationalreaction to the so-called trial in Tiraspol  where a group ofpersons was detained for political reasons by theself-proclaimed authorities of Transdniestr. Their lives arestill in danger. This trial reveals the political nature of theconflict in the Republic of Moldova.Despite the energetic diplomatic efforts made to date the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia are far from beingresolved. As a neighbour and friend to all the successorStates  Romania is genuinely interested to see the earliestpossible resumption of normal life in that region. Putting anend to the sufferings of the people and to the continual life-threatening risks to the lives of the members of the UnitedNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) is an immediateimperative.Romania reiterates its great appreciation of the constantefforts deployed by the two Co-Chairmen of the PeaceConference on Yugoslavia. In this context we should stressthe Romanian Government’s commitment to continuing itsefforts for a peaceful settlement of the Yugoslav conflict andits support for the peace process co-sponsored by the UnitedNations and the European Community.Convinced that a negotiated peace is the onlyacceptable solution to the conflict  Romania will add itsdiplomatic efforts to those of other countries in the region.The success of our joint efforts is vital for the new Europewe wish to build and for the future stability of the region.In the context of the Yugoslav crisis  Romania compliesstrictly with the sanctions regime imposed by the relevantSecurity Council’s resolutions. Despite painful effects onour economy in the midst of a period of crisis and transition we consider these measures a necessary means of supportingthe peace-seeking efforts.The presence of European Economic Community andCSCE sanctions assistance missions and of a small WesternEuropean Union fleet that is patrolling the Romanian sectorof the river has tightened the already-existing monitoringmechanisms. We have also engaged in close coordinationwith the other riparian countries.Notwithstanding these efforts  we have not receivedsuitable compensation to defray our tremendous economiclosses. We are certainly encouraged by the increasingawareness on the part of the international community and theSecurity Council  in the spirit of Article 50 of the United24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionNations Charter  with respect to the difficulties beingexperienced by Romania and other affected countries. Weshould like  however  to see this spirit given material form.The United Nations bodies and international financialinstitutions should respond to the needs of our countriesrather than leave us to fend for ourselves in seekingsolutions to the burdensome difficulties we face as a resultof acting as loyal Members of the United Nations.We welcome the serious debate in various UnitedNations bodies on the issue of compensations. Therecommendations adopted by the Committee of the SecurityCouncil established under resolution 724 (1991) expressgenuine moral support and solidarity. Unfortunately  wemust accept the fact that moral support is not enough; wecannot face serious economic needs with nothing more thanfine words. We await strengthened consultative mechanismsfor considering concrete solutions to these problems  and wehope that the international financial institutions will be morereceptive.This would bring well-deserved assistance to theaffected countries  while at the same time increasingconfidence in the authority of the United Nations Charterand its ability to preserve the dedication of countries to thecause of peace.We believe that the end of the cold war will result innew general and specific duties for the members of theinternational community. If our common goals as Membersof the United Nations are democracy  peace and security then solidarity is an essential means of achieving thosegoals. One of the most original contributions the UnitedNations could make during the current United NationsDecade of International Law would be to define the legalcontent of the ""duty of solidarity"" which should beimplemented in consonance with the universally acceptedprinciples of jus gentium  democracy and human rights. Inour view solidarity should become one of the centralstrategic values of the new world order.Undoubtedly we still live in a time of great challengesfor the world community and the United Nations. Thoughit is true that many of the great expectations raised by theend of the cold war have not yet been fulfilled  we shouldnot give up hope. The best way to turn hope into reality isto work together  leaving both unfruitful habits and selfishconsiderations behind us. Our joint efforts must  above all be an expression of a vital  powerful solidarity and ofconfidence in what we can do together for a bettertomorrow."
"139",5957,"RUS",48,1993,"First of all  I should like to congratulate you Mr. President  on your election to your important post. I seeit as a manifestation of respect for the peace-loving policyof Guyana  and as a tribute to the growing role of LatinAmerican and Caribbean countries in international affairs.Last year demonstrated the great potential for dramainherent in the post-confrontational and post-communistworld. We have seen that the very highest levels ofcooperation are achievable. We see truly exciting prospectsin yesterday’s address by President Bill Clinton of theUnited States and in other statements already delivered fromthis rostrum.At the same time  developments in the formerYugoslavia  Abkhazia and Karabakh have also revealed thetrue depths of barbarism and the significant new threat ofaggressive nationalism.Outbursts of violence caused by xenophobia  even intraditionally prosperous countries  have shown that no one issafe from this danger. It is no less serious a threat to peacetoday than nuclear war was yesterday. The worldcommunity mustered the strength to stave off the nucleardanger. An important guarantee against this was theRussian-American START II Treaty. Nowadays we allconfront the equally formidable challenge of a newgeneration of conflicts and wars triggered by nationalist political and religious intolerance. That is why democracyand peacemaking must be the key terms defining the strategyof the world community as it moves into the twenty-firstcentury.The United Nations is now turning to face this newchallenge. The successful United Nations operation inCambodia was one of the largest in the history of theOrganization. Life is returning to normal in a country solong torn by civil war. We stand ready  together with othermembers of the international community  to help the peopleof Cambodia to rebuild their country.Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 15We have seen a political and psychologicalbreakthrough in the solution of the key problem of theMiddle East settlement  which is the problem of Palestine.We pay tribute to the courageous leaders of Israel and thePLO who have taken the first and most difficult step towardsmutual recognition and reconciliation. We are ready toparticipate in an international conference on the economicdevelopment of self-governing Palestinian territories.Russia  as a co-sponsor of the Conference on the MiddleEast  will spare no effort to advance the peace process in allother areas.However  the key to the settlement of many conflictshas not yet been found. Russia will continue to encouragethe parties to the Bosnian conflict not to lose the chance ofa peaceful settlement and will contribute to the operation forits implementation under United Nations command.Twice during wartime I have had occasion to visitSarajevo. I propose that the United Nations should place thecity under its moral and political protection and that itshould be declared a centre of coexistence and a meetingpoint for Islam  the Orthodox Church  Catholicism and otherreligions. The city should become a symbol for the wholeworld  a reminder that political violence and intoleranceunder the banner of religion are the worst possible crimesagainst religion itself and the human spirit. In any case  itis surely time to think of establishing closer contactsbetween the United Nations and the world’s leadingreligions.The international community seems to have turned ablind eye to Afghanistan and Angola as soon as they ceasedto be pawns in the cold war. The United Nations has noright to leave millions of people who live there in the gripof an epidemic of ethnic  clan and religious extremism andto forget their economic and humanitarian problems including that of the liberation of former Soviet prisoners ofwar.We must learn the lessons of the United Nationsoperation in Somalia and considerably improve itseffectiveness. Conscious of its special responsibility formaintaining peace  Russia has made peacemaking and theprotection of human rights  particularly those of nationalminorities  the priority of its foreign policy  first andforemost in the territory of the former USSR.We will spare no effort to strengthen theCommonwealth of Independent States and make it a positivefactor  not only regionally  but globally. I call uponMembers of the United Nations to support proposalssubmitted jointly by the members of the Commonwealth ofIndependent States to the present session  relating inparticular to the non-proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  the struggle against international terrorism andthe protection of the environment.Our peacemaking efforts are already yielding their firstresults. For more than a year now there have been nohostilities in the Transdniester region and South Ossetia.With our participation  the process of normalization of thesituation and national dialogue has started in Tajikistan.Russia is making active efforts to put an end to theAbkhazian and Karabakh conflicts and to renderhumanitarian assistance to their victims.All these problems are too serious and too tragic forspeculation about neo-imperial plans of Russia  diplomaticrivalry  or the search for new spheres of influence byneighbouring and distant Powers. The United Nations  theConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and all States truly interested in peace  along with Russia will have enough work to do together. We want to seemuch more active assistance for our peacemaking efforts not in words  but in deeds.In most cases this means that the United Nations shouldgive a mandate for operations conducted at the request ofconflicting parties on the basis of appropriate agreements.For this  close interaction with the United Nations and theCSCE missions is essential. Also  our minds should be opento non-traditional methods  such as the participation ofcontingents of the conflicting parties themselves and thoseof a neighbouring mediating State. The pragmatic nature ofsuch a model was shown in particular in the Transdniesterregion and in South Ossetia. This model should be used and not disregarded  in other regions  in the interests of theUnited Nations  which is facing an overload of peace-keeping operations. The collective peacemaking forces ofthe Commonwealth of Independent States could also interactwith the United Nations itself. It is in any case time toestablish closer relations between the two organizations.In material and financial terms the burden ofpeacemaking borne by Russia alone today in the territory ofthe former USSR must be lightened. This could meanestablishing a voluntary fund for this purpose. Of course Russia realizes that no international organization or group ofStates can replace our peacemaking efforts in this specificpost-Soviet area.16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionBy and large  taking into consideration the wideexperience gained throughout the world  it is time to thinkof a modern overall strategy of peacemaking which wouldbe integrated with ""An Agenda for Peace"" proposed by theSecretary-General.The Russian Federation  as an initiator of the statementof the President of the Security Council on peacemaking andpeace-keeping issues  made on 28 May 1993  makes thefollowing proposals.The first is to define a clear-cut concept of politicalleadership by the Security Council  create an effectivemilitary command under the supervision of the Secretary-General and establish a procedure for involving  on thatbasis  regional organizations.The second is to establish under Article 29 of theUnited Nations Charter a special Security Council committeeon improving peace-keeping operation practices. This couldinclude those States which have already gained considerableexperience in this area of United Nations activity.Our third proposal is to set up United Nations stand-byforces which would be at the disposal of Member States andused in peacemaking operations with the consent of theirGovernments on a case-by-case basis at the request of theSecretary-General.All these questions directly relate to the process ofrenewal of the United Nations. The reform of UnitedNations bodies  including the Security Council  will makesense and be effective if it allows for a more adequateresponse to new challenges in the field of peacemaking.The settlement of conflicts should go hand in hand withthe international protection of their victims. As a follow-upto the Geneva International Conference on the Protection ofVictims of War  we propose that international legalrestrictions be imposed on the use in internal conflicts of themost destructive and indiscriminate types of weapons primarily military aircraft and artillery-rocket systems. Weshould also eliminate or call a halt to the use of mercenariesand volunteers both in domestic and international conflicts.We propose the establishment of a permanentinternational tribunal to deal with crimes against humanity.The inevitability of punishment will help to prevent therecurrence of such atrocities.It has become crucially important to addresscomprehensively the problem of refugees and to specify therelevant principles of international law at a specialconference.Peacemaking cannot be separated from the protectionof human rights. The international community is duty-boundto condemn strongly ""double"" or lower standards of humanrights protection  the theory and practice of the superiorityof rights of an ""indigenous"" nation and the creation of mono-ethnic States. The time has come to establish a UnitedNations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Followingthe example of the Conference on Security and Cooperationin Europe  it is time for the United Nations also to have aSpecial Rapporteur on National Minorities. We support theproposals of the Secretary-General in the field of humanrights protection.The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction woulddirectly contradict the peacemaking efforts of the UnitedNations. This poses an ever growing threat not only in thefuture but even at the present. We are ready to cooperatewith the United States and other countries in solving theproblems connected with cutting off fissionable materialproduction and banning the construction of facilities for suchproduction  particularly in conflict areas.We are in favour of transforming the NuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty into a universal agreement ofunlimited duration. The United Nations should also work toensure the universality of and strict compliance with theConvention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.Russia reiterates  from this rostrum of the GeneralAssembly  its intention to adhere to the international regimeof non-proliferation of missile technology. In the very nearfuture  we intend to take concrete steps to strengthen ourrelevant domestic legislation  going so far as to envisagecriminal prosecution for violations of the rules governing theexport of missile equipment and technology. We call on allStates that possess such technology to join the MissileTechnology Control Regime (MTCR). It is also necessaryto provide for equality of rights and obligations of theparticipants  so as to enable them freely to export peacefulspace technology.Successful economic reform is one of the guarantees ofpeace. This is of particular relevance to the many developingcountries and to the post-communist States. Easier access toworld markets for countries with transitional economies including Russia  and the lifting of all discriminatoryrestrictions is becoming an issue of the highest priority. WeForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 17believe that the General Assembly should express its supportfor efforts in this direction. We also propose theestablishment of a mechanism to coordinate programmescarried out by the institutions of the United Nations systemin support of economic reforms in countries in transition.The strengthening of democracy is the principalguarantee of security and socio-economic development in theworld today. This has been true in Europe  Asia  Africa andLatin America  although the process is not proceeding easilyand automatically everywhere. Peoples who have risen upagainst totalitarianism are threatened by the risk of politicalviolence and ultra-nationalism.We categorically reject such an alternative. Russia ispeacefully transforming itself in accordance with thefundamental principle of democracy: free elections. In 1991 the people of Russia elected their country’s first democraticPresident  and they confirmed their confidence in his policiesat the April referendum this year. On the basis of thistwofold mandate  the President has taken decisive measuresto ensure democratic elections to the Parliament inDecember of this year. Thus  the old totalitarian system ofpower will be definitively dismantled and replaced by a newsystem of power elected by the people and responsible onlyto the people. We invite international observers to monitorthe elections to the Parliament.In building a new democratic Russia  we of course mustfirst of all rely on our own potential. Yet we very muchappreciate the solidarity the democratic community hasshown us. Such solidarity is neither an act of interferencein our domestic affairs nor the whimsical gesture ofromanticists in international politics. It is simply anexpression of the human duty to protect the rights ofindividuals in other countries.Next month will mark the fiftieth anniversary of theMoscow Conference when  in the turbulent year of 1943  thefoundation was laid for the establishment of the UnitedNations  which was conceived as an organization ofdemocratic countries having triumphed over Nazitotalitarianism. Half a century later  the success ofdemocracy in Russia and many other countries has made itpossible for the first time to realize fully the lofty destiny ofthe United Nations and to help it become a truly efficientpeacemaking Organization.We should not allow political short-sightedness  currenteconomic difficulties  egoism and conceit to make us losethe chance to transform the still fragile post-communistworld into a democratic one. I hope that this session willmove us closer to an understanding of this goal and of theways of reaching it in the interests of all States and nations."
"140",6004,"RWA",48,1993,"I am experiencing a feeling of signal honour andgenuine pleasure  and also at the same time a deep feelingas I now  on behalf of my country  Rwanda  speak beforethis prestigious General Assembly of the United Nations which each year considers the fate of our world.Above all  I should like to associate myself with theeminent speakers who have spoken before me here  toextend to you  Sir  on behalf of the delegation of which I amthe head  our warmest congratulations on your election to thepresidency of the United Nations General Assembly at itsforty-eighth session. We are assured that your personalqualities and your extensive experience in internationalissues will assist you in discharging this difficultresponsibility. Your personal qualities and your experienceare the best guarantee of the success of the work of thepresent session. We also wish to congratulate all the othermembers of the General Committee  who  we are sure  willspare no effort in assisting you in successfully dischargingthe difficult task entrusted to you. The delegation of theRepublic of Rwanda will spare no effort to participateactively and effectively to ensure a successful conclusion ofthe debate on the items on the agenda of this session.Moreover  we wish to render a well-deserved tribute toyour predecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  who was alwaysinspired by the same concern for effectiveness in the causeof peace  justice and international security. He deserves ourdeep gratitude for having guided with wisdom andcompetence the work of the forty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly.We should also like to take advantage of this happyopportunity to warmly welcome the presence here with us ofnew Member States  the admission of which is an importantstage towards achieving the universality of the Organization.The forty-eighth session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly is opening at a time when the world presents to usa rather gloomy picture. Here and there are several scatteredislets of peace and prosperity but they are few indeed.Moreover  in various corners of the world armed conflictsand political tensions are ready to explode into open crisisand economic and social ruin. In many countries we findpoverty and upheavals in the quest for more balancedsocieties  and everywhere there is anguish in the face of somany challenges which confront the conscience of man andwhich spawn fear for the future.Fortunately  good will is being demonstrated andmobilized at the level of States  non-governmentalorganizations  and regional and international organizations -in the forefront of which is the United Nations - to arousethe universal conscience  extinguish the fires  accompanypolitical change  allay misery and renew hope and theenjoyment of life for those for whom the horizon seemsclosed and gloomy.It is an appropriate time and place to pay a sinceretribute to the world Organization and to its tirelessSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for all theactions undertaken and carried out with skill and designed torestore peace in regions and countries devastated by war  toprevent other conflicts  and to assist disadvantaged peoplesor those sorely tried by disasters of all types. To be sure the means are limited  but is not this Organization the lasthope of people?And success nurtures that hope. Thus we welcomeenthusiastically the end of the civil war in Cambodia and there-establishment of State institutions in that country.Rwanda welcomes the progress that has been madetowards a settlement of the conflict in Mozambique and isfollowing particularly closely the political developments inSouth Africa. While the system of apartheid in the latter hasnot yet been completely eliminated  recent developmentspromise positive and rapid progress.Rwanda is also most gratified at the very positivecourse of the Middle East peace negotiations  which  thanksto mutual recognition between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and to the signing  inWashington on 13 September 1993  of an agreement onPalestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho  have just gonethrough a very important stage. We hope that this historicagreement  which lays the bases for reconciliation betweenIsraelis and Palestinians  will open the way to a lastingsolution to all the issues connected with the problem of theMiddle East and will lead ultimately to peace and calm inthat part of the world.To that end  we call on the international community toredouble its efforts to secure positive results for the attemptsnow being made to settle the conflicts in Bosnia andHerzegovina  Liberia  Angola  Somalia and all othercountries where peoples are being battered  divided andplunged into misery by individual or tribal egoism andambition or are having their sovereignty threatened by theinordinate greed of other States.At the level of international economic relations  it isdepressing to note that  to this day  three quarters ofmankind live on the sidelines of economic and socialprogress  in so far as numerous structural imbalancescontinue to hamper the efforts of the countries of the Southto achieve self-development and international cooperation.Indeed  despite the concerted efforts at integration  despitethe internal adjustments still undertaken at enormoussacrifice  and despite the expressions of good will forinternational partnership  foreign debt continues to grow  andthe gap between the economies of the North and those of theSouth continues to widen.The delegation of Rwanda is convinced that if the lotof mankind is to be improved  the international communitymust undertake measures that can promote the emergence ofa new  more balanced and more equitable world economicorder. In this regard  only a common political will on thepart of all the Members of this Organization can help tocorrect the structural imbalances in the global economy andto open the way to a new partnership in whichinterdependence means  first and foremost  a shared destinyfor mankind  in which international cooperation is even moresynonymous with success that benefits all the partners - theseal of fraternity and the promise of genuine solidarity.Forty-eighth session - 6 October l993 3Rwanda has always believed that internationalcooperation  if it is to be more effective  must be based to aneven greater extent on intense  transparent  consistent andconcise action agreed with our partners and undertakenwithin what must one day be regarded as a genuine contractof solidarity. Rwanda has always believed that well-plannedcooperation implies the concept of co-management  of co-responsibility. This means shared responsibility  ongoingdialogue  transparency of commitments and acceptance ofthe right of all sides to make mistakes  so that  to a greaterextent than in the past  cooperation can meet the stakes ofthe future. To secure even more genuine cooperation  theinternational community must seek effective solutions to allthese challenges that are leading us into institutionalized crushing debt.In addition  the scope of international cooperation canbe widened  and its impact increased  only through genuineintegration of action and of programmes in the context of anational strategy and with a global vision of authentic self-development. Rwanda has always attached specialimportance to international cooperation  to which it owes somuch of its progress  its development and its achievements.With regard to the political situation in Rwanda  mycountry  as Members know  is emerging from a pointless andundeserved war  which was imposed on it three years ago on 1 October 1990. Allow me  before sketching out thesituation into which this war has plunged the population ofRwanda and the country’s economy  to emphasize onceagain the role of the international community in resolvingcrises and conflicts  for the ending of the war in my countryis the result of a miracle of international solidarity.There is no doubt that this required the good will of thetwo parties to the conflict. Wisdom prevailed over ambition and hatred yielded to the nation’s need to survive. But thewill of the two parties to pool their efforts was stronglysupported by countries neighbouring Rwanda  among whichthe two parties chose  by common agreement  the Republicof Zaire as Mediator and the United Republic of Tanzania asFacilitator.The two warring parties benefited also from the skilledhelp of President Abdou Diouf of Senegal  who was at thattime Chairman of the Organization of African Unity  and ofcertain friendly countries - France  Belgium  the FederalRepublic of Germany and the United States of America. Inaddition  they received most valuable assistance from theOrganization of African Unity and the United Nations. Allthese countries and international organizations sentrepresentatives to Arusha  Tanzania  to take part in the peacenegotiations that had begun in Zaire following the launchingof hostilities  that had continued in Tanzania for a year  withtheir participation  and that culminated in a peace agreement.I take this opportunity to express once again to all thesecountries and organizations the sincere gratitude of theGovernment and people of Rwanda for their highly valuablecontribution to the positive outcome of the negotiations which were very trying to all who were involved and whichon numerous occasions would have been on the verge ofcollapse had it not been for the tenacity and determinationof the two parties and the wise and firm advice of all friendspresent.This senseless war that befell Rwanda is now subsiding thanks to the peace agreement that was signed in Arusha on4 August 1993. It was bloody and devastating. We mourntens of thousands of victims. The war resulted inconsiderable destruction of infrastructure  equipment andsocio-economic and administrative systems  and it left in astate of dire poverty more than 900 000 displaced persons whose property went up in smoke.That war has left us with orphans and invalids of allages  widows  helpless old people and hundreds of thousandsof economic victims. In the regions affected by the war misery and desolation hold sway. Education has beenseverely jeopardized and the psychological consequences forthe most vulnerable age groups are doubtless incalculable.This war has destroyed the fragile equilibrium of thecountry’s food supply and has exacerbated the famine whichhas struck the entire country  because it broke out in thecountry’s most fertile regions  which have not beencultivated for three years now. The representatives ofinternational bodies and non-governmental organizations whovisited the camps of displaced persons cannot forget thedesolate sight of the make-shift shelters where hundreds ofthousands of human beings  crammed together in highlyunsanitary conditions  continue to lead lives that are close tointolerable. Those representatives cannot forget the longlines of hungry people on the roads  seeking the assistancesent them by the international community  which withdifficulty was able to deliver it to them for their survival.And what can we say of the economy in general?Already badly shaken  it is today in even worse condition following the enormous expenditures resulting from the warand the destruction it caused. Thus  after the signing of theArusha Peace Agreement  the time has come for the long-term  enormous work of national reconstruction in the newlyregained peace and calm  without forgetting the other  no4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionless important objective  the implementation of nationalreconciliation and the continued strengthening of the processof democratization in the management of the country. Wecan already welcome the establishment of a multi-partysystem by the constitutional review of 10 June 1991  thanksto which 17 political parties were agreed upon. Five ofthem are at present forming a transition Government whichsoon will be expanded to the Rwanda Patriotic Front for anew transitional period which should lead to pluralist  freeand democratic elections.On the economic level  Rwanda has been experiencinga crisis since the 1980s  which has had negativerepercussions on the implementation of the budget and hasbeen exacerbated not only by the war but also by theunpredictable nature of external shocks  in particular thecollapse of the international price of coffee  our primaryexport.As it was no longer possible to control the growth ofpublic expenditures and of the fundamental imbalance in thebalance of trade  in combination with a production systemwhose structure is very fragile  my country implemented  inNovember 1990  a programme of recovery having thefollowing priorities: to relaunch the economy  to achieveinternal and external financial balance  to promote domesticsavings  to encourage the activity of the private sector andto improve the management of the public sector.Rwanda’s structural adjustment programme has beengiven great technical and financial support by all the donors headed by the Bretton Woods institutions. Unfortunately the launching of this programme  which the Governmentcould apparently have carried out without too many suddendetours  coincided with the attack of October 1990.From this rostrum  I would like most solemnly to thankthe international community for the support it has accordedRwanda both with assistance in the balance of payments andwith development projects. We are even more grateful forthe priority the international community has given toassistance for those displaced by the war  in answer to theconsolidated appeal made by the Department ofHumanitarian Affairs of the United Nations  whosededication is inestimable.Following the war and the new deterioration of theterms of trade which affected the economy of Rwanda  thevery backbone of our structural adjustment programme isthreatened. I am speaking here of the liberalization ofexternal and internal trade which requires a comfortablecurrency reserve situation.The Government of Rwanda has just decided upon theprimary features of its short- and medium-term post-wareconomic policy from 1993 to 1996  items we havesubmitted to the international community. This policyreflects the Government’s commitment to do all in its powerto stabilize the large financial balances and to launch theprocess of economic recovery on the basis of thefundamental strategy of the structural adjustment programme which gives a key role to market forces. In short  thepositive results of the measures that have been in place sinceNovember 1990 must be capitalized upon  and new measuresrequired by the deterioration of short- and medium-termeconomic prospects  linked to the war  must be planned.Therefore  in accordance with the contents of the PeaceAgreement  the priorities of the expanded transitionalGovernment are to pursue efforts at economic recovery andto work on four programmes for specifically post-wareconomic development: emergency assistance to thosedisplaced by the war in order to help them return to theirproperty  assistance in the reintegration of Rwandeserefugees  assistance in reconstruction and assistance in thesocial and economic reintegration of demobilized militarypersonnel.For the repatriation of Rwandese refugees in accordancewith the Dar-es-Salaam Declaration of 19 February 1991  adonors’ meeting will be organized at the initiative of theGovernment  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) andthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees (UNHCR). With the war  we saw all types ofdestruction  particularly the damaging and/or destruction ofseveral thousands of hectares of forest which will evenfurther aggravate the wood shortage. With the end of thewar  the country will have to dispose of the funds todemobilize more than 31 000 military personnel. We willalso have to locate throughout the country paying jobs andtraining which can facilitate their social and economicreintegration.Within the framework of the preparation for theprogrammes of reconstruction and socio-economicreintegration of demobilized military personnel  I havepersonally sent a request to the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations  on 2 January 1993  and an inter-agencymission of the United Nations systems and of the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP) is at presentbacking the Government of Rwanda in the preparation of thedocument to be submitted to the donors at a round table forhumanitarian emergency assistance.Forty-eighth session - 6 October l993 5Rwanda is trying to manage its meagre resources in anextremely difficult context. But it remains committed to thestrategy of economic development contained in the structuraladjustment programme it launched in November 1990  with as its base  the process of economic liberalization that hasalready begun and is giving the private sector a larger rolein decision-making.By signing the Peace Agreement the Government ofRwanda firmly committed itself to strengthening the basis ofa State of law in which public freedoms  together withpolitical rights  justice and equality  will be guaranteed. Inthat Agreement the two parties have agreed that anindependent National Commission for Human Rights will beestablished entrusted with dealing with violations of humanrights perpetrated by any person on Rwandan territory and in particular  by State bodies and by persons under cover ofthe State or other organizations. Simultaneously  theGovernment will move to improve the functioning of thelegal and penal systems  in particular by forbidding arbitraryand illegal arrests and inhumane treatment of detainees andby severely punishing the perpetrators of such acts.Since the country’s human  material and financialmeans are severely limited  an appeal will be made toforeign financial and technological assistance  especially inthe area of the training of magistrates and officials of theOffice of the Public Prosecutor and Ministry of Justicepersonnel.In the Peace Agreement the Government of Rwanda hasalso reaffirmed its determination to reach a final settlementof the refugee problem  a goal to which it had committeditself in the Dar-es-Salaam Declaration of 19 February 1991at the regional summit meeting which examined the problemof Rwandan refugees.The task will be a difficult one for the broad-basedtransitional government envisaged in the agreement withinthe framework of the Protocols of Agreement on Power-sharing between the country’s political parties and theRwandese Patriotic Front (RPF). That Government will beset up in the next few days  as soon as the prerequisiteconditions have been met. The task will also be a difficultone for the people of Rwanda as a whole  who will be theultimate authors and beneficiaries of the hoped-for progressand well-being.Nevertheless  despite the will and determination of theRwandan people and their Government  we mustacknowledge the utter insufficiency of the domestic meansavailable  given the titanic labour to be accomplished. Wethus look to the international community to support andsupplement our own efforts.The first contribution we expect from the internationalcommunity is the deployment  as rapidly as possible  of aninternational neutral force  as provided in the ArushaAgreement. On behalf of the people of Rwanda  I shouldlike to express to the United Nations as a whole  and to themembers of the Security Council in particular  our gratitudefor the historic decision the Organization took yesterday inadopting the resolution establishing the United NationsAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR)  so long awaitedfor the implementation of the Arusha Peace Agreement.The Agreement assigns to that force the task offacilitating the implementation of the Peace Agreement specifically by supervising implementation of the Protocol onthe Integration of the Armed Forces of the Two Parties andby providing various kinds of assistance to the authoritiesand competent bodies. The Agreement also assigns toUNAMIR security tasks  including  inter alia  monitoring theoverall security situation in the country and investigating andreporting on activities carried out by the competentauthorities and bodies in the maintenance of public order;assisting in ensuring the security of the civilian population;assisting with mine-clearance operations; assisting in theidentification of arms stockpiles and the neutralization ofarmed bands throughout the country  and monitoring therespect by both sides of the comprehensive cease-fire andcessation of hostilities  as provided in the Peace Agreement.Lastly  the Arusha Peace Agreement entrusts the neutralinternational force with the tasks of supervising the trainingprocess of the national armed forces  and here I wouldmention only the supervision of the disengagement of forces supervision of the demobilization of all the military forcesand the Gendarmerie  and participation in the trainingprogramme for members of the New National Army andNational Gendarmerie.This is some indication of how necessary and urgentthe establishment of the neutral international force is in orderto allow for the creation of the broad-based transitionalgovernment and the reintegration of persons displaced by thewar  the repatriation of refugees and  in a6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessiongeneral manner  national reconstruction in conditions ofmaximum security.Another extremely vital contribution we expect from theinternational community  and more specifically from theUnited Nations system and  on a bilateral level  from thefriendly countries and various non-governmentalorganizations  will be that of financing the priorityprogrammes to which I referred a few moments ago.Today  more than ever  Rwanda needs the attention concern and good will of the international community. It isrelying on that community’s generosity to re-establish itselfand to recover from the horrors of war. May that hope berealized soon.With the support of the international community thepeople of Rwanda hope to pass smoothly through a transitionperiod that  notwithstanding the guidelines of the PeaceAgreement  could still turn out to be arduous. The peopleof Rwanda  however  are relying on the patriotism and senseof responsibility that their political authorities and the leadersof the parties in the government and the TransitionalAssembly must demonstrate to consolidate the democraticgains and lay down  once and for all  the foundations ofpeace and national harmony. Once the demons of divisionhave been exorcised  the people of Rwanda will surely builda new nation and experience once again uninterruptedprogress.At this session of the General Assembly elections willbe held for a number of seats on the Security Council.Rwanda has officially put forward its candidacy to becomea non-permanent member of that body entrusted withresponsibility for international peace and security. Itscandidacy was endorsed at the last Summit Meeting of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) held at Cairo at theend of June this year. As the Head of State  I ask for theAssembly’s trust in my country  Rwanda  which has neveryet had a seat on the Security Council. As a Stateconcerned to carry out its responsibilities  including those onthe international level  Rwanda believes that it can  todaymore than yesterday  make its modest contribution to themaintenance of peace in the world and to the restoration ofpeace in troubled regions and countries.Emerging as it now is from a war that has tried itsorely  Rwanda is better aware of the price of peace  thepeace it has now regained thanks in particular to the effortsof the international community.Those are the reasons that have motivated Rwanda toput forward its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on theSecurity Council: to assist other warring nations to return topeace  but also to work  together with the other members ofthe Council  for the strengthening of peace within its ownborders. Rwanda hopes that it will have your confidence.An ancient country that was under United Nationstrusteeship throughout the period prior to its accession tonational independence  my country  Rwanda  which has justemerged from the throes of an unmentionable war and nowyearns to rebuild  relying on the lessons of the past  hasevery reason to feel that it has matured  and it assures youof its unswerving determination to work for the advent ofpeace in the world and understanding among nations. On itsbehalf  I repeat to the United Nations  our Organization  oursincerest wishes that it may succeed and flourish for thehappiness of all mankind."
"141",6049,"SAU",48,1993,"It is with pleasure that I convey to Your Excellency at theoutset of my statement  our sincerest congratulations on yourelection to the Presidency of the forty-eighth session of the18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionGeneral Assembly of the United Nations. Your electionreflects appreciation for you personally  as well as for thepositive role played by your country in the internationalarena. I wish you every success in the pursuit of yourmission.On this occasion  I also wish to congratulate yourpredecessor for his effective guidance of the affairs of theGeneral Assembly at its previous session.I also wish to acknowledge the sincere effortsconstantly exerted by the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to enhance theprospects for peace and reduce the elements of tensionwhich prevail in many parts of the world.I am also pleased to welcome  on behalf of theKingdom of Saudi Arabia  all the States that have joined ourOrganization to participate  along with all other MemberStates  in realizing the noble objectives towards which we allstrive.This session of the General Assembly takes placeamidst important developments in the international arena thatrequire us to strive to conclude our work with successfulresolutions on the problems and crises we face. Theseresolutions must be within the context of our efforts tobenefit from the opportunities provided by the emergence ofwhat has come to be known as the new international order.We have all contributed  through the United Nations toestablishing the new international order  the foundations ofwhich are based on the principles enshrined in the UnitedNations Charter and inherent in international law. This neworder respects the sovereignty and independence of Statesand guarantees the inviolability of their international borders.It guarantees the territorial integrity of States and rejectsinterference in their domestic affairs. It is based on equityamong nations  small and large  rich and poor  and its goalis to replace war and destruction with cooperation betweennations and peoples. The new international order strives forthe peaceful resolution of conflict and rejects the use offorce or coercion. It operates to preserve the dignity of manand to spread security  stability  prosperity and developmentto all corners of our world.The emergence of this new order has been a source ofhope and optimism for the international community particularly when serious and constructive internationalcooperation succeeded in confronting the Iraqi aggressionagainst the State of Kuwait. Today  however  we aresaddened and pained by the inability of this order to confrontthe aggression committed against the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina  a State Member of our internationalOrganization. This crisis  if not resolved in a mannercompatible with the principles of the new world order  willcause this new order to lose its credibility and effectiveness.We therefore call for enhancing the role of the UnitedNations from one of mere crisis management andmaintenance of peace to one of active and effectivepeacemaking.A general overview of the current international situationreveals that there remain pockets of tension which threatensecurity and stability in many regions of the world. Withthe persistence of such challenges  the role of the UnitedNations is becoming increasingly important  not only for themaintenance of peace  but as an effective means for creatingconditions conducive to peace and stability throughout theworld. Without a doubt  the creation of such conditions willbe made much easier if the opportunities for cooperationbetween nations are increased and support for the UnitedNations is strengthened so that the Organization mayfunction in a manner that would guarantee that no countrycommits aggression against another or threatens its security sovereignty or territorial integrity.The honourable role played by the United Nations morethan three years ago when it stood firmly in the face ofIraq’s aggression against its neighbour Kuwait  and theresolutions it adopted led in the end to repelling aggressionand restoring legality to Kuwait the peace-loving nation.This positive role portrays our expectations of thisinternational body in the present circumstances. We hopethat it will continue to be played and ask that it be enhancedby efforts to ensure the complete implementation of allSecurity Council resolutions regarding the Iraqi regime which continues to flout international legality. Two yearsafter the liberation of Kuwait  the Baghdad regime continuesto resort to threats and false allegations against Kuwait. Itcontinues to delay efforts to implement United Nationsresolutions and rejects all international obligations. Wepoint in particular to the Iraqi regime’s objections to therecommendations of the United Nations Iraq-KuwaitBoundary Demarcation Commission and its rejection ofSecurity Council resolution 833 (1993)  as well as itscontinued detention of Kuwaiti hostages and prisoners ofwar. This regime has arrogated the right  on the basis ofsovereignty  to starve and abuse its people and subject Iraqto dangers which threaten its unity and security. It falselyblames the international community for the dangers andtragedies to which Iraq and its people have become subject.The surest way of facing up to the threats this regime posesForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 19to the region as a whole  and to the Iraqi people is to fullyand completely implement Security Council resolutions.The Declaration of Principles between the PalestineLiberation Organization and the Israeli Government  signedin Washington  D.C. on 13 September 1993  has raisedexpectations and hopes that a just and permanent settlementcan be found to the Arab-Israeli conflict  which has persistedfor far too long. This development  though representingonly an agreement on autonomy in the occupied Palestinianterritories  beginning with Gaza and Jericho  neverthelessrepresents a step towards the establishment of a just comprehensive and permanent peace between the ArabStates and Israel. A solution to the Palestinian question willobviously contribute to a just and comprehensive settlementof the Arab-Israeli conflict as it is the core issue of thatconflict.The warm welcome with which the Palestinian-Israeliagreement was received within Palestinian  Arab andinternational circles genuinely and clearly reflects the desireof the Arabs to establish a permanent  just andcomprehensive peace in the Middle East. It also indicatesthe seriousness with which the Arab side has pursued thecurrent peace process  which was launched in Madrid inOctober 1991 under the sponsorship of the United States ofAmerica and the Russian Federation.As we witness today the optimism generated by thePalestinian-Israeli agreement  we cannot but feel that it isincumbent upon the international community to lend supportto the progress that has been achieved in this area byproviding the necessary economic and developmentalassistance required to build the administrative structuresneeded to make the agreement on self-rule succeed. At thesame time  it is also incumbent upon us to work diligentlyto exploit the momentum generated by this agreement infurthering the cause of peace.The consolidation of this step requires the achievementof tangible and positive results in the areas of negotiationbetween Palestinians and Israelis; at the forefront of thoseare the issue of Al-Quds  which is an integral part of theoccupied Arab territories  the issue of the return ofPalestinian refugees  and the settlements built by Israel in theoccupied Arab territories contrary to international law andthe Geneva Conventions. At the same time  genuineprogress along all the other bilateral negotiating tracks isneeded.The issue of the occupied Arab Syrian Golan Heightsis clear: it is governed by the principle of respect forinternational borders. The maintenance of security is notfeasible  as the realities of contemporary history teach us through the occupation of territory by force  but ratherthrough the establishment of peace. Thus  peace on thisfront will be achieved only by a complete Israeli withdrawalfrom the occupied Golan Heights.Likewise  the Lebanese-Israeli negotiating track isgoverned by United Nations Security Council resolution425 (1978)  which clearly calls for the immediate unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Lebaneseterritory.I wish to express the appreciation of the Government ofthe Custodian of the two holy mosques to President Clintonfor his prudent initiative in calling for  and hosting  aninternational donors’ conference to solicit political andfinancial support for the Palestinians as they prepare toassume the responsibilities of self-rule in the occupiedterritories. I also wish to take this opportunity to expressour pleasure at the positive results achieved at thatconference.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has given  and continuesto give  its full support in all possible forms to the MiddleEast peace process since it began in Madrid. It hasparticipated effectively in the multilateral talks  andgenuinely hopes that the process will lead to a just permanent and comprehensive solution to the Palestinianquestion and the Arab conflict with Israel on the basis ofUnited Nations Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and338 (1973).Despite the financial burdens the Kingdom of SaudiArabia bears in building an advanced economy in which theexpectations of its citizens for a better future are fulfilled and despite its current international obligations at a time ofdifficulty in the international economic system  the Kingdomof Saudi Arabia participated in the international donors’conference that recently concluded its meetings inWashington.The Custodian of the two holy mosques has bestowedupon me the honour of announcing the Kingdom’scommitment to providing substantial developmentalassistance to improve the infrastructures in the West Bankand Gaza Strip in coordination and cooperation with theWorld Bank’s special five-year programme for the occupiedterritories. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will participate through the Saudi development fund  to the tune of$100 million for the year 1994. We believe that thisassistance will improve the living conditions of our20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionPalestinian brethren in the occupied Arab territories andcontribute positively to the peace process.The Lebanese Government has made great strides in itsefforts to implement the Taif Accords  and has taken thenecessary political and constitutional measures to achievethis aim. We must continue our support for the efforts ofthe legitimate Lebanese authorities and contribute to theprocess of reconstruction in Lebanon.In this regard  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia appeals tothe international community to help Lebanon by all availablemeans in order to enable its Government to continue movingforward with the process of reconstruction and allowLebanon to regain its material and cultural position.It is important to reiterate the need  if this goal is to beachieved  for an Israeli commitment to implement  fully andunconditionally  United Nations Security Council resolution425 (1978)  which requires Israel to withdraw from Lebaneseterritory to enable the Lebanese Government to extend itslegal authority over all Lebanon.We should like to emphasize our desire for the MiddleEast region to obtain its legitimate share of security  peaceand stability so that it is able to direct all its energiestowards development and devote all its resources towardsprosperity for its people.One of the most important tasks facing us in thisrespect is to strive towards the elimination of weapons ofmass destruction in the Middle East. The Kingdom of SaudiArabia is a signatory to the Convention on thenon-proliferation of chemical weapons and the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We continue tobelieve that the goal of making the Middle East a region freeof all kinds of weapons of mass destruction  whethernuclear  chemical or biological  will be realized only whenall States in the region  including Israel  refrain from theproduction  stockpiling  or possession of any kind of weaponof mass destruction.The situation in the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina is being aggravated by the continuation of agenocidal war waged by Serb forces  with the support ofSerbia and Montenegro  against that young Republic. Thecontinuing tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina which has resulted in the death of thousands of innocentcivilians and the displacement of a large portion of itscitizens  would not have occurred were it not for theapparent indifference of the international community. Thisattitude allowed the forces of aggression to benefit fromtheir aggression  and to continue their abhorrent policy of""ethnic cleansing"" without fear of retribution.This feeble stand on the part the internationalcommunity  particularly the European countries  wasreflected in the inability to implement comprehensively theresolutions of the London Conference  upon which we hadrested great hopes. It is also reflected in the failure of theVance-Owen plan and the collapse of the subsequent Genevatalks on refugees.The international community’s dereliction of itsresponsibilities vis-á-vis the Serb aggression has emboldenedthe Croats to embark upon a similar course of making gainsby means of force and coercion.Against such a backdrop  it was strange indeed thatwhen Croatia was targeted by Serbian aggression  theinternational community  and especially the Europeannations  were quick to stand by Croatia and provide militaryassistance that contributed to the success of internationalefforts to achieve a peaceful settlement  whereas theinternational community’s feeble stance in the case ofBosnia and Herzegovina and its failure to implement theinternational resolutions calling for the imposition ofeconomic sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro  havedeprived that young Republic of the means of exercising itslegitimate right to self-defence. Those resolutions and thesanctions they call for remained dead letter and were notseriously implemented until it was too late  after the Serbshad rejected the Vance-Owen Plan  which the Bosnians andCroats had accepted. What really shocks and amazes us isthat this war of aggression is being waged on the Europeansoil whereas history teaches us that such wars on that soilhave never been limited wars but have always overspilledbeyond the borders. However  no one seems to be payingany attention to those object-lessons.While we hope that the history of Europe’s wars willnot repeat itself  we hope that the solutions that are beingproposed do not turn out to be the seeds of future conflictsand disputes. We hope that the international community willgive serious consideration to the demands of the Republic ofBosnia and Herzegovina so that it may be saved from anyrepetition of the policies of aggression and ""ethniccleansing"". The geographical demands of that young nationshould be satisfied by granting it access to the sea as well asproviding it with the means of legitimate self-defence  inconsonance with the principles of the United NationsCharter.Forty-eighth session - 13 October l993 21The principled stand by the people and Government ofthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in support of the Republic ofBosnia and Herzegovina emanates from their strong and totaladherence to international legality and respect forinternational law and not from any religious fanaticism orethnic affinity. It is the same principled stand that was takenby the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in support of Kuwait whenit fell victim to the Iraqi regime’s aggression.Somalia continues to be in the grip of instability andpolitical chaos  with all the attendant acts of violence andbloodshed  despite all the efforts deployed to help that nationout of its plight. International efforts  during the Conferencefor National Reconciliation held at Addis Ababa  focused onthe preservation of the Somali State and the maintenance ofits independence and territorial integrity. Unfortunately  therequired steps have not been taken for the seriousimplementation of that Agreement. The role of the UnitedNations has been limited to the distribution of humanitarianassistance to those in need at a time when the role it isexpected to play within the new world order is to contributeto peacemaking and to the stabilization of the Somali State.Such measures should help to establish a SomaliGovernment that can extend its authority throughoutSomalia.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made a number ofattempts to contain the conflict in Somalia and has tried tobring about national reconciliation among the variousfactions. It will continue to deploy efforts to stop thebloodshed and to provide humanitarian assistance and relief.We support the Secretary-General’s recommendations in hisreport to the Security Council  on the means of helping re-establish Somalia’s constitutional institutions and on theefforts needed to reach national reconciliation and to rebuildSomalia.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stood by the fraternalpeople of Afghanistan throughout their jihad and celebratedwith them their victory over the forces of brutal occupationin the struggle for restoring their national identity. TheKingdom of Saudi Arabia spared no effort in working forreconciliation when the infighting started between thevarious mujahidin factions. Those efforts were crownedwith the signing of the Mecca Agreement and the initiationof steps towards its implementation. A NationalGovernment that combined all factions of the Afghanmujahidin was established. We take this opportunity to urgeour brethren in Afghanistan to comply with the terms of theagreement so that Afghanistan may begin to move towardsreconstruction and development and regain its place and rolein the international community.It must be noted that that part of the world continues tosuffer as a result of the problem of Jammu and Kashmir which continues to be an element of instability in the region.The Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosquesfollows with great concern the ongoing violence there. Weare keen on finding a solution on the basis of United Nationsresolutions to this long-standing problem that hasovershadowed the relations of the two neighbours  India andPakistan.Among the other conflicts in Asia I would refer to thetragic developments resulting from the worsening conflictbetween two United Nations Member States  the Republic ofAzerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia. That conflict hasrecently resulted in the occupation by Armenia of parts ofAzerbaijan. We consider that occupation to be a breach ofthe principle of the peaceful resolution of conflicts  andemphasize the importance of withdrawal by Armenia’sforces from Azerbaijan’s territory in order to transfer thatissue to the negotiating table with the aim of reaching apeaceful and just settlement that would ensure the legitimaterights of the people of Azerbaijan.Our joint and serious efforts towards consolidating theunderpinnings of the new world order aim at making itpossible to address the issues of development and thecreation of an international economic environment in whichfinancial resources would be diverted from arms races toeconomic and social development. Those efforts are inkeeping with our ambitions and the aspirations of ourpeoples for a better world of peace  prosperity and security.Such an enterprise requires the cooperation of the developedindustrial nations by opening their markets to the productsof the developing nations  the elimination of protectionistmeasures  ensuring an early successful outcome to theUruguay Round of multilateral trade talks and finding anurgent  rapid solution to the debt problem. On the otherhand  economic cooperation between the developingcountries themselves is a paramount issue and represents afundamental tool for consolidating international economicgrowth.My Government attaches great importance to issuesrelating to the world economic system. The Kingdom ofSaudi Arabia represents a State open to the world interacting with all the trends and developments that affectit. Thus  we are keen on preserving the health and strengthof the world economy  and we are concerned by thedisruptions and turmoil that affect its course anddevelopment. It is on that basis that the Kingdom of SaudiArabia is participating positively in the ongoing discussionson energy and environment. We have shouldered our22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionresponsibilities in this regard and have played an active rolein international discussions to find a workable and balancedsolution to global warming based on proven scientificevidence. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is convinced thatthe future of this world  its prosperity  and the well-being ofits inhabitants  depend on a clear understanding of theenvironmental problems that face us all and on fullyunderstanding the consequences of the policies adopted indealing with those problems.This requires delicate balancing of the burdens andcommitments of each and every State in addressing problemsof the environment. Due consideration should be given alsoto the situation of every energy producing or consumerdeveloping country and the effects of environmental policieson the economic growth of those countries. Such anapproach will certainly contribute to the achievement ofcomprehensive development and to the betterment of ourpeoples’ standards of living so that they may all enjoyprosperity  peace  security and stability. The currentinternational circumstances  resulting from the ending of thecold war  together with the progress achieved in arms controland reductions of conventional weapons afford us a rareopportunity for channelling the financial windfall towardssolving the problems of development and economicbackwardness.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been at the forefrontof Islamic States that have adhered to the Cairo Declarationon Human Rights in Islam  issued by the Organization of theIslamic Conference on 5 August 1990. This CairoDeclaration should be regarded as a tributary providing theproper foundation for positive and practical internationalcooperation and flowing into the main stream of universalsupport for human rights and freedoms.Most particularly  the Declaration expresses the will ofover 1 billion people  which by any measure grants it auniversal character. While the principles and objectives ofhuman rights are universal in nature  their application musttake into consideration the diversity of societies and theirhistorical  cultural  and religious backgrounds and legalsystems. We should not rush to the creation of mechanismsthat would only deepen differences and disregard the sort ofsensitivities that became noticeable during the WorldConference on Human Rights that was held recently inVienna.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a developing societyfirmly based on the rules that constitute the pillars of Islamiccivilization. It is a society that has firmly set itself to faceup to the challenges of our times with determination andconfidence  and it is a society undergoing evolution andsignificant reform. Its reforms are guided by the Custodianof the Two Holy Mosques  King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aiz  andembodied in the basic laws of governance  the Charter of theMajlis al-Shura - the consultative council - and the laws ofthe provinces. These laws place upon the State the primaryresponsibility for the protection of human rights inaccordance with the Islamic Shariah and determine therelationship between ruler and ruled on the basis ofbrotherhood  consultation  loyalty and cooperation.I am pleased to inform this body that the members ofthe Majlis al-Shura and those of the provincial councils havebeen named. These institutions are now making seriouspreparations to embark upon their appointed tasks and toserve their faith  their King  and their nation. This importantstep in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s development pavesthe way for participation by Saudi citizens in sharing theresponsibility for confidently building a promising andhopeful future.Forty-eighth session - 13 October l993 23The political and economic challenges we face whichabound on this session’s agenda  put a great burden ofresponsibility on us all towards our peoples and nations.Our common future will depend on the way we face up tothose challenges. In the light of the current internationalsituation and of the emergence of a new internationaloutlook which rejects fanaticism and ossification andconfirms a desire for openness and progress  we harbourgreat hopes that we shall be able to surmount thosechallenges. In so doing  we must take into consideration thefact that the new international order will not be able toprovide us with the peace  justice and development we desireunless we give it the opportunity to do just that."
"142",6086,"SDN",48,1993,"Allow me at the outset toexpress to Ambassador Insanally my special congratulationson his election to preside over the General Assembly at thisimportant session. He represents Guyana  an active memberof the Non-Aligned Movement  of which Sudan is proud tobe a founding member. May I also extend our thanks andappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev for theskilful and efficient manner in which he conducted the workof the previous session.The United Nations represents hope for all nations andnascent States  especially those that attained theirindependence through long struggle. It is a great honour andpleasure for me to welcome our sister country  Eritrea which has joined the membership of the United Nations.Our two peoples continue to enjoy mutual respect andesteem  and our Governments are endeavouring to fosterfraternal relations with a view to achieving prosperity for thebrotherly peoples of the two countries  and for the wholeregion.Allow me also to salute the Czech Republic  Slovakia The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  Monaco andAndorra  which joined the United Nations as part of a newmomentum contributing to human endeavours to achievestability  prosperity and peace for the world.I also salute the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who is leading the Secretariat ofthe United Nations at a crucial stage as it faces manychallenges and pressures.The Sudan learned with grief and sadness of the tragicloss of life in the earthquake which struck parts of India. Iextend the deepest sympathy of the Sudan to friendly Indiaalong with heartfelt condolences to the families of those wholost their lives.Since the previous session  important events haveemerged in the international arena. We are now witnessingaccelerated political and social change unprecedented inhistory. New international situations and changes occurevery day; we are all trying to keep up with them. Today we are experiencing a phase of travail and transition  whichresults every day in new  divergent patterns. The moststriking of those patterns is the widening of the gap betweenthe rich North and the less privileged South.The trend in today’s world is towards the machinery ofregional groupings. This reflects the fact that the world hasalready started to be more inclined to think in a morecollective manner. We hope that this new pattern will bepositive and constructive  giving due respect to the chartersand covenants that are binding on all. We seriously assertthat developing countries are no longer principal partners inmost of the resolutions that are adopted  particularly withinthe framework of the Security Council and other UnitedNations organs. Had developing countries been allowedequitable participation  their contribution could have beenmore effective in the course of many of these importantevents  specially in the field of regional and internationalpeace and security.Four years ago we started reviewing the functions ofthe United Nations and its various organs. We must placeon record  from this rostrum  our conviction that thisOrganization has a basic role to play in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and the achievement ofprosperity for mankind. For the United Nations fully toperform such a vital role  its governing Charter must be fullyrespected. The Charter must also be adhered to by all  andmust be updated to keep pace with the developments thathave occurred since its adoption.The General Assembly too should be enabled fully toperform its functions for the maintenance of peace andsecurity. The General Assembly should be given its dueimportance  equal and parallel to that of the SecurityCouncil.Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 35Selectivity in implementing the provisions of theCharter must be abandoned. In this regard  we firmly stressthat the activities of the Security Council must be transparentand that the Council should adopt a democratic approach inits decisions. It is thus inevitable that the question of theCouncil’s permanent membership  and the right of veto which enables a few States to invalidate the opinion of themajority  be reviewed  especially at a time when the UnitedNations is advocating the values of democracy  participation justice and equality.The United Nations and one of its organs  the SecurityCouncil  are currently engaged in serious and active attemptsto settle disputes based on new prospects for theestablishment of regional and international peace andsecurity. Let us pause here for a moment. We all aspire tosave the world from the calamities of war and thedestructive consequences of the prevailing social andeconomic situation. Yet  at the same time  we reject doublestandards in the resolutions of the Security Council especially in relation to international peace and security. Weare anxious lest the United Nations lose its proper vision inthe heat of events.The nature of the responsibilities and duties of theOrganization requires strict neutrality. International peaceand security is a principle that must apply to all. But to seethe people of Bosnia and Herzegovina suffer to the brink ofelimination because of the shaky and defective resolutions ofthe Security Council is a situation that should not be allowedto pass unnoticed. Similarly  the Somali people cannot beallowed to remain victims of irregularities committed by theinternational forces there because of the departure from theirbinding original mandate. This is a matter that requires bothchange and a strict and immediate investigation. We are stillwitnessing the deterioration of the security situation inSomalia owing to the continuing fighting between theinternational forces and some of the Somali factions  as wellas with individuals. This has resulted in many killings andhas caused the international forces to stray from theiroriginal mandate. We have previously expressed ourreservations with regard to the hasty use of internationalforces in Somalia without consulting the States of the regionor exhausting the efforts and endeavours being exerted bythose States to find a solution to the Somali crisis.We are concerned that the continuation of fightingbetween the international forces and some of the Somalifactions will shed more blood  complicate the problem andrender it insoluble by the United Nations. Therefore  werequest the United Nations and the forces that are supposedto operate under its banner to refrain from continuing thetype of actions that would provoke the Somali people andthe country’s factions or affect the structure of their politicalfuture  values and cultural and religious heritage.We also deem it fitting that the Permanent Committeeon Somalia of the States of The Horn of Africa be given thenecessary time to perform its pioneering function of findinga solution to the Somali crisis. These States are betteracquainted with the nature and dimension of the problem byvirtue of their special relations with Somalia and its people.We will support new international arrangements thatwill ensure the enhancement of the performance of theOrganization and establish justice and tranquillity among all.The arrangements we are hoping for shall not infringe uponthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of States or meddlewith their independence or right of decision-making.Preventive diplomacy  associated with peacemaking andpeace-keeping  should be motivated by a basic goal  namely the elimination of regional and international tension. Thiscould be achieved by defining the causes of political andsocial conflicts in order to eliminate them so that differentsocieties might enjoy stability  well-being  and peace.Preventive diplomacy and the subsequent use of political andmilitary force cannot be applied solely against less privilegedcountries and vulnerable peoples.In brief  we are hoping for a new formula within theframework of current international arrangements to guaranteethe rights of all and to save the world from the hegemony ofthe stronger over the less privileged. We also aspire to agreater role for the regional organizations of the developingcountries and to their representation in the important forumof the Security Council  which is entrusted with the task ofmaintaining peace and security all over the world.Along with this understanding of the new role of theUnited Nations in protecting and preserving the rights ofStates  we call for the lifting of the economic embargoimposed on Iraq. The Iraqi people have suffered for anextended period of time from the unfair embargo that is stillimposed on them  despite the exhaustion of the reasons thatinvoked it.Another example of the misuse of this internationalOrganization is the embargo imposed on Libya without anylegal and justified cause to permit the actions taken againstthat country. Libya has already responded to SecurityCouncil resolution 731 (1992) and shown sufficientflexibility to settle its differences with the Western States  amatter that would justify the lifting of the embargo imposedon it.36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe agenda items before this session include importantissues reflecting the accelerated pace of events I mentionedat the beginning of my statement. However  I prefer to bedirect in touching upon issues of immediate concern to us inthe Sudan because of the misunderstanding that hasaccompanied them.During the forty-eighth session of the Human RightsCommission  held at Geneva in March 1992  and upon amotion by the United States representative  the Commissionadopted a resolution appointing an independent expertassigned to investigate the human-rights situation in theSudan and to submit a report to the forty-ninth session of theCommission in March-April 1993. The States sponsoringthat resolution did not wish to wait for the report of theindependent expert but pushed the matter to the forty-seventhsession of the General Assembly  where a resolution on thealleged human-rights violations in the Sudan was adopted.The sponsoring States used all the influence  pressure andthe mechanical majority they possessed to see that thatpolitically motivated resolution was adopted.In his report to the forty-ninth session of theCommission on Human Rights in March 1993  theindependent expert praised the cooperation of theGovernment of the Sudan and explained that he had hadneither the time nor the opportunity to judge the situation ofhuman rights in the Sudan or to study the mattercomprehensively. He indicated that the Commission mightwish to extend his mission in order to allow him to completehis mandate. While we do not conceive of any justifiablereasons behind his appointment  the Government of theSudan nevertheless extended every possible cooperation tothe Special Rapporteur  who visited the Sudan last week andwill submit his report.Respect for and maintenance of human rights representone of the sacred principles that are enshrined in all divinereligions as well as in man-made laws. The Sudan  inspiredby its cultural and civilized heritage  pays due attention tothe issues of human rights. The Sudanese Government andsociety respect and observe the human-rights values basedon their religious belief and traditions. Accordingly  wereject any politicization or manipulation of such a sacreddoctrine as a pretext for meddling in the internal affairs ofStates or for imposing a specific cultural trend or option ofcivilization on any State. For the same reason  we are of theview that developmental assistance should not be tied to adistorted human-rights record. The right to developmentitself represents an inalienable human right. We also opt forequality and fairness in assessing or monitoring theperformance of States in the field of human rights. Weadamantly reject policies that reflect a double standard indealing with human rights  because the Sudan has beenvictimized by such policies. We also hope that universalityof human rights will not be construed to justify denial of thecultural  religious and indigenous specifics of various Statesand peoples.Those who pose as defenders of human rights in theSudan ignore the terrorist practices of the outlaws insouthern Sudan lead by John Garang. They have opted tokeep silent with respect to the atrocities he has committed atrocities such as the abduction and recruitment of childrenfor military operations  the regular killing of civilianpopulations  the downing of civilian aircraft and thekidnapping and killing of United Nations staff working inrelief operations. They have also kept silent with regard tohis continued obstruction of all serious peacemakingendeavours initiated inside or outside the Sudan. Not onlythat  they have received him as a top official dignitary andextended to him every moral support  despite his grossviolation of human rights.In this connection we view General Assemblyresolution 47/142 as a biased resolution that has contributedto the intransigence of the Garang movement and motivatedit to reject all Government endeavours to achieve a peacefulsettlement through negotiations. We are also convinced thatthat resolution lacks any substantive justification  and westand ready to provide all the factual information on thehuman-rights situation in the Sudan to all who are interested.Those who accuse the Government of the Sudan ofviolating the human rights of its own citizens have alsoignored the giant achievements of the Government  such asadopting the conferences system along the lines of Shuraand organizing the national conferences to determine thestructure of the political system in order to lay down thebasic foundations of national unity and to look for ways andmeans to achieve a real peace guaranteeing fundamentalpolitical  social  cultural and religious rights for all citizens.As a result  a National Transitional Assembly wasestablished as the supreme legislative organ of the country pending completion of the political structures at both thefederal and the state level and the conduct of the presidentialelections to be held in the country at a subsequent stage.Many must have learned of the recent decision of theUnited States Government to add the Sudan to its ownclassification of countries allegedly sponsoring terrorism.While the United States Government is free to take whateverdecision it deems appropriate  we have the right to questionthe facts and findings on which the United StatesForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 37Government has based its decision. While the United Stateshas the right to enact domestic decisions  the utilization ofsuch decisions as a prelude to further actions beyond itsterritories contradicts international law and the UnitedNations Charter. We cannot understand how a super-Powerwhich enjoys permanent membership in the Security Councilcan enact domestic legislation to justify the pursuit of itsprivate interests in the territories of other countries. Suchinstances are numerous  the most recent of which was thesearch in the port of Djibouti of a vessel freighting sugar enroute to sisterly Somalia.It is our conviction that the motive behind the mediacampaign against the Sudan is the alienation of Sudan fromits African and Arab affiliations and the smearing of itsimage by erroneously labelling its civilization as terrorist.This media campaign constitutes a prelude to a siege onSudan similar to what has happened to some other countries.We are known to all as a peaceful nation; we denounceterrorism in all its forms. Accordingly  the decision lacks thenecessary legal support  contravenes justice and goodconscience and clearly exceeds the role of the UnitedNations. As proof of our assertion  it could not generate anysupport. Former President Jimmy Carter and a number ofcredible institutions and newspapers have expressed theirscepticism and criticism regarding its ethical value.Likewise  the Sudanese peoples have demonstrated theirrejection and denunciation of that decision. Real terrorismis when a single super-Power uses it as a pretext and utilizesits might to terrorize small developing countries for noreason except that they opted for a path of independentdecision-making and rejected blind proselytism  or merelyfor their different views.Mixing politics with humanitarian assistance is ratherrisky  especially in relief work  which is a sensitive matter as it directly affects human survival through supplying basicneeds such as food and medicine. This necessitates theabsolute neutrality of the relief donors. Recent years havewitnessed an increasing involvement of politics inhumanitarian work  which fact led Mr. Cornelio Sommaruga President of the International Committee of the Red Cross(ICRC) to explicitly warn against the danger of mixingpolitics with humanitarian work. Sudan has sufferedtremendously from these attempts to tarnish its image byintentionally distorting its achievements in relief delivery sothat they are seen as failures  its initiatives depicted asobstructions and its cooperation as impediment of the inflowof relief supplies. The reality is that we feel we are unjustlytreated by some States and some media that tend toundermine our efforts in relief operation and blemish ourreputation.However  Sudan has a bright and outstanding record inthis area. Operation Lifeline Sudan is an unprecedentedinitiative; it has enabled the United Nations andnon-governmental organizations to provide relief supplies toaffected populations  whoever and wherever they are. Sincethe forty-seventh session  continuous efforts have been madeto strengthen the efficiency of Operation Lifeline and itsrelief programme  such as the signing of an agreementbetween the Government of the Sudan  the United Nationsand the rebel factions in December 1992 to secure the flowof relief to all areas in need. In January 1993  anotheragreement was signed between the Government of theSudan  the United Nations and the non-governmentalorganizations to facilitate and enhance the role of the non-governmental organizations in relief and rehabilitation. InMarch 1993  the Government of the Sudan signed amemorandum of understanding with the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross to streamline the cooperationbetween the Government and the Committee and tostrengthen the effectiveness of its operations in southernSudan. The allocation of 153 000 metric tons of grain bythe Government to the World Food Programme to bedistributed to the population in need represents a cornerstoneof our contribution to relief efforts.The mission of Mr. Vieri Traxler  Special Envoy of theSecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs for the Sudan and its positive outcome  stand as another example of thecooperation of the Government of the Sudan with theinternational community. A number of modalities wereagreed upon during that mission to guarantee the fullimplementation of all previously signed agreements. It ismy pleasure to convey to this Assembly that during Mr.Traxler’s mission to the Sudan a number of steps were takento implement what was agreed upon. On the initiative of theGovernment of the Sudan  an agreement was reached to sendjoint assessment missions  constituted by the United Nationsand the non-governmental organizations working in reliefoperations  to about 30 safe locations in the three SouthernStates  the Nuba mountains and Kordofan. It was alsoagreed that the town of Malakal and its environs would beconsidered a model of relief integrated programmes to beimplemented in other areas after proving successful. This isin addition to other steps oriented towards strengthening theefficiency of operations and ensuring relief for those inneed wherever they may be.Allow me to acquaint this Assembly with theachievements of the Government of Sudan in political economic and social fields. The priority item on myGovernment’s agenda is to attain a just and lasting peace insouthern Sudan and to put an end to the war that horrified38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioninnocent civilians and devastated their lives  the war thatexposed them to the scourges of death  famine  disease anddisplacement. This war  which was the by-product of thecolonial conspiracy  has turned the citizens into recipients ofrelief and made them dependent on others. It constitutes aperpetual squandering of vast resources that could have beenutilized in economic and social development and for thewelfare of the Sudanese peoples in the south and the north.Faithful to its earnest endeavours to bring about apeaceful settlement of the discord in the south  the SudaneseGovernment has emphasized since 1989 its readiness to talkpeace with the rebels without preconditions. TheGovernment put forward a comprehensive framework forpeace emanating from the recommendations of a nationalconference. This approach is based on remedying thelingering causes of the conflict in the areas of power- andwealth-sharing  relations between religion and State  adoptionof the federal system of government to meet the aspirationsof different regions for a genuine sharing of power  theexemption of the south from the application of Sharia lawsand the redistribution and reallocation of resources for socialand economic development on equitable grounds.In this positive spirit the Government held severalrounds of negotiations with the rebel movement. The lastmeeting took place in Abuja with the mediation of sisterlyNigeria. The Government  out of its keen desire to bring thepeace talks to a successful conclusion  showed greatflexibility  but it realized  unfortunately  that  owing to thepressures of foreign interests  Garang’s faction was not themaster of its decision. That was why we could not reach anagreement in order to alleviate the suffering of our citizensin the south.The failure of the second Abuja peace talks did not however  weaken the determination of the Government tocontinue searching for peace through negotiations. To thisend  the Government started a new round of negotiations this time in Sudanese territory  with the other united rebelfactions. The Government also accepted a quadrilateralpeace initiative put forward by four Heads of State membersof the Intergovernmental Authority for Drought andDevelopment (IGADD): Kenya  Uganda  Ethiopia andEritrea. We believe that neighbouring countries are able andkeen to help in resolving this stalemate. Furthermore  theGovernment accepted the initiative of former PresidentJimmy Carter in mediating between the Government and therebel factions.In the area of economic development  the Governmentof the Sudan adopted an ambitious three-year economicprogramme for the implementation of far-reaching reformsin the structure of the Sudanese economy by engaging in afree-market policy  diminishing the role of the Governmentin trade and economic activities  and giving the privatesector its due catalytic role in these activities.Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 39Economic and monetary regulations were enacted toencourage investment  especially in agriculture and animalproducts. This economic programme reaped its fruits  andwe have registered an increase of over 10 per cent in therate of growth of the gross national product  as well as self-sufficiency in grain and sugar. This programme energizedthe economy and led to the inflow of foreign investment owing to the free-market policy  the reform of theinfrastructure and the building up of the capacity of humanresources.All these developments could have achieved positiveresults  not for the benefit of the Sudanese people alone  butalso for the African and Arab regions  had they not beenforestalled by political machinations in areas of internationaltrade and economic cooperation  as well as interference inthe work of the international monetary institutions. Anunjust and undeclared economic embargo deprived the Sudanof development resources from bilateral and multilateralinstitutions. This unjust behaviour deprived the people ofthe Sudan of their right to development  a right enshrined inall international conventions.In the social field  the Government is very attentive tothe needs of the impoverished sector of the population.Financial support is increasingly extended to them throughZakat funds and social-welfare institutions. A number ofcommercial subsidies were introduced to alleviate theeconomic burden of a broad sector of the population.Salaries in the public and private sectors were increased andsubjected to continuous revision. All this was done in fullcompliance with and respect for human dignity  and toeliminate poverty.Moreover  in the area of legislation  the Governmentexcluded the States with non-Muslim majorities from beingsubjected to Sharia laws.In the area of human rights  a Supreme Council forHuman Rights was established  under the chairmanship ofthe second-highest ranking official in the State.Security prevails throughout the country  the rule of lawhas replaced chaos  and there have been other greataccomplishments in the fields of education  literacy  health environment  and the improvement of the living conditionsof displaced persons and their relocation to ensure adignified life while they await the elimination of theconditions that forced them to become displaced persons.The position of Sudan has remained clear ever since thecommencement of the Arab-Israeli peace talks: we believethat they should lead to the exercise of Arab and Palestinianrights based on the provisions of Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978). Sincethe signing of the Declaration of Principles of self-autonomybetween the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) andIsrael  the Middle East and the Palestinians’ cause haveentered a new phase. The Arab League Council ofMinisters  after its 100th meeting in Cairo  issued acommuniqué on this agreement based on Security Councilresolutions. The communiqué emphasized the necessity ofan Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territoriesin the West Bank  the Gaza Strip  Jerusalem  the GolanHeights and southern Lebanon so as to open a new page inthe history of the Middle East and enable the people of theregion to work for development and prosperity. The ArabLeague Council considered the agreement a step forwardtowards the establishment of a comprehensive peace in theregion  provided that other steps to complement it wereguaranteed such as a complete Israeli withdrawal from theoccupied Syrian Golan Heights  the West Bank  includingJerusalem  and the territory in southern Lebanon.The Arab world has articulated its judgement on thishistoric agreement and proved its sincerity about desiring ajust  lasting and comprehensive settlement in the region. Atthis critical point in time  we appeal to our Palestinianbrothers to consolidate their unity and unify theirdeterminant objectives. They should close the doors againstany attempts to divide them. The United Nations is calledupon to supervise this peace plan by insisting on theimplementation of all its resolutions based on internationallegitimacy. The custodians of this peace plan are also calledupon to ensure an expeditious Israeli withdrawal from all theoccupied Arab and Palestinian territories  in full compliancewith the relevant United Nations resolutions.The positive developments taking place in South Africaas a result of the struggle of our brothers and sisters there intheir quest for emancipation  equality and the rule of themajority stand as proof of the important role the UnitedNations can play in accordance with the principles of theCharter whenever a Member State shows the necessarypolitical will. My delegation associates itself with the leaderNelson Mandela in his call upon the internationalOrganization to secure the transitional arrangements leadingto the emergence of a democratic  unified and non-racialSouth Africa.As an African country  we believe that Africa hasdemonstrated throughout history its unique ability to resolveAfrican disputes through African mediation. In this regard I salute the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  the40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionIntergovernmental Authority on Drought and Desertification(IGADD)  the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) and all other African subregional organizations as well as various African States that have played leadingroles in the peaceful settlement of several disputes in suchcountries as Rwanda and Liberia thus contributing to peace and stability in Africa. We hopethat peace will soon prevail in Angola  Mozambique andSomalia so that Africa can enjoy the stability that will enableit to meet the challenges of construction and developmentand move towards prosperity for the African people andpeople of the whole world."
"143",6131,"SEN",48,1993,"The General Assembly’s annual convening in New York isa world event which  each year  expresses the hope ofnations and peoples to find common ground  throughdialogue and joint effort  in order to live together theirshared destiny. In a world that is becoming daily morediverse and in which peoples are witness to so manycontradictions  is it not here and now  in close friendship andfraternal dialogue  that humanity  with its boundlessintellectual and ethical potential  can embark on a process ofself-examination and be reconciled with the universalconscience  which is also the foundation of our humancalling to live together and in harmony?It is in that belief that the delegation of Senegal - whichparticipated in your election  Mr. President  aware of yourbrilliant political record and the outstanding role yourcountry plays on the international scene - extends to youthrough me the warm congratulations of my country  ourpeople and its leaders. We have no doubt about yourmastery of international practice  for we know that your vastexperience as a statesman will make it possible for you toconduct  with effectiveness  intelligence and skill the workof this session of the General Assembly. My best wishesare thus with you in your election and with the task youhave been called upon to accomplish  until September 1994 from this historic and lofty rostrum.Your predecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  former Ministerfor Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria  guided the proceedings ofthe forty-seventh session of our General Assembly with acompetence and effectiveness that deserve our appreciationand gratitude. We wish heartily to congratulate him.I should like to pay a special tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the enormousenergy that he has expended with such foresight and courageto ensure the implementation of the principles and therealization of the objectives of the Charter of ourOrganization. The personal friendship that I have sharedwith that eminent citizen of the world for almost 25 yearsallows me to reiterate the esteem and admiration that I havealways felt towards him.Finally  I should like to extend my country’scongratulations to all the new States Members of ourOrganization - the Czech Republic  the Slovak Republic  theFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  the Principality ofMonaco  the Principality of Andorra and Eritrea. I welcomeall of them to the United Nations family.Some 15 years ago  in September 1978  I had thehonour for the first time  in my capacity as the new Ministerfor Foreign Affairs of Senegal  to address this Assembly.As the young head of the diplomatic corps of an Africancountry  I referred to the many problems then confrontingthe international community and which revolved around twobasic focal points.The first of these was the accession to politicalsovereignty of peoples that had not yet experienced freedom that had been denied the full exercise of inalienable rightsinherent to every human being on Earth. Those rights hadbeen denied them by other men  other peoples  other Statesand other nations in the name of a system that was imposedon them and to which they had been subjected. Hope intheir fellow man was their only defence.The other focal point of attention was the graveinequality of conditions for the economic  social  human andcultural development of nations. Some of these nations hadnear-total control of scientific developments  industrialtechnology  transport and communications  the cultural mediaand world trade networks. They even controlled the rawmaterials that were produced  to a great extent  in theunderdeveloped regions.At the same time  while the prices of these rawmaterials were falling year after year at a dizzying pace other nations were forced to buy at a high price and withreduced resources the consumer goods produced in theindustrialized countries. Those nations were devoting all oftheir export income to these transactions and were thereforeunable to invest in order to ensure their own development.Thus doomed to indebtedness  they lost a significant part ofForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 9their own sovereignty just as they were taking their firsttentative steps onto the international scene.And here we are today  15 years later  gathered togetherto evaluate  in an outpouring of solidarity  the distance wehave covered.The fact is that the world has changed - yes  it haschanged - and the transformations that characterize this endof the twentieth century are so profound that theinternational community at large feels the need to reformradically the way the United Nations functions  as regards particularly  the composition of the Security Council  thefinancial management of the United Nations and cooperationfor development  to mention just a few of the most acuteneeds of the present day.The world has changed. As for the African continent -to take this as a point of reference - most of the peoplesformerly under foreign domination have acceded toindependence. States have been created; the structures of aneconomy have been established; and political and economicleaders have been trained and set to work to help thesepeoples fulfil their destinies.But inequalities remain  even though an unprecedentedglobal crisis today affects the economies of all countries including even those of the most highly industrializednations. The world economy seems to have becomedislocated. It has lost its balance. New rules are establishedand developed day by day in the quest for new balances andnew solutions. And all this is done in a situation thatincreasingly jeopardizes international peace. This situationcould  if we are not careful  lead to impatience  tointolerance  to irritation  to a lack of dialogue - in short  toinevitable confrontation. Such a threat is unacceptable  andwe must not accept it.That is why  together with my colleagues the otherheads of delegations  I would like on behalf of my country -an African country  a Sahelian country  a developing country- to join other delegations in repeating to the nationsgathered here that  in spite of all these problems  we do nothave the right to despair.For it is obvious today that the salvation of humankindresides in solidarity and in friendship and cooperationbetween human beings. The fundamental and logicalunderpinnings of relations between peoples are  more thanever before  dialogue and agreement  expressed through firmlanguage that translates our thoughts about the human beingand about life.It is fortunate that a country such as France - which Iam pleased to mention  together with other industrializedcountries that are supporting Africa - reaffirmed just a fewdays ago in Paris  through Mr. Alain Juppé  Minister forForeign Affairs  that the West in general and the Europeancountries in particular must be aware that if the majority ofthe populations of the world remain hungry  poor  bearingthe weight of the distortions in the international economy and if  in addition  they see their efforts to achieve politicaland social democracy destroyed by difficulties of all types then there will always be a risk that international peace willbe destabilized.The industrialized countries must move in the rightdirection. They must understand that international solidaritycan be expressed only through the mutual support thatnations must give each other. In this respect  our continent Africa  and many Asian countries should receive this supportin a context of mutual respect. In other words  the proposalfor an ""agenda for development"" initiated by the Braziliandelegation  with the support of the Group of 77  toaccompany the ""Agenda for Peace"" submitted by ourSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  deserves theinternational community’s attention. This important measurereflects the concerns of the Head of State of Senegal President Abdou Diouf  who  when he addressed thisAssembly last year  on this very date  launched the idea ofa general agreement on solidarity as the foundation forfruitful international economic cooperation  the driving forceof North-South solidarity in a renewed form.Ancient African wisdom - the ancient wisdom of ourcontinent -teaches us that human beings  who alone canchange and improve their own environment  are endowedwith prodigious intellectual and moral resources  resourcesbased on intelligence  imagination and the ability to rise toa situation in a way that makes it possible for them to fulfiltheir destiny. We must remain united and mutuallysupportive.In this connection  the delegation of Senegal solemnlycommends the international community for the efforts thatmade possible the signing in Washington on13 September 1993 of the agreement between the State ofIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Thishistoric event put an end to many decades of hostility andrancour  which cost thousands of lives and left manywounded and many alone  orphaned or widowed - allbecause of a lack of understanding which itself led to thedestruction of the conditions for development in the MiddleEastern countries as a whole. And  what is more  there wasthe flare-up in oil prices which began in October 1973 and10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionwhich led to the inflationary curves that have since thencharacterized the global economy everywhere in the world.It is now up to the international community to work toconsolidate this important step in the direction of a just andcomprehensive peace in the Middle East. In this endeavour the United Nations family can rely  as in the past  on theconstant and active support of my country to ensure that inthat holy land Israelis and Palestinians can bring humankindinto harmony with its profound values of tolerance  wisdomand concord.That is also the way we view the efforts made toresolve conflicts that in the past seemed beyond any humansolution. I have in mind  inter alia  Cambodia  where thesettlement plan designed by the United Nations led to theholding in May 1993 of general  orderly and democraticelections  as a result of which a legitimate Government wasestablished; El Salvador  where  after several years of civilwar  negotiations conducted under the auspices of the UnitedNations led to the signing  at the beginning of last year  ofthe Mexico Agreement  which initiated a period of transitiontowards general elections planned for the beginning of 1994;Liberia  where repeated initiatives pursued by the membersof the Economic Community of West African States supported by the United Nations and by the Organization ofAfrican Unity  made it possible to conclude  in July 1993  anew peace agreement which should  as we fervently hope lead to a definitive settlement of that fratricidal conflict; andMozambique and Rwanda  where similar agreements havebeen concluded and where the United Nations has beenmeaningfully involved in their practical and completeimplementation.I also have in mind South Africa  where considerableprogress has been made toward eliminating a system whichthe entire world rejected and condemned  and where peoples united in fruitful diversity  must work together for theemergence of a human community characterized by justiceand equality. My country  Senegal  will respond to theappeal made in this Hall a few days ago by President NelsonMandela  when  from this very rostrum  he invited theinternational community to take a new approach consistentwith the evolution of the situation in his country.All of these are excellent examples of the fact thatthese new times bear new hopes  even though we still havegrounds for legitimate concern. In fact  despite the victoriesthat freedom has won  when peoples are liberated peace isnot always the result. The legacy of the collapsing old orderis in fact often an unwieldy one  difficult to manage. On theruins of oppression which lasted for far too long we mustbuild a new world  a world of freedom and peace  of justiceand progress.During this uncertain period of transition  borderconflicts  problems between neighbours and religioustensions bring a return to the conflicts - civil war  genocide rivalry among members of the same national community - ofan era we thought past. Yugoslavia  Somalia  Angola:there are many examples that show that universal peace  thatprimary objective of the United Nations  is yet but anaspiration.The challenge  therefore  is to do all in our power sothat in all parts of the world the freedoms regained will openthe way to peace. My country  Senegal  which has alwaysand in every way been committed to strengthening peace andpromoting security  feels that working towards this objectivemeans  first and foremost  affirming forcefully the rule oflaw in international relations. Lasting peace and security  infact  can be guaranteed only if all nations of the worldcomply with the rule of law in their relations with othernations. That law must be the same for all if justice is toprevail.In this context  and in connection with the tragedy ofthe fraternal people of Kuwait  I welcome the happyconclusions that have been reached by the Iraq-KuwaitBoundary Demarcation Commission. The internationalcommunity must continue to protect all States from anyexternal threat to their independence and sovereignty.My thoughts turn also to Bosnia and Herzegovina  amartyred State and a State Member of the United Nations.I believe the international community has endeavoured inevery stage of the evolution of the situation in the formerYugoslavia to guarantee the territorial integrity andsovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina  and the internationalcommunity has committed itself to enforcing  above all  therights of the Bosnian people  a people today undeniably thevictim of true genocide. This commitment must berespected because the very credibility of our Organization isat stake.In any event  it is in order to uphold respect for thatcommitment that my country  whose Head of State isChairman of the Sixth Islamic Summit Conference  intendsto continue the efforts he has already begun to contribute tothe promotion of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina  in closecooperation with all countries that cherish the same ideals ofpeace and justice.Forty-eighth session - 6 October l993 11I also have in mind the painful situation prevailing inAngola. The Bicesse Accords  although freely entered intoby the parties to the conflict  seem today to have collapsed.By calling into question the validity of the electionsorganized a year ago under those same Bicesse Accords UNITA has once again plunged Angola into an atmospherefraught with danger and uncertainty. The magnitude of thedestruction and suffering caused by this situation warrantsurgent efforts to arrive at a definitive cease-fire and aresumption of negotiations. The framework already exists:the Bicesse Accords  endorsed by the United Nations. Theprinciples on which any solution to the conflict must bebased are also very clear: the safeguarding of Angola’sterritorial integrity and national unity and also  above all respect for the will of the Angolan people  freely expressedin the elections a year ago.On these bases  my country would here like to send outa solemn appeal to all our Angolan brothers and sisters above all those of UNITA  to understand that it is not in theinterests of the Angolan people to continue the fighting. Theinterests of the Angolan people reside exclusively in thenational effort that all must make to restore peace andharmony to Angola. We Senegalese  for our part  support allefforts to help them in this regard.There is also the situation in Somalia  where a greatdeal remains to be done to restore peace and organize aviable State. The United Nations there is on the right path conducting the most ambitious and largest operation everorganized in Africa. My country would like to express itspleasure once again over the organization of this operationin a country that is today experiencing a tragic and complexsituation. The infrastructure has been devastated  the Statehas collapsed and fratricidal internal strife has engenderedmassive displacements of the population.In the face of this tragic situation and in support of theAddis Ababa Agreement  which was the result on last 28March of the Conference on National Reconciliation inSomalia  the international community  through the UnitedNations  gave the United Nations Operation in Somalia(UNOSOM II) a mandate to continue the disarmament andto work towards national reconciliation  and at the sametime  and most important  towards the strengthening ofpolitical institutions.We are pleased to note that today  in spite of thesporadic turmoil of recent months  UNOSOM II has begunto help the Somali people restore the sovereignty andintegrity of the State. It is in Somalia’s and the wholeinternational community’s interests for this mission tocontinue and that it achieve the desired results.I wish at this point to conclude my statement on ahopeful note.There is a clear awareness today that our planetarycommunity is inextricably interrelated  that it rests on anatural unity based on scientific and medical discoveries andthe speed of communications. But despite  and perhapsbecause of  this very progress there remains a certainfragility in the balance of our world.Our calling as human beings endowed with reason istherefore to remain united and to ensure together  hand inhand  the survival of humankind. It is our duty to see to itthat our populations live long and in good health  to see toit that future generations derive the greatest benefit from theexperiences we have had and that we are having now  sothat  tomorrow  our legacy to them will be a world that hasnot been destroyed  a generous nature  a land united on thesolid foundations of friendship  brotherhood  love and peace."
"144",6178,"SGP",48,1993,"Since PLO Chairman YasserArafat shook hands with the Israeli Prime Minister on theWhite House lawn  nothing seems impossible any more.The end of the cold war has opened opportunities to setaside some of the most intractable  destructive and polarizingconflicts of our time.Apartheid is coming to an end in South Africa. EasternEurope is free. Russia and the other States of the formerSoviet Union are shaking off the stifling effects of more than70 years of communism. Germany has been peacefullyreunited.In Asia  Cambodia is moving towards nationalreconciliation after almost 20 years of war. Viet Nam andLaos are reintegrating themselves into the South-East Asiancommunity.China and Taiwan held direct informal talks inSingapore and Beijing this year. They will continue theirown dialogue at their own pace. They should be encouragedto build confidence by working together  as they alreadyhave in the Asian Development Bank and the Asia-PacificEconomic Cooperation Council (APEC) and as they hope todo in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).Change has its own dynamic. And not all changes arebenign. The post-cold-war problems are legion and wellknown. It will be a challenge for the United Nations torespond. In recent years  there has been a marked expansionin the number and scope of the operations and activitiesauthorized by the Security Council.Established procedures  such as the Security Council-mandated Commission that has demarcated the boundarybetween Iraq and Kuwait  have made and will continue tomake positive contributions to stabilizing the post-cold-warworld  providing authoritative reference points. UnitedNations specialized agencies  such as the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  are playing an importantrole in holding renegade countries like North Korea tointernationally accepted standards of conduct in the criticalarea of nuclear non-proliferation. The internationalcommunity must continue to support such tried and testedmeasures and organizations.But there is also an expectation that the end of the coldwar will enable the Security Council to play more ambitiousroles and at last assume ""primary responsibility for themaintenance of international peace and security"" underChapters V and VII of the Charter. In Cambodia  Haiti andSomalia  among other places  the United Nations is breakingnew ground by actively interposing itself as a vitalstabilizing actor in situations which would once have beenconsidered essentially within the domestic jurisdiction ofStates.The legal  diplomatic and political implications of thesedevelopments are still unfolding and are not yet fullyunderstood. Not everyone is entirely comfortable with them.But I believe that most Member States regard the trend asgenerally positive and as making for a more secure world.The majority wants a more active and effective SecurityCouncil.The Secretary-General’s report on the question ofequitable representation on and increase in the membershipof the Security Council  submitted in accordance withGeneral Assembly resolution 47/62  has thus occasionedgreat interest. There is wide consensus that if it is to beeffective in the next century the Security Council cannotsimply extrapolate its mandate from the starting-point of1945 after the cold-war interregnum  but must accuratelyreflect the current configuration of global power.International order cannot be built on nostalgia. Too greata disjuncture from reality will doom the Security Council toeventual irrelevance. As membership of the United Nationsexpands  there is also a general expectation that the SecurityCouncil should become more representative of theOrganization as a whole.The composition of the Security Council is acompromise between the principle of the sovereign equalityof States and the realities of power politics. That all Statesare equal but that some  for better or for worse  have adisproportionate influence on the international order is a factof life. Great-Power leadership is vital. It is a reality.Recognition of the special status of great Powers is thus arequisite for effective action by the Security Council. Whenit comes to the crunch  only the great Powers can make adecisive difference. But the temper of our times alsodemands that if action is to command a general consensus:the great must seek the mandate of the many.Forty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 17The issue is  however  more easily defined thanresolved. The only previous increase in the size of theSecurity Council began in the 1956 session of the GeneralAssembly with discussions on an increase of non-permanentseats. Agreement was reached only in 1963 and came intoforce two years later  almost a decade after the process hadbegun. The lapse of time shows the complexities involved.The difficulties are still with us. To be sure  there areestablished principles laid down in Article 23 (1) of theCharter to guide the way to a possible further expansion ofnon-permanent seats. But there are no such guidelines forthe more crucial question of an increase in permanentmembers. The Secretary-General’s report must therefore berealistically considered as only the beginning of a longprocess of debate whose outcome cannot be confidentlypredicted at this point.There are two basic problems. The first is simply todecide what is the current configuration of internationalpower that should be reflected in the distribution ofpermanent seats. This is not as straightforward as it mayseem. When the Charter was being drafted  the end of theSecond World War  with easily discernible winners andlosers  was in sight and was being prepared for. Theintention was for the winners to have primary responsibilityfor guiding the new international order. Yet even then  twoof the ""Big Three"" victors  the Soviet Union and the UnitedKingdom  were sceptical of Roosevelt’s view of China’sability to play a major role in the post-war world.Churchill’s insistence on including France among the elitegroup was met with similar scepticism by Roosevelt andStalin.It will be even more difficult to decide who belongs tothe new elite. The end of the cold war took everyone bysurprise and was far from clear-cut in its resolution.Economic  political and military power no longer necessarilycohere in one single locus. The United States is victor  butits economic recovery is slow and its competitivenessblunted. Russia is in serious economic and politicaldifficulties but  because it has nuclear weapons  it remainsa military great Power exercising a commanding influenceon its former dominions  where the threat of chaos in thepost-cold-war world is also greatest. Japan and Germany areclearly world economic powerhouses  but both lack aninternal and regional consensus on the use of military forcesbeyond their borders.The second problem is even more fundamental andvexing. The United Nations is an international Organization.It is not and was never intended to be a supranationalorganization. The United Nations was created by sovereignStates and can do nothing without their assent  in whichprocess the permanent members have a more thanproportionate say through their veto. I state this withoutrancour as a fact well known to all. Any design forenhancing the effectiveness of the Security Council thereforecannot just be based on abstract wisdom concerning therequisites of the international order. No plan that has anyprospect of succeeding can avoid reckoning with calculationsof the national advantage of the current permanent members.But if the new Security Council is really to reflect thecurrent international distribution of power  the processshould logically entail the deposition of some from the eliteas well as the anointment of others. Even if some were tobe elevated without necessarily displacing others  theexpansion of the small group of the select would imply therelative diminution of the status of the current permanentmembers. It is not surprising  therefore  that only onepermanent member has so far come out unambiguously infavour of an expansion in the number of permanent seats.It does not take a cynic to wonder whether it wasemboldened to do so because the others have been soconspicuously coy on this critical point. No country hasever voluntarily relinquished privilege and power. We areafter all in the company of sovereign States  not saints.There is no circumventing the veto. There is noconstitutional means of amending the Charter without theassent of all the permanent members  some of whom maybelieve they stand to lose by it. Yet change is imperative ifwe are not to squander the opportunity afforded by the endof the cold war - more so for small States that have fewbetter choices than an effective United Nations for theirsecurity.To make progress  there is no alternative but graduallyto shape a consensus through a patient process of debate anddiscussion. To force the pace or attempt to impose amajority agreement will not work. At this preliminary stage it would be most useful to try to identify and buildconsensus on objective general criteria that all permanentmembers  present or aspiring  must fulfil. This is a moreclinical and constructive approach than engaging in a horserace or a beauty contest to pick specific countries. Toattempt to do so at this stage is premature and would onlybe divisive. But the identification of objective criteria willset a common standard and  if we can agree on them  aconsensus on specific countries will naturally emerge.This will entail thinking through the role of the UnitedNations into the next century. What challenges will the18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionUnited Nations face in the next decade? What will be therole and priorities of a new Security Council under theseconditions? What capabilities will it need? These difficultquestions demand the most exhaustive possible examination.The General Assembly should consider the formation of aworking group  representative of the whole membership  toconsider them and formulate agreed objective criteria for theexpansion of the Security Council  especially its permanentmembership.To stimulate discussion  Singapore suggests thefollowing:First  there should be a level playing field with regardto all present and future members of a possible expandedSecurity Council. Anachronistic references to ""enemyStates"" in Articles 53  77 and 107 of the Charter should beremoved. It is time to set aside the baggage of the past.Suggestions that there could be or should be a different setof permanent members without the veto are also impractical.No country that is capable of making a contribution as anew permanent member will accept such second-class statusfor long. It will only undermine the principle of great-Powercooperation  in the absence of which the Security Councilcannot function. Nor is it practical or even desirable to doaway with the veto. The fact that the veto has been abuseddoes not detract from its intended function. It is arecognition of the hard reality that great Powers will notconsent to put their power at the disposal of a sheer majorityfor the implementation of decisions which they do not agreewith. It is a safety valve that prevents the United Nationsfrom undertaking commitments that it lacks the power tofulfil. However  to minimize the misuse of the veto  ifpermanent membership is expanded at least two vetoesshould be required to block a resolution.Secondly  privilege must be paid for. An expanded rolefor the Security Council will require more resources. AUnited Nations perennially on the brink of financialinsolvency cannot effectively meet the challenges of the nextcentury. A permanent member should therefore carry alarger portion of the financial burden of the United Nations.Each permanent member should pay at least 9 per cent ofthe operating expenses of the United Nations as well as11 per cent of the costs of the peace-keeping operations ofthe United Nations  which are the average percentages of thepermanent five’s current collective percentage of thesebudgets.Thirdly  permanent members must have muscle and thewill and the capability to wield it for the cause of the UnitedNations. The main mission and primary responsibility of theSecurity Council is to maintain international peace andstability. Force will be needed in pursuit of order and theSecurity Council cannot be effective without a sword that issharp and ready. All permanent members should beprepared to give effect to Article 43 of the Charter and beready to place their military forces at the disposal of theUnited Nations and shed blood to uphold international orderif necessary.This list is by no means exhaustive. Other memberswill have their own suggestions for appropriate criteria. Iurge all members to participate in discussions on theexpansion of the Security Council so that we may have thebenefit of the fullest possible range of views and emergewith the widest possible consensus.Finally  Mr. President  I should like to congratulate youon your unanimous election. I am confident that you willlead the Assembly at this session effectively. I should alsolike to take this opportunity to welcome the six newMembers that have joined the Organization. I am certainthat they will contribute positively to the work of the UnitedNations."
"145",6211,"SLB",48,1993," Let me extend toyou  Sir  the warm greetings of my Government and thepeople of Solomon Islands. We congratulate you on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at this forty-eighth session. Your experience  diplomatic skills andleadership assure us of a successful and fruitful session.I also join in the tributes paid to your distinguishedpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria for the excellent manner in which he presided over theaffairs of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly.We join  too  in acknowledging and commending thereport (A/48/1) of the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  His Excellency Mr. Boutros-Boutros Ghali  on thework of the Organization. The report is a comprehensivecatalogue of the achievements of the United Nations  itsstrengths and weaknesses  the threats and opportunities theOrganization faces and the challenges it has before it. Allthese point to one common truth: there is an undeniabledisparity between idealism and reality  between the mountingresponsibilities of the Organization and its capacity toachieve pragmatic  focused and specific goals. The gapbetween promotion of the ideals of the Charter andrealization of them continues to widen.Over the last three weeks  we have heard MemberStates renewing their support for  and commitment to  thisbody. It is clear that the Organization is calling out for ourattention. It needs us all  just as much as we need it;perhaps it now needs us more than ever before to strengthen6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionit and enhance its performance in its delivery of services andgoods to our many peoples around the globe.Mr. President  your opening statement 22 days agoconcluded with the visionary challenge  ""We the peoples -united for a better world"" (A/48/PV.1). In the spirit of afamily of nations  the United Nations will be celebrating thistheme at its fiftieth anniversary in 1995. While SolomonIslands shares this vision  it counsels against extravagance waste and mere symbolistic ceremonials which do not reflectlong-term substantive benefits. To mark the occasion withserious reflection  education and communication  carefulplanning and a wider consultation programme at all levels ofthe international community will be essential. Awarenessprogrammes and activities aimed at promoting the principleof unity in diversity should be a key to strength and wealth both for nations and for the global community. A goalwhich can be promoted during the fiftieth-anniversarycelebrations is that of world citizenship  or citizens of planetEarth.The basis for this should be very simple: everyoneliving on this planet has a responsibility for its sustainablegrowth. Everyone must be aware of  and feel concerned at the possibility of our destroying the planet. Individualsmake up communities. Communities make up nations.Nations make up the global community. The globalcommunity lives on this planet.Citizens of Planet Earth  or world citizenship  is aunifying vision of a peaceful  prosperous global society.This emerges from a sense of responsibility and theacceptance of the oneness of humanity. To embrace thisvision of world citizenship into the twenty-first century leaders and Governments must change their attitudes to takeon the greatest challenge facing the world community -releasing the enormous financial  technical  human and moralresources required for the sustainable development of ourplanet. Can we collectively face this challenge in order toimplement the various components of Agenda 21? Theanswer lies in the hands of the people and the nations of theworld. How can we make this theme a reality - a reality notonly for us at this time but also for future generations onthis planet?I was heartened to hear the President of the UnitedStates  Mr. Bill Clinton  say these words on the first day ofthe general debate:""The United States intends to remain engaged and tolead."" (A/48/PV.4  p. 8)He also went on to say:""... we must and will serve as a fulcrum for change anda pivot point for peace."" (ibid.)The Solomon Islands is currently working with theUnited Nations Development Programme on a pilotprogramme called ""Children of Planet Earth"" (COPE).COPE is an environmental educational-awarenessprogramme aimed at primary-school children. It will beincorporated into the school curriculum as a modulecompulsory for all children. There will be no pass or failgrade  but any child who completes the module will get aUnited Nations badge or a certificate. The module willfocus on the environment and on sustainable growth  andnational  regional and international perspectives will be builtinto it. The Solomon Islands strongly believes thateducation with regard to the environment is important anddeserves priority investment. The target group is thechildren  because they will be the leaders of tomorrow.Two weeks ago  His Excellency Shimon Peres  IsraeliForeign Minister  described war and peace in this way:""In war  the old bury the young  and in peace  theyoung bury the old.""I thought this was quite revealing. It tells of a reality a reality which has written a new chapter with a change ofheart. The handshake between Palestine LiberationOrganization leader Mr. Arafat and Israeli Prime MinisterMr. Rabin on Capitol Hill symbolized a major milestone inMiddle East history. The Solomon Islands welcomes thisgreat advancement in human relations between these twonations. It is hoped that the process of creating forgivenessand trust will pave the way for lasting peace in the MiddleEast. I applaud the countries that have pledged financialassistance or assistance in kind to Palestine.The forty-eighth session of the General Assemblyopened at the dawn of a new era in South African history.African National Congress leader Mr. Nelson Mandela renowned for his struggle against apartheid  made a movingstatement at this very rostrum requesting the lifting ofeconomic sanctions against South Africa. To see Mr.Mandela and President De Klerk moving towards SouthAfrica’s first non-racial elections is an immense andpromising change. At last  both leaders have decided totravel in the same bus of democracy. We too join the restForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 7of the world in welcoming this first historic step towardsmajority rule in South Africa.The parameters for the global agenda of the UnitedNations General Assembly have evolved slowly over theyears. However  not only have agenda items changed fromtime to time  but they have increased in number as well.The issues before the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly fall into the following broad categories: first making and keeping peace; second  arms controls anddisarmament; third  economics and development; fourth global resource management; fifth  human rights and othersocial issues; sixth  international legal issues; and seventh financing and administration of the United Nations.Each of these broad headings receives a thoroughsurvey and analysis at every session of the GeneralAssembly from both the developed and the developing partsof the globe. Some speakers focus specifically on certainissues  such as making and keeping peace  or arms controland disarmament; others draw the General Assembly’sattention to such matters as economic development  global-resources management  human rights and other social issues.The debate so far has been interesting.A quick overview of what has been said so far fromthis rostrum reveals a global picture that is both bright andgloomy. One truth  articulated by almost every speaker inthe area of world peace and security is that the threat ofconflicts between States has not diminished  even after thesuper-Power rivalry has been eroded. Senator Gareth Evans the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs  captured thequestion of world peace and security in a more imperativeway when he addressed this Assembly at its 5th meeting  on27 September. He referred to the resurgence ofethno-nationalism  which often takes a violent form  givingethnic groups a claim to minority human rights protection aswell as a claim to self-determination.Speaking on behalf of the European Communities Mr. Willy Claes  Deputy Prime Minister and Minister forForeign Affairs of the Kingdom of Belgium  patrolled themajor trouble spots of the world in a memorandum attachedto his statement. The Solomon Islands appreciates theefforts of the European Communities in resolving regionalconflicts throughout the world and welcomes its commitmentto world peace and security. The Balkan crisis has becomea cryptic jigsaw puzzle. Human suffering continues.Peacemakers and peace-keepers have tried  and are stilltrying  to find a solution. The Solomon Islands deplores theatrocities committed and appeals to the nations with waysand means to bring peace to this region. As peace is beinggiven a chance in Asia  the Middle East  Africa  LatinAmerica and the South Pacific regions  so may it be givena chance in the Balkan region.In his address to the General Assembly on 28September  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the RussianFederation referred to the Bosnian conflict and remarked:""... the key to the settlement of many conflicts has notyet been found."" (Official Records of the GeneralAssembly  Forty-eight Session  Plenary Meetings  6thMeeting  p. 15)He also said:""In any case  it is surely time to think of establishingcloser contacts between the United Nations and theworld’s leading religions."" (ibid.  p. 15)It appears that there is a missing dimension to theapproaches employed in conflict resolution.As we consider the growing number of problemsconfronting our world  we cannot escape the feeling that thesolutions will not simply be political  economic or social. Inmany cases  the problems are so complex and so deep-seatedthat we need superhuman help. A new prescription for truepeace must include the development of the spiritual andpastoral well-being of all peoples around the world.To this important extent  my Government recognizes as its first principle ""the sovereignty of God as the basis ofrighteousness  justice and dignity in thedevelopment of the Solomon Islands and itspeople.""We realize that neither the individual nor society can achievefull potential without the help of Almighty God. If God issovereign in the affairs of our world  would we not be wiseto bring Him into the planning process as well as give Hima place in the resolution of conflicts  whether national regional or global?The question of New Caledonia  in the South Pacific has been on the agenda of the United Nations for sometime - but not for much longer  I hope. Solomon Islandsjoins its colleagues in the South Pacific region in endorsingthe recent report on New Caledonia of the MinisterialCommittee of the South Pacific Forum. As a member of8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionthat Committee  I hereby humbly express our appreciationand gratitude for the cooperation and support of the Frenchand territorial authorities in facilitating the recent visit ofMinisters to the Territory. My Government also reaffirmsits strong support for the Committee’s recommendations andrenews its firm support for the aspirations and goals of thepeople of New Caledonia  including the Kanak community.We note the progress of the Matignon Accords  and  whilesensitive to the varying and conflicting interpretations andexpectations  we urge all parties to maintain theircommitment to the Matignon process and to the promotionof economic  political and social development in NewCaledonia.The United Nations is a strong supporter of peace.This noble world body has  to date  supported thereunification of the two Germanys and of the two Koreas.In this context  reunification means only one thing - theuniting of people. Unification means peace and coexistence.Conflicts in areas around the world should be resolvedthrough dialogue. Thus  we believe that the United Nationsmechanism that was used in the case of Germany and in thecase of the two Koreas should be applied to the situationinvolving the Republic of China and the People’s Republicof China.Solomon Islands recognizes the need for reunificationof the two Chinas through good will and in good faith. Wecall on both to hold talks  on equal terms  on the basis ofthis important United Nations principle. But the process canbe successful only if this world body considers theexceptional situation of the Republic of China on Taiwan inthe international context  based on the principle ofuniversality of membership and in accordance with theestablished model of parallel representation of dividedcountries at the United Nations.Solomon Islands fully recognizes and strongly supportsthe wish of the people of the Republic of China to rejoin theUnited Nations. As a small  friendly nation with apopulation of only about 300 000  Solomon Islands firmlybelieves that the desire of the 21 million people of theRepublic of China in Taiwan for their own representation inthis world body is reasonable and justified. We are sure thatthe international community would benefit from the positivecontribution that the Republic of China is capable of makingto this Organization. Our own country has benefited  in thepast 10 years  from the economic development andtechnological progress that the people of the Republic ofChina have secured through achieving for their country sucha high position in the league of the industrialized nations.Solomon Islands therefore supports the call from otherMember States for the establishment of an ad hoc committeeto examine the question of the Republic of China rejoiningthe United Nations.The mere existence of weapons of mass destructionposes a big threat to global peace and security. However even more worrying is the potential proliferation of nuclear chemical  biological and ballistic missiles - the danger oftheir falling into the wrong hands. We applaud the countriesthat have taken positive steps towards the elimination ofthese weapons. We also welcome the Secretary-General’sreport on new dimensions of arms regulation anddisarmament in the post-cold-war era. We believe in theintegration of arms-regulation efforts into the broaderstructure of international peace and security  theglobalization of arms control and of the disarmament processand the revitalization of arms control. We strongly proposethat the arms-control and disarmament agenda clearly reflectthe realities of the post-cold-war era. This is the challengefor the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly.Turning to nuclear testing in our region  I must say thatour continuing desire and concern is to ensure that the SouthPacific region remains a nuclear-free zone and a zone freeof all types of radioactive waste. Solomon Islands thereforemaintains its support for further suspension of nuclear testingin our region. We warmly welcome the decisions of theUnited States  Russia and France to extend their testingmoratoriums. In this vein  owing to recent developments we call upon China and the United Kingdom seriously toconsider declaring similar moratoriums.Solomon Islands is gravely concerned about thedumping of radioactive and other waste at sea. We thereforeurge the States parties to the London Dumping Conventionof 1972  when they adopt amendments in November thisyear  to continue their active support for a total ban on suchdumping.The shipment of plutonium  with the danger that itposes to the fragile marine ecosystem of the South Pacific is a matter of major concern to the Governments of theregion. The highest international safety and securitystandards must be adhered to. Any nation engaging in thisbusiness must satisfactorily address all possiblecontingencies.There is a clear message in statements issued by Statesmembers of the Group of 77. It points to the increasingconnection between environmental concerns anddevelopmental issues  to the delicate balance between theenvironment and development  between population andForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 9development  and between good government anddevelopment.Member countries of the South Pacific Forum werewell represented at the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro Brazil  in June 1992. A principal outcome of the RioConference is Agenda 21 - an action plan for the 1990s andthe twenty-first century. It sets forth strategies andintegrated-programme measures to halt and reverse theeffects of environmental degradation and to promoteenvironmentally sound and sustainable development in allcountries.Once again Solomon Islands reaffirms its strongcommitment to sustainable development. We believe thatsound environmental practices constitute an integral part ofthe development process. Thus  all development activitiespursued must be both economically and ecologically sound.The collective voice of small island developing States isheard through the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS)which share unique circumstances  vulnerabilities andlimitations. These include their small size and relativegeographic remoteness  a narrow range of resources  severepopulation stress  sometimes minimal renewable fresh waterresources  and high degrees of endemism. These pressuresand limitations underscore the need for careful andsustainable management of resources to sustain futuregenerations. This point was highlighted in our country’sstatement last year.Solomon Islands  like its other South Pacificneighbours  continues to rely heavily  and in some casestotally  on the sea  the land  the rivers  the forests and the airaround us for its livelihood and survival. Solomon Islandstherefore attaches great importance to environmental issuesand accords high priority to collective efforts in the UnitedNations Conference on Environment and Developmentfollow-up activities and the implementation of Agenda 21 including other  associated principles and conventions.Solomon Islands is a party to the Port Vila Declaration onPopulation and Sustainable Development. We thereforecontinue to support preparations for the forthcoming twomajor Conferences in 1994 - the Barbados GlobalConference on the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States and the Cairo World Conference onPopulation and Development.Solomon Islands is one of the few countries in theSouth Pacific that now has a national environmentmanagement strategy endorsed by the Government. Thatstrategy is now in the implementation phase  in whichpriority areas for action at the national level have beenidentified.Human-induced climate change and its subsequenteffect of sea-level rise is perhaps the most intractable threatto human well-being and the survival of many species onEarth. The South Pacific is no exception. Solomon Islandsis a signatory of the Framework Convention on ClimateChange and will soon complete the necessary requirementsfor its ratification. The formalities for the ratification of theMontreal Protocol are under way. We warmly welcome thespeedy action of the United Nations in establishing aCommission on Sustainable Development and  in particular we welcome the acceptance of the South Pacific Forumsecretariat as a special representative to the Commission andthe South Pacific Regional Environment Programme(SPREP) as an observer in the Commission.Solomon Islands applauds the initiative taken by theGovernment of Papua New Guinea in putting forward through the United Nations system  the agenda item onopportunity and participation. The adverse economicchanges in recent years have created difficult circumstancesfor many small countries. There is a need to identifyoptions in order to make possible participation byGovernments and peoples of developing countries on anequal footing. Solomon Islands welcomes the proposal inthe Papua New Guinea initiative for the establishment of apanel of experts to study and recommend ways of increasingopportunity and participation for developing countries.Speaking about Papua New Guinea  I should like toconvey Solomon Islands’ profound appreciation to theUnited Nations for the goodwill mission it sent last year todiscuss the problems we had encountered at the borderbetween Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. I amhappy to report that the new Solomon Islands Government through its six-point initiative  is working constructively withits neighbour  Papua New Guinea  to find a lasting peacefulsolution to the problems at our border.Proper management and good fishing practices areessential for the sustainable use of marine living resources.The major income earner of Solomon Islands is fisheries.Solomon Islands supports the United Nations Convention onthe Law of the Sea. Preparations for its ratification arebeing considered. The Solomon Islands Governmentstrongly supports the work of the Forum Fisheries Agency(FFA) and appeals to distant-water fishing nations tocooperate with the management and conservation measuresstipulated by that Agency.10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe new Government of Solomon Islands has justofficially launched its blueprint document entitled ""Statement of Policies"". The Government’s philosophy ofwhere and how to steer the country over the next four yearsis laid out in this document. The Government is embarkingon a major programme of economic and social reformsaimed at attaining sustainable development. The ministriesresponsible are currently discussing and putting together aprogramme of structural adjustment. The programmeemphasizes the sustainable management of natural resources public-sector reforms and the promotion of private-sectordevelopment. It devotes particular attention to the sizes andcosts of institutions  and outlines proposals for theredeployment of resources to areas of production and need.The preparation of this programme is expected to becompleted by November 1993.While this exercise is considered to be a long-termviable undertaking  it is necessary to seek externalassistance. The Government of Solomon Islands is fullycommitted to this long-overdue reform  but appeals tointernational financial institutions and donors to providefinancial assistance and advice.On human rights  the Solomon Islands Governmentfully supports the Vienna Declaration and Programme ofAction which were the outcome of the World Conference onHuman Rights held from 14 to 25 June 1993. Fundamentalrights and freedoms of the individual are listed in chapter II sections 3 to 19 of our national Constitution. We condemnany violation of human rights anywhere in the world. Wealso join the rest of the world in the promotion of humanrights and support those who have spoken in favour of theestablishment of a post of high commissioner for humanrights. Such a post would indeed be a worthwhileinvestment.Solomon Islands also salutes the work and courage ofthose countries that contribute troops and humanitarianassistance to trouble-spots all over the world. We pray forthe souls of those who have died in the field. We stronglydeplore the actions of those who have committed atrocitiesagainst peace-keepers  Red Cross workers and associatedpersonnel. Solomon Islands therefore strongly supports NewZealand’s initiative in requesting the inscription on theGeneral Assembly’s agenda of the critical item on the safetyof personnel in United Nations peace-keeping operations.The United Nations Charter has now been physicallyreduced to a pocket-sized booklet  but the demands thenations of the world place on this global Organizationoutstrip the limits of its capabilities and the resources at itsdisposal. Perhaps this is a positive sign - a justification ofthe need for its continuing existence.A few more flags have been added at the UnitedNations this year. We warmly welcome the new Membersof the United Nations family and congratulate theirGovernments and peoples on taking this courageous step.In 1945 the founders of the United Nations saw theneed to set up this body. Today  we are challenged in nouncertain terms to ensure that the work that was begun 48years ago continues  to keep the Organization alive  relevant meaningful and cost effective. It is the only hope for worldpeace and security and for the promotion of democracy development and global-resource management. MemberStates request the Organization to be accountable  and so weMember States too must return to it our individual dueresponsibilities.May the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations bringa new dawn to human relations between all peoples aroundthe world."
"146",6257,"SLE",48,1993,"Last year  my Head ofState  Captain Valentine E. M. Strasser  acquainted this bodywith the devastation visited on Sierra Leone as the result ofthe civil war in Liberia. He described to this Assembly thepain and agony that Sierra Leoneans have had to endure asa result of that conflict  and the ramifications it portendedfor regional peace and security.Regrettably  I am constrained to inform this body  notonly that the war in Sierra Leone has persisted  but that thelives of many innocent Sierra Leoneans have continued to belost. What we are witnessing today is the internal40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessiondisplacement of more than 400 000 Sierra Leoneans andmore than 250 000 others who have had to seek refugeestatus in neighbouring countries  not to mention thedevastation caused to the national economy.Thus  with our territory devastated and our economynearly destroyed  it is understandable that my country is soanxious that peace should return to Liberia. Without peace Sierra Leoneans cannot embark on the economicreconstruction of their country. Sierra Leoneans are alsohopeful that if peace should return  we can start picking upthe pieces of what is left of our country and get on with ourlives  and that the massive diversion of our resources toprosecute a rebel war will no longer be necessary. It is alsoour hope that with the conflict behind us  the Government ofthe National Provisional Ruling Council will be able to giveits undivided attention to the essential task of nation-building. We therefore renew our appeal  from this rostrum for timely humanitarian assistance for the hundreds ofthousands of our fellow citizens who have been displacedand made refugees  for it is only with such help that theycan start their lives anew.The socio-economic assistance of this Organization willalso be necessary for our post-war reconstruction andrehabilitation efforts. Our cri du coeur is for theinternational community to provide the requisite support andassistance for a country desperately in need  through no faultof its own; a country that has acted as its brother’s keeper in the true meaning of that expression  and on behalf of theinternational community to bring an end to bloodshed andhelp restore law and order in Liberia.It is  therefore  our hope that the latest CotonouAgreement on that conflict will continue to pave the path topeace in Liberia. It was my Government’s expectation thatby now  with the assistance of the Security Council  therewould have been a rapid establishment and deployment ofthe United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL)and also meaningful support for the Trust Fund establishedby the Secretary-General for the continued engagement ofthe Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) Military Observer Group (ECOMOG) inLiberia.Part of that peace plan calls for the establishment of abuffer zone along our borders to prevent the infiltration intoour territory of men and matériel from Liberia. In the nameof regional peace and security  we call on this Organizationto give its full support to our request. International help forECOMOG is particularly necessary when one considers thatfor the past two years  West African countries have beenshouldering the burden of maintaining peace in Liberiawithout much outside help  in spite of the enormousproblems facing them individually and collectively. In aregion which contains 10 of the least developed and poorestnations  it is obvious that sooner  rather than later  the WestAfrican subregion will not be able to continue with theECOMOG burden without such outside help.I would like to issue a note of warning here: theCotonou Agreement  in our view  offers the last chance tobring peace to Liberia. If it should fail  we fear that thatcountry might become another Somalia. Hence  the supportof the United Nations remains indispensable. We thereforehope that Member States will contribute  and contributegenerously  to the Trust Fund. Doing so would save lives.Before continuing with my line of thought  on behalf ofthe Sierra Leone delegation and on my own behalf  I shouldlike to convey warm greetings to Ambassador Insanally onhis unanimous election to preside over our deliberationsduring the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly.It is also fitting that I express my delegation’s sincereappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev  hispredecessor  for the able manner in which he executed histask and for his personal exertions in the advancement of thenoble objectives of our Organization.Our distinguished Secretary-General has  stoically andwith dedication and determination  continued his yeoman’sservice on behalf of us all. We congratulate him warmly onhis latest report.I should also like to extend the best wishes of theGovernment and the people of Sierra Leone to the friendlyGovernments and peoples of those countries that have joinedus in this Assembly as full Member States. We have nodoubt that their admission has not only enhanced the goal ofuniversality; with their new energies they will effectivelycontribute to our quest for a more peaceful world.We believe that our Organization is at a crossroad  thatwhat we say and commit ourselves to during this sessionwill have serious implications on the shape of things tocome  and that the rebirth of this Organization will requirelearning from the lessons of the recent past and adjusting ourvision for the future.Sierra Leone had sincerely hoped that the end of thecold war era would usher in a golden millennium of peaceand prosperity for all. Unfortunately  however  we havewitnessed a series of situations all over the world that haveForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 41given rise to a more violent and insecure internationalenvironment. We are faced with conflicts and misery thathave adversely influenced the lives of vast sectors ofhumanity  and we now feel an even deeper sense ofhelplessness and despair that makes us almost nostalgic forthe order and logic of bygone days. But nostalgia has nopurpose if it serves only to pander to escapism  withoutusing the lessons of the past to guide our future courses ofaction.Let me now turn to an issue that continues to deeplyconcern us all  namely  peace-keeping. The principle andefficiency of peace-keeping are not in question  but alreadyexpenditures for peace-keeping have several times overoutstripped the Organization’s regular budget. Moretroubling is the prospect that such expenditures will soonexceed resources committed to development since theestablishment of the United Nations. We sincerely believethat the time has come when more attention should be givento conflict prevention and resolution.It would serve ourpurpose much better and cost this Organization much less ifconflicts were contained and resolved before reaching thepoint of open hostilities  when situations are more difficultto control. We can catalogue a series of lost opportunitiesof which one glaring example is the Liberian conflict. Letus  from this point forward  give more attention to theprevention of conflict rather than having to field troops invarious theatres of war at exorbitant cost. Recent eventshave proved that we cannot afford to risk the lives of ourmen in the field in situations that could have been prevented.Let me reiterate Sierra Leone’s firm conviction andcommitment to the peace-keeping operations that are nowtaking place throughout the world. We deplore the acts ofthose who have made peace-keepers objects of theirviolence  and we salute the gallant men and women who areacting on behalf of us all.However  our perseverance in the pursuit of globalpeace and in peace-keeping will not reap the desired harvestif the present proliferation of arms and ammunition totheatres of conflict continues. As we all are aware  manythird world countries where military conflicts are ragingtoday do not manufacture arms. On the other hand  theycontinue to be the recipients of some of the deadliestweapons. Such weapons  when supplied to the contendingfactions  be they rebels or others  have as their main victimsinnocent civilians. Today  we are witnessing carnage andloss of human life  as a result of the use of weaponsacquired by various rebel movements in Africa from armsmanufacturers over the years.It therefore becomes obvious that  if we are to put astop to such blood-letting and human carnage  furtherstringent measures must be imposed on the sale andproliferation of arms and ammunition. In our view  into thiscategory falls the proliferation and ever-increasing use ofmines and other explosive devices in the third world whichhave taken a heavy toll in human life  especially innocentcivilians. Many civilians continue to die because of theindiscriminate manner in which these mines have beenplanted and used by rebel forces ever since they wereacquired from unknown sources. We therefore welcome theinitiative taken by the European Community to inscribe anitem on the agenda of this session of the Assembly toaddress such issues. We believe that the support of theinternational community is indispensable to dealing with thedisastrous consequences of the presence of such mines.While still on the issue of conflicts  we wish to reiterateour support for the recently concluded InternationalConference for the Protection of War Victims and itsrecommendations. We are firmly convinced thathumanitarian law must be made completely universal  widelyknown and fully respected  and must be extended to fullycover non-international conflicts.My delegation continues to watch with interest thepolitical developments gaining momentum in South Africa.Yet  much as the ongoing negotiations offer hope for aresolution of this problem  we are deeply saddened that thecontinuing violence  directed especially against innocentpeople - the majority of whom are blacks - goes onundiminished. Violence  in whatever form  is an abhorrence but its pursuit by unscrupulous groups and individuals toreap political capital  at a time when patience  courage commitment and tolerance are required  can only give us allcause for concern.We therefore wish to appeal to all  regardless ofaffiliation  to exercise forbearance and to renounce the useof violence. But  more so  we call on all Governments andpolitical leaders to use their influence with their supportersto prevail upon them not to threaten the democratizationprocess and to work constructively for a better South Africa.This appeal goes also to all emerging democracies.Now that the goal of majority rule is in sight  it is timefor blacks  who have for long suffered under the odioussystem of apartheid  to close their ranks in solid unity sothat  together  they may be able to let the new South Africacreate an impact on the international scene  for their ownbenefit and the benefit of all South Africans.42 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionWe appeal to black South Africans to forge greaterunity and to be conscious of their responsibility to disprovethe assertion of the apologists for apartheid that blacks areincapable of ruling themselves. For it is only when they actin unison and stop the violence that they will be able toenjoy the fruits of their freedom struggle  which they haveendured for so long and are  at last  about to win.Sierra Leone has for many years supported acomprehensive solution to the Middle East conflict  based onSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).We see the recent mutual recognition of the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel as an extremelypositive step towards the full restoration of peace in theMiddle East.We also encourage all the parties to the ongoingnegotiations concerning other facets of the Middle Eastproblem to demonstrate the same spirit of accommodation inthe interests of their own people  who for decades haveknown nothing but strife  conflict  suffering and hatred  andin the interests of peace and of mankind as a whole.Sierra Leone supports the territorial integrity of Kuwait.I would now like to turn to another important matter inthis Organization: that is the functioning of the SecurityCouncil.Undoubtedly  just as a growing number of nationscontinue to encourage greater participation by their citizensin the attainment of the ends of the State  so must thisnational awareness of the need for political harmony andjustice be a paradigm instructive to the Security Council which  as the primary organ responsible for the maintenanceof international peace and security  should be perceived aslegitimate in its decision-making process and  thus  shouldembrace the views of a wider section of the internationalcommunity.It is necessary at this juncture to express our concerns -concerns that are shared by many small States Members ofthis Organization - regarding the willingness of theinternational community  but more so its major players  toensure respect for the principles enshrined in our Charter.It is clear that the time has come to articulate the normativevalues that are to be pursued in guaranteeing the security ofthose who are not in a position to undertake their owndefence and to reassure them that their reliance on theUnited Nations as the guarantor of their sovereignty againstviolations by stronger nations has not been misplaced.The failure to halt aggression in some recent cases hasseriously undermined the foundations of the commonsecurity arrangement that the end of the cold-war presaged.The repeated indecision with which aggression in differentparts of the world has been confronted has set a dangerousprecedent by undermining the confidence of small nations inthe Organization’s protective capacity and by encouragingautomatic resort to self-defence  with a concomitant increasein arms build-up. It also goes some way to assuaging theresidual fears that perpetrators of massive violations ofhuman rights  even genocide  may have had that theirdespicable actions will somehow be met with purpose andresolve by the international community.In the coming days  there must be a firm  unequivocal timely and balanced response from the internationalcommunity to threats to and breaches of international peaceand security if the Bosnian experience is not to become afeature of relations between States. It is undesirable to allowthe view to prevail that the international community is moredisposed to act forcefully in certain instances than in others.It is in this vein that we must express our concern over theapparent deterioration of the security situation in Somalia.We express the belief that  despite the provocation  adistinction must continue to be made between the Somalipeople  the warlords and gunmen. We firmly reject thosewho want to impose tyranny on the Somali people  and weexpress our heartfelt condolences to the families of thosegallant peace-keepers who have fallen while on duty inSomalia.The World Conference on Human Rights held inVienna in June this year was a landmark event which wasable to overcome the numerous challenges that it faced.That Conference addressed  inter alia  such fundamentalhuman rights as the rights of women and children andreaffirmed the universality of human rights and thelegitimate role of the international community in protectingthese rights worldwide. It also reaffirmed the importance ofeconomic  social and cultural rights and the right todevelopment  and it adopted several practical steps topromote and protect human rights in both private and publiclife. The challenge now facing us is to implement therecommendations of that Conference.We would not like to reopen the debate regardinghuman rights standards. The United Nations establishedthose standards more than 40 years ago. What is importantis that human rights should remain universal andnon-selective. Human beings all over the world  irrespectiveof their race  religion  gender or class  must enjoy equalrights and protection.Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 43We see the re-emergence of racism and ethnic conflictat its genocidal worst today in various parts of the world.The United Nations must assume a much stronger role intrying to prevent and minimize the suffering caused topeople who are subjected to the pain and intimidation of thisdark display of man’s inhumanity to man. Regrettably  inmany lands today  on every continent and among peoples ofevery race  colour  language and religion  conflicts erupt inunspeakable violence. As has been observed  ethnic tensionshave become the racial fault line in widely diverse societiesall over the globe - the advanced  the developing  therelatively stable and the unstable alike. We must redoubleour efforts and guard against such dangers.Sierra Leone continues to be concerned by the problemof refugees and displaced persons  particularly as weourselves have become victims of such a phenomenon.Apart from the effort to prevent and avert the flow ofrefugees  if our people are to be able to return to theircommunities  remain there and rebuild their lives they musthave what the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees calls ""emergency development funds"" to meet theirbasic needs in the areas of health care  education andemployment. While acknowledging the generosity that theinternational community has shown in the past in respect ofrefugees worldwide  we appeal to that community in general and to the major donors in particular  not to give in to ""aidfatigue"" but to meet the urgent and felt needs of theirbrethren and sisters  many of whom have found themselvesrefugees overnight through no fault of their own.Sierra Leone therefore urges the internationalcommunity to look at these ever-present challenges: how toassist uprooted people  particularly in the context of conflictand grinding poverty; how to enable the displaced to returnhome in safety and dignity and rebuild their lives; and howto prevent and solve refugee problems.However  while providing help and assistance tomitigate the refugee problem  we remain convinced thatunless and until the international community can overcomethe scourge of poverty  that problem will remain insolubleand be constantly with us. It is therefore our fervent hopethat  even at this late hour  renewed impetus will once againbe found to prevent and eradicate this condition of humanmisery.The necessity of guaranteeing the foundation of acommon security evidently goes beyond the reduction orelimination of military conflicts and embraces humansecurity as a whole. Indeed  the fortunes of many a societywill hinge on this  as in many developing countries the rootcause of political and social upheaval or military conflictremains grinding poverty. Without the eradication of thisscourge  the prospect for human development will remainbleak. Regrettably  for many of our countries in Africa especially the least developed among us  two years after theadoption of the New Agenda for the Development of Africain the 1990s our experience has been one of disappointmentand frustration. Even though most African countries havecarried out the structural adjustment programmes and put inplace democratic structures  the development partnershippromised by the New Agenda has not been forthcoming.With few exceptions  the resources necessary to get the NewAgenda implemented have not been made available.Today poverty and underdevelopment continue toplague countries like mine in sub-Saharan Africa despite thecommendable efforts of this Organization to solve some ofthese palpable problems. It is a matter of regret that thenew world order seems to have relegated the economic anddevelopmental needs and problems of Africa to the lowerrungs on its list of priorities. The New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s is failing because of alack of funding and support from the internationalcommunity. The implementation of this New Agendarequires the full participation of the international community especially donor Governments and organizations andprogrammes of the United Nations system. It is therefore ofthe utmost importance and urgency that economic  technicaland development assistance be provided to Africa by theinternational community  which unfortunately has notresponded sufficiently to our needs. We therefore call onour partners in development to give us all the supportnecessary to make the reforms that we have carried outsuccessful and the sacrifices we have made not a mere wasteof time.Our present situation also underscores an urgent needfor support for the effective functioning of the proposedAfrican Economic Community  which is designed to enhanceeconomic integration and cooperation in Africa. Financialand technical assistance must be provided to Africanregional and subregional organizations for them to be ableto overcome the socio-economic challenges facing them.We fully accept that responsibility for Africa’s developmentrests with us Africans  but it is obvious that for us to be ableto achieve and sustain the goal of development  particularlyin the face of all the obstacles against us  including highlyunfavourable terms of trade  we must receive much strongersupport from the international community. With suchsupport  the vast potential of the continent will be properlyutilized so that we do not miss yet again an opportunity toprovide a catalyst for Africa’s meaningful contribution to the44 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessiongrowing global economy from which we all must benefit.It is for this reason that we look forward to the forthcomingTokyo International Conference on African Development which should provide yet another opportunity for committedinternational support for Africa’s development efforts. Wealso look forward to a balanced and successful outcome ofthe Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and anexpansion of world trade  improved commodity pricing greater market access and non-restrictive trade practices thatwill work for the benefit of all countries  especially those inthe process of development.The trauma that many African societies areexperiencing daily in the fight against poverty  malnutritionand disease must not be allowed to become a way of life.The improvement of our people’s lot is as much to berealized through aid flows as it is to be guaranteed bylong-term measures aimed at addressing the heavy debtburden  discriminatory trade practices and depressedcommodity prices from which so many of us suffer. We inAfrica would dearly love to be able to lift ourselves by ourown bootstraps but we cannot do so when our bootstraps arefirmly in the hands of others.We face a most painful dilemma  wherein we findourselves in a position from which we presently seem unableto influence the forces that shape our destinies. But theproblems we encounter as developing countries should notdeter us from forging ahead to find new ways todevelopment and prosperity. The experience gained by suchcountries as Singapore  the Republic of Korea  Thailand andother South-East Asian countries clearly shows that successcan be gained in the long run where there is sacrifice determination and hard work.This notwithstanding  Africa’s underdevelopmentremains unique  and unless the international communityapplies creative and effective comprehensive measures  suchas debt-for-development swaps and other debt reliefmeasures  the solution to Africa’s economic crisis particularly for countries in the least developed category will continue to be illusory. In a world where the gapbetween the rich and the poor countries is growing widerevery day  the need for economic and technical cooperationbetween developing countries cannot be overstated.With regard to the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development (UNCED)  we welcome theestablishment of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment as a functional Commission of the Economicand Social Council. What now remains to be put in place isthe practical implementation of the Commission’s mandateto ensure the effective follow-up of UNCED. Sierra Leonewelcomes the decision to convene a Global Conference onthe Sustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates in April 1994.At the recent United Nations Conference on StraddlingFish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks  the plight ofmany coastal States  including mine  was highlightedregarding the lack of an effective monitoring  control andsurveillance system that can be maintained on a sustainedbasis in the face of the continuing indiscriminate advance ofcertain distant-water fishing nations  some of which not onlyfish the straddling stocks outside the jurisdiction area  butenter and violate the territorial rights of our countries. Eventhe fleets of those nations which obtain relevant licenses tofish do not declare the correct catches for reliable datarecords. Consequently  the true state of exploitation of thestocks within the national jurisdiction of most of ourcountries is not accurately known  and so Sierra Leone despite its location in one of the most fertile areas in termsof marine living resources  realizes only a miniscule amountfrom these resources as a result of the activities of thedistant-water fleets.This present state of affairs is certainly untenable andshould not remain unchecked. The exploitation of ourmeagre resources by larger nations and bodies takingadvantage of our technological weaknesses can only worsenour economic situation. These wanton fishing practices alsothreaten to deplete the fishing grounds of our nations and tobecome great environmental hazards. I therefore wish toreiterate the support expressed by the Sierra Leonedelegation for the conclusions of that Conference  which wehope will bring about a radical change in the presentexploitation of our marine resources. I hope our experts willsoon be able to sit down with experts of the United Nationsto work out modalities that will ensure the equitable andjudicious exploitation of our marine resources.Looking back at the progress accomplished by mankindover the past few decades of its quest for peace  security andsocial progress  we have to admit that the results achievedhave been mixed.A few years ago  for example  the world watched withhope and expectation as nations and societies were infusedwith a new energy which held out the promise of a new dynamic era in which our societies would at last realize thepotential for peace and the global environment would betransformed for the better. Then  many of us wereconvinced that  if history had taught us anything  it hadimpressed on us that this journey’s success could not endureForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 45unless we divested ourselves of the old flawed anddiscredited formulae in which the age behind us had beenembedded. It was our hope that  phoenix-like  we wouldrise from the ashes of unfulfilled dreams and start on ajourney towards the fulfilment of our aspirations to a goldenage.Today  some way into that journey  we have begun towonder whether that dream was not a mirage  whether thenew reality on which so much depends will be shaped withthe good will and cooperation of all nations  big and smallalike.In the past  many of us called for the emerging order tobe nurtured and shaped by the joint will of the internationalcommunity as a whole  mindful as we were of the need toanchor this new direction on principles we all believed inand subscribed to. We are still of that view. Yet  thoughthe recent months have witnessed a process of revitalizationin the Organization’s responsibilities for crisis managementand its larger engagement with the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  we are increasinglyconcerned about emerging trends that may not augur well forthe global political and socio-economic transformation we allanticipate.The assurance of international security cannot succeedfor long unless we are able  as an Organization  to forgeinternational consensus among all Members on measures thatare of primary importance to us all. New energy shouldimpel us to find the source of today’s problems  so as tomitigate the disastrous conditions under which a largesegment of mankind continues to live. New impetus shouldbe given to breaking the constraints that for so long kept usfrom gaining access to those in need and finding solutionsto their problems.It is our fervent hope that all of us  with new vision andcommitment  will accomplish these goals so that we mayattain the new world order that was conceived within theparameters of the ideals of this Organization."
"147",6304,"SLV",48,1993,"It is a great pleasure for us to salute yourunanimous election  Sir  to preside over the GeneralAssembly’s work at its forty-eighth session  especially sinceyou are a worthy representative of a sister country of ourregion of Latin America and the Caribbean. Your openingaddress  in which you presented your vision of the world was rich in ideas and insights into international reality. Youurged that we commit ourselves to promoting the purposesand principles of the Charter in order to achieve a betterworld  and you encouraged us to reflect on ourresponsibilities as we strive to meet the global challengesfacing our peoples. Your address demonstrated yoursensitivity and wisdom  which  added to your political anddiplomatic experience in multilateralism  will help us moveforward to change as we endeavour to achieve the objectivesof our Organization.We should also like to express our appreciation to yourpredecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  the former Foreign Ministerof Bulgaria  for the successful manner in which he guidedthe work of the forty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly and in particular for his efforts to bring about therestructuring and revitalization of the United Nations system.We also wish to join in the expressions of appreciationto the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for hisdedication and hard work in leading our Organization. Weonce again express our support for and confidence in him inhis difficult task of seeking international peace and security.For the fifth year in a row we have come to this highestinternational forum  from which it has been our privilege togive annual testimony to the progress of a process that though it is unfolding in a small developing country represents one of the most complex and exemplary dynamicforces for peace in modern history.In 1989  when we first came to speak to the world’srepresentatives from this rostrum  the case of El Salvadorwas just one more knot in the tangled web of problems leftbehind by the sadly notorious cold war as it beganunexpectedly to wind down. A few months earlier  we hadjust taken the reins of government with a great purpose bornin the deepest part of our conscience: to do all that washumanly possible to find a political solution to theSalvadorean conflict. That is how we expressed ourselves with a solemn promise  to the Salvadorean people on thefirst day of our Government. We reaffirmed it before theUnited Nations in September of that crucial year of 1989 only a few weeks before the world witnessed the almostunbelievable dissolution of one of the greatest ideological-military Powers on Earth. This led to a new era - difficult but also hopeful and promising  for all.If we wish sincerely to interpret the history of ourcountry  we must say that the peace process in El Salvadorwas a search along various avenues that had been present inthe lives of the people of El Salvador ever since our nationwas born. Our peace process is not a mere expression of theneed to find a sensible and reasonable end to an unjust andpainful war. In El Salvador  as in so many other countrieswith a historical development similar to ours  peace is thegeneric name for age-old needs and aspirations  such asthose for democracy  democratic institutions  the rule of law political freedoms and rights - in a word  the victory ofcivilization over barbarism.This helped us to understand  as our work for peacebegan  that it must be solid and enduring. Otherwise  wewould be making just another effort - like so many in ourpast - that would not rise above superficial means or lay thetrue foundations of the country’s political  social andeconomic modernization. For us - and this is the aspect thathas enabled our process to succeed - peace is synonymouswith democracy.We in El Salvador have been delighted to learn that from varying perspectives of ideological and politicalthought  our peace process is considered exemplary. In thisforum of nations  we should like to point to some of thefactors that  in our opinion  have allowed us to set thatexample.First of all  we believe that the solution achieved isstrictly in keeping with the nature of the conflict. Given thatit was a conflict with historical and social roots  its eruptionwas eminently political  linked to the inadequacy anddysfunctioning of the traditional Salvadorean political systemand the political-ideological confrontation of the super-Powers. The solution had to be political  without winners orlosers  and to aim at the creation of a new scenario involvinga system of pluralistic participation. The peace agreementis a plan of commitments to expanding  developing andguaranteeing democracy in El Salvador. That was what weneeded. That is why it was implemented in an irreversiblemanner  despite momentary problems that were merelymishaps along the way.Secondly  the conflict led to violent confrontation in thecountry. The exhaustion from the war and the impetustowards a process of democratization created the conditionsfor the emergence in El Salvador of a culture of tolerance understanding and reconciliation - in a word  a culture ofpeace. This concept has not emerged in El Salvador alone;it is a growing concern throughout the world. With thesupport of the United Nations Educational  Scientific andCultural Organization  we are striving to promote a cultureof peace  for which we appeal for the firm support of theinternational community. Without a culture of peace  whichwill help to remove the ever-active remnants of the cultureof violence  it will be impossible to establish the new worldorder demanded by our times  a new moral order betweenmen and nations as the foundation for this new world orderof competitive but respectful and harmonious coexistence which we can glimpse as an achievable reality as we passinto the new millennium.Thirdly  we must recognize that the peace process in ElSalvador was continually and effectively followed by theinternational community  represented by the Security Counciland the Secretary-General of this great world Organization by a group of countries that had close ties to the situation inEl Salvador in a variety of ways  and by a widespreadgeneral interest in observing the ways and means used toresolve a conflict such as the one that afflicted El Salvadorfor such a long time. We have no doubt that without thisinternational attention a solution to the problem in ElForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 3Salvador would have been much more difficult andcomplicated.El Salvador is a living example of how the transitionfrom a world dominated by a confrontational bipolarity toone determined by the logic of specific situations is takingplace. We do not doubt for one instant that the engine ofthe world process is changing: from abusive and heartlessideology to pragmatic and ordered rationality. There havealways been many problems and conflicts in the world  butfor a long time the international drama seemed to be anincreasingly absorbing confrontation of ideologies. Thisdistortion  aggravated by the real problems that existed impeded their solution. It is true that since the cold warpainful and cruel situations have erupted  such as the onenow experienced in the former Yugoslavia. But ideological strategic and geopolitical bipolarity artificially created someconflicts and stifled others  also artificially. Reality is  ofcourse  a better guide than all the fantasies of the ideologies.We in El Salvador do not speak of these matters withthe tranquillity of analysts or the scientific patience ofacademicians. We speak of war because we have physicallyendured it. We speak of the worldwide ideologicalconfrontation because  during what we now know was itslast phase  El Salvador was one of its most intensebattlegrounds. And we also speak of peace because we arebuilding peace on the basis of an agreement of greatinstitutional significance  conceived and structured tostrengthen democracy in El Salvador and throughout CentralAmerica.We have already expressed what this peace means tous. And now we would like to emphasize that we are wellaware that peace is a process. Being a process  it cannot bestatic  but must evolve. In this as well  El Salvador sets anexample. Countries such as ours were for long caught up inthe struggle between authoritarian stagnation andrevolutionary radicalism. This is a pivotal moment inhistory  because it is giving us all a lesson in thepre-eminence of an ancient but under-valued concept:evolution. ""Everything changes "" said the pre-Socraticphilosopher. But the natural rhythm of that change hasalways been a kind of historical riddle. With manycertainties remaining  and in the healthy absence of themagical formulas that have so tormented the world duringour century  we are perhaps on the way to understanding thatthe natural rhythm of change can also be summed in anotherclassic phrase: ""Without hurrying  but without pausing.""With evolution as our guide once again  we have noreason to hurry. The rhythm of transformation occurs in away that cannot be resisted. We see this in the changinginternational  political and economic relations of our time.An almost spontaneous restructuring has followed theremoval of so many straitjackets. And this restructuring hasbrought to light what has always been most important: thereal problems. As the East-West conflict has disappeared almost no one speaks about the North-South conflict oralternative alignments  but the serious problems ofinequality  critical poverty and dependence have not beenresolved. They are still with us. And they are a challengefor this new order which we are trying to create on a morerational and reasonable foundation.In this new scenario  the United Nations has a centralrole which was until recently unimaginable. The greatdynamic of universal peace cannot be led by a singlecountry  nor even by a privileged group of countries. Thecooperation  understanding and support of all countries isneeded  as is an instrument which will make peace processesviable and monitor and support them. That instrument isthis Organization  and this special dimension of its work hasexpanded and been emphasized in recent years. El Salvadorhas the honour to have been one of the first countries tobenefit from the new United Nations system of peace-keeping efforts. All the work of active mediation and thenactive monitoring - unprecedented in international law -which the United Nations has been putting into practice inEl Salvador  is not some theoretical artifice  but an exercisederived from the necessities of a real situation. The dynamicof the Salvadorian process has shaped the role of the UnitedNations in our country. We Salvadorians have learned muchfrom our close relation with the world Organization  and weare sure that it too has learned very important lessons fromits continuing participation in the achievement  maintenanceand development of peace in El Salvador.Our view of the United Nations has been enriched aswe have shared with the world Organization theresponsibility of carrying out the peace plan in El Salvador.Thus we understand more clearly that the United Nations isalso evolving. Its original form was a product of the end ofthe Second World War; it must now open itself up to newrealities. Organs  such as the Security Council  and even theSecretary-General now have roles and responsibilities whichdemand changes. The composition of the Council and theveto mechanism within it  which were a result of the deepmutual distrust of the post-war period  must befundamentally revised to adopt them to times of cooperationand exchange. The Secretary-General’s field of activityshould also be reconsidered  because there is far moreexecutive work to be done today than in the past. All theseare unavoidable challenges that now face the Organization to which we owe so much and which we wish to see everstronger and more efficient.The United Nations has room for the whole world. Insuccessive addresses here  we have emphasized theimportance of the principle of universality. We understandthat this principle cannot in any way provide a means ofinterfering in the internal affairs of States; at the same timewe believe that there are realities of today’s world thatcannot be disregarded. We have therefore supportedconsideration of exceptional situations  in keeping with theexperience with parallel representation of divided countriesat the United Nations. It should be possible to resolve thismatter within the framework of understanding and opennessthat now characterizes international relations.El Salvador  for the first time in its history  is in thevigorous mainstream of modernization  a dynamic thatconcerns all countries during these times of change. Ourcontribution cannot be material  because we lack resourcesand wealth  but we have earned the capacity to speak withthe moral force of a people raising itself up from its ownrubble with the unexpected serenity that results fromprolonged suffering. If we in El Salvador can testify toanything  we can testify that it is possible to move fromirrationality to the deliberate construction of historicalrationality. In proceeding along this long path we need theinternational community’s political  moral and financialsupport  in keeping with the resolution that the GeneralAssembly adopted last year for the reconstruction anddevelopment of El Salvador.We must reincorporate ex-combatants in institutionaland productive life through programmes such as the transferof land for farming. Also  there are many new institutionsemerging in our country  such as the civilian national police which is one of the most ambitious experiments in publicsecurity in the world. We need timely technical andeconomic support to build the structures of peace moreswiftly. We would like to be able to wipe from our mindsthe discouraging evidence that it is easier to find the moneyfor war than for peace. The culture of peace - which is aworld-wide challenge - must also become evident in thisfundamental change in priorities.We are here for the last time because our presidentialmandate comes to an end on 1 June 1994. It has been animmense honour for us to come here every year to report onthe progress in a process that is of such great concern to thepeople of El Salvador  and yet is also of such concern toCentral America and the international community because ofits positive effects on regional stability.The country that we are talking about today is verydifferent from the one that we were discussing in 1989  andthe important thing is that what is surprising in thedifference is how positive and how full of hope it is. Thecredit is not ours. We did our work and exercised our will.The credit goes to a people that  from being a footnote tohistory  has won  by dint of sacrifice  a place of honour inthis changing scene that we are seeing emerge at this closeof the century.All the political and social forces in El Salvador haveworked together to bring about the emergence of the newcountry. The friendly countries that are closest to us byreason of history and geography can testify to this. We havemade a successful effort to bring order to our economy  andwe are laying the foundations for the continued constructiveadvance of full democracy - political  economic  social andcultural.El Salvador expresses its concern over the continuedexistence of conflicts that are devastating some parts of theworld. The tragic cases of Bosnia and Herzegovina and ofSomalia cause us great distress. However  we haveconfidence in the force of reason  which always finds a wayto achieve even the most difficult goals.And there is good news too  such as the extraordinarilyimportant agreement on mutual recognition between Israeland the Palestine Liberation Organization  which has thrilledthe world. We have also seen an opening up in SouthAfrica for reason to prevail  and the situation in Haitibecoming clear  albeit with difficulty. All that gives uscomfort  and reminds us that we are in a period of enormoussurprises. The world is ridding itself of many oppressivespectres  and this gives us the strength to believe in the greatpotential of the international system.If we had to prepare a list of all those to whom wewould give thanks for their contribution to peace in ElSalvador  we would always leave out a few  but we cannotfail to mention the extraordinary work carried out both bythe previous Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar and the present Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  and also their body of collaborators andadvisers  without whose participation and support it isunlikely that we would have achieved the goal of puttingEl Salvador on the road towards genuine peace. TheSecurity Council has always been very mindful of the peaceprocess in our country  and the Council’s active even-handedness also deserves our highest praise.Forty-eighth session - 27 September l993 5On behalf of El Salvador  I give thanks to everyone.El Salvador is a living example. We hope that we willcontinue to be an example of stability  respect for humanrights  national concord and progress. We therefore call onthe world to give us its attention and support  and  most ofall  we ask God to shed his light on El Salvador  on theUnited Nations and on all men and women of good faith onthis Earth of ours  which is a common inheritance that mustbe shared by all mankind."
"148",6329,"SMR",48,1993," More than 12 months ago addressing the Assembly  which since then has seen a steadyincrease in its membership  with the admission of newMembers that I welcome today with great pleasure  Iexpressed my personal satisfaction and that of the people ofthe Republic of San Marino over the momentous changesthat have marked these past hectic years.Today  however  we face the pressing and seriousproblem of managing those changes. It is of fundamentalimportance to those peoples who have seen the laying of thefoundations of the edifice called ""Democracy"" that thisprocess continue and be shored up by solid institutions. Thestrengthening of those institutions must be accomplished toguarantee the solidity of that essential edifice  which may bealtered or changed in some of its parts  but which cannot bedeprived of its foundations.Today more than ever  the importance of democraticinstitutions must be acknowledged  upheld and stressed.Now more than ever  peoples need to be assured thatstruggles for power  those between factions and those causedby ethnic  economic and political interests  will be avertedfor ever so that real peace may be made  restored andmaintained.My country is convinced that a renewed commitmentof the United Nations is necessary for the attainment of thisaim  in virtue of the role it plays as a universal factor thathas become a real point of reference for the entire world.Not even the most advanced democratic society canfully meet the needs arising out of the exercise of freedom.In my opinion  however  any form of political regime otherthan democracy would deprive man of his freedom to aneven greater degree. Democracy  even in its initial and mostincomplete forms  is organized in such a way thatindividuals may take part  directly or indirectly  in theexercise of power.Further development of the existing democratic régimeis a precise commitment that my country has undertaken inan attempt to find a solution to one of the consequences ofthe past emigration of its citizens. I am referring to theefforts we are making to facilitate the exercise of their rightand duty to participate in political life through their votes.In our attempts to solve this problem the relevantinternational instruments of the United Nations will be aprecise point of reference and an irreplaceable guide.I am following with particular interest the discussionunder way on the possibility of reforming the institutionalmechanisms of the Organization. It is undoubtedly wise toadapt institutions to present circumstances  so that they willrespond effectively to the new challenges. San Marinosupports those reforms  prompted by the conviction thatwider participation leads to more effective and sharedinterventions. That is why with my country is followingwith special attention the application submitted by Sweden in its capacity as Chairman-in-Office of the Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  for the CSCE’sadmission to the United Nations with Observer States. Thatapplication enjoys the full support of all participating States and I wish to express here the desire of my country to seeit accepted.14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe CSCE continues to play a leading role in Europein favour of peace and the safeguarding of human rights.Closer cooperation with the United Nations has now becomeindispensable  and it will surely produce positive results.The initial task of the United Nations was to lay downthe fundamental principles for the protection of humandignity and for a peaceful  democratic and civil coexistence.It then undertook a wider-ranging task  in light of theevolution of rights and of those systems established for theirsafeguard. Now the Organization must intensify itsintervention straightforwardly and incisively in order toresolve critical situations.The policy of pursuing the peaceful solution  resortingto negotiations  mediation and political diplomatic initiatives is unquestionably the right course. That is the path to followin our times; it is policy of a democratic society in whichreason must always prevail.Recourse to force  even when it seems indispensable tomaintain or restore democracy  is always an unfair anddangerous option  since it takes a heavy toll of lives andcreates grounds for revenge that are risky and difficult todispel and may always trigger civil wars.I truly hope we will not have to say one day that themagic moment when our dreams seemed to have becomereality has passed us by. We must persist in averting thedangerous strategy of nuclear deterrence.If we manage to create a world with collective securityas its prevailing feature  there will no longer be grounds forconflicts. Peace  however  does not depend exclusively onthe possession of weapons and on the thirst for supremacy.Today  more than ever  peace depends on solidarity  onrespect for rights and on our efforts in favour of tolerance.Europe is plagued by conflicts that offend peoples minorities  women  children and the poor. Every continentis afflicted by wars and deep crises  which have become soendemic as to arouse the suspicion that they have beenaccepted as the norm. Some of the conflicts have becomeso acute that even humane acts  solidarity and the mostindispensable interventions against hunger and cold seemnow to have faded into the background.Exhausting and sincere mediation initiatives fail; crisis-management becomes impossible; the solution of conflictsseems unattainable  despite the growing number of political diplomatic and military missions  and even relief missionsare hindered in the performance of their work.San Marino believes that the United Nations has theability  the authority and the structures to formulate adynamic and effective plan able to prevent and solveconflicts  manage crises and maintain peace.The authority and the means of the Organization maysometimes not involve military choices. In any case  suchinterventions can be justified only when all possibilities ofa peaceful solution have been considered and it is borne inmind that resort to this option must not cause victims.Crises and conflicts may be averted by eliminating theirroot causes. When riches are not fairly distributed; when allcitizens do not enjoy the same rights and duties; when rightsand freedoms are not respected; when it is forgotten thatminorities are composed of individuals; when a distinctionis made between the dignity of man and that of woman;when injustice exists; when man and his rights do not prevailover the organization of the State and its military apparatus;then conflicts inevitably arise.The key principle of the United Nations  which hasalways fascinated the people of the Republic of San Marinoand has now become our trusted point of reference  is thatof the indissoluble bond between personal freedom and theliberty of all peoples. That freedom must be based on acomplex system of limits so that no man  in the exercise ofhis rights  can ride roughshod over the rights of another.In that spirit the Republic of San Marino recentlywelcomed with sincere satisfaction the agreement of mutualrecognition signed by the State of Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO). That agreement  concerningan area that has been theatre of war for a very long time was reached through peaceful negotiations and politicalmediation in which both sides gave up something tofacilitate the peace process.This major event is an important point of reference  aproof of the existing good will and wish for certainty confirming that this is the only possible way to resolveconflicts.My country is convinced that many challenges have yetto be met and still await effective solutions. We have toexert our best endeavours to defend the poor fromunderdevelopment  to sustain and contribute to their progressby restoring to them  when the situation so requires  theenvironment of which they have been deprived as aconsequence of ecological degradation. Every man is aguardian of the world and is entitled to ask that it be usedcorrectly.Forty-eighth session - 12 October l993 15We must express solidarity in the forms that such ahumanitarian and understanding attitude requires  respectingthe dignity of peoples and their freedom to make their ownchoices and determine their own destinies.We must play a fundamental role in educating futuregenerations on mutual understanding  respect and tolerance.This is the challenge facing the entire world and Europe inparticular. Together we will have to overcome theconsequences of intolerance to which we have given thenames of racism  ""ethnic cleansing""  mass migrations  refugeand asylum.The people of San Marino are following with particularconcern all issues related to minorities  their inalienable rightto free existence and well-balanced development  respect fortheir cultures and religions  and the real exercise of theserights under the same conditions enjoyed by the majorities.The reason for this special interest is probably to be foundin the numerically small population of my country  whichhistory has always taught to offer hospitality and expresssolidarity with the weak  the oppressed and the victims ofpersecution.Today this problem has reached proportions that mightbecome alarming. Nobody knows how many people maybe forced in the future to leave their native countries inorder to survive  whether in flight from underdevelopmentand hunger or prompted by the desire for freedom. Thus the problem has two faces. The first is the fact that no oneshould be forced to leave his home and country; the secondis the fact that all people  to the extent their circumstancespermit  must be willing to offer hospitality in a spirit ofsolidarity and brotherhood.Having referred to this problem  I cannot fail tomention the situation affecting the former Yugoslavia  thecoast of which can be seen  when the air is clear  from themountain on which the Republic of San Marino is situated.Who knows the destiny of that poor people or when thisunacceptable war will finally end? I appeal to the GeneralAssembly  to all States of the world and to the UnitedNations that we put a halt to the catastrophe. Let usreiterate and strengthen within our own nations a sense oftolerance undertaken as a duty and not as a right."
"149",6445,"SUR",48,1993,"On behalf of theGovernment and people of the Republic of Suriname  I takegreat pleasure in welcoming you  Sir  to the presidency ofthe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly. You bringto your high office great experience as a skilled diplomat experience which will be useful in this epoch-making periodfor the Organization. Indeed  your election is a fittingtribute to you personally and an honour to your country. Weare therefore most gratified to see a skilled and adistinguished son of our good neighbour  Guyana  presidingover our deliberations.We thank your predecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev ofBulgaria  for the excellent manner in which he conducted theaffairs of the last session of the General Assembly.We also take this opportunity to pay tribute to theSecretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for his tireless efforts in consolidatinginternational peace and security.Before proceeding  I should like to express the feelingsof sincere sympathy of the Government and people of theRepublic of Suriname to the Government and people of theRepublic of India on the sad occasion of the tragicearthquake disaster in which so many lives were lost. Iappeal to the international community to render thenecessary effective support to India to alleviate the sorrowand suffering of the people involved.I should like to take this opportunity to add to whatnumerous previous speakers have already said on behalf ofthe many people living in areas whose developmentdifficulties  and their consequences  do not receive enoughattention  because of the high priority given to issues ofinternational peace and security. I am referring todeveloping areas that risk being forgotten  though they areinhabited by people who truly pursue welfare  well-beingand prosperity  and seek true participation in the worldcommunity  where the principle of power will ultimatelymake way for the principle of interdependence within theinternational system.Countries in the developed North usually succeed instrengthening their mutual relations in political and economicareas  and they are becoming increasingly interdependent.Thanks to a greater environmental awareness  we arebecoming increasingly conscious that North and Southdepend strongly on one another. This interdependence unfortunately  has not yet evolved sufficiently with regard topolitical and economic questions  and the views held by theNorth and the South on many essential issues  such as thealleviation of poverty and economic development  are stillstrongly divergent. Moreover  the interests of the North inmany ways still prevail over those of the South.In particular  the financial and technological dependenceof the South on the North causes serious divergences. Thediscriminatory regulations that make it difficult for the Southto gain access to international markets and the ever-changingconditions that make the flow of funds to the South almostimpossible are  inter alia  factors that make the gap with theNorth almost unbridgeable.In the past  agreements on multilateral and internationalcooperation  such as the International Development Strategyfor the Fourth United Nations Development Decade  theCartagena Commitment  Agenda 21 and the United NationsNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s have been approved by the international community. Thosecommitments constitute a solid basis for strengthening globalpartnership for development. However  various programmescould not be implemented  and much still remains to be doneto enhance multilateral cooperation.Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 19Like many developing countries  Suriname has a seriousshortage of external funds for its development process despite its relative wealth of mineralogical and biologicalresources.Certainly  we have succeeded  through maximummobilization of our national forces  in coping with thepolitical crisis that dominated the country in the 1980s  andSuriname has been able to join the countries of LatinAmerica and the Caribbean that have managed to givemeaning to the process of democratization. It is our jointresponsibility to see that this momentum is preserved andthat the euphoria of the victory of democracy overdictatorship  particularly in our region  does not have adverseeffects.Without broad-based development in our countries weshall not be able to provide democracy with a sound basis.For the democratic ideal is not an isolated politicalphenomenon  but one that is closely interwoven with thewhole of the social and economic reality in our part of theworld.Without alleviation of the pressing debt burden  withoutan appropriate recompense for our most important exportproducts  without credit facilities for the necessaryproduction inputs  without an expansion of exportpossibilities and without the financial support of the richercountries  endeavours to realize a stable democraticconstitutional State will prove to be in vain. We havenoticed - not without concern - that in their attitudes towardsdeveloping countries some developed countries ignore thespecific circumstances of those countries  which have fallenseriously behind in their development.The political crisis which Suriname went through in the1980s  and Suriname’s related isolation from the importantdonors  caused a serious decline in the economicdevelopment of the country  which was further aggravatedby the drastic reduction of the country’s income from itsmain export products - more specifically  alumina andaluminium.In order to meet the resulting financial  economic andmonetary crisis  we drafted a structural adjustmentprogramme  which is now being implemented. We areaware that  despite the many theories and analyses in thisfield  there exists no blueprint for the resolution of economiccrises that can be applied smoothly inasmuch as the objectof adjustment is a very complex reality.My Government is also aware that achieving economicrecovery and furthering development while at the same timesafeguarding political stability is no easy task and must beapproached quite prudently. It is a process which will entailincreased poverty  and can lead to a serious disruption ofsocial life in the short term. Unfortunately  the divergentviews held by Suriname’s authorities and by the donors onthe proper way to implement the adjustment programme putsgreat pressure on the space necessary for a policy whichfocuses primarily on the well-being of the nation as a whole.The failure  in many countries  of stringent adjustmentprogrammes undoubtedly relates to a perspective which failsto recognize sufficiently the reality of developing countriesat the present time and ignores the real aspirations ofhumankind. In such a state of affairs  dialogue betweenNorth and South is difficult and strained. The North itselfhas succeeded in developing a number of mechanisms tosolve differences  in which the consistent application of theprinciples of equality and mutual respect commands ourattention. Such consistent use of these principles could also perhaps  open the way to fruitful dialogue with the South.In 1992 Suriname and the Kingdom of the Netherlandssigned a Framework Treaty. This Treaty  together with the1975 Treaty  provides a basic framework for substantialsupport from the Kingdom of the Netherlands to thedevelopmental aspirations of the Republic of Suriname. Itis with pleasure that we can announce here that  within theframework of these treaties  positive cooperation wasrealized last year  which contributed substantially to thesuccesses in consolidating the restored democracy inSuriname  strengthening the constitutional State andprotecting human rights  as well as in establishing andmaintaining peace after the end of the armed struggle in theinterior of the country.However  some questions have been raised as to themotives for this cooperation in the light of the recent attitudeof the Treaty partner regarding support for the recovery ofour country’s economy.Despite many efforts on the part of the internationalcommunity  the Uruguay Round negotiations of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  which couldprovide the framework for a comprehensive and sound basisfor future trade relations  are still ongoing. The Governmentof Suriname looks forward to an early and balancedconclusion of the Uruguay Round with a view to promotingthe establishment of a just and equitable multilateral tradingsystem.20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionRecession in the world economy  stringent budgetarypolicies in donor countries  trade problems and domesticfactors in a number of countries have dampened the hope inmany developing countries for a steady flow of developmentaid. Concurrently  new claims on external financialresources are being made  so that allocations for future aidcan further cloud the outlook for multilateral aid. Thegeneral trend at present is a marked increase in contributionsto peace-keeping operations and a clear decline in funds foroperational activities.The annual peace-keeping budget has increasedfivefold  and is expected to be $3 673 000 000 for 1993 while voluntary contributions to the United NationsDevelopment Programme  the United Nations Fund forPopulation Activities and the United Nations Children’sFund have declined by about 10 per cent. In one of hisreports  the Secretary-General noted that very seriousproblems caused by civil unrest and other sources of strifeaffect an increasing number of people who are often amongthe most vulnerable groups of the population  placingparticularly difficult demands on United Nations operationalactivities.Failure to address issues such as the alleviation ofpoverty  underdevelopment  unemployment  illiteracy and thethreat to the environment because of a lack of financialresources can cause social tensions. This  in turn  cangenerate social disintegration and  eventually  thedestabilization of the political system. Hence  an agenda thattends to reflect mainly international peace and securityproblems is not constructive. More and more it isrecognized that favourable economic and social conditionscan help strengthen peace and security. Therefore  wefavour a programme based on a combination of political economic and social factors together with global security.The social crisis of the 1990s may be considered aresult of  inter alia  world-wide growing poverty  particularlyin the developing countries  unemployment and socialupheavals. It is therefore gratifying to note that preparationsare being made for a World Summit for Social Developmentin 1995. It is our hope that the core issues of the Summitdirected towards the strengthening of the process of overallsocial development will be addressed during the preparatoryprocess and that agreement can be reached  in a spirit ofconsensus  on matters of such vital human importance.Agenda 21  adopted during the United NationsConference on Environment and Development in Rio deJaneiro  and the subsequent establishment of the Commissionon Sustainable Development  are important guides for theinternational community in achieving sustainabledevelopment. UNCED also underscored the need to providedeveloping countries with adequate resources and toacknowledge the urgency of making technology  especiallyenvironmentally sound technology  available to that end.However  the progress achieved to date in obtaining new andadditional financial resources is disappointing. Hence  wewelcome the Commission’s decision to establish twoworking groups to tackle the two issues.My Government supports a timely and strictimplementation of the Agreement signed by PresidentAristide and General Raoul Cedras  containing arrangementsmade with a view to reaching a political solution to theHaitian crisis. The United Nations and the Organization ofAmerican States are playing a major role in implementingthe Agreement reached at Governors Island in New York.We are deeply distressed by the recent developments inHaiti  which could jeopardize the return of PresidentAristide. We strongly appeal to the military leaders in Haitito uphold their promises and to create the atmosphere ofcalm required for the full application of the Agreement.My delegation has always stated that the principles ofthe United Nations Charter and the relevant United Nationsresolutions  particularly those of the Security Council provide the best concrete basis for the achievement of acomprehensive  just and durable peace in the Middle East.We are therefore moved that the State of Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) have finally starteda negotiating process which could create the conditions forpeace. The Agreement that was mutually recognized andsigned is a courageous step in that direction. Wecongratulate both Israel and the PLO on this historic deedand we appeal to the international community to use thismomentum to bring peace and prosperity to the wholeregion.My delegation welcomes the progress made so far bythe multilateral party negotiating process to a negotiatedsettlement and national elections in South Africa. A politicalsettlement will lead to the end of apartheid and establish anew  united  non-racial and democratic South Africa. Thedestructive character of apartheid has caused so much harmto the people that it is only fair that in this new era  everyeffort must be made to overcome social and economicdisparities so that peace and stability can be established. Wetherefore expect the international community to fully andgenerously support the new South African Government withassistance for the reconstruction and development of thenation.Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 21Like many others in the world  my country is troubledby the continuing horrifying events taking place in Angolaand in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We cannot let the sufferingand degradation continue. The bloodshed  hatred andhostilities must end now  for the people concerned have theright to live in peace.World-wide drug abuse and trafficking remain a matterof deep concern  not only in our region but in the world asa whole. Despite measures and strategies geared towardsthe elimination of drugs  it is sad to note that drugs can beobtained for illicit purposes virtually everywhere in theworld. This is  indeed  an unfortunate development  since itwas expected that after the Global Programme of Action wasadopted  together with the Comprehensive MultidisciplinaryOutline of Future Activities in Drug Abuse Control  thesituation would improve substantially. We thus support theview that efforts against drug abuse and trafficking mustcontinue in a balanced and concerted manner.The end of the East-West confrontation has resulted ina slowdown of the arms race and reduced the threat ofarmed conflict. We regret to observe  however  that thespread of conventional arms continues to take on adangerous magnitude  while at the same time armedconflicts are increasing  causing the tragic loss of numerousinnocent human lives. Ongoing conflicts have alreadyresulted in more than 100 million refugees world wide  30million displaced persons and hundreds of millions ofunexploded mines. It is time to recognize that trade inconventional arms should be drastically curbed.In the context of global security  the question of thenon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction continuesto be an important one. My delegation is in favour of auniversally applicable and internationally verifiablecomprehensive test-ban treaty. Such a treaty wouldstrengthen international security and would represent afurther step towards nuclear disarmament.The set of principles contained in the report of theSecretary-General ""An Agenda for Peace"" provides acomprehensive framework for the maintenance of interna-tional peace and security. My delegation follows with keeninterest the activities of the United Nations in the fields ofpreventive diplomacy  peace-keeping and post-conflictpeace-building. We are aware that at present some 70 areasof conflict or potential conflict exist throughout the world.In this respect  we welcome the involvement of regionalorganizations that can render valuable assistance in themaintenance of international peace and security  includingthe peaceful settlement of disputes.According to the Charter of the United Nations Member States have entrusted to the Security Council theprimary responsibility for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. The balance of political and economicpower in today’s world has drastically changed.Consequently  the premise that brought about the structureof the Security Council is no longer valid. The generaldebate last year on the issue of equitable representation andan increase in membership of the Security Council  whichled to the adoption of resolution 47/62  can  it is hoped contribute to a more equitable geographical representationin the Council and to enhancing the democratization processof the work of the Council by making its deliberations moretransparent.The expectations in the developing world that thepost-cold-war era would create new developmentperspectives have not yet materialized. However  theincreasing pauperization of large parts of the world demandsthe taking of urgent and decisive action to offer those peopleprospects for change and improvement in their daily livingconditions. To this end  our Organization will have tostrengthen its prominent role as a factor for development andwill have to make the appropriate mechanisms effectivelyoperational.It is important for all Member States to provide theUnited Nations with legitimate room for that purpose.Suriname will  to the extent possible  make its contribution."
"150",6469,"SVK",48,1993,"I wish to convey mycongratulations to Ambassador Insanally on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.I wish him luck and success in his high office.Let me also thank the President of the previous GeneralAssembly session  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  for his effectiveguidance of its deliberations.I would also like to express my profound appreciationto His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of the United Nations  for all his dynamic work inleading this organization.A year has passed since I last had the honour to addressthe Assembly. As the last Minister of Foreign Affairs of thecommon State of Czechs and Slovaks  I askedrepresentatives at the forty-seventh session for theirunderstanding and support for the process of transformationtaking place at that time in the Czech and Slovak FederalRepublic  and I reiterated the desire of the new successorStates to be admitted to the international community ofsovereign States on an equal basis.In addition to its membership in the United Nations  theSlovak Republic today is a member of 53 internationalorganizations  including United Nations specialized agencies the Council of Europe and the Conference on Security and10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionCooperation in Europe (CSCE). We declared our interest inthe fastest possible integration  together with other countriesof the Visegrad Four  in such effective Euro-Atlanticpolitical  security and economic organizations as theEuropean Community  the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) and the Western European Union.Slovakia is building its statehood on civic principlesbased on respect for individual rights. The objective of theSlovak Republic as a multi-ethnic State is to create afunctioning system of ethnic coexistence and guarantees ofequal rights and opportunities for all.The President returned to the Chair.The tragedies of Bosnia and Herzegovina and ofGeorgia alert us to inconsiderate and irresponsible attemptsto gain political capital from nationalistic sentiments. Weare against steps  regardless of their motivation  that wouldultimately lead to the creation of ethnically pure territoriesand States and that would question or endanger the peacefulcoexistence of populations of different ethnic origins. Weapply the existing international norms regulating suchpeaceful coexistence and we favour their further elaboration.We support the idea of adopting a generally bindingdocument on the rights of persons belonging to national ethnic and other minorities in the United Nations  the CSCEand the Council of Europe. We are convinced that such adocument must equally respect the territorial integrity ofStates and the principle of inviolability of existing borders.Our economic policy aims to build a balanced andprosperous economy based on market principles. Thus farthe reform measures have not brought the expectedeconomic revival. The economic difficulties are aggravatedby various internal and external factors  among others theconversion of the armaments industry. The 1990 decision ona far-reaching conversion led to the reduction of Slovakia’smilitary production to an unprecedented 9 per cent of the1989 level. This political decision to close a whole majorbranch of Slovak industry without the necessary preparationfor a real conversion  though highly moral  did not take intoaccount its economic and social consequences.If we are to attain the necessary economic growth  weneed access to the markets of developed nations  somethingwhich is increasingly complicated - all the more so becauseof the economic recession. We are convinced thatprotectionism is not a solution. We hope that negotiationson the further liberalization of world trade will be successful in particular the negotiations of the current Uruguay Roundof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.We also feel encouraged by clear expressions of apolitical will to reform and remove export controls inheritedfrom the cold war period that now unfairly burden legitimatecommerce and unduly restrain growth and opportunities  asrecently stated by President Clinton before this body.Incidentally  on this very day  Slovak representativesare signing an association agreement between the SlovakRepublic and the European Community in Luxembourg.The association agreement  which we consider the first stepin our efforts to gain full membership in the Community also reflects the general direction of our foreign policy. Itencourages further positive development in our country  andwe believe that it will help us resolve some of theaforementioned economic problems.The international community is daily confronted withsuch tragedies as that in Bosnia and Herzegovina orTajikistan  with countries at the crossroads  such as Russiatoday  but happily also with encouraging developments  suchas those in the Middle East and in South Africa.It is only natural that the United Nations adapt itself tothe increased tasks in its mission as the guardian ofinternational peace and security. To manage the ever-increasing load of responsibilities more effectively  it isnecessary to pay attention to early warning and preventiveaction at an early stage. Equally demanding our attentiontoday is the phase of post-conflict peace-building andrestoration as a basis for preventing the renewal of conflicts.Regarding the peace-keeping operations of the UnitedNations  common experience urges us to requireimprovements in their planning and execution. Everyoperation should have clearly defined political objectives  anunambiguous mandate  and an understanding of its possibleand feasible scope and duration and of available means andsupport. When the Security Council sets up a newoperation  it should define and ensure security and safetyconditions and guarantees under which the operation is to bedeployed. We support the idea of a universally binding legalinstrument on the safety of peace-keeping operationspersonnel. Troop-contributing countries should also have thepossibility  through some regular mechanism  of beingconstantly informed and consulted prior to and during thewhole operation.Another means of enhancing the effectiveness ofpeace-keeping is increased cooperation between the UnitedNations and regional arrangements  such as the Conferenceon Security and Cooperation in Europe. In the Euro-Atlanticarea  we should also seek involvement in peace-keeping ofForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 11such organizations as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) or the Western European Union. All theseorganizations should be mandated in every specific case bythe Security Council.Slovakia is among the countries that have been mostseverely afflicted by the sanctions against the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia. We shall provide data on theselosses shortly. We believe that the effort to secure effectiveeconomic assistance should not be limited to moral appealsto States and institutions. The economic situation of thecountries depending on the Danube as their main waterwayhas been ever more aggravated by arbitrary acts of blockadeand other violations of the respective United Nationsresolutions and international conventions. We are convincedthat such acts require a clear and resolute response.The decision of the Geneva Conference onDisarmament on a mandate for a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is a major move in itself. It also sends a signalto the whole non-proliferation regime. We support theuniversal and indefinite extension of the non-proliferationTreaty. We also hope that the question of the nucleararsenal of the former Soviet Union will be satisfactorily andspeedily resolved in the spirit of non-proliferation.Slovakia welcomes the establishment of the UnitedNations Register of Conventional Arms  which we considerto be a first decisive step leading to increased globaltransparency and constraints in conventional weapons. Weare ready to support moves towards enhanced transparency as well as more detailed information on military holdingsand procurement through national production  made underthe banner of the United Nations  the Conference onDisarmament or the Conference on Security and Cooperationin Europe.Wishing to ensure full continuity with the activities ofCzechoslovakia - an original member of the Conference onDisarmament - and enjoying the support of the EasternEuropean regional group  the Slovak Republic applied formembership in the Conference on Disarmament. A windowof opportunity for Slovakia to become a member was openedby the proposal to gradually enlarge the membership of theConference. Those on the proposed list of 23 new membersshould in our opinion be admitted as soon as possible.The World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed theuniversality of and respect for human rights and the need fortheir universal application. It also  appropriately  drew ourattention to the vital interdependency of human rights andsustainable development  and their bearing on internationalpeace and stability. We are prepared to support stepstowards implementation of its recommendations. Slovakiatherefore encourages the establishment of a post of UnitedNations high commissioner for human rights.Recent developments in many areas of the world wherecivilian populations are increasingly the targets inpredominantly non-international conflicts impel us to demandthat States and parties to conflicts strictly observe andenforce the rules and principles of international humanitarianlaw. We support efforts to bring those who are alleged tohave committed war crimes to justice  inter alia through theestablishment of an international criminal court.International humanitarian agencies and organizations whose activities we highly esteem and support  can attest toanother deplorable feature of today’s world: the misuse andeven the rejection of humanitarian assistance for politicalreasons. Those conducting humanitarian operations areworking under increasingly unsafe conditions. Theinternational community should demand respect for humanrights and humanitarian norms by the States and parties toconflicts. Neither should we completely ignore the fact thatsanctions which are rightfully applied against those whohave breached international peace and security have a directbearing on the fate and even the lives of innocent civilians.In a true humanitarian spirit  we should at least try toaddress this aspect of sanctions as well.Furthermore  questions related to large-scale migration refugees and displaced persons require our urgent attention.The international community should set forth appropriaterules and standards regulating large-scale populationmovements and seeking solutions for their root causes andconsequences.We also feel responsible for the most vulnerablesegments of the world population - the women  the children the disabled and the aged. We are ready to take part in theinternational community’s efforts to seek means foraddressing their needs and concerns.The Slovak Republic is greatly interested in reinforcingthe role of the United Nations and enhancing itseffectiveness and capacity for action. We wish to join theranks of those States that support the implementation of thereform process of the United Nations in order to transformit into a more effective and economical organization. Itsorganizational structure should respond more adequately tocurrent global realities.12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionSlovakia is prepared to deliberate on proposals made byother members of the world community  including theproposal to restructure the Security Council  which shouldmaintain its representativity and at the same time itstransparent character. We are of the opinion that countriessuch as Germany and Japan should be invited to assume theresponsibilities of permanent members of the SecurityCouncil. At the same time  the Slovak Republic observesthat the number of States able to contribute - owing to theirgrowing economic influence and role in world affairs - tothe objectives of the United Nations is increasing. Anydecision on the composition of the Security Council shouldbe the result of a democratic discussion. An expansion ofthe Security Council must not jeopardize its effectivenessand operational capability.The General Assembly itself  in our opinion  shouldalso play a more important role within the United Nationssystem. The reform of the Economic and Social Councilshould continue  with a view to avoiding duplication betweenthe Council and General Assembly agendas. Cost reductionscan also be made in the activities of the United NationsSecretariat. When this issue is considered  it should beborne in mind that the Secretariat executes its tasks inresponse to the requirements of the Member States.The reform of the United Nations should be carried outin the context of the financial situation of the Organization.We consider the change in the financing principlesunderlying the United Nations regular budget and the budgetof peace-keeping operations to be one of the most significantaspects of this restructuring. The Member States shouldmeet their financial obligations to the United Nations fullyand in due time. We believe  however  that the rules fordetermining the contributions of Member States to theUnited Nations budget should be made more flexible inorder to accommodate changes in the economies ofindividual Member States. The present economic reality rather than history  should become the main and decisivecriterion.Let me conclude by wishing the General Assemblyevery success in the demanding work that is ahead of it atthis session."
"151",6494,"SVN",48,1993,"Allow me  Sir  to offeryou  and the Republic of Guyana  sincere congratulations onyour election as President of the General Assembly at itsforty-eighth session. This session is taking place at amoment of world history which everyone agrees to beexceptional  so it is particularly important that it be assuccessful as possible. The fact that you are guiding itswork encourages me to hope that it will be so.Let me also take this opportunity to express mygratitude for the contribution of the former Foreign Ministerof the Republic of Bulgaria  His Excellency Mr. StoyanGanev  as President of the Assembly at its forty-seventhsession.The very presence of Slovenia as an independent Stateand a Member of the United Nations is adequate testimonyto the fact that the world has fundamentally changed.Together with a series of other countries that are eithernewly founded or have disengaged themselves from theshackles of limited sovereignty - or both simultaneously -Slovenia was not  of course  only an object of those changes but a protagonist in them. The motive force for thesechanges was the democratic aspirations of nations  theirdemocratic movements and prominent individuals from allspheres of social life. Many of the basic principles of theUnited Nations Charter  especially the principle of respectfor human rights  motivated the democratic movements intheir struggle for political and economic change.We should not forget that fact today as we watch theprocesses under way in the part of the world formerlyknown as the East. The tragic events which we perceive ashaving resulted from those very changes should not blur thememories of the movement for the freedom and dignity ofmen and women as individuals and as members ofhistorically  culturally and linguistically defined entities. Thedifficulties faced by the new democracies were expected.Yet they are strengthening democratic institutions and theeffectiveness of democratic mechanisms. On the other hand in another - the smaller -part of the East  there is an orgy ofdestructive violence caused by inconceivable hatred.The old terminology  transferred to the notion of""countries of the former East""  obstructs a real understandingof current events in the part of the world to which it refers.Ideological notions should be replaced by terminology thatrespects the cultural and historical characteristics ofindividual regions  which in recent history all known politicsand ideologies have tried to obliterate.The former socialist countries that earlier on haddeveloped democracy movements are now experiencingsecure democratic development. On the other hand  in thosecountries with totalitarian regimes that were suddenlyconfronted with the end of the bipolar world and wheredemocratic movements were barely incipient  the ensuingideological vacuum led to nationalism accompanied byexpansionism and grave violations of human rights and ofthe rights of minorities. Former Yugoslavia  a typical multi-ethnic State  a federation composed of six differentterritorially defined members  experienced the consequencesof these distinctions within its former borders  and for thatreason could not survive.Every region has its own particular characteristics.Respecting them would to a great extent facilitatestabilization and the prospects of peaceful development onthe basis of multilateral cooperation. It is not just forEurope in the wider sense that this is valid  although it istrue that the processes of change are most pronounced in thisregion  for better or for worse. The changes I am referringto put seriously to the test most of the principles ofinternational cooperation and most of the mechanismscreated to enhance it. The right to self-determination is acase in point. This right  on the one hand  was denied tosome nations while on the other hand the misuse of the sameForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 11principle for carrying out aggressive expansionism andland-grabs has been tolerated.The role of the United Nations has greatly increasedsince the end of the cold war  and the Organization isconfronted with a number of issues that have to be tackledin a new way commensurate to the new atmosphere. Nowit is more or less clear to everybody that we cannot dowithout new concepts and new mechanisms within thisOrganization to enable it to react in accordance with therequirements of the time. It is of crucial importance tostrengthen human rights and democracy within countries andto reflect this equally in their interrelations.There are great expectations that the United Nationswill face these issues and will be able to adapt itselfefficiently. In order to do this the General Assembly shouldmake proposals in this regard. Let me mention some of thefields that these proposals could embrace.International law needs a further evolution ofsubstantive provisions and consensual mechanisms for theirimplementation. The principle of non-interference in theinternal affairs of States should be reaffirmed  though itshould be sensibly qualified by adequate internationallydefined standards. International cooperation and theinterdependence of all States are continuously diminishingthe scope of matters which are essentially within thedomestic jurisdiction of States  while the scope of legitimateinternational action is being expanded. In this context thereappears to be an opportunity for further protection of humanrights  the rights of ethnic minorities and the environment.The Conference on Human Rights which took place inVienna last June confirmed global standards of respect forand protection of human rights and recommended theestablishment of a high commissioner for human rights.Slovenia intends to submit during this session proposals forenhancing the activities of the United Nations in the field ofhuman rights  strengthening the Centre for Human Rightsand the establishment of a high commissioner for humanrights.Economic cooperation is of particular importance.Cooperation in the framework of a series of existinginternational organizations and integrations must be seen inthe context of its extension to new members. Agreementson economic cooperation between members andnon-members of trading blocs are already being concluded although sometimes too slowly. In any case  it is importantthat these associations should not close the door to the newdemocracies  since this could greatly impede thedevelopment of market economies in the new democraciesat the very start. It is to be hoped that regional EconomicCommissions  specialized agencies of the United Nations andinternational financial institutions will use their influence inorder to help remove obstacles.At the Earth Summit in Rio last year we took part inthe efforts for closer international cooperation on theenvironment. We will render all possible support to theUnited Nations to achieve the aims of the Rio Conference including sustainable development  and to simultaneouslydetect new problems in this field. Of course  success willelude us if there is no adequate supervision or sanctions.European security since the end of the cold war hasacquired different faces  and new countries have entered theEuropean scene. Some military arrangements with purporteddefence aims have disbanded  and a number of countries arelooking for new arrangements to safeguard their security.This represents an opportunity that should not be lost.Europe should be able to fill the security vacuum withdemocratic  forward-looking and adequate securityarrangements for all  the more so since it is the first time inhistory that security is not bound to increased defencespending. This is encouraging. On the other hand  we arefacing the danger of new outbreaks in different regions.This situation  more than anything else  requires preventivediplomacy  which should  by its very nature  be a matter ofcoordination for the United Nations  whose views should beformed in the General Assembly and the Security Council.Existing security associations  such as the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO) the Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the Western EuropeanUnion (WEU) should be systematically extended  and careshould be taken to see that there is coordination betweenthem and decision-making institutions of the United Nations.The agreement between the United Nations and the CSCEsigned in May this year is encouraging from this point ofview. It may be useful to seriously consider creating forcesfor rapid action  wherever timely action firmly authorized bythe Security Council could prevent a crisis.During the last two years Slovenia has radically andunilaterally restricted its own military potential. More thanhalf of the military facilities of the former Yugoslav army onSlovenian territory have been committed to civilian needs.However  the Republic of Slovenia remains subject to thearms embargo which the Security Council imposed on theformer Yugoslavia. Unfortunately  this measure did notproduce the desired effect in other parts of the formerYugoslavia; on the contrary  it has prevented the victims ofaggression from effectively defending themselves. It is our12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionview that it is high time the Security Council reconsideredthis measure and adjusted it to realities.I am sure that I am not alone in the view that all thenew dilemmas that the world is facing also require reform ofthe structures and mechanisms of the United Nations. TheGeneral Assembly should more fully utilize its owncompetence in this sense for dealing with situations and takesteps to settle international relations matters. The SecurityCouncil  in view of the new circumstances in the world andthe nature of current problems  would appear to need somemodification so as to be able to react more flexibly andeffectively. It would be wise to increase its membershipappropriately to make it more representative and tostrengthen its responsibility to United Nations Member Statesthrough the General Assembly. Further  strengthening theprofessional competence of the Secretariat could beenvisaged  thereby improving conditions for the effectiveoperation of the Secretary-General. The current state of theworld  in which we are simultaneously confronted withpossible dangerous consequences of otherwise welcomechanges and with the well-known mounting problems ofdeveloping countries  of course demands increased efficiencyof existing and perhaps new mechanisms. This means thatit will also be impossible to avoid the question of settling theregular financing of the United Nations.In closing I must unfortunately also touch on a matterthat has already disturbed and concerned the internationalcommunity for far too long: the crisis in some parts of theformer Yugoslavia. Slovenia  despite being near the regionsof armed conflict in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina has not been directly involved in the problems that havebeen the cause of armed conflict for the last two years. Thisdoes not  of course  mean that people of Slovenia and theSlovene Government are indifferent. The Republic ofSlovenia is respecting sanctions and is cooperating in allefforts by the international community to bring peace tothese countries. We have submitted proposals in order toalleviate the crisis  find a political solution and cut short thewar and suffering. Unfortunately  the war still rages on.We are constantly reminded of this by the presence of70 000 refugees living in Slovenia. Caring for them is nosmall burden for the 2 million inhabitants of Slovenia  eventhough we have the cooperation of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees. However  international aid forrefugees is decreasing.In our view  it is crucial to abide by all the principleson which the international order after the end of cold warshould be based. This would encourage the newly foundedFederal Republic of Yugoslavia to follow these principlesand  like other States founded on the territory of the formerYugoslavia  to seek membership in the United Nations inaccordance with the Charter. The political and economicinterests of all members of the former Yugoslavia can beginto be met only through negotiations  on an equal legalfooting  on the succession of the former Yugoslavia.Slovenia supports  and will continue to support  allinitiatives to create a better world that provides adequateprospects for the coming generations - a world based on themutual interests of the entire international community without the horrors of war  poverty and social distress  aworld in which human rights and the dignity of everyindividual are standards respected by all Governments.I wish the General Assembly every success at thecurrent session in its work towards this goal."
"152",6539,"SWE",48,1993,"Let me express the SwedishGovernment’s satisfaction at the election of AmbassadorInsanally of Guyana as President of this session of theGeneral Assembly. I should also like to pay a tribute to theSecretary-General and to his endeavours to promote theprinciples of the Charter and a stronger United Nations.Furthermore  I welcome the six new Members of theOrganization.The totalitarian ideologies of this century have beendefeated  but the struggle of ideas is not over. Totalitarianideas and ideologies can take on different shapes at differenttimes. In many places - and no country is immune - we stillwitness expressions of racism  xenophobia and intolerance.If these tendencies are not effectively countered today  theworld might have to face far uglier threats tomorrow.As we welcome the progress towards peace andfreedom in Eastern Europe  in the Middle East and in SouthAfrica  we have to realize that these achievements will proveelusive if they do not give people a better life. Peace anddemocracy  freedom and reconciliation  must be cemented byeconomic and social progress.The individual’s endeavours to improve his own lot andthat of his family reflect a basic human desire  whichtranscends all cultural differences. If that desire ishampered  if hope turns into disillusion  a fertile ground iscreated for the merchants of hatred and preachers ofviolence.The regions of the world where security and prosperityhave been relatively well secured now have opportunities tohelp extend the zone of peace to areas that are struggling toescape the vicious circle of poverty and violence. The maininstruments for such developments are freer global trade anda more open exchange of ideas.In Europe  the evolving European union  of whichSweden soon hopes to become a member  has a specialresponsibility for ensuring that the Iron Curtain is notreinstalled in the form of persistent economic and socialdivisions. The United States and Asia-Pacific countries aremeeting challenges of a similar nature in their regions. Inthe Middle East and Africa  we all share a jointresponsibility.In spite of all the challenges facing the world today -regional conflicts  widespread poverty  environmentaldamage and arms proliferation - I believe we have areasonable chance of extending the zone of peace andprosperity as we stand at the threshold of the twenty-firstcentury. In this effort we must be able to rely on a strongand efficient world Organization.Today the United Nations is reaching middle age. Intwo years it will be celebrating its fiftieth anniversary. Theend of the cold war brings new opportunities to utilize thefull potential of the United Nations Charter and the UnitedNations system. At the same time  a thorough diagnosis andsome strong prescriptions are necessary if the Organizationis to serve as a vigorous instrument of the world community.Former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold oncesaid:""The United Nations is  and should be  a living evolving  experimental institution. If it should evercease to be so  it should be revolutionized or sweptaside for a new approach.""Those words are as challenging and valid today as they werein the late 1950s.Today  I do not intend to dwell on those areas in whichthe Organization works well  or to commend praiseworthyinitiatives. Instead  I would like to concentrate on areaswhere reforms and a special focus are indispensable. Themost important of these are the promotion of peace andsecurity  the role of the Organization in the economic andsocial fields  and the promotion of human rights.In responding to several crises in the aftermath of thecold war  the Security Council has  de facto  considerablybroadened the concept of international peace and security.The United Nations finds itself engaged on a regular basisin wide-ranging and diversified operations in a variety ofcomplex conflict situations. Some of these are of an internalnature and many of them involve humanitarian efforts. Thevery concept of United Nations peace-keeping has undergonedramatic change.Unprecedented demands are being placed on theOrganization in the quest for global security and peace.There has been an eight-fold increase in the number ofpeople serving in peace-keeping operations during the pasttwo years; the peace-keeping budget will more than doublein the course of a single year.18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe implementation of a peace agreement in Bosniaand Herzegovina will require additional and substantialcontributions from United Nations Member States. Againthe willingness and ability to provide personnel andresources will be tested. I am pleased to announce that atthis very moment a Nordic battalion group is being deployedin Bosnia.As much as we welcome a peace settlement for Bosniaand Herzegovina we must recognize that it is far from anideal solution to that long and bitter conflict. It mightconstitute no more than the beginning of a complicated andfrustrating process towards peace where all efforts must beused to counter the inherent dangers of continued aggression ""ethnic cleansing"" and the dismemberment of Bosnia andHerzegovina.As soon as a settlement has been signed by the parties we should concentrate on building a peace which canprovide safe and decent conditions for the sufferingpopulation. First of all  we need a strong and efficientpeace-keeping operation in order to assist in implementingthe provisions of the agreement.International organizations  particularly the UnitedNations  must embark on a comprehensive reconstructionand rehabilitation programme. Special attention should bepaid to the situation of refugees and displaced persons  andto their return  and to the plight of women and children.Experience gained from the conflict in formerYugoslavia and from the successful United NationsTransitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) shows theneed for an integrated approach to international peace andsecurity. This must be one of the guiding principles forreforming and restructuring the Organization to enable it todeal more effectively with today’s conflicts. TheSecretary-General’s report ""An Agenda for Peace"" indicatesways to improve the medium-term and long-term handlingof peace-keeping. An interaction between preventivediplomacy  peacemaking  peace-keeping and post-conflictpeace-building is indispensable.The need for reform in the peace-keeping area isundisputed. Ongoing efforts in this regard are commendableand should be further promoted. The Nordic countriesintend to present proposals on this issue during the currentGeneral Assembly session. At this early stage I would liketo stress the following points.First  we should be able to react flexibly to dynamicsituations in peace-keeping operations  and that requiresbetter provisions for planning and operations staff.Command and control need to be clearly defined. Theoperative command of operations in the field would  ofcourse  remain in the hands of the respective forcecommanders.Secondly  close consultations between the troopcontributors  the Security Council and the Secretary-Generalare of special importance in complex peace-keepingoperations. A forum for coordination and exchange ofinformation to improve contacts between the Council and thetroop contributors would be desirable. I propose that sucha forum be set up for each major operation.Thirdly  we urge Member States to respond positivelyto the Secretary-General’s request  and provide troops  otherpersonnel and equipment on a stand-by basis for use at shortnotice for peace-keeping purposes. The members of theSecurity Council hold a special responsibility to ensure thatadequate resources are provided when it decides on newoperations.Fourthly  peace-keeping operations and humanitarianrelief efforts are increasingly interrelated  and this requiresimproved coordination. In many cases the humanitarianefforts are vital for the successful pursuance ofpeace-keeping operations.Fifthly  the great number of peace-keeping operationsand their diversity require special emphasis on training. Toaddress the need for appropriate training of United Nationspeace-keepers  United Nations training colleges should beestablished. The United Nations has an important role toplay in coordinating and promoting peace-keeping trainingfor all categories of personnel. Member States withlong-standing traditions in this field bear a specialresponsibility. Sweden  for its part  is prepared to contributeto improving the skills of peace-keepers. This could includetraining for civilian and humanitarian-relief personnel  andalso for police and military staff.Finally  and most important  present and increasingdemands on United Nations peace-keeping cannot be met ifMember States do not pay their dues. We must create thenecessary resources for the rapid implementation of SecurityCouncil decisions. If not  we run the risk of underminingthe credibility and the prestige of the United Nations and theSecurity Council.New threats to regional security are emerging.Cooperation between the United Nations and regionalarrangements is vital to meet these threats of globalForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 19importance. Regional action is indispensable to strengthenthe global community of values and to secure the efficientuse of scarce resources. In this spirit  the Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) is applying forObserver status in the General Assembly.As Chairman of the CSCE Council  I signed in May aframework document with the Secretary-General. Thisframework aims at improving coordination and cooperationbetween the United Nations and the CSCE in conflictresolution in the CSCE area. The implementation of thatframework is essential for realizing the goals of Chapter VIIIof the Charter. Regular consultations  mutual exchange ofinformation and coordination of activities between the UnitedNations and the CSCE have started. CSCE missions aresupervising the implementation of United Nations sanctionsagainst the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia andMontenegro). Concrete action in the field is also takingplace in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and inunfortunate Georgia.As Chairman of the CSCE I deplore the recentdevelopments in Georgia. The very survival of Georgia asa member of the international community is now at stake.The CSCE lends its full support to President Shevardnadze’sefforts to prevent the dismemberment of his country. Allparticipating States must now exert their influence to thatend. The disintegration of Georgia is in no one’s interest.The Security Council bears primary responsibility forthe maintenance of international peace and security  andmust be the driving force behind reforms in this area reflecting the aspirations of the States Members of theOrganization. In this context  we welcome the statement bythe Council that progress in disarmament  arms control andnon-proliferation can make a crucial contribution to themaintenance of peace and security. An early agreement ona comprehensive test ban would enhance that concept.The considerable increase in the number of Members ofthe United Nations makes an enlargement of the SecurityCouncil a matter for urgent consideration. The effectiveness efficiency and legitimacy of the Council must be theoverriding goals. A reform must ensure that the Councilcontinues to be relevant in a changing world and that itretains its capacity to act decisively and promptly.The United Nations has a unique mandate to promoteeconomic  social and environmental progress anddevelopment. Increased attention should be given to theseareas to overcome long-term threats to international peaceand security. Today  the challenge for the United Nations isto fulfil its important role in supporting internationalcooperation and governments’ efforts to master theincreasingly complex problems of development. Sweden islooking forward to contributing to the deliberations on thereport of the Secretary-General on an agenda fordevelopment.Along with other countries  we have witnessed withincreasing concern what seems to be a fragmentation andmarginalization of the United Nations in developmentassistance  not least in long-term development. It is obviousthat extensive reform is needed if the United Nations is to beable to respond to the new challenges.A more efficient governance structure and a broader more stable and predictable funding of operational activitiesare in the interest both of recipient and of donor countries.We must sharpen our instruments  both in terms of policyformulation and development action  to avoid having interest commitment and funding from Sweden and other MemberStates diverted to other organizations  to the detriment ofthose most in need of what the United Nations could offer.As a long-standing  major donor  with a firm belief inthe importance of the United Nations in the economic andsocial fields  Sweden will continue to work for much-neededreforms. Against this background  we hope that the recentdecision to continue negotiations on the role  size andfunctioning of the executive boards of the developmentprogrammes will lead to a result that ensures an effectiveconduct of work in the development field. The executiveboards must be efficient instruments  capable of firmlyguiding the work of their respective organizations.The promotion of human rights is a United Nationspriority objective  as set out in the Charter. Thus  theprotection and promotion of human rights should underpinthe whole spectrum of United Nations activities.Flagrant abuse of human rights and humanitarian lawis still a tragic reality for millions of people in many partsof the world. At the World Conference on Human Rights all States reaffirmed their solemn commitment to promoterespect for and protection of human rights and fundamentalfreedoms  the universal nature of which is beyond question.Such commitments are  however  of no avail if they are notput into action. All States have a duty to adhere to theinternational conventions in this field.We must also make sure that the United Nations humanrights programme is allocated the means and supportnecessary to fulfil its role. We should  as a matter of20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionurgency  take steps to increase the resources and improve thefunction of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights.The establishment of a high commissioner for humanrights would enhance the capacity of the international systemto deal more directly with emergencies and grave violations.It would help to improve coordination and integration ofhuman rights within the United Nations system as a whole.The commissioner would personify the priority given to theprotection of human rights  and this issue should be a matterfor prompt consideration by this General Assembly.Sweden welcomes the fact that the General Assemblyrecently proceeded to select the judges for the Tribunalestablished for prosecuting war crimes committed in formerYugoslavia. This means that the Tribunal can shortlycommence its important work.Let me revert to the United Nations financial crisis. Itis deeply disturbing that 90 per cent of the assessedcontributions are paid late or not at all. There is nojustification for the failure of permanent members of theSecurity Council to live up to their obligations in thisrespect.The time has come to address the issue of incentivesand penalties to enhance the principle of meeting financialobligations on time and in full. The recommendations of theIndependent Advisory Group on United Nations Financingin this respect must receive immediate attention. In thisconnection  let us not forget the letter and the spirit ofArticle 19 of the Charter  with its implications for the rightto vote.An adjustment of the scale of assessments must ensurea fairer and more up-to-date application of the principle ofcapacity to pay.At a time of resource constraints  it is also imperativefor Member States to face the questions of priorities andefficient management. Strict budgetary discipline isrequired  and scarce resources should not be wasted onactivities lacking well-defined goals: the means entrusted tothe Organization must be used in the most cost-effective andprudent manner. We welcome the recent measures taken bythe Secretary-General in this regard.We now have a unique opportunity to strengtheninternational cooperation. This window of opportunity isgreater than at any time since 1945. The judgement ofhistory will be harsh if we fail to grasp this moment.Therefore  it is up to us  as politicians and statesmen of thepresent generation  to make sure that internationalcooperation takes a decisive step forward.The United Nations has a central role in this process.If the United Nations concentrates on the essential tasksentrusted to it in the Charter  and manages to generate thenecessary support and cooperation  this can be achieved.There is broad consensus among the Member States aboutthe need to strengthen the United Nations. If this consensuscan be transformed into rapid action  we will have madeconsiderable progress in making the world Organizationfulfil the high expectations attached to it today."
"153",6577,"SWZ",48,1993,"I am delighted and honoured tohave this opportunity once more to address this distinguishedgathering.I bring with me from the Kingdom of Swaziland thegreetings and good wishes of Her Majesty Indlovukazi andthe whole Swazi nation to our fellow Members and friends.Before I begin my remarks  I should like  on behalf ofthe Kingdom of Swaziland  to express my deep condolencesto the people of India  who have suffered so much in the last24 hours. Our thoughts and prayers reach out to the familiesand friends of the victims of the tragic earthquake as theystruggle to overcome the effects of disaster. May AlmightyGod protect all in the region from further suffering.Mr. President  on behalf of the Swaziland delegation let me offer my sincere congratulations on your election tothe presidency of this forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. Many issues of vital importance to the worldwill be discussed during this session  and we are entirelyconfident in your ability to lead us to a successful conclusionin all our deliberations.We should also like to express our deep appreciation toyour predecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  who guided theproceedings of the forty-seventh session to such great effect.We are meeting at a time when our Organization isfaced with a number of concerns  whose challenge to ourresources  and to our unity  is perhaps without parallel in the48 years of our existence.We Members are fortunate that our success in meetingthese challenges lies to a large extent on the shoulders of ourSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Ghali  whose performanceover the last two years has fully justified our confidence inhim. The Kingdom of Swaziland pays a tribute to his skill vision and leadership  as we face increasing challenges -internal as well as external - to our Organization. We areconfident in his ability to act on behalf of us all  as theUnited Nations strives to maintain peace and securitythroughout this troubled world and as we continue to fulfilthe hopes and wishes of our peoples  through the promotionof social and economic development in all Member States.We offer our Secretary-General the fullest support andencouragement in the difficult times ahead.Swaziland is delighted to extend the hand of friendshipto our six new Members  including our own Africancontinent’s newest nation  Eritrea. Earlier this year  wepraised the United Nations-sponsored elections  whichallowed Eritrea a peaceful transition to independence  andwe welcomed it to the Organization of African Unity familyof African nations. Now  that welcome is extended to thislarger family.The admission of these new countries is further proofof the importance we place on embracing all peoples withinour Organization: the principle of universality - ofrepresenting all the nations of the world - is one that hasbeen at the very centre of the United Nation’s existence since our establishment in 1945.All groups of people  all nations  regardless of size orhistory  have a contribution to make towards ensuring asafer  more prosperous world  in which we can live andwork in peace and provide the promise of economic andpolitical security for future generations.Just one month ago Swaziland celebrated an event ofgreat importance in the history of the Kingdom. Twentyfive years ago  on 6 September 1968  we regained ourindependence and resumed our rightful place in the worldonce more  as a free  sovereign nation.To mark such an historic occasion  we hosted a largenumber of Heads of State and other representatives ofcountries from every corner of our globe for three days ofcelebration and rejoicing.While the event was one of great national jubilation and an opportunity to give thanks to God for the manyblessings he continues to bestow on us  it was also a chanceto review the progress of the nation’s development; toexamine our successes and failures; and to learn from thelessons of our first 25 years as a nation reborn.We were also able to confirm the steps we are takingto continue in our quest to bring all Swazis once more underthe protection of our leadership. A committee has beenestablished and negotiations are under way to restore theland and the people that have been lost to us over the lastcentury. We shall be keeping this Organization fullyinformed of developments.Most prominent among Swaziland’s blessings havebeen the peace and stability we have continued to enjoythroughout these times of great change and disorder. As anation  we confirmed how important a role our unity playsin preserving the conditions for our stability  anddemonstrated what we could do to ensure that thoseconditions will be enjoyed by future generations.We acknowledged that two factors have contributedmost to our unity: first  the emphasis we have alwaysplaced on those aspects of our national character that makeus unique from others - our traditions  our customs and ourculture; and  secondly  our policy of always acting inconsensus  wherever possible  on issues of nationalimportance.These traditional values which continue to guide andlead us today may seem old-fashioned and out of date intoday’s world. But they have served Swaziland well andwill continue to bind the Swazi nation together for manygenerations to come.I do not wish to give the impression that time has stoodstill for us in our remote corner of the African continent -far from it. Swaziland  too  has felt the winds of changewhich have blown throughout the world; and together  as afamily  we have bent to accommodate them  for the good ofthe nation as a whole.One current example is the process of political reformon which we are embarked.As I mentioned a few moments ago  Swaziland isgoverned by the principle of rule by consensus of the people.Through the ages  our leaders have ruled with the consent ofthe nation  and this principle continues today. So when theeffects of global political reform began to be felt in theKingdom  all Swazis were given the opportunity to offertheir individual opinions on the need for change.The result was a series of recommendations by themajority of the Kingdom to bring about a number ofdemocratic reforms  of which the most important concernedchanges in our electoral system to allow direct andaccountable representation in Parliament.The decision by the people to implement the changeswas announced last October  and the first stage of electionsunder the new system was successfully conducted a weekago. The final stage will take place in 10 days’ time.Our new-found political maturity has also resulted inthe lifting of certain restrictive measures which  for variousreasons  had been thought necessary in the past.Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 3These moves  and indeed the process throughout  hasbeen warmly welcomed and supported wholeheartedly by theinternational community. More importantly  it has fulfilledthe wishes of the vast majority in Swaziland.Ahead of us lies the implementation of the otherrecommendations made by the Kingdom. We shall takethese steps forward in the way we always conduct business -quietly  peacefully and with the consent of all our people.I give this outline of recent reforms in Swaziland notfrom any need to justify our actions to the outside world  norindeed to gain the approval of the international community.No  I simply offer it as an example of the importance we  asa nation  place on our unity  and on the principle of meetingfresh challenges together  as a family.Swaziland’s internal policy is mirrored in our dealingswith the outside world. Throughout our history  we haveconsistently pursued a policy of encouraging the settlementof all disputes through peaceful dialogue and negotiation.We are heartened that this principle is shared by the UnitedNations in its attempts to maintain global peace and security.It is a distressing fact that the challenges facing theUnited Nations in this regard have reached a level perhapswithout equal since its establishment at the end of the lastglobal conflict.The consequences of the breakup of the former SovietUnion  in particular  have focused world attention oncontinental Europe  where the situations in the formerYugoslavia and Georgia continue to give us all great causefor concern.The horrors of the war in Bosnia reinforce the beliefthat we need some way of limiting the effects of tensionbefore they are allowed to expand and explode.Swaziland has fully supported the efforts of the UnitedNations and the European Community to bring about anegotiated settlement to the conflict; and we recognize thework of those involved in the process towards peace.Special mention must be made of the contribution ofthe members of the United Nations Protection Force(UNPROFOR) in Bosnia  who risk their lives daily in theircourageous attempts to bring relief to the suffering of somany. We urge the leaders of the three sides to find thebasis for a peaceful settlement before the start of a winterwhich many thousands will otherwise not have a chance ofsurviving.Not far away  in Georgia  we have witnessed withconcern the unfolding of another tragedy whoseconsequences may well be felt for some time to come.Swaziland urges those involved  with the support from thosehaving influence in the area  to learn from the suffering ofBosnia and to find a peaceful  negotiated settlement to thedispute that has ruined the stability of a nation which sorecently rejoiced in its new-found independence.The last two weeks have seen the internal politicalstruggle in Russia reach a critical point  constituting a veryserious threat to the stability of that great country.Most countries in the world have learned from bitterexperience that there is no easy path to reform  no certainblueprint  no overnight success.As a country with enormous strategic and historicalimportance  Russia has held our attention throughout itsoften painful transition  and our thoughts are with its peopleduring this latest internal crisis. Swaziland joins the rest ofthe international community in supporting a peacefulresolution to the constitutional struggle on whose outcomethe peace of the entire region may depend.Cyprus continues to give cause for concern to mydelegation  fully 19 years after the short but destructiveconflict that brought division to that unhappy island.Swaziland shares with Cyprus membership in the BritishCommonwealth of Nations  and we support the untiringefforts of our Secretary-General to promote dialoguebetween Greeks and Turks so that a lasting settlement acceptable to all  may be found.Closer to home  for many of our brotherly Africancountries conflict and internal strife continue to be themajor obstacles in the way of the development of thecontinent as a whole. Of particular distress to us in southernAfrica is the appalling disaster which has overtaken ourbrothers in Angola  where more tragedies occur each daythan anywhere else in the world. If any country has sufferedenough it is surely Angola. No reason can possibly justifythe scale of the disaster suffered by so many. We thereforesupport the measures taken by the United Nations to bringabout an end to the conflict  and we appeal to thoseresponsible for the continuation of the suffering to allowsense and reason to prevail. The elections last Septemberwere judged free and fair by organizations of which we area member and whose views we respect. We appeal to both4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionsides to come together in a spirit of understanding andcompromise to achieve a lasting peace for the wholecountry. The efforts of our United Nations Special Envoyin this difficult and dangerous assignment deserve our fullestsupport.On the other side of our continent  we continue withgrave concern to look on the situation in Somalia  where despite the efforts of the large United Nations force and alarge measure of success at the start of the operation  aformula for lasting peace still cannot be found. Swazilandgives due praise to the members of the peace-keeping forceas they attempt to maintain the conditions in which food andmedical relief can reach those most in need. Clearly  thesupport of the international community will be necessary forthe foreseeable future - despite the enormous drain this willmean on our limited resources - as efforts are made to helpestablish suitable political conditions in the country toencourage sustainable development.Despite these setbacks to global peace  the last 12months have seen considerable successes recorded in otherareas  many of which owe much to the efforts of the UnitedNations. In this Hall on Monday  President Clinton spokeof the determination of his Administration to continue withthe policy of encouraging an end  once and for all  to thespread of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons.Swaziland supports any measure to limit the ability of allcountries to make political use of weapons of massdestruction  and we call on all the nuclear Powers to give theinitiative the support it deserves.Of perhaps greatest immediate significance in the areaof global peace  however  was the recent signing of thepeace accord between Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization. Swaziland joins the rest of the world inwelcoming with enormous relief this sign of real progresstowards peace in the Middle East. We acknowledge thosewho have contributed to this first  vital step towards asettlement of the crisis which has afflicted the region for solong. In particular  the determination of the two leaders Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat  to bring aboutthe conditions for a settlement deserves the praise of us all.Meanwhile  along with the rest of the world  werecognize that many challenges lie ahead in the process ofreconciliation and peaceful resettlement. Above all  theremust be a firm commitment to the process from all nationsin the region. The responsibility for a successful future liesas much with the neighbouring countries as it does withIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization.Swaziland therefore welcomes the immediate favourableresponse to the treaty from many in the region  and we offerour wholehearted support to the process begun with thathistoric handshake. Our hopes and prayers for lasting peaceare with the people of the Middle East.The successful conclusion of another long-runningconflict owes much to the efforts of the United Nations andis worth highlighting. The free and fair elections inCambodia have  hopefully  brought an end to many years ofsuffering by the Cambodian people and fully justified thesupport we  as Member States  gave to the process.Challenges to peace in that country remain  however and  while welcoming the moves to unite the people behinda newly established monarchy  Swaziland is concerned thatany remaining differences be resolved through negotiation and not by the means that  in the past  gave rise to suchhatred and division among the Cambodian people.Africa  too  has experienced encouraging developmentsover the past 12 months. Of particular relevance toSwaziland have been the ongoing peace processes in theneighbouring countries of Mozambique and South Africa.Later this month we shall formally begin the process ofreturning the tens of thousands of Mozambican refugees totheir homeland. Swaziland has hosted these unfortunatevictims of civil war for many years  with the assistance ofthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Wepraise all those who have contributed to the peace effort.Above all  we recognize the willingness of both sides tobring an end to the suffering of so many fellow-countrymen.We therefore acknowledge the commitment to peace ofPresident Chissano and Mr. Dhlakama  who have given anexample to the leaders of other countries experiencinginternal struggles. We pray that the peace process will beallowed to run its course  with the assistance of the UnitedNations force that is stationed in the country. Swazilandstands ready to help Mozambique to regain its significancein the region.The situation in South Africa - our other neighbour -too gives some reason for long-term hope of a peacefultransition to majority rule and the birth of a new SouthAfrica. This view has been strengthened by the speechesthat President De Klerk and Mr. Mandela made in theUnited States last week. The negotiation process hasproceeded in accordance with a tight timetable  andimportant successes have been recorded. I refer  forexample  to the recent agreement concerning conditions forthe establishment of the Transitional Executive Council.Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 5The setting of a date for elections - April 1994 - is ofparticular importance as it provides a focus for the blackcommunity  which has been denied the vote for so long.However  major obstacles remain if next year’s election dateis to be met. Prominent among these is the distressingcontinued violence in many sections of South Africansociety. This has resulted in widespread loss of confidencein the peace process. We appeal to the leaders of all partiesin South Africa to impose the maximum restraint on thosewho threaten the real progress that has been made so far.We pray that reason will prevail and that the existing forumfor peaceful negotiation will be used for the resolution ofany differences.A matter of equal concern  and with the potential togive rise to greater problems in the long term  is the absencefrom the negotiations of representatives of large sections ofthe country. Empty chairs at the negotiating table will resultin an incomplete solution to the problem of creating a newSouth Africa. All South Africans must be represented at thetalks  so that each may feel that he is a part of the solution.Conditions must be found to give all in South Africa regardless of race or belief  a voice in the transition process.In the meantime  in accordance with the wishes of themajority of South Africans  Swaziland supports the call forthe lifting of the remaining economic and trade sanctionsagainst South Africa  to enable the country to begin the longand difficult process of resolving the many developmentchallenges it faces.Swaziland looks forward to welcoming a new SouthAfrica as a major force in the development of the region.Further north in our continent  the recent signing of thepeace accord in Liberia will  we hope  bring to an end along and painful chapter in the history of that unhappycountry. Swaziland endorses the offer of the United Nationsearlier this year to assist in the electoral process. We appealto all Liberian leaders to respect the peace process and toput their faith in the electoral system  so that the countrymay begin the task of rebuilding in an atmosphere ofnational unity and conciliation.As we examine the extent of United Nationsinvolvement in peace-keeping operations around the world it is clear that we face major questions about our ability tocope with future conflict situations. While Swaziland salutesthe courage and dedication of the 80 000 men and women ofthe various United Nations forces on assignment in 17separate operations throughout the world  we support the callof other Members for a full examination of the way in whichour peace-keeping operations are managed  with a view tosecuring the maximum benefit from our limited resources.We are approaching our fiftieth anniversary  and this isa suitable moment to review our past performance in thisarea and to draw on our collective experience so that infuture peace-keeping roles we may make the most efficientuse of our resources. Swaziland therefore welcomes the call in the Secretary-General’s report ""An Agenda for Peace""  fordiscussion of these vital issues during the current session.At the beginning of my address I expressed the Swazidelegation’s welcome for the accession of six new Membersas an indication of the Organization’s respect for theprinciple of universality. We confirmed that it is a basichuman right of all peoples to be represented at the UnitedNations so that the widest possible range of opinions andexperience may be pooled  and the benefits of theOrganization shared by all countries.The President returned to the Chair.Yet the Kingdom of Swaziland has enjoyed a long andhappy relationship with 21 million people who believe thatthey have had no representation here since 1971: I refer tothe people of the Republic of China.For the past 25 years the Republic of China has shownitself to be a true friend of Swaziland. We have benefitedfrom the experience of development which has lifted theRepublic of China to a position high on the list ofindustrialized nations. The rest of the world has beenexcluded from that experience and from the positivecontribution that we feel the Republic of China can make tothe international community. It is a contribution that theGovernment and the people of that nation have demonstratedtheir will and desire to make. And 21 million people feelthat they are denied the right of representation here in theUnited Nations by men and women of their own choice. Inthe interest of equity and justice  their collective voicedeserves to be heard.Swaziland therefore supports the call from otherMember States for the establishment of an ad hoc committeeto look into the issue of the Republic of China’s re-entryinto the United Nations.Following from the issue of basic human rights amongnations  Swaziland attached great importance to ourattendance at the Conference in Vienna last June. We made6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionclear the priority we attach to the promotion and protectionof human rights in our own country and the important rolewe believe that plays in the maintenance of peace andstability throughout the world.The principle of equality among nations is one that hasguided our foreign policy since independence  and we joinother Member States in welcoming the Conference’sDeclaration and Programme of Action. We look forward tothe discussion here in the General Assembly of proposalsagreed at the Conference  and we stand ready to implementthem where necessary.For many years after independence the Kingdom ofSwaziland enjoyed a period of steady growth and reasonableprosperity  despite the difficulties experienced by otherdeveloping nations in our region. The world-wide economicrecession and the drought years of 1991 and 1992 meant anend to the expansion of our economy  and the Kingdombraced itself for some tough times ahead. As a developingcountry we are heavily reliant on the economies of nationsthat are more industrialized than ours  and the failure of theprojected world-wide recovery in 1993 has added to ourdespair.We have recognized that there are internal measures wemust take ourselves  and we are active in attempting tostrengthen our industrial and agricultural base; but weremain dependent on outside support to finance programmesto help achieve our objectives.The Kingdom has begun a programme of action for ourown economic development  based on the principle ofnational consensus that was so successful in our politicalreforms. The United Nations continues to support us in theplanning and coordination of our efforts  and we will needthat support for some time to come if we are to experiencethe growth we need for the economic security of futuregenerations.One area in which we have been concentrating mucheffort is the expansion of our export markets and our traderelations with other countries. We have therefore beenfollowing anxiously the prolonged process of concluding theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks. Wehave a saying in Africa: ""When the elephants fight  the antsget squashed."" For our small  developing nation  muchdepends on the successful outcome of the talks. We are  inparticular  looking forward to an international trade packagewhich will take full account of the needs of the developingnations and will make allowances for current tradeagreements between us and the first world. Anotherdeadline is just two months away. We appeal to the world’smajor economic Powers to consider the long-term fate of ourpeople and not to be seduced by the short-term politicaladvantage to be gained from indecision and delay.Although we will be heavily reliant on the outcome ofthe GATT talks  Swaziland and the other countries in theSouthern and Eastern African regions have followed theexample of other major trading blocs around the world andformed our own regional common markets. The SouthernAfrican Development Community (SADC)  of whichSwaziland is currently Vice-Chairman  and the PreferentialTrade Area (PTA) for Eastern and Southern African Statesare models of inter-nation cooperation. Our objective is theimprovement of all our peoples through closer economic andtrade cooperation and development between member States.Through our membership in these trade organizations  we aretrying to open up more regional markets to complementthose we have established overseas. Our long-term target isto achieve a measure of regional self-reliance  and it is onethat deserves the support of the developed world. SADC the PTA and other arrangements like them will succeed aslong as we can count on the support and commitment oforganizations such as the United Nations. I commend themto this Assembly.Swaziland fully agrees with the United Nations inattaching importance to the concept of sustainabledevelopment among Member nations  and we welcome yourcall  Mr. President  for an agenda for development to havepriority focus in this session. In this regard  we intend totake a full and active part in next year’s conference onpopulation and development  and the Heads of State summiton social issues in 1995.The concept of a holistic approach to development -taking into account issues such as the environment  humansettlement  population management  productive employmentand the easing of poverty - is one that forms the basis of ourown nation’s policies.We are working hard to ensure that our development issustainable for the benefit of future generations of Swazis -just as our forefathers made sacrifices to ensure a secure andprosperous heritage for us.We therefore welcome any initiative that placespopulation concerns at the centre of all social  economic political and environmental activities and we look forward toa worthwhile output from Cairo next year and from thesocial Summit in 1995.Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 7It has been an eventful and exciting year. The firststeps have been taken towards the resolution of manylong-standing problems  but many challenges remain.The need for internal adjustments in the administrationof the Organization has been clearly identified and we lookforward to monitoring more effective operations as a resultof the initiatives taken by the Secretary-General. Despitethese  the United Nations can be proud of its record over thepast twelve months and the Kingdom of Swaziland salutesall those who have contributed to the many substantialachievements we have recorded.I should like to give my personal assurance thatSwaziland will demonstrate its confidence in theOrganization by paying its dues on time and with greatwillingness in the firm expectation that they will be put tothe best possible use. We urge all other Member States totake the same attitude so that the Organization might havethe funds available to undertake the programmes ofassistance that are so desperately needed throughout theworld.In conclusion I should like to take this opportunity  onbehalf of Her Majesty  the Indlovukazi  and the whole Swazination  to express my deep gratitude to the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and all its sister agencies for the many programmes of assistance undertaken inSwaziland since its independence.We believe that the United Nations remains the onlytruly global forum for confronting the challenges facing theworld today  and the only body with the resources and thecommitment to implement the solutions. The world wouldindeed be a more troubled place without the combinedefforts of all of us here.We take pride in reaffirming our commitment to theprinciples and ideals contained in our founding Charter."
"154",6611,"SYC",48,1993,"I too would like to extend to AmbassadorInsanally the congratulations of Seychelles on his election tothe presidency of the General Assembly. We wish himevery possible success in carrying out his duties.Allow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to theSecretary-General for his tireless efforts in seeking solutionsto the many problems facing the international community.Our session is opening on a note of hope  because it istaking place only a few days after a historic event ofexceptional importance. I am referring  of course  to thesigning of the peace agreement between Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization. May that negotiationprovide a lesson in those areas where misunderstanding hatred and conflicts of interest are still bringing suffering toso many.The dramatic events and the human tragedy that aretaking place in hotbeds of tension throughout the world area credit to no one. However  we must take note of the factthat while reaction has been passive and hesitant in somecases  it has been quick and resolute in others.The quest for peace is nevertheless at the centre of ourconcerns. The considerable financial resources ourOrganization devotes to peace-keeping missions or missionsto restore peace demonstrate this. This is undoubtedly proofof our own determination to bring to a halt these conflicts which result in so many victims and destroy all theachievements of development.Indeed  any lasting development necessarily impliesefforts to thwart the threat of certain situations turning intoopen conflict.42 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionFor us island States  the seas are a source of life. Ourfuture depends mainly on them. And for our developmentto be truly lasting  we must have peace on the seas.While it is indisputable that old rivalries have subsidedin the seas and oceans of the world  it nevertheless remainstrue that the Indian Ocean has always been coveted by all.And that is why we reiterate our request that the IndianOcean become truly a zone of peace and cooperation to thebenefit of coastal States. The concept of the ColomboConference is perhaps something from a bygone era  but itsobjectives remain relevant today.Members will find it easy to understand  therefore  whywe attach such great importance to the implementation ofresolution 47/59 of the forty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly calling for the organization by the Ad HocCommittee of a meeting that would propose new alternativeapproaches leading to the achievement of the goals containedin the initial Declaration  taking into account the changinginternational situation.It is in this spirit that I should like to make an appealto the countries which have not yet done so to ratify theConvention on the Law of the Sea so that we can get thenecessary 60 ratifications for its entry into force. How arewe to understand that such an important Convention hasbeen endorsed by only 56 countries since 1982? Of course we do appreciate the importance of what is at stake  butinternational solidarity must be our guide.The International Olympic Committee would like torevive the ancient tradition of the Olympic truce and declare1994 the International Year of Sports and of the OlympicSpirit  and we should support that proposal. Let us notunderestimate the values of the Olympic spirit. They arerich in potential applications for managing internationalrelations.But no peace can be lasting while the causes ofconflicts remain. These causes are selfishness  intolerance xenophobia  discrimination and dictatorship  but also - andespecially - poverty  poor management and excessiveindebtedness. These are ills that generally lead to theemergence of new conflicts. Should we not attack the rootcause rather than the effect?A few years ago  financial backers madedemocratization one of the prerequisites for assistance todeveloping countries  and as a bonus to democracy  certaincountries benefited from the generosity of the internationalcommunity because they had pioneered that approach.Today  most of our countries have embarked on the processof democratization - with varied results  admittedly - but thedesire to fit into the new order was the underlying reason forall. Nevertheless  this new process  and I would take thecase of the Republic of Seychelles  which has met thischallenge calmly and successfully  inevitably entailedextrabudgetary expenditures in all areas  both economic andsocial.While it is true that the transition to democracy issomething which is very valuable in and of itself  theestablishment of new structures and the implementation ofnew rules have nevertheless been a source of additional costswhich have placed a heavy burden on national budgets thatwere already fairly shaky. And almost everywhere  theimplementation of this democratization process required thesupport of the international community. Is this not anobjective reason to think about setting up a United Nationsspecial fund to provide financial and logistical support forthese reforms?To be viable  this democratic undertaking must seek tomeet all the challenges of a country. If it is to ensure thecontinuation of these new institutions  it must pave the wayfor sustainable development commensurate with theaspirations of peoples.Thus  with the advent of the Third Republic  ourcountry is today in a new stage of its history. For more than18 months  within the context of a constituent commission reforms have been undertaken that will produce a newConstitution and lead to free and democratic elections. Inother words  for a year and a half national activity has beenslowed  and even brought to a halt in some cases  while thefundamental economic problems remain.The Seychelles has been the scene of anothermomentous event  the Fourth Indian Ocean Games  whichtook place last August in conditions that were judgedexceptional. Reverting to what I was saying  I would notethat the cost of the infrastructure for those Games madeserious inroads into the national budget.One might wonder how a small island country was ableto engage in such a programme of reforms for 18 months insuch circumstances. We are proud of having succeeded  butthe economy must be restimulated immediately if we do notwish to lose all the social and political benefits that wereachieved.Forty-eighth session - 30 September l993 43I should like now to take up the problem of the smallisland States  of whose fragility everyone here is aware. Weare countries whose reduced size is the source ofinnumerable constraints on economic and socialdevelopment  such as chronic deficits in trade balances andbalances of payment  the high cost of social infrastructuresin relation to their utilization and  especially  the excessiveindebtedness caused by a lack of funds to finance investmentprogrammes. The convergence of those factors has onlyexacerbated the fragility of our economies  which  generallyspeaking  are based on one or two sectors such as tourismand fishing.That is the daily lot of the Seychelles and other smallisland States  which  with courage  perseverance andintelligence  are nevertheless attempting to find solutions thatwill enable them to promote the economic and social well-being of their peoples. Thus we believe that it is quitefitting to draw the international community’s attention onceagain to the need to establish specific programmes andmechanisms that would make it possible for our islandcountries to move towards sustainable development. We askthat the same facilities that are made available to the leastdeveloped  landlocked countries be made available to us.In any event  per capita income  always put forward asa criterion for level of development  cannot be relevant forsmall island States because it is distorted by the small sizeof their populations. Has any thought been given to the percapita cost of infrastructures or the per capita debt? Webelieve that such an analysis would result in thereconsideration of many decisions.Of course  it is up to us  first of all  to take everymeasure to ensure the sustainability of our development bypreserving  in so far as possible  our environment  which liesat the basis of all our export products. Despite all theseconstraints  we have been able - thanks to the judiciousnessof our choices and our economic decisions -to achieve tangible results. But the internationalcommunity’s support  which we had been promised in Rio did not materialize.Today  all of the developing countries are in aprecarious situation. They are confronted with manychallenges: the poverty of millions of human beings  highrates of infant mortality  famine  the destruction of theenvironment and fratricidal wars. But these challenges arenot insurmountable. What is required is courage andinternational solidarity.It is more than ever the duty of the United Nationsonce again to draw the attention of the developed countriesto the effects which the continuation of such a situationmight have on our economies and our cultures - in a word on our future  but also on theirs.We would like concrete action  because we do not wishto have to deplore again the inertia of speeches ordeclarations of intent. While new conflicts arise  the oldones persist almost everywhere and the scope of the disastersis tremendous. Hence  we must react quickly  because manypeoples have suffered far too much from the horrors of war.Above all  the major Powers  the guarantors of thesecurity and regulation of the world economic situation  mustgive the United Nations the means to carry out its policies.Finally  we sincerely hope that the current session willgenerate the necessary impetus to resolve all our concerns so that peace  at last restored  can create a climate conduciveto development."
"155",6652,"SYR",48,1993,"It gives me great pleasure on behalf of thedelegation of the Syrian Arab Republic to congratulateAmbassador Insanally on his election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. I take thisopportunity also to commend the role of his friendly countryin the Non-Aligned Movement and the positive contributionto the United Nations made by the friendly countries ofLatin America.I should also like on this occasion to voice our esteemto the President of the Assembly at its forty-seventh session Mr. Stoyan Ganev  for the success he achieved during thatsession. We extend to him and to the friendly country ofBulgaria all best wishes for progress and prosperity.I wish also to welcome the new Member States thathave joined our international Organization. It is our hopethat they will make a contribution to the work of the UnitedNations with their active input.The end of the cold war has faced the internationalcommunity with immense challenges and substantivequestions most of which have remained without satisfactoryanswers while others have been left to the judgement ofhistory and to the vagaries of time. It has become clear tomany people in various parts of the world that facing up tothese new challenges has not been an easy task for anyindividual country  regardless of its power or wisdom.The international climate has been rendered yet morecomplex and difficult by the reactions of those who haveconsidered themselves to be the victors of the cold war.Their reactions have reflected their narrow short-terminterests rather than the elements of the new reality whichwould have served better both their long-term interests andthose of other countries - or which  in the very least  wouldnot have done harm to those interests.This is one of the basic reasons which  to date  haveprevented the emergence of a new world order. It was notreasonable to expect the countries and peoples of the worldto support a system in which they have no say and fromwhich they have no tangible expectations. This mightexplain why from one day to the next and year after yearthere has been less talk and lower expectations of theemergence of a new world order on the ruins of the oldorder.On today’s international scene we see little constructionand few new breakthroughs; we see many ruins  much chaosand numerous unanswered questions. Has the world oftoday become more secure and stable? Have the causes ofsocial tension and the many forms of regional conflictreceded? Has the number of refugees and displaced personsdecreased? And has the life of ordinary people in the South and even in the North  grown more prosperous orcomfortable?These are legitimate questions  but detailing the answersbefore this Assembly will not be a source of joy or comfortto many of us  especially in view of conflagrations invarious parts of the world which warn of increased humansuffering  ranging from killing and deportation to ""ethniccleansing""  and real hunger. Of such things  world publicopinion knows but very little. Suffice it to say that thenumber of conflicts which figure on the agenda of theUnited Nations is far smaller than those which are queuingup in the wings.When we say this  however  we do not wish to give theimpression  by such a graphic objective description of thenew international situation  that the past was better than thepresent. Far from it. For such is not the logic of mycountry  Syria. Nor is it the logic of life  itself which  webelieve  tends to move towards the better  inevitably and asa matter of necessity  even if it sometimes stumbles here andthere or appears to be static at certain times.Our real aim in describing the post-cold-warinternational situation is to attempt a serious assessment that we truly believe  we share with many other countries whichaspire to correct the course of international relations in boththe political and the economic spheres  in order to makethem more democratic and equitable.In this context  we find no better framework than theUnited Nations to promote international dialogue andcooperation. In order for such dialogue to have positive andfruitful results in the interest of all concerned  it is necessaryto introduce democratic reforms that would restructure thedecision-making process in the Organization so that it mayreflect the views of the majority. It is not reasonable  forinstance  to allow the United Nations machinery to bemanipulated  sometimes  in order to intervene in the internal18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionaffairs of countries under one pretext or another  before theMember States themselves are given the chance to introducethe necessary reforms that would restructure the UnitedNations in such a way as to guarantee equitablerepresentation in its main organs and prevent the use ofselectivity and double standards in addressing the issues thatare of vital importance to Member States.But how can the majority of Member States expect thatsuch needed reforms of the structure of the United Nationswould be introduced at a time when some countries thatpride in ending the cold war resort to launching covert andovert cold wars against countries which would preserve theirindependence and stand up for their national sovereignty?We feel it is our duty to draw attention to the fact thatfailure to introduce the required reforms will render theUnited Nations incapable of addressing the regional conflictsthat multiply daily. It is to be feared is that the importantrole of this international Organization might change in thecourse of time to one of dealing with the problems of tensof thousands of United Nations soldiers entrusted with themission of preserving a lost peace. This would drain theOrganization’s resources and distract it from the many taskswith which it is entrusted.The multifarious feelings of concern prevailing amongmost peoples in the world  particularly in developingcountries  are deeper than might at first be apparent. We  asArabs and Muslims  might well have become more sensitivethan others recently regarding what seems to be designed toundermine our interests and distort our history  which during its most glorious phase  was never racial oraggressive towards other peoples and religions. Rather  itwas humane and civilized  as all objective Western historiansattest.We have the right to wonder about the reasons behindthe ongoing unjust campaign against the Arabs and Muslims who are slandered merely because some individuals haveallegedly committed a terrorist act against Western targets while not a word is uttered against those who are trulyresponsible for terroristic acts against thousands of Arabvictims both in the occupied territories and southernLebanon. The time has indeed come for an awakening ofthe Western conscience and for addressing objectively thesensitive issues which affect the dignity of peoples and thesovereignty of States. The objectivity of the strong cannotpossibly be interpreted or understood  by any ethicalstandard  as a concession offered to the other party. Ratherit often promotes the strong’s status and prestige.It is well known to everyone in the world that theArab-Israeli conflict is one of the oldest  most complex andmost dangerous conflicts in the world. That is why theUnited Nations has been seized of it since it first started. Itis also no secret to anyone who follows developments in theregion that Syria  under the leadership of President Hafez alAssad  maintained for 20 years its deeply rooted belief in thenecessity of establishing a just and comprehensive peace inthe region on the basis of United Nations resolutions andinternational legality.Although many peace initiatives were put forwardduring the 1970s and 1980s in an attempt to address theArab-Israeli conflict  Syria objected to those initiatives onlybecause the solutions they proposed lackedcomprehensiveness and because they ignored participation bythe Palestinians and lacked the guarantees that wouldsafeguard their national rights. Once it received Americanguarantees for the participation of the Palestinians and acomprehensive solution on all fronts in accordance withSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425(1978) and the land-for-peace formula  Syria has played apositive and fundamental role in the long and arduousnegotiations with the United States over the convening of apeace Conference in Madrid.By responding positively to the American initiative Syria  as the whole world has acknowledged  made theconvening of a peace Conference possible. In so doing Syria acted on the basic of its deep conviction that  or orderfor peace to be acceptable to our peoples  it has to be a just comprehensive peace that would result in returning return allthe Arab occupied territories and ensuring stability andsecurity for the whole region. Without such elements  peacecan neither survive nor become a true and stable peace inwhich and with which the people of the region can coexist.For any peace to receive broad and continued popularsupport  it must be honourable for us as well as for theothers. The sons and mothers of our martyrs must feel thattheir dear ones who fell in the battlefields also contributedto establishing this peace on the basis of right and justice and that with their sacrifices and blood they saved the nationfrom being forced to capitulate.Syria  which consistently believed in a just andcomprehensive peace and demonstrated its earnestness anddetermination to reach such peace through the Washingtontalks and the constant coordination with the Arab parties andco-sponsors  is  in fact  more serious and keen in its effortsto achieve peace than those who deviated from the path ofArab coordination and through their unilateral signingopened the doors of the region to all kinds of options.Forty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 19Unless serious and urgent efforts are made to achievesubstantive and tangible progress on the Syrian andLebanese tracks  peace might be the weakest of thoseoptions.We in Syria do not exaggerate the value of thisPalestinian-Israeli agreement because each and every one ofits provisions needs new negotiations. At the same time  wedo not underestimate its probable repercussions  especiallyon the Palestinian arena  where it has created sharpdivisions. Regardless of all this  however  we think that themost serious threat the peace process faces lies in Israel’sattempts to give the impression that the signing of thisagreement has achieved peace in the region  and that theinternational community  and particularly Arab countries must behave accordingly.The judgement of history on the Palestinian-Israeliagreement since the secret Oslo talks has become theresponsibility of the Palestinian people and their institutions.No one should think that Syria is going to obstruct thisagreement  nor does Syria need to do so. But at the sametime  no one should expect that Syria is going to prevent thePalestinians from criticizing the agreement  while the IsraeliPrime Minister has not been able to prevent Israeliopposition from doing so despite his repeated assurances thathe has made no concession to the Palestinians.Yet in spite of all this  Israel still claims that it needsenough time to digest the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in ablatant attempt to evade the serious follow-up of the peaceprocess launched in Madrid two years ago. In the meantime the international community  the United States at the fore has seen the necessity of capitalizing on the momentumgenerated by this agreement to continue the peace process onother tracks  particularly on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.The Arab States have also stressed  in the communiquéissued at the meeting of their Foreign Ministers in Cairo on20 September 1993  that this first step:""must be completed by urgent steps on all tracks andmust guarantee the withdrawal of Israel from all theoccupied Syrian Golan and from the Lebanese lands ...for the Arab League Council believes that  for peace inthe Middle East to be lasting  it has to be just andcomprehensive and must be based on Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978) andon international legality.""Peace cannot be built on lands under occupation  norcan it be achieved through the usurpation of the rights ofothers. Those who are trying to make people believe thatthe Middle East has suddenly been transformed into an oasisof peace and prosperity know better than anyone that peace stability and prosperity cannot possibly coexist withoccupation  arrogance and the denial of the rights of others.It is about time Israel stopped misleading world opinionand portraying itself as a victim. Is it reasonable that acountry should continue to claim that it is the victim whileit continues to produce and stockpile the most sophisticatedof weapons  including all kinds of weapons ofmass-destruction  and continues to occupy the lands of othersby force  in defiance of United Nations resolutions?My country  Syria  which declares its positions candidlyand clearly to the whole world without fear of blame  willnot give up an inch of its occupied territories. It iscommitted to continuing the peace process in earnest and isalso committed to doing all that is required of it incompliance with Security Council resolutions 242 (167) and338 (1973)  as well as the ""land for peace"" formula. Syriawill also continue to work with the co-sponsors of the peaceprocess with a view to achieving a genuine  just andcomprehensive peace so that the Middle East may indeedbecome an oasis of peace  stability and prosperity."
"156",6697,"TCD",48,1993,"It is both an honour and a pleasure for me to extend torepresentatives the warm greetings of the people of Chadand to express their sincere wishes for peace.Before conveying to Members the message of theTransition Government of the Republic of Chad  I shouldlike to extend to you  Sir  my delegation’s congratulations onyour election as President of the General Assembly at itsforty-eighth session. I assure you that  in the discharge ofthis difficult task  you will have the ready and fullcooperation of my delegation.I should like also to express to your predecessor Mr. Stoyan Ganev  our gratitude for the dedication withwhich he conducted the work of the General Assembly at itsforty-seventh session.Our thanks go also to our dynamic Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his continuing commendableand tireless efforts in the cause of peace and developmentthroughout the world.4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionIt is also a pleasure to welcome the delegations of theCzech Republic  Slovakia  The Former Yugoslav Republicof Macedonia  Eritrea  the Principality of Andorra and thePrincipality of Monaco.The forty-eighth session of the General Assembly isbeginning at a time when clear hopes for peace in certainregions are emerging  yet war continues to causeunspeakable suffering elsewhere. Misery is increasingthroughout the world  and the gap between the richest andthe poorest continues to widen. Given these problems  theUnited Nations is increasingly called upon for assistance.Consequently  its capacity to react and to intervene isreduced.Concerted action by people of good will who lovepeace and freedom and who work to reduce poverty andmisery and to advance democracy and human rights couldhelp to limit the number of calls for assistance that are nowbeing made on this Organization.Within this framework  Chad set out on the road todemocracy in 1990. This deliberate choice was made in thelight of the recent history of our country and the profoundaspirations of our people to peace and social well-being. Inthis regard  the Sovereign National Conference that was heldfrom 15 January to 7 April 1993  and brought togethernearly 1 000 delegates from all regions and all social strataof the country  enabled us to lay the basis for theestablishment of stable democratic institutions and to ensurelasting peace and good management of the country’s affairs.This National Conference  which instilled much hope in thehearts of the citizens of Chad  took the following steps inimplementation of the Transitional Constitution: thePresident of the Republic  who is the guarantor of nationalsovereignty  was confirmed in office; the Prime Minister who is the elected Head of Government  was put in chargeof implementing the programme of action; the SupremeCouncil of Transition  the elected legislative body  was putin charge of follow-up action in connection withimplementing the programme of action and was given thejob of providing arbitration in the case of any disputesoccurring during the transition.The National Conference intended  through thisrestructuring process  to give new direction to public life inChad  providing transparent administration in public affairs full freedom of the press and scrupulous respect for humanrights. These indispensable corollaries of any democraticsystem are among the major concerns of the delegates.Here  the Supreme Council for Communication and theNational Commission on Human Rights  which will beestablished soon  will guarantee freedom of the press and thefundamental rights of citizens.For all the participants in the National Conference  asfor all the people of Chad  the time has come to make peace to seek new solutions to the country’s problems  so that itwill be possible to achieve genuine national reconciliationamong all the sons of Chad. The Transition Government which I have the signal honour of heading  is makingsustained efforts to realize these objectives. Thus  it istrying to create the conditions necessary to the building ofconfidence among the people in the future of their country.The restructuring of the national army of Chad that isnow taking place will eventually open the way to bettercontrol of public expenditure and will make possible thechannelling of the country’s limited resources into the mostproductive sectors. Nor can any democratization beundertaken and made stable without security services capableof ensuring respect for the territorial integrity of the country.Above all  there is a need for a disciplined army thatrespects the Constitution of the Republic.My Government lacks the financial and other materialmeans to succeed in this transformation of the national armyof Chad. First and foremost we need to encourage elementsof the army from the outset by financing projects formilitary reconversion and for reintegration into civilian life.In that connection  we warmly thank the French Republic forits assistance over the past three years. I wish also to renewour appeal to all countries that wish Chad to be genuinelytransformed to help us with all possible assistance in thisdifficult task.Beyond the question of the success of thedemobilization operation is the question of the future ofdemocracy in Chad. Our democracy will be unable towithstand for long the many pressures resulting from all thevarious problems besetting our country.Hence  my country is working tirelessly to concludeagreements of reconciliation with the remaining oppositionpolitico-military organizations. My Government isdeveloping initiatives in the area of human rights  bolsteringfreedom of the press and establishing political parties andcivic organizations. Despite that progress  cases of humanrights violations continue in my country. This proves  ifproof were needed  that it takes time to change ways ofthinking  no matter what the clear will of the highestnational authorities may be.Forty-eighth session - 8 October l993 5There is no lack of obstacles for any young democracy.As it is said  democracy  poverty and insecurity are not goodneighbours. At the forty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly  my delegation drew attention to my country’sprecarious economic situation. Apart from problems linkedto uneven rainfall over our territory  to the threat of locustsand to fluctuations in the world economic situation  oureconomy is experiencing difficulties linked to pooradministration. The resources of the State are insufficient topay salaries and growing military expenditures. There is noguarantee that we will be able to afford the cost of materialsand State contributions for investment in priority projectsrelating to infrastructure  health and education.The basic imbalances that characterize financialmanagement in Chad - which explain the continueddeterioration of our country’s social fabric - reflect those inother Central African economies covered by the CentralAfrican Customs and Economic Union (CACEU). Thosecountries had achieved notable growth in 1985  but sincethen have been in an unprecedented crisis. In thecircumstances  my country - current Chairman of theCACEU Council of Heads of State - fully subscribes to theplan for subregional adjustment and economic recoverydrawn up by the Central African States Development Bank and hopes to benefit from the greater understanding andsupport of the international community. That support willgive our Government a sound basis on which to implement as it has declared its wish to do  a consistent programme ofmacroeconomic adjustment and structural reform  with thesupport of bilateral and multilateral donors.Already we can say that the major thrust of the reformswill be in the areas of improved public financing  theresumption of productive activities through reductions in thecost of the elements of production  rationalization ofmanagement  elimination of arrears in State debt  thepromotion of a well-functioning private sector  and theimplementation of monetary  fiscal  customs and institutionalmeasures drawn up within the subregional framework ofCACEU and the customs zone.My country  which has experienced the throes of war cannot remain insensitive to the many conflicts that aretearing today’s world apart  claiming innocent liveseverywhere. In Africa  we are concerned at the exacerbationof the situation in Somalia and Angola. Chad hopes that thefirm position adopted by the United Nations on those twoconflicts will help make those most responsible for thetragedies respect agreements they have signed.With respect to Mozambique  we are following withinterest the peace process under way in that country  and weurge the two parties to cooperate fully and in astraightforward way to achieve peace. We also welcome thepeace process that has begun in Rwanda  Liberia and SouthAfrica  where in the months to come multiparty negotiationswill lead to general elections  which we hope will be freeand transparent.In the Middle East  the signature of a declaration ofprinciples on Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho andmutual recognition by the Palestine Liberation Organizationand the State of Israel give us hope that the peoples of thatregion will at last be able to live in peace. Dialogue andcooperation should guide future relations among the peoplesof the region.Chad is convinced that only dialogue can restore peaceto Central and Eastern Europe; we fully subscribe to theaction taken by the international community to bring abouta just and peaceful settlement of all the conflicts ragingthere.Today’s world economy is characterized by a structuralcrisis in the developed countries and by increasingly delayeddevelopment in the developing countries  particularly thoseof Africa. My country welcomes the convening of theinternational conference on African development  which isnow under way on the initiative of the Government of Japan.We hope that the results of that meeting will be positive forAfrica. On behalf of my Government  I convey deepgratitude to the Japanese Government for its initiative.My delegation hopes that the restructuring andrevitalization of the economic and social structure of theUnited Nations will contribute to strengthening theOrganization’s capacity to act.My delegation reaffirms its strong conviction that onlydialogue and cooperation will enable us to overcome thenumerous obstacles to the establishment of peace andharmony among peoples.It is in that spirit that my country has appealed to theInternational Court of Justice to settle its border dispute withthe Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Both partieshave committed themselves to respect the judgment.Members will know from my remarks that my countryis passing from a long  dark night of instability  dictatorship human rights violations and economic set-backs. They willalso know that the heroic struggle of the people of Chad has6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionled it onto the path of democracy; we want at all costs tostay on that road. My delegation affirms that forcefully.My people earnestly desires to make achievementsleading to a major recovery in its political  economic andsocial situation  and has adopted an ambitious programme ofchange  which we did not have the means to implement fullyin the six months remaining in the transition period. As theytirelessly pursue implementation  my country’s officialsintend to focus all their efforts on certain pivotal objectives which I shall enumerate now.First  we must ensure unswerving respect for humanrights by guaranteeing the security of citizens; we mustensure freedom of communication  along with all individualfreedoms and  above all  respect for the value of human life.We must banish the concept of impunity from our judicialsystem. To that end  and to ensure the safety of our citizensthrough a major reorganization of the police  we requiresupport from the international community both in devisingthe action to be taken and in providing the means to do so.My Government’s second objective is the holding offree  open and democratic elections.The social crisis we have just described is creatinginextricable problems for my Government  problems withserious and pressing implications. A country cannot begoverned when there is constant pressure from the streets nor can decisive efforts be focused on carrying out economicrecovery if there is not a Government elected on the basis ofa programme containing needed beneficial measures and ifit does not have the support - or at least the understanding -of the people with regard to an economic and social plan.Thus  our Government intends to work on preparing for andholding free  open and democratic elections within the time-frame set out in the recommendations of the SovereignNational Conference. Here too  and above all  we will needthe support of the international community.On that note  in evoking the basic aspiration of mypeople  I shall leave this rostrum today  having transmittedmy country’s message of peace to the internationalcommunity. Our aspiration to democratic change is  I feel realistic and its implementation is  I believe  inevitable.Long live peace and dialogue between peoples!"

I should also like to reiterate to him our verysincere gratitude for his constant and tireless efforts toenhance the effectiveness of the Organization  particularly inthe field of peace-keeping and the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. The firm determination hehas displayed in the restructuring of the United Nations tobetter adapt it to present-day realities has also won ouradmiration.Our Organization is growing steadily  bringing us evercloser to the goal of universality envisaged in the Charter ofSan Francisco. Togo bids welcome to the new Membersthat have joined the Organization this year  and we expressto them our willingness to work in concert with them inbuilding a world of greater justice and solidarity.The prevailing situation in the world today does not liveup to the expectations engendered by the changes thatForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 25took place at the beginning of this decade. The hope ofuniversal renewal characterized by the building of a worldof peace  prosperity and justice  marked by reliable solidarityand more active cooperation among nations  has been slowin taking concrete form.The grim picture seen in the tragedies unfolding beforeour eyes in Somalia  Liberia  Angola  Bosnia andHerzegovina and elsewhere  as well as the persistence of theinternational economic crisis  leads one to believe that thefuture of the world is not as rosy as we had hoped. Thenew order is still rather nebulous.Nevertheless  we welcome the growing involvement ofthe Organization in settling the various crises facing theworld. This bears witness to its new vitality and reflects thegrowing confidence that Member States place in multilateralcooperation.A year ago we noted from this same rostrum theupheavals that had occurred in recent years throughout theworld  particularly in Europe  Asia and Africa. Those signsof the times were then said to exemplify the determinationof peoples to gain more freedom and full participation in themanagement of political affairs.Today  more than ever before  those peoples are stillsearching for that era of freedom  peace and justice that onlydemocracy  stripped of all disguise and based on clearlyunderstood and assimilated multi-party systems  can providethem  with the support of the international community though without the need to yield to the temptation ofimposing a uniform model.This emancipation movement  to which the Africanpeoples did not hesitate to adhere  has met with differentfortunes in its various manifestations. While in certaincountries the transition towards democracy has unfoldedsomewhat smoothly and has made it possible to bring aboutgenuine changes  in others the process has hardly achievedthe objectives so earnestly desired. This is true in somecountries of the African continent that  because of a lack ofunderstanding between the various players  face enormousdifficulties that rend the fabric of society. Because of thislack of understanding  the aspiration of the African peoplesto more freedom and democracy  though a legitimate one has unfortunately given rise here and there to a new type ofproblem  on top of the continent’s usual troubles.It is unfortunate that my country  Togo  has surely paida heavier price than others in the ineluctable march towardsdemocratization. Indeed  no one can know the pain andsorrow of our people’s path in its progress towardsdemocracy. Many difficulties arising from seriousmisunderstandings between the players in national politicallife regarding what democratization involves have dealt aheavy blow to the democratic process  which we had allhoped with all our hearts would be a peaceful one. This hasled to a rare outbreak of political violence  which hasravaged the whole of the national territory  unleashed seriousdisruptions in the nation and displaced populations.In the face of this worrisome situation that wasthreatening national cohesion  the Government  anxious to doeverything it could to bring the transition to culmination asquickly as possible  has made numerous efforts to find asolution to the political crisis in which our country wasplunged. In this spirit  it has done everything it can tocombat violence and insecurity by deploying the publicsecurity forces in order to ensure  throughout the territory the peace and order that are indispensable for the freemovement of peoples and goods and the proper conduct ofsocial  economic and political activity before  during andafter the electoral consultations.However  I hardly think it necessary to go on at greatlength on this situation  because we were offered the meansof a solution  and we did not fail to seize it. Thus  thepeople of Togo have regained the hope and calm they soneeded in order to regain their confidence.The elections of last 25 August - which were held  byand large  in a calm and serene atmosphere and transparencyand in the presence of international observers - allowed ourpeople democratically to appoint the first President of theFourth Togolese Republic. Re-elected with a large majorityof the votes cast  the outgoing President  General GnassingbéEyadema  set as his main task to work tirelessly  in fullrespect of human rights  for national reconciliation and therecovery of the country’s economy  ruined by more than twoyears of turbulent transition. He therefore called upon thesons of the nation to start with a clean slate  to forgivethemselves and unite in the struggle for the democraticprocess and the restoration of the country  in the interests ofall. Certainly  some problems remain  but such problems areinherent to any apprenticeship. It is thus possible now tohope that Togo will be restored to its former health.26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionIn this connection  I am pleased to point out that  withregard to the forthcoming legislative elections  theGovernment has already taken steps to resolve all thetechnical problems connected with the organization of theelections so as to ensure that they are held in the greatestpossible transparency. Aware that democracy requires thecooperation of all in the management of the polity’s affairs the Government intends to spare no effort to ensure theopposition’s participation in the forthcoming legislativeelections.Our delegation should emphasize here the very usefulrole played by friendly countries in the search for asuccessful solution to the crisis in our country. I thereforetake the opportunity to thank from this rostrum all thosewho  from near or far  contributed to our achievement of thatresult. Our feelings of deep gratitude go out particularly tothe people  the Government and the Head of State ofBurkina Faso  Mr. Blaise Compaoré  who applied all theirtalents to bring about that which  several months earlier  stillseemed impossible: bring our Togolese brothers around anegotiating table and lead them to reach agreement.I also wish to welcome the sustained action undertakenby France  the Federal Republic of Germany and the UnitedStates of America  whose mediation contributed to thefavourable outcome of the initiatives. My Government isparticularly grateful to the United Nations and to theOrganization of African Unity  whose observers in the fieldmade a very valuable contribution to the proper holding ofthe elections of 25 August 1993. It is to be hoped that theresult of this process will be the restoration of nationalcohesion  allowing the Togolese henceforth to enjoy theirrights fully and in all tranquillity  including their right tofundamental freedoms and to development.The World Conference on Human Rights  held inVienna from 14 to 25 June 1993  seems to have been aneffort to produce international consensus on the furtherpromotion  protection and defence of human rights. Thatmeeting enshrined the axiom  henceforth shared by all  thatdevelopment  democracy and human rights form anindissociable triad.But can we speak objectively of the effective enjoymentof human rights in the case of a population whose standardsof living are below the necessary minimum? The rights tofood  education and adequate health care are in fact deniedto the citizens of our developing countries  above all becauseof an unfavourable international economic situation. Thefirst among human rights is the right to life - a decent life.Therefore  in the framework of promoting and protectinghuman rights  it is necessary to redouble efforts to help thedeveloping countries to assume their responsibility tocontribute to the full flowering of the individual.My country  which is deeply devoted to respect for thehuman person and determined to build a State of law  hasassumed as its own - by including them in its newConstitution  adopted by referendum on 27 September 1992 -the fundamental principles of democracy and those linkedto the protection and promotion of human rights. Onceagain  I should like to affirm before this Assembly that Togois firmly committed to all universal values encompassing theprotection and enjoyment of rights inherent to the humanperson. It is thus with faith and conviction that I aver thatthe difficulties of adapting national legislation tointernational norms and the various approaches available inno way detract from the duty of each State to contribute tothe tangible and irreversible progress of the cause of humanrights throughout the world.The end of the cold war and the disappearance ofideological antagonisms have not yet made it possible tousher in the genuine era of peace to which the world aspired despite the encouraging prospects these changes seemed tooffer. Indeed  narrow nationalism  religious fanaticism ethnic rivalry and hegemonism have resurfaced unfortunately plunging certain parts of the world intoturmoil.Thus  in Africa  the situation remains disquietingdespite the praiseworthy efforts of the United Nations andthe Organization of African Unity to settle the conflictsravaging the continent. In Angola  it is unfortunate that warpersists and continues to claim many victims  despite theinitiatives made to induce the belligerent brothers to laydown their arms. I express the hope that both protagonists overriding all other considerations  make as their main goalsthe re-establishment of peace and the higher interests of theAngolan people  and renounce the use of force and find afinal and negotiated solution to the conflict.In South Africa  the positive progress achieved -particularly the fixing of 27 April 1994 as the date for theholding of the first multiracial elections - clearly demonstratethat the emergence of a democratic non-racial society in thatcountry is near at hand. In that spirit  Togo welcomes theadoption in Cape Town on 23 September by the three housesof the South African Parliament of a bill instituting atransitional executive council entrusted with helping andcontrolling governmental activities up to the elections.Forty-eighth session - 4 October l993 27However  the noteworthy progress made recentlytowards the complete and final dismantling of the apartheidsystem has been unable to disguise the various acts ofviolence  aggression  confrontation and assassination thathave become daily features of South African political andsocial life. This increased violence  inspired and cunninglymaintained by groupings opposed to change  should promptthe international community to do all in its power to ensurethe irreversibility of the process under way.The Togolese Government takes note with interest ofthe appeal made on 24 September by the President of theAfrican National Congress  Mr. Nelson Mandela  for thelifting of economic sanctions against South Africa. It is ourhope that this measure will help to accelerate the democraticprocess in that country.In Somalia  the deployment of the United NationsOperation has made it possible to alleviate the suffering ofthe population. My delegation  while welcoming the effortsof the United Nations to restore normal living conditions expresses its grave concern at the enormous loss of lifeamong the civilian populations and the Blue Helmets alike.Given the present delicate situation there  it isimportant  as the Security Council unanimously urged on 22September  to redouble efforts to reach a political settlement.To that end  we cannot overemphasize the need to doeverything possible to fulfil the objectives of the UnitedNations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II)  namely  the""facilitation of humanitarian assistance and therestoration of law and order  and of nationalreconciliation in a free  democratic and sovereignSomalia ..."". (Security Council resolution 865 (1993) para. 4.)As for Liberia and Rwanda  which have for a numberof years been arenas of cruel  fratricidal upheavals  Togo ispleased to see that  thanks to the courage  farsightedness anddetermination of the parties concerned  there are finally someindications of genuine prospects for a final settlement ofthose conflicts through  respectively  the Cotonou andArusha Agreements.In the case of Liberia  in particular  my delegationwelcomes the arrangements made by the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and theUnited Nations for the implementation of the Agreement of25 July so that the people of Liberia can once again live inpeace and security and set about rebuilding their country inregained national unity.In that connection  we believe that the role to be playedby the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia(UNOMIL)  established by the Security Council on 22September of this year  will be a very decisive one.With regard to the situation in Western Sahara  Togowelcomes the efforts of the Secretary-General as set forth inhis report of 28 July 1993 (S/26185) on that question andurges him to pursue dialogue with the parties to the conflictin order to achieve implementation of the United Nationssettlement plan.There are other regions of the world in which conflictsalso demand our attention and call for further efforts on ourpart to come up with adequate solutions.In the case of the Middle East and the Israeli-Arabconflict  Togo welcomes the signing of the agreement onmutual recognition between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and hails it as an importantfirst step towards peace in the region. Today  thatagreement and the one relating to Palestinian autonomy inthe Gaza Strip and Jericho are indications that things arefinally on the right track. My country is more than everconvinced that only the final settlement of the Palestinianproblem can lead to peace in the region.True  there is still a long way to travel down the roadto peace. In reaching that goal  the protagonists  both Araband Israeli  need our material and moral support. Theconsolidation of the process that has been set in motiondepends on the international community’s ability to respondeffectively and urgently to the economic and socialdevelopment needs of the West Bank and Gaza Strip  foronly viable development can ensure lasting peace in theregion.As for the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina  Ishould like  on behalf of the Togolese Government  to repeathere our hope for the success of all the initiatives taken byall sides to end the tragedy in that country. No one in theworld can sleep peacefully in the knowledge of the anguishof the innocent victims of that conflict. To the protagonistswe say: Enough! Enough of dying! Be flexible  bereasonable.28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionFinally  with regard to Cambodia  Togo welcomes theinestimable peace-keeping efforts made by the UnitedNations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) which made it possible for free and democratic elections inthat country  under United Nations auspices  to be held inMay 1993.The various conflicts that beset the world are directlyrelated to the arms race. All countries are in duty bound toincrease their efforts to halt that race. At stake are thesurvival of mankind and national  regional and internationalpeace and security.General and complete disarmament - genuinedisarmament - for which all mankind so ardently hopes requires a substantial contribution from all Member Statesand the creation of appropriate structures. In thisconnection  the action of the United Nations in this areashould be stepped up in order that the objectives ofdisarmament can be achieved. The mission of the RegionalDisarmament Centres should be viewed in the same context.It is essential that they be made more operational byproviding them with adequate human  material and financialresources to enable them fully to discharge their duties.The effectiveness of our Organization obviouslydepends on restructuring and revitalizing it. My delegation while welcoming the efforts already exerted in thisconnection  believes that a review of the Charter is animperative need in order to enable all the organs of theUnited Nations to participate fully in the implementation ofits purposes and principles.The time has come for the Organization to hew moreclosely to the spirit of the Charter. My delegation thereforewarmly welcomes the proposals that there should be arethinking of the membership of the Security Council witha view to its expansion. In that endeavour it is importantthat serious consideration be given to equitable geographicalrepresentation of various regions so as to endow theuniversal Organization with a broader international consensusthat would provide a solid basis for its actions and make itmore dynamic  more active and more efficient.As far as relations between States are concerned  theGovernment of Togo  in keeping with its policy of openness dialogue and concerted action  firmly adheres to theprinciples of non-interference in the internal affairs of Statesand the non-use of force. Furthermore  we believe that given the present state of international relations  theOrganization should help its Members to create domesticconditions that can contribute to the elimination of tensionscapable of leading to war either within or between States.It was in that spirit that we welcomed last year thehighly pertinent recommendations formulated by theSecretary-General in his report  ""An Agenda for Peace"" which were aimed at the maintenance and restoration ofinternational peace and security. Today more than everbefore  the United Nations must strengthen its capacity tomaintain and preserve that peace and security  to ensurerespect for human rights and to promote economic and socialprogress.The economic and social gap between rich and poorcountries is growing wider by the day  and the economies ofthe developing countries  particularly the least developedamong them  are prey to chronic recession.In Africa the situation is even more tragic. The peoplesof Africa  already the victims of undernourishment  famineand all kinds of other ills  are also bearing the full brunt ofthe constant decrease in export prices  the continuousdeterioration of terms of trade  the obstacles imposed ontrade  and the burden of indebtedness.In the area of international trade  relationships are ruledby the law of the jungle. The persistence of protectionismand the adoption of Draconian measures against exportsfrom developing countries continue to hamper the effortsthey are making to achieve growth through exports.In the light of what I have just said  it is urgent for theinternational economic environment to be improved bydesigning a more open and transparent trading system. Thesystem will have to protect and support the tradingrelationships of the third world countries with theindustrialized countries and  moreover  make it possible forcountries with weak economies to come away from thesidelines and be fully integrated into the world economy.My Government therefore wishes trade liberalization tolead to the establishment of principles of fair play that wouldimpel the countries of the North to buy the South’s productsat remunerative prices. Towards this end  it is our hope thatthe multilateral negotiations of the Uruguay Round will takeinto account the concerns of the third world.The debt problem remains a source of serious concernfor the African States  which are already being sorely triedby the effects of the world economic crisis. Africa  whichForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 29is allocating more than half its income to servicing its debt as required by the structural adjustment programmes  hasbeen struggling for more than a decade now under aneconomic shock therapy that leaves it no chance of success.Unfortunately  the many initiatives that have been taken topromote our countries’ development have so far not hadpositive results  as most of them have been implementedonly half-heartedly. This is particularly true of the UnitedNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the1990s and the Paris Programme of Action for the LeastDeveloped Countries for the 1990s.In view of these considerations  my delegation wouldlike to recall that it is for the international community toadopt steps designed to alleviate the debt burden. Thesesteps should include  inter alia  writing off debt fordeveloping countries or  failing that  reducing it substantially making repayment conditions more flexible  and setting upand paying into a diversification fund to transform thecommodities sector and stimulate economic growth inAfrica. There should also be a call for a considerableincrease in official development assistance.As the 1980s were a lost decade for Africa  during the1990s the industrialized countries should agree to an increasein financial flows to the poorer countries sufficient tosupport their activities and programmes for development economic expansion and diversification  because it is ashame to see aid levels falling just when the Africancountries are making major efforts to promote democracyand manage their economies in a sound and rigorousmanner. Of course  no one opts for democracy in theexpectation of preferential treatment  but particular attentionshould be paid to our countries  which are already shaky asa result of the general crisis that is rocking the world.Although we should stick to the rules of good economicmanagement  it would be a good thing if our countries which are already in trouble  were not forced to submit tolong-drawn-out economic therapies that are quite likely tokill their efforts to become more democratic.So  are we right to hope that the Tokyo Conference onAfrican development  which is going on right now  willmake it possible for us to drive it home to the major worldpolitical and economic players that there is a crying need tomake a massive  collective effort for African recovery because Africa’s economy has fallen into wrack and ruin?Forty-eight years after the Second World War  the world which is still characterized by an attitude  on the part of thestrong  of moral indifference and hardness of heart towardsthe weak  is still living in fear of what the next day willbring.However  despite the tough political  economic andsocial realities that all mankind is facing  we all do feel thecommonality of our peoples’ destiny and  without a doubt the relevance of the purpose and principles of ourOrganization. Thus  we must turn the upheavals since theend of the cold war to advantage by building a new worldorder based on collective security on three levels - thepolitical  the economic and the humanitarian - so as to bringabout better living conditions in greater liberty.Towards this end  the United Nations would gain bybeing reformed  made more democratic and revitalized inorder to live up to its universal vocation and take up themany challenges that a changing world is imposing on it."
"158",6788,"THA",48,1993,"On behalf of theGovernment and the people of Thailand  may I extend mywarmest congratulations to you  Sir  on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.I am confident that you will provide the Assembly with thenecessary leadership and direction in this period of systemicchange in the international order.I also wish to congratulate Mr. Stoyan Ganev ofBulgaria for having guided the forty-seventh session of theAssembly to a successful conclusion.Allow me also to express our admiration to and supportfor Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his untiringefforts in guiding the United Nations through this period when the Organization is being called upon to undertakepeace-keeping activities around the globe on a scaleunprecedented in its history. I also wish to congratulate himon his vision  so lucidly expressed in his report  ""An Agendafor Peace."" We look forward with anticipation to hisforthcoming report on an agenda for development.It is with great pleasure that we welcome  as fullMembers of the United Nations  Andorra  the CzechRepublic  Eritrea  Monaco  the former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia  and the Slovak Republic. We sincerely believethat these States’ assumption of their rightful places in thefamily of nations will further strengthen the universalcharacter of the United Nations.Before proceeding further  may I  on behalf of theGovernment and the people of Thailand  convey profoundsympathy to and express solidarity with the Government andthe people of India following the massive destruction andloss of life that resulted from the devastating earthquake lastweek.With the end of the cold war  a new spirit of friendlycooperation prevails in South-East Asia. The internationalsettlement of the Cambodian problem means that  for thefirst time in recent memory  the region is free of majorarmed conflict. With a view to constructing a new regionalorder of peace  harmony and prosperity  we the countries ofthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) areseeking to intensify various cooperative efforts amongourselves and with our neighbours and our friends outsidethe region.ASEAN was born in Bangkok more than 26 years ago when the cold war was at its height. Now  at the end of thecold war  ASEAN has attained the political and economicstanding to play a greater role in the affairs of the regionand beyond. Thailand will assume the ASEANchairmanship this year  and it looks forward to working withall concerned  both within and outside the Association  toadvance the causes of peace and prosperity in South-EastAsia.As the ASEAN member geographically closest to therest of South-East Asia  Thailand is in a unique position toserve as a bridge to our non-ASEAN neighbours. Thus  myGovernment wholeheartedly welcomes the accession by theSocialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Lao People’sDemocratic Republic to the ASEAN Treaty of Amity andCooperation  which sets the broad framework for enhancedcooperation in South-East Asia. We earnestly hope that theday is not too distant when Laos and Viet Nam  together10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionwith Cambodia  which is on the path towards rejoining theinternational community  will become full members ofASEAN.In seizing the opportunity to help to forge a newregional order of cooperative peace and common prosperity ASEAN is increasingly appreciative of the function ofmultilateral diplomacy - particularly the enhancedcooperation between ASEAN and the United Nations.For well over a decade  Cambodia has commanded theattention of the world. ASEAN and the United Nations havebeen working closely with each other to secure a durablepolitical settlement of the Cambodian problem. InCambodia  the United Nations has just undertaken one of themost comprehensive peace-keeping operations in its history.The Organization - essentially through the United NationsTransition Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) - must becongratulated for organizing the massive repatriation ofCambodian refugees from neighbouring Thailand and thecrucial elections that resulted in the creation of ademocratically elected majority Government in Cambodia thus enhancing the prospect of national reconciliation. Ishould like to express my Government’s appreciation to Mr.Yasushi Akashi  to his colleagues and to the men andwomen of UNTAC for successfully fulfilling their missionof helping to restore peace to Cambodia. Above all  ourwarmest congratulations go to the courageous Cambodianpeople themselves and  in particular  to His MajestySamdech Norodom Sihanouk for his vital role in therestoration of the Cambodian nation.Besides facilitating the return of more than 300 000Cambodians to their homeland  Thailand had cooperatedwith the United Nations from the outset. We participated inthe mine-clearing and road-building operations in westernCambodia  and  as I speak  Thailand is working closely withUNTAC in implementing the withdrawal of the remainingUNTAC personnel. Thailand will continue to participate inthe international community’s efforts to rehabilitateCambodia. To this end  we welcome the success of theInternational Conference on the Reconstruction of Cambodiathat was held in Paris in September this year. With thereturn of peace and normality to Cambodia  we are confidentthat the country will resume its rightful place in the South-East Asian family of nations. Thailand pledges its friendshipand cooperation to the newly elected Government ofCambodia as it embarks on the path of nation-building.In the post-cold-war world  the changing concept ofsecurity provides further impetus for the regional role of theUnited Nations. In the present era  security is defined in farbroader terms than in the past. In particular  thenon-military aspect of security has assumed greater urgencythan  and now takes precedence over  its military dimension.It is now seen more as a confidence-building process than asa process of either defence or deterrence. Activities to""reassure"" other parties  political dialogue and similararrangements to engender and enhance mutual understanding mutually beneficial collaborative efforts to solve commonproblems  crisis-management mechanisms and otherpreventive measures could all be subsumed under theheading of security.Such a concept of security  particularly at the regionallevel  fits in well with the preventive-diplomacy approach.This is one area in which there is potential for the UnitedNations to define its role as being to strengthen and facilitateregional cooperation and understanding.Naturally  all efforts in this regard must be undertakenwithin a multilateral framework. The collaborative agendafor preventive diplomacy would include conflict forecasting conflict avoidance or prevention  conflict management  andthe prevention of conflict escalation. In this regard  myGovernment welcomes the Secretary-General’s excellent andcomprehensive report ""An Agenda for Peace""  whichrepresents new thinking and an innovative approach tostrengthening the role of the United Nations. Moreover  myGovernment is heartened by the enthusiasm that MemberStates have shown for the report. Our next step must be fulland speedy implementation of the recommendations putforward in the report  as well as those contained in variousSecurity Council documents and in General Assemblyresolution 47/120  which was adopted at the last session.A mature and self-confident ASEAN is in a singularposition to enhance the role and effectiveness of the UnitedNations in South-East Asia - particularly in the areas ofpreventive diplomacy  peacemaking  peace-keeping andpeace-building. In the aftermath of the cold war  the successof the United Nations depends very much on closecooperation with countries in target regions. Put simply  theUnited Nations needs all the help it can get. Regionalorganizations can help to identify potential conflicts and together with the United Nations  contain them before theyerupt. Cooperation between the United Nations and aregional organization with a solid track record - such asASEAN - can compensate for the weaknesses of anyorganization acting singly.To explore how best the Association of South-EastAsian Nations (ASEAN) could act in accordance with therecommendations contained in ""An Agenda for Peace"" Forty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 11Thailand has initiated and organized  in collaboration withour ASEAN partner Singapore  a series of internationalworkshops on ASEAN-United Nations cooperation for peaceand preventive diplomacy.The rationale behind this initiative is simple enough.The threat to international peace  actual or potential  oftenarises out of a certain specific region. With cold-warconstraints on United Nations regional intervention removed the Organization is in an ideal position to cooperate withASEAN to ensure peace and stability in South-East Asia.The foundation for such cooperation already exists.The ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South-EastAsia forms the basis for a new code of conduct in the regionand was endorsed by the forty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly.Other factors may also favour United Nationspreventive diplomacy in South-East Asia. One of these isthe regional presence of the major Powers. Under certaincircumstances  the United Nations provides a framework foraction by major Powers. A case in point is Japan’speace-keeping role in the region under the United NationsTransitional Authority in Cambodia. Arrangements couldthus be made for these nations to play a ""legitimate""crisis-prevention role involving  for example  politicaldialogue and mediation. Similarly  the regional economicdevelopment imperative may add impetus to United Nationsregional involvement. The Organization has long been inplace in South-East Asia in this regard. Its developmentcommitments to and development efforts in the region havebeen evident in the location there of various United Nationsregional bodies.The next step will be to work out specific functionalarrangements for ASEAN-United Nations cooperation. It isanticipated that the third and final workshop  to be held inBangkok in January 1994  will come up with suggestions onappropriate mechanisms for fostering the conditions forregional peace and prosperity through closer cooperationbetween ASEAN and the United Nations.The improved outlook for greater economic cooperationin the region is manifest in the enthusiasm for economicnetworking. Within ASEAN we have set up the ASEANFree Trade Area (AFTA) to intensify intra-ASEANeconomic cooperation and attract outside investment. Thecountries of South-East Asia are taking up the challenge offorging economic linkages through various schemes knownas ""growth triangles""  ""growth quadrangles"" and ""specialeconomic zones"". These linkages will help further promotethe spirit of friendship and cooperation and serve to providea nucleus for greater interaction with other parts of theworld.A livable world is a world in which governmentaldevelopment strategies can be implemented in a favourableinternational environment. The international economy mustprovide a supportive climate for achieving environment anddevelopment goals. Among others  we must further pursuethe liberalization of global trade policies  promote theefficient allocation of the world’s resources  make trade andenvironment mutually compatible  and provide adequatefinancial and technical resources to developing countries.These measures are prerequisites for creating a moreprosperous world  where countries share their wealth in aliberal trading system and where fair competition isguaranteed by broadly accepted rules. For this reason  myGovernment believes that an early and successful conclusionof the Uruguay Round is imperative to revitalizing worldtrade. Thailand joins our ASEAN partners in welcoming therenewed determination and commitment of the industrializedcountries at the recent Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo toresolve remaining problems and to conclude the Round bythe end of this year.Balanced world development is not only an enlightenedaim  it is the foundation for the enduring progress of allsocieties. And this should be the basis for reactivatingNorth-South cooperation. It should mark a new beginningin international development cooperation based on theprinciple of the Cartagena commitments. It must go beyondaid to embrace partnership and reciprocal responsibilities. Itmust address global and regional concerns by meeting localneeds.The global consensus reached at the Earth Summit inRio de Janeiro last year has equipped us to take collectiveaction to meet new priorities. We have built the consensusto pursue development which goes beyond economic growth.It is development in a comprehensive sense  guided byprinciples of equality and justice  and underpinned by socialand ecological responsibility. As we  the leaders  proclaimchange  we must demonstrate our political convictionthrough national policies that are in line with theinternational consensus.My Government is fully committed to theimplementation of the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development (UNCED) agreement. Ournational development plan for 1992 to 1996 reflects ourdetermination to achieve sustainable development. My12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionGovernment has taken various necessary administrative andlegal steps to integrate the environment with developmentand to implement the programme of action as reflected inAgenda 21.As my Government is the first elected Governmentfollowing the May incident of 1992  we are more keenlyaware of the intimate links between democracy development  and human rights. Hence  democratizationmust be accompanied by sustained efforts to further thecause of human dignity and freedom.Forty-five years ago  Thailand joined the internationalcommunity in adopting the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. Since then  the international community hasachieved a number of positive results in the protection andpromotion of human rights.From the time of the first International Conference onHuman Rights in Teheran in 1968  the internationalcommunity has assumed new responsibilities not only toprotect but also to promote human rights. The time hascome to work on the prevention of human rights abuses.Last June  the World Conference on Human Rights inVienna concluded with a consensus document. The ViennaDeclaration brings together views on fundamental rights  andserves as a universal basis from which the internationalcommunity will proceed. Thailand reaffirms its commitmentto and respect for human rights and fundamental freedomsas set out in the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action.The task before us now is to implement therecommendations of the Conference. In this regard  theUnited Nations has a central role to play. The Organization with the collective efforts of its Member States  muststrengthen the mechanisms for allocating sufficient humanand financial resources to carry out the activities required ofit.Before I conclude  may I emphasize that Thailand hasbeen fortunate enough to have the benefit of the guidanceand wisdom of their Majesties the King and Queen in allspheres of national life. Indeed  our monarchy has been thesymbol of national unity  a beacon of hope and the ultimatesource of strength in the hearts of all Thai people.Mr. President  let me conclude my statement bywishing you every success in your new responsibilities. Youhave a long and important session of the General Assemblyahead of you. I have no doubt that you will fulfil yourresponsibilities with great dignity and distinction."
"159",6813,"TJK",48,1993,"The year that has elapsed since the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly was noteworthy forthe further growth in the authority and the effectiveness ofthe United Nations. It testifies  in our view  to the deepunderstanding that the members of the world communityhave about the need for close  constructive cooperation inthe name of a better future. As I look around this Hall  inwhich  for the first time  a Head of State of a sovereignTajikistan is speaking  the words of the great poet Saadicome to my mind:""The sons of Man are but one bodyFor the Creator made us all from but one beginning"".Now that I find myself here  in the centre for settlingthe problems of the whole world  I should first of all like tocongratulate Mr. Samuel Insanally  the PermanentRepresentative of Guyana  on his election to the presidencyof the General Assembly. Allow me to express the hopeForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 5that this session  under your skilful leadership  Mr. President will achieve tangible  successful results for the good of allmankind. I should also like to draw attention to theexcellent work done by Mr. Stoyan Ganev  President of theGeneral Assembly at its last session; Mr. Ganev bothenergetically and effectively guided the deliberations oncomplex political problems.It is with great satisfaction that I greetMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  and express to him our sincere gratitude for histireless efforts to resolve the conflicts in various parts of theworld  not excluding my own country.The Republic of Tajikistan is taking its first steps as asubject of international law. It is with deep satisfaction thatI note that we have been granted an equal voice in thecommonwealth of nations  and we are aware that thishonourable right imposes significant duties on us.The two years of our independence  in addition tomoments that are undoubtedly positive  have also entailedthe harsh trials that my patient and peace-loving people arenow going through. It is for the historians to study the rootcauses  the reasons for the situation in Tajikistan today. Ithink that my job is to point out just one thing: those whomwe believe  on the basis of the law in force in the Republicof Tajikistan  to be guilty of unleashing civil war are guiltyof grossly violating the very foundations of any modernsociety  namely the primacy of law.As in any civil war  in the civil war in Tajikistan therecan be no victors. Our urgent task as a nation is to heal  asquickly as possible  the bloody wounds that it has inflictedon our country.The attention the community of nations is payingTajikistan is understandable. Nor should we be surprised atthe variety of opinions we hear when events in the Republicare being analysed. I should like to shed some necessarylight on a number of issues.Now that we have set out on the path of independentdevelopment  we have run up against the enormous politicaland socio-economic problems of the transitional period.Our national economy was built up as just one smallpart of the enormous economic complex of the formerUSSR  and was basically a provider of raw materials. Withthe collapse of those economic ties  our Republic has comeface to face with many almost insoluble problems. Therehas been a catastrophic drop in the standard of living  whichcould hardly fail to lead to an increase in social tension.The power struggle that developed at the same time andthe attempts to seize power illegally  by force andundemocratically  have split society apart and led to asenseless  fratricidal war. The results of this we know:thousands of broken lives  thousands of dead and wounded refugees and missing. Immeasurable political  social andeconomic harm has been done to the Republic.The internal instability has become the main reason forthe economic and political chaos  the total legal confusionand the sharp drop in production. The future of our people -the future of Tajik statehood - has been put in jeopardy.The sixteenth session of the Supreme Council of theRepublic of Tajikistan  which was held in these conditions laid fundamentally new foundations for establishing peaceand civil harmony in our country. The Supreme Council hasdecided in favour of solving all political  social andeconomic problems solely within the framework of theconstitution. A number of important laws have been adoptedthat are designed to afford citizens social protection and toreturn them to their homes and peace-time jobs.In accordance with the Constitution  we have elected aleadership for the Supreme Council and formed aGovernment. Today our society and our people havebecome aware that the highest power in the State should bethe law  and only the law.As the Head of State  I declare  from this rostrum  thatwe shall adhere to the fundamental principles of the FinalAct of the Helsinki Conference and the Paris Charter andother international instruments for the defence of law. Weare determined to carry out democratic transformations inour country and to acknowledge and respect philosophical religious  ideological and political choice as an inalienableright of the individual.Working under the constant pressure of political andsocio-economic problems  we have succeeded in a short timein removing the economic blockade from all the regions ofthe Republic and have begun rebuilding our destroyednational economy and instituting economic reforms in ordergradually to introduce a free market.From the beginning of the restoration of our Republic our Parliament has adhered to the principle of the primacyof law  and in so doing has passed a number of measures while the Presidium of the Supreme Council has laid down6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionthree special decrees on amnesty. Does not this show thatwe are acting to resolve through political means theproblems that have accumulated in our country? We areprepared for dialogue with all the social forces in ourcountry to achieve national reconciliation  civil harmony andstability in Tajikistan.We would like to cooperate constructively with forcesof any political orientation acting within the framework ofexisting law and respecting generally accepted principles ofdemocracy. I would like to inform the world communitythat Tajikistan is actively working to improve its electionlaws and to prepare a draft new Constitution in whichmaximum attention will be given to all problems related toguaranteeing and protecting inalienable human rights.In terms of settling our domestic political problems  weare seriously concerned over the attempts at regionalizationof the internal conflict in Tajikistan  a conflict which is stillgoing on in a number of areas along the Tajik-Afghanborder. The outbreak of the conflict this summer broughtdozens of deaths.Allow me briefly to tell the Assembly my view of theessential reasons for the tensions along and inside the border.Everyone knows that until recently Tajikistan had beensystematically subjected to unprovoked acts of armedintervention from the territory of a neighbouring country.Naturally  we understand its internal difficulties related toestablishing a centralized State administration. But factscannot be denied  and we have now been faced with theneed seriously to deal with the question of self-defence.We are not hatching any hostile plan with regard toAfghanistan. The measures which we have taken and aretaken to strengthen the defence of our border - which is alsoa border of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) -do not go beyond what is laid down in Article 51 of theUnited Nations Charter and are fully in keeping withgenerally accepted norms of international relations.But this  of course  does not mean that that is the onlyway to solve the problem. And here we are encouraged bythe notable speed-up in the negotiating process with theauthorities in Kabul. We have achieved a number ofpositive agreements on a broad spectrum of questions including normalizing the situation along the Tajik-Afghanborder. We think that a permanent  substantive dialoguewith the leadership of the Islamic State of Afghanistan willhelp us remove some other well-known irritants.It is most unfortunate that huge resources are still beingspent to support destructive elements based on the territoryof Afghanistan. Having gone there from Tajikistan  they are with the help of extremist groups and the forces ofinternational terrorism  hatching plans forcibly to change theState structure in our country. A legitimate question arises:is it not wiser to use these resources to build rather than todestroy?Another of our problems is that of the Tajik refugees inAfghanistan. There are many versions of how they ended upon the territory of Afghanistan  but that is not the mainpoint  which is that they should return to their homeland asquickly as possible. We express our sincere thanks to theAdministration of Afghanistan and to the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees  who are giving seriousattention to those people. As of the middle of September more than 35 000 Tajik refugees - more than half the total -had returned to their permanent homes from Afghanistan.We hope that the process of voluntary return will continueand that with the support of the authorities of Afghanistanand of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees we shall in the near future be able to put an end once andfor all to this painful question.We have already completed our preparation for signinga trilateral agreement between Tajikistan  Afghanistan andthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Wehope that the agreement will be signed as soon as possible.From this United Nations rostrum  I should like to sayone more thing in this regard. We are firmly convinced thatthe support of the Administration of Afghanistan in effortsto restore peace to the Afghan land  which has suffered somuch  would be in the interests not only of that country butof the region and of the entire world. There was a timewhen some States spent a great deal of resources on war inAfghanistan. In my view  the time has come to help restorea peaceful life there. A restless  unstable Afghanistan is athreat - and not only to Tajikistan.Regarding our participation in the CIS  I mustemphasize that Tajikistan is in favour of strengthening theCommonwealth while observing full respect for thesovereignty and independence of its member States. In thiscontext  I should like to point out the significance of twoareas of our activities within the framework of the CIS activities which are critically important for Tajikistan. I amtalking about relations with Russia and with the CentralAsian States.Forty-eighth session - 30 September l993 7Russia  as a permanent member of the Security Council has undergone great trials in taking upon itself themaintenance of peace and stability in virtually all the spaceand territory of the former Soviet Union. Therefore  thepeoples of the former Soviet Union  including Tajikistan commend and welcome the peace-keeping efforts made byRussia.A positive role in stabilizing the situation in our countryhas been played by the brotherly support of Uzbekistan Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. Tajikistan also thanksthe United States and all the other countries of Europe andAsia that extended the hand of assistance to us duringterrible and dark days.We hope that Tajikistan will quickly be removed fromthe blacklist of conflict areas. In this respect  we count uponthe tangible assistance of the world community in restoringour national economy  which has been destroyed by war andby natural disasters. A country which is rich in naturalresources  which has an attraction in terms of its economicprospects  needs purposeful assistance in order to be reborn.Allow me to express the hope that that assistance and thatsupport will naturally  in accordance with generally acceptedprinciples in world practice  be given to my country.Tajikistan  which has gone through the horrors of acivil war  views with great concern the course of events inthe hot spots of our planet. We know of the pain andsuffering of the people of Somalia. We feel the full depthand senselessness of the tragedy of the peoples of the formerYugoslavia  the deadlocked events which have taken placein the Caucasus of the post-Soviet era. We also knowfirsthand how destructive is the force of local conflicts. Thatis why we make an urgent appeal to the world communityto multiply its efforts to end  and to prevent  that type ofconflict. We are firmly convinced that the force of arms  nomatter how threatening and frightening they may be  cannotsolve a single contentious issue.In this connection  we are seriously concerned by theuncontrolled and unsanctioned trade in arms in areas ofintense instability. Essentially  what is happening is amassive arming of entire regions. Indeed  we can imaginehow unbelievably difficult it is to take away from apopulation weapons that they have illegally obtained. Onthe basis of our own bitter experience  we loudly speak outabout the danger of that fateful trend.Today  this destructive impact on our economy hasbeen joined by another: the aspiration of a number ofcountries to acquire nuclear weapons or the technology toproduce them. As a country which has the technology formining and initially processing uranium  we categoricallyoppose the use of that priceless source of energy fornon-peaceful purposes.We state our unconditional support for theNon-Proliferation Treaty  and we hope that the conference ofthe States parties to that Treaty  scheduled for 1995  willdecide to extend it indefinitely.As the Assembly knows  the end of the cold war andbipolar confrontation gave rise to great hopes on the part ofthe peoples of the world. Unfortunately  events have not yetjustified many of these hopes. None the less  there is oneplace in the world where notable political events have beenobserved. We are deeply satisfied with the historicagreements reached between the Palestine LiberationOrganization and the State of Israel on mutual recognition.We welcome the decision of the United States ofAmerica to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization and we commend that great country for its role in supportingpeace and stability on earth.The questions which the General Assembly will bediscussing at its forty-eighth session show that there is nowan onward rush towards the interdependence of nations. InTajikistan we are convinced of this.We commend the peace-keeping and humanitarianefforts of the United Nations. We are especially proud ofTajikistan’s initiative to include institutions of theCommonwealth of Nations in the broad peace-keepingactivities on the territory of our country; that initiative hasnot been ignored.The mandate for the presence in Tajikistan of theSpecial Envoy of the Secretary-General  Mr. Ismat Kittani has been extended. The Republic has fruitfully worked withthe United Nations Observer Mission  the representative ofthe High Commissioner for Refugees  and the representativesof other international non-governmental organizations.Our special gratitude goes to the Security Council ofthe United Nations  which constantly monitors developmentsin the situation in and around Tajikistan. We sincerely hopethat the efforts of the community of nations will beincreasingly focused on ensuring the conditions forsustainable development.8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionWe wholeheartedly support the principles andrecommendations of Agenda 21. We feel that accomplishingthat Agenda’s important goals  such as the transfer oftechnology and resources  will have a favourable impact ondisaster areas such as the Aral Sea and areas of greatpoverty.In conclusion  I would like to assure the Assembly thatmy people  who have now embarked upon establishing theirown statehood and have overcome considerable difficultiesin so doing  look to the future with a feeling of great and  Ihope  justified optimism.We will spare no effort  we shall use all our energy  inbuilding a genuinely legal  democratic and enlightened Statewhich will not fail to take a worthy place among thecivilized countries of the world."
"160",6837,"TKM",48,1993,"First of all  I should like to congratulate thePresident on his assumption of his important post at theforty-eighth session of the General Assembly.I should also like to express my gratitude for making itpossible for me to comply with the instructions of thePresident of Turkmenistan  Mr. Niyazov  and the entireTurkmen population in speaking to the world community.A unique situation prevails in the world today. There are nolonger two inimical camps  and we virtually have eliminatedthe most pressing problem of global nuclear conflict.Furthermore  ridding ourselves of the ideological yoke hasfreed us from internal conflicts and contradictions. Aspolitical scientists said after the end of the standoff betweenthe two blocs  we now have on the world agenda urgentproblems - new and bloody regional and internal conflicts which are no less dangerous to the world than a globalconfrontation.What are the reasons for this seemingly unfathomableoutbreak of aggressiveness and conflict? In our view  theanswer to this question can be found in the lack of politicalpragmatism and in a failure to understand realities. One ofForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 25the major reasons is the lack of a deep-seated politicalculture and of restraint  and the desire to do everything atonce. But there are no miracles. We need political courage which has been demonstrated by the President ofTurkmenistan  in order to avoid the pitfalls of unrealisticdecisions  something which might  to put it mildly  lead tosocial disappointment.From the very first days of our independent existence Turkmenistan found itself faced with a whole series ofdifficult and unique problems  which were determined by thespecial characteristics of its attaining statehood. Proclaimingits sovereignty and independence is only the starting-pointfor a lengthy process which is to lead to the establishmentof an efficient political system  a strong national economyand a workable social structure. For this  we needessentially not just reforms but a full reorientation of thepolitical system and of the economy. I should like toemphasize especially this aspect  since at the same time verydifficult reforms will be needed in other areas as well.The natural economic and social development of ourpeople was interrupted for seven long decades. As a result people lost the notion of private property  and their ways ofthinking and social morals became out of touch. This is animportant aspect  and we should bear this mind inestablishing new States on a new legal basis.At the present time  the most important possessions ofall the citizens of Turkmenistan are independence and theopportunity to solve their problems independently. Perhapsthis would seem to be axiomatic  but as we see it  of theentire system of priorities formulated by the Government ofour country  this is the most desirable in the currentcircumstances prevailing in Turkmenistan and in the area.In order to achieve large-scale reforms of the politicaland economic system in Turkmenistan  a programme of ""10years of stability"" has been adopted. What are the tasks ofthat programme? First and foremost  to wean the economyaway from the notion of State property  in particular from afoodstuff-dominated economy and production towards theproduction of prepared products. The second is theformation of the political  economic  social  spiritual andcultural life of the State  without the infamous system -inherited from the past - of roles played out in advance.Thirdly is the formation and development of democraticinstitutions  including a multi-party system. Against thebackground of these processes  we see social psychologytransformed  away from political apathy and the lack ofresponsibility.In this regard  we are trying to pursue our policy insuch a way that we would strengthen our ability to avoidsocial upheaval  breakdowns in all sectors of society and thelack of social harmony. This is not easy. The people ofTurkmenistan need unity and solidarity. This gives us hopefor the future  however. Pragmatism will be a determinantin overcoming our difficulties in establishing the majorcriteria for Turkmenistan’s current foreign policy. In solvingthese economic problems  we are offering to our foreignpartners businesslike cooperation without any ideological orpolitical passions  and we have found understandingeverywhere. The logical outcome of this development hasled us to the formulation of a foreign-policy concept ofpositive neutrality  which is in keeping with the nationalinterests of our State and in the interest of maintaining peaceand stability in the region.In solving military problems  we have been guided byour neutral status  which stems from the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States and therecognition of territorial integrity and the inviolability oftheir borders. It is well known that sometimes the conceptof non-interference can be questionable or even rejected.But in our view  a new independent State in Europe andAsia also needs conditions for the peaceful resolution of itsinternal problems in order to achieve civil calm and in orderto find the necessary compromises. Obviously  based onmilitary force  we cannot achieve development and progressin the broad sense of the word. And we need to move awayfrom internationalizing the internal problems of variousStates through military force. At the same time  we supportthe peace-keeping actions of the United Nations and otherinternational organizations.These are the factors that determine our view of eventsin Tajikistan. I can state that our position has found supportand understanding among other countries. We have reachedagreement with the leadership of Iran on a new agreement one of the most important conditions of which is thetransformation of the 1 500-kilometre border between Iranand Turkmenistan into a border of peace and cooperation.We are actively engaged in political dialogue with thecentral Government of Afghanistan and also with theauthorities of the northern and north-western provinces.Such a policy has brought positive results. Recently wesigned a three-party memorandum on the construction of arailroad from Turkmenistan to Pakistan through Afghanistan.In addition  Afghanistan will see the first major railroad inits history. We will make it possible  therefore  to have anoutlet to the ports of the Indian Ocean through the States ofCentral Asia and Europe.26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionSpeaking of relations with our neighbours  we mustespecially emphasize the role of Russia in the creation of anindependent Turkmenistan. We well understand that thisprocess began in Russia and was initiated by its leadership.A high degree of understanding at the level of leadershipand the traditional mutual respect of our peoples hasestablished a lasting basis for the development of mutuallyadvantageous bilateral cooperation on new and equitablebases. In speaking of this  I should like from this rostrumto state that Turkmenistan supports the efforts of theleadership of Russia to establish order and to establishconditions for the active continuation of political reforms andthe full dismantling of the totalitarian system and itsreplacement with a system chosen by the people.Turkmenistan is actively developing relations withTurkey  Austria  the United Kingdom  Indonesia  Pakistan Malaysia  Germany  France  Argentina and Italy  andconstructive dialogue with the United States is under way.President Niyazov’s recent visit to Belgium laid thegroundwork for new cooperation between Turkmenistan andthe countries of the European Community and betweenTurkmenistan and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.We are also opening a number of Turkmenistan Embassiesabroad. In short  our country is actively involved ininternational relations.We support those agreements that will lead to an endof confrontation and make possible peaceful and constructivedialogue. Among those agreements  we note withsatisfaction the recent changes in the relationship betweenIsrael and the PLO.Turkmenistan’s geopolitical situation - our country is amember of the Conference on Security and Cooperation inEurope (CSCE) and is at the same time connected by deephistorical and cultural roots to the Middle and Far East -enables us  in view of our country’s stability  to play aconstructive role in bridging the gap between two majorregions of the world.I should like to say a few words on Turkmenistan’sposition vis-à-vis the Commonwealth of Independent States.Turkmenistan is in favour of the Commonwealth  in favourof the development of integrationist processes and  while itopposed the establishment of any kind of rigid centralizedsystem in the past it is in favour of coordinating structures.In our view  the coming forth today of super-nationalformations has held back the process of independence andhas now led back to the former system of decision by force.In States that have arisen since the dissolution of the SovietUnion  we now see respect for national interests alone  andwe see only the bare beginnings of a process of inter-Staterelations on new  qualitatively different bases. Thestatehood of these countries is a difficult matter  and thisprocess must respect national specificities and social andeconomic factors. If all these factors are borne in mind  anykind of rigid coordinating structure is impossible. Attemptsartificially to impose positions and a unified model fordevelopment on new independent States cannot but workagainst sovereignty and national interests. In the finalanalysis  such an approach would lead to the establishmentof a new centre.From the very outset  Turkmenistan actively attemptedto develop relations with the countries of the Commonwealthof Independent States on the basis of bilateral relations andvarious types of agreements  in view of the fact that theCommonwealth is primarily a consultative mechanism thatgives us the opportunity to exchange ideas and experienceand to lay down programmes of action. We feel that suchan approach is more flexible and therefore more effective.Experience has shown that at this current stage - and Iemphasize  at this current stage - bilateral agreements are amore reliable basis for solving problems as they arise.We often see the example of the European Community and  supposedly  the same thing could happen in our region.To my mind  anyone who tries to achieve what the EuropeanCommunity has done over 40 years is not taking intoaccount some essential factors: the high-level starting-pointof the unification of Europe  the very different market basisof its economies and what might be called the Europeanpsychology. We have none of these factors.It is important to establish the fact that if we cannotcount on our future relations  the Commonwealth ofIndependent of States has no prospects. We in Turkmenistanbelieve  and have always believed  that a solution should befound within the framework of the Commonwealth  shouldbe adopted by consensus and should be very broad andbased primarily on economic feasibility and attractiveness.This will be only the first step  and it needs to be followedby others on a higher level of integration.But for this  the Commonwealth of Independent Statesand the countries of which it is composed need a period oftransition in order to work out acceptable approaches andadequately evaluate the existing realities. Over two years ofindependent development  we have done a great deal ofwork in establishing a legal basis for the market. We havealready established the basis and guarantees that opened upthe Turkmen market to foreign investors and enterprises. InForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 27Turkmenistan we have introduced private property including land  and we have established zones of freeeconomic development. Today we have a stable politicalsituation and social agreement. It is important that societybe psychologically prepared for new economic relations.On 1 November this year  Turkmenistan will introduceits own national monetary unit  the manat. We are in anextremely unstable monetary zone  which would meancertain limitations for Turkmenistan if we gave up oursovereignty and formed our own policy regarding prices taxation  budgeting  credit and monetary policy. Hence  ourcountry has sometimes absorbed some losses because ofcontinuing inflation and the economic crisis.All of this was conditioned by the need to introduce ourown currency. We believe that our own currency policy willbe closely linked to that of the United States dollar  and weintend to ensure  from the time we introduce it  itsconvertibility. According to prognoses of internationalexperts and our own evaluations  we have a real opportunityof doing this. The manat will be a reliable currency for theState reserves. The introduction of a national currencypolicy will hasten structural changes in the economy andbring us closer to the market.With the International Monetary Fund we have workedup a programme of structural economic changes  includinga step-by-step process. From 1 October we have begun abroad liberalization of prices  including plans to enter theworld price system and this also includes energy prices.With the introduction of the manat as our currency we arebeginning active privatization  which involves  first andforemost  the sphere of services in the area of medium-sizedand large enterprises. This is to be done by sellingenterprises at auction and distributing shares among workers.We hope to conclude the privatization process by the end of1995.I should like to point out that the privatizationprogramme has been carried out in close cooperation withthe World Bank. In addition  measures to free prices havebeen undertaken by the Government in order to free uptrade. Licensing of exports will take place with a view toobserving norms ensured through national security and theprotection of our cultural and artistic heritage. We shall alsoundertake other steps designed to promote maximumstimulation of international trade and eliminate administrativebarriers and to increase access to the market. In a time oftransition to a market economy  we intend to make theState’s role more streamlined and open and significantlyreduce its interference in economic activities.We welcome the attention the United Nationsspecialized agencies have paid us with regard to ourproblems. Despite our difficulties and the problems yet tobe solved  the Republic has achieved considerable success.Over the first six months of 1993  Turkmenistan’s nationalincome increased by 112 per cent. Such growth would nothave been achieved by many States in a similar situation.Over that same period industrial output increased by 116.9per cent  and agricultural production increased by124 per cent.The stronger our economy  the more reliable the fabricof political and social life in our State. At the same time we believe that economic development is inconceivablewithout our country’s steady development of a society inwhich the individual and his interests are regarded as themost important end. For Turkmenistan  which for 70 yearshad a totalitarian system with backward social development development of the economy remains the keystone of ourState policy. In this context  along with other forthcomingmajor international events  such as the InternationalConference on Population and Development  the FourthWorld Conference on Women  with the three objectives equality  development and peace  and the InternationalConference on Population and Development  which will dealwith problems of human beings and their need for shelter we welcome the preparations for the World Summit forSocial Development  to be held in Copenhagen in 1995 which will deal  we think  in detail with social consequencesof economic reform and restructuring as applied to countriesin transition. In the context of social problems  I should liketo point out that in 1990 we had the World Summit forChildren  which established a new basis for improving livingconditions for children the world over.The Government of Turkmenistan gives priorityattention to these endeavours. Turkmenistan joined in theConvention on the Rights of the Child and intends very soonto sign the Declaration that was adopted at that WorldSummit. We also have serious work under way for nationalprogrammes of action in order to achieve the goals outlinedin the Declaration.28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionWe share the view of the international community thatwe must rebuild the Earth’s ecology. We supportinternational cooperation in United Nations efforts in thistimely endeavour. In our view  it is sustainable developmentand balanced attention to the interests of all countries thatwill ensure the successful solution of global  regional andsubregional problems; this should accord with theconclusions of the 1992 United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development and of the Convention onclimate change.I announce before the Assembly that Turkmenistanintends to eliminate all its nuclear weapons and will continueits support for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT)  for the chemical weaponsConvention  and for the bacteriological (biological) weaponsConvention.I convey the gratitude of the President of Turkmenistan of our Government and of our people to the United Nationsfor its support and its understanding.I should also like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his tireless and innovative work.Turkmenistan wishes to state without reserve that it willhonestly and openly cooperate with all States that share itsattachment to the principles of the Organization. Ourpolicies will be based on common sense and on protectingour people’s interests. Turkmenistan  in creating ademocratic  secular State  is open to peaceful cooperationand ready to engage in broadly-based  mutually beneficialcooperation."
"161",6904,"TTO",48,1993,"It is withimmense pride that I congratulate you  Sir  on behalf of theGovernment and the people of Trinidad and Tobago  on yourunanimous election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session. Your election to thisimportant position is a tribute to the active and constructiverole played by Guyana in international affairs over the years.It is also a tribute to your own personal integrity anddiplomatic acumen. As a fellow representative of a memberState of the Caribbean Community  I am confident that youwill bring to the deliberations ahead the necessary measureof impartiality and astuteness that will be indispensable inreconciling the differing views on the many complex issuesbefore us.My delegation joins in welcoming the six newestMembers admitted into this family of nations in 1993:Andorra  the Czech Republic  Eritrea  Monaco  the SlovakRepublic and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.These new Members  all of which are relatively small  candraw some inspiration from the election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly of a representative from Guyana  thesmallest developing country in terms of population  ever toassume that position. For indeed  small States must continueto be afforded every opportunity to be full and activecontributors to the collective search for peace  security andeconomic and social advancement for all.All States  particularly the more vulnerable among us can derive much hope and encouragement from thedevelopments of September 1993  which set the course fora new relationship between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization and improved prospects for peace inthe Middle East. The historic exchange of letters ofrecognition between Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin andChairman Yasser Arafat  and the subsequent signing of thePalestinian-Israeli agreement  which extends limited interimself-government to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and inJericho in the West Bank  constitute a momentousdevelopment in the turbulent and violent history of theregion.Who among us could have anticipated that  in the midstof current growing tensions and conflicts worldwide  suchsworn enemies in the perennial theatre of conflict in theMiddle East would have conceded so much in the pursuit ofa better future? In today’s troubled times  these boldpartners in peace have renewed the faith of many the worldover in the capacity of diplomacy  political will andenlightened self-interest to overcome decades of hatred mistrust and fear. We all recognize the tremendousdifficulties and challenges ahead. Trinidad and Tobagowishes these leaders well and urges active United Nationsinvolvement in assisting all parties concerned in a smoothtransition from a state of belligerence to one of cooperationand peaceful co-existence. Given the centrality of thePalestinian question to the conflict in the Middle East  allparties need to work indefatigably to translate this initialsuccess into a comprehensive and durable peace for theregion.A similar concerted response on the part of the UnitedNations and the international community will be imperativein assisting the people of South Africa in their transition toa united  democratic  non-racial South Africa. After more than 45 years of anguished attention to the despair  sufferingand injustice in that country  the provision of token measuresof assistance would be unacceptable.If the world is to give any credence to the UnitedNations new thrust towards post-conflict peace-building  atangible commitment to the success of the transition in SouthAfrica needs to be made. We therefore join the call for anenhanced United Nations presence in South Africa  apresence that is urgently needed prior to the elections ofApril 1994. Trinidad and Tobago is taking the necessarysteps to implement the decision taken on 8 October by theAssembly to lift economic sanctions against South Africa(resolution 48/1). It is our hope that the internationalcommunity will respond positively and generously to thishistoric decision; and that it will quickly lead to theprovision of ample financial and technical assistance  as wellas to appropriate investments  that will allow a newnon-racial Government to begin redressing the graveinequalities in all aspects of life in South Africa. We alsohope that  in time  the advancement of greater economic andsocial equity in South Africa will mitigate  and eventuallyresolve  other problems that are the legacy of apartheid including the rampant and widespread violence whichthreatens the process of transformation in the country.Over the years the Government and people of Trinidadand Tobago have faithfully monitored the progress of theSouth African people on their arduous journey to this criticalpoint in their history. We have adhered assiduously to thevarious sanctions and other restrictive measures adoptedagainst South Africa by the United Nations. Within ourlimited means we have also extended a helping hand to thevictims of apartheid. Trinidad and Tobago has shared in theanguish of South Africans in their long struggle against theracist system of apartheid. We will also rejoice with themin their victory as we anxiously await the dawn of a free just  non-racial and prosperous society in South Africa.Here at the United Nations let us seek to emulate thecourage and statesmanship recently demonstrated by themajor political actors in the Middle East and South Africa.We too must seize the opportunities for peace and seek toemploy fully the machinery at our disposal in the activepursuit of a better future. Amid the growing anxieties andinsecurities pervading many societies  member States havea collective responsibility to the millions around the globewho continue to repose much faith and hope in thisOrganization and its ability to address successfully themyriad political  economic  environmental and socialproblems now confronting us all. Trinidad and Tobagotherefore joins in celebrating a reinvigorated United Nations which is seeking to have a more meaningful impact on thelives of the world’s peoples.Trinidad and Tobago applauds the heightenedinvolvement of the United Nations in the effort to restoredemocracy to Haiti and to secure the safe return of PresidentJean-Bertrand Aristide to the helm of a legitimateconstitutional government. The United Nations  with itsactive involvement in the organization of the 1990 electionsin Haiti  facilitated the free expression by the Haitian peopleof their unfulfilled dreams and yearnings for freedom and adecent standard of life. It is therefore only fitting that thisOrganization  with the consent of the legitimate governmentof Haiti  should provide maximum support to efforts toguarantee a peaceful return to democracy and nationalreconciliation in that country  without which those dreamswould not be realized.Trinidad and Tobago is concerned at the seriousdeterioration in the situation in Haiti since the welcomesigning in July of this year of the Governors IslandAgreement and the New York Pact. We deplore the flagrantviolations of human rights and the blood-letting  which mustbe stopped. We express the hope that international effortsto establish a new police force in Haiti and toprofessionalize its armed forces will lead to greaterguarantees of life and liberty in Haiti. My delegation takesthis opportunity to commend the Special Envoy for Haiti Mr. Dante Caputo  as well as the able staff of theinternational Civilian Mission in Haiti for their invaluablecontribution towards resolving the crisis.Developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina and inSomalia are among the more worrisome of those in whichthe United Nations has been involved  particularly in viewof the Organization’s inability to stem the tide of violenceand suffering. United Nations interventions in these areasare also increasingly being regarded as test cases for the newUnited Nations of the post-cold-war era.In Bosnia and Herzegovina  the horror and savagery ofthe persistent attacks on innocent civilians  particularly onthe Muslim population  have elicited entirely inadequateresponses from the international community.Notwithstanding the efforts of the United Nations ProtectionForce and the various international and non-governmentalhumanitarian organizations  thousands continue to starve  areexpelled from their homes and regions  or perish at thehands of perpetrators of genocide and ""ethnic cleansing"".Yet  despite threats of punishment on the part of the SecurityCouncil  these and other atrocities are committed withimpunity  while violent attempts to dismember the sovereignState of Bosnia and Herzegovina persist. The UnitedForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 3Nations can ill afford to fail Bosnia and Herzegovina  forthat failure will have serious repercussions in the region andbeyond  as well as repercussions for the Organization.We have also witnessed alarming developments inSomalia. In the early stages of United Nations involvementin the country it was faced with a unique combination offactors  including massive starvation and famine  widespreadviolence  the ready availability among the populace ofweaponry of varying sophistication  and a total absence ofany centralized authority. Today  with the assistance of theUnited Nations and other organizations  Somalis of good willcan be proud of the successes achieved in breaking thebackbone of the devastating famine and in makingsignificant  though limited  strides towards the restoration ofcivil government and political reconciliation.It is impossible  however  to be oblivious to the majormilitary engagements in the Somali capital of Mogadishu which have led to tragic loss of life and have seriouslyimperilled the United Nations operation in that limited area.Trinidad and Tobago deplores the vicious attacks on thepeace-keeping forces of the United Nations Operation inSomalia (UNOSOM II)  which could ultimately derail effortsto restore peace and security to the country and frustrate theattainment by the Somali people of their goals andaspirations.We also support the call for urgent steps to be taken toensure the safety and security of the tens of thousands ofmen and women who are engaged in these difficult anddangerous United Nations peace-keeping operations aroundthe world.The extent of human suffering and instability now beingexperienced as a consequence of general economicstagnation is as disconcerting and disheartening as thatvisited upon us by war and strife. Many communities are inthe midst of economic and social crisis. Poverty unemployment and crime are increasingly threatening thevery fabric of societies and are clamouring for the concertedattention of the international community. The UnitedNations must heed this call since  as stated by theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali:""social peace is as important as strategic or politicalpeace"". (A/47//277  para. 59)This issue is of utmost importance to Trinidad andTobago  which has not been spared the ravaging effects ofa decline in economic activity. The price of the singleproduct which represents the mainstay of our economy  andwhich accounts for more than 40 per cent of governmentrevenue and over 80 per cent of foreign exchange earnings has been in steady decline. This reality  and the structuraladjustment policies which have had to be implemented insupport of long-term development  have resulted in seriousdislocations in the short term. The ranks of the unemployedhave grown to approximately 20 per cent and there is anincreasing need to provide safety nets for the morevulnerable in this society at a time when governmentrevenue continues to fall.Further  Trinidad and Tobago’s very capacity to providesufficient social services to those not in a position to makethe burdensome sacrifices required of the general populationhas also been severely hampered by onerous debt-servicingpayments. These challenges which we are experiencing inTrinidad and Tobago are widely shared by other developingcountries.The same spirit of cooperation and activism which nowcharacterizes the United Nations approach to political andsecurity questions must also impel the internationalcommunity to address economic and social questions with anequal sense of urgency. The United Nations agenda fordevelopment  which the Secretary-General has beenmandated to prepare  must be given priority attention in theyear ahead. In this context  and with the aim of forging anew partnership in the quest for solutions to global economicproblems  it may be opportune to consider the convening ofa world economic summit.Trinidad and Tobago is of the view that the UnitedNations agenda for development should not be restricted toproviding guidelines for future action by the United Nationsin the economic and social sectors. It should also includerecommendations for strengthening the capacity of thisOrganization to enhance international cooperation in thesefields and to promote the advancement of developingcountries.At its forty-seventh session the General Assemblyreaffirmed that development is a shared responsibility. Ifour collective war on poverty  disease  unemployment andother challenges to development is to succeed  it must alsobe undertaken on the basis of a true partnership  apartnership involving individuals  States  regional andinternational organizations and non-governmental entities  forwe must engender a sense of inclusion among all ofsociety’s economic and social actors  while giving duerecognition to their respective roles and responsibilities.However  Trinidad and Tobago also shares theperspective of the Secretary-General  as stated in his 1993report on the work of the Organization  that4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session""States and their sovereignty are increasinglyrecognized as indispensable building-blocks ofinternational order and problem-solving."" (A/48/1  para.13)While all credible entities should be allowed to contribute totheir greatest potential towards our shared objectives  Statesmust not be deprived of the proper tools of governance andthe opportunity to utilize them effectively on the basis ofconsidered national strategies and priorities.The concept of partnership must apply equally to thearea of development finance and to trade. As regards thelatter  Trinidad and Tobago has steered the steady course oftrade liberalization but  like many other developing nations has encountered persistent restrictions in the markets of theindustrialized countries. It is hoped that the formation ofmega-trading blocs will not compound these difficultiesfurther.We witnessed the application of the principle of globalpartnership in the convening of the United NationsConference on Environment and Development and theadoption of Agenda 21 in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. Todate the first important steps have been taken towards theimplementation of the comprehensive programme ofactivities for sustainable development contained in Agenda21. The 1994 Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island States presents the nextimportant opportunity for the international community todemonstrate the continued political will to fulfil thecommitments undertaken at the Earth Summit in 1992.For small island nations like Trinidad and Tobago  thisGlobal Conference  to be held in Barbados in April of nextyear  is critical to our efforts to forge  with the assistance ofthe international community  appropriate strategies for theimplementation of Agenda 21  as it pertains to our specificsituation. We strongly believe that small States should notbe penalized for their limited capacity to inflict majordamage on the global environment. Positive recognitionshould instead be given to their greater propensity forattracting a disproportionate share of environmental damage.Trinidad and Tobago hopes that adequate concessional fundswill be provided for the sustainable-development activities ofthe small island developing States  as an importantcomplement to initiatives taken at the national and regionallevels.The urgency that developing countries  such as myown  attach to the elaboration of the proposed agenda fordevelopment signals the importance we attach to achievinga proper balance in the level of resources devoted to politicaland security questions and those allocated to economic andsocial programmes. The World Conference on Populationand Development in 1994  the Fourth World Conference onWomen in 1995 and the preparations for these Conferences will also contribute significantly to a strengthened economicand social agenda within the United Nations.In addition  it is our hope that substantive preparationsfor the 1995 World Summit for Social Development willreinforce the importance of focusing on the ultimateobjective of our development policies and programmes: thewell-being and advancement of people.Trinidad and Tobago intends to follow closely thehigh-level plenary discussions to be held on internationalcooperation in the fight against drug abuse and illicit drug-trafficking. Our country has fallen victim to the increasedtransit of illegal drugs through its territory. As is often thecase  increased levels of illicit trafficking have led towidespread drug abuse and an accompanying rise in othercrimes. We note that this problem continues to plague agrowing number of nations and therefore urge that higherpriority be given to the United Nations programmes designedto combat this menace.The United Nations has not been provided with thefinancial resources needed to implement its legislativemandates. We have now exhausted some of the funds fromwhich relief was frequently obtained in past years  resultingin a serious threat to the daily operations of theOrganization. However  while it will be readily agreed thatany organization must be provided with the resources itneeds to carry out its functions  it must also be admitted thatthere is a growing imbalance between the demands beingmade upon the United Nations and the ability of a growingnumber of States to meet the cost of these demands. Thisis particularly the case with the peace-keeping budget  whichin 1993 is expected to be almost three times the amount ofthe regular budget.The United Nations is now in a critical period ofadjustment and reorientation. Trinidad and Tobago concurswith the view that there must be improvements in theadministrative and operational performance of the UnitedNations in all its activities. Transparency and accountabilitymust be the watchwords of the Organization.As we approach our fiftieth anniversary  we the StatesMembers of the United Nations must remain steadfast in oursupport for the fundamental purposes and principles whichhave promoted order and security in the world community.We must also meet the challenges and grasp theopportunities presented by the altered global environment.Forty-eighth session - 12 October l993 5Let us forge ahead  confident in our ability to work togetherand to succeed in advancing the cause of peace anddevelopment."
"162",6951,"TUN",48,1993,"I am particularly pleased to offer my warmcongratulations to Ambassador Insanally  both on my ownbehalf and on behalf of the Government of the Republic ofTunisia  on his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I am delighted to seehim directing our work and I am convinced that in thechoice it has made  the General Assembly intended tohonour his country  which has been devoted to the cause ofpeace and international cooperation.I would also like to take this opportunity to thank hispredecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  for the contribution he madeto the work of the forty-seventh session and for the greatskill he evinced at that time.It is also a pleasant duty to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the Organization  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  forhis efforts and the determination in implementing theobjectives and decisions of the United Nations aimed atresolving conflicts throughout the world. His is far from aneasy task  particularly since those conflicts have multipliedand the activity and role of the United Nations today haveincreased as well.I should also like to congratulate the new MemberStates that have acceded recently to membership of ourOrganization and to welcome their delegations here present.I am quite certain that they will make their own valuablecontributions to what is being done by the United Nations topromote peace and cooperation between nations.After the spectacular upheavals that the world hasundergone  the current session provides us with a propitiousopportunity to take a close look at the circumstances and theprospects offered by these changes and to consider ways andmeans of strengthening our Organization and its new fieldsof action  particularly on the basis of preventive diplomacyand on building relationships of trust and cooperationbetween States.Starting from 7 November 1987  Tunisia has beenengaged in laying the foundations of a modern and advancedState capable of adapting to the changes that have takenplace and continue to take place in the world. Tunisia hopesthat after the era of dogmatism and ideology  the world willbe able to evince greater maturity by putting more vigour instriving for cooperation between nations and solidaritybetween peoples.One of the signs of such maturity is undoubtedly thedynamic peace process in the Middle East. There can be nodoubt that the premisses of peace in the Middle East whichare now attracting the attention of the entire internationalcommunity are an indication that an end to decades ofconfrontation  destruction and suffering is now in view.The historic mutual recognition between Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization and the declaration ofprinciples relating to the occupied territories are allimportant signposts along the road towards recognition of thelegitimate rights of the Palestinian people  and are a causefor hope that a just and comprehensive peace in the MiddleEast is in the offing.Tunisia  while welcoming these developments  wouldlike to voice the hope that Israel will show the necessarycourage to reach agreement with the Arab parties concernedin order to achieve a just and lasting peace that willguarantee that all the peoples of the region will live insecurity and stability  and that in the place of strife andconflict there will be good-neighbourliness.Devoted as it is to the universal values of peace andjustice  Tunisia will continue to endeavour to give impetusto this dynamic peace process in the Middle East with aview to undoing the knot of the crises and conflicts thatbeset the world today.In line with this stance  Tunisia has made a point ofbeing associated with the efforts of the internationalcommunity and with the work of the United Nations in theservice of peace  security and stability.It is in this context that we should view Tunisia’sparticipation in the operations involving supervision of theelections in Cambodia  despite the enormous difficulties thatwere encountered.Forty-eighth session - 27 September l993 17Also  Tunisia recently responded to the United Nationsappeal to take part in the Somali operation; unfortunately the situation seems to indicate that a return of peace in theshort term seems rather unlikely.Tunisia also responded to the United Nations appeal tobe associated in United Nations efforts in the WesternSahara  the purpose of which is to lay the groundwork forholding a referendum.Regarding the tragedy of the people of Bosnia andHerzegovina  Tunisia once again appeals to the conscienceof the world to work determinedly towards seeking a justsettlement based on law and international legality rather thanon the basis of fait accompli politics  so that a swift end maybe put to this tragedy  particularly as winter is near.Since it remains faithful to its Arab and Islamicidentity  and since it also belongs to the Maghreb  Tunisiawill do everything it can to strengthen the ties ofbrotherhood and cooperation in order to achieve ourobjectives so that we may be able to realize the aspirationsof our peoples of a better future. It is in this spirit thatTunisia and Algeria have recently concluded an agreementon the demarcation of the borders between our two fraternalcountries. The agreement will be deposited shortly with theUnited Nations.In this context  we should like to express our sincerehope that all the problems in the Gulf region will beproperly and rationally resolved  including the boundarydisputes between Iraq and Kuwait and between the UnitedArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran  and that thiswill be achieved by peaceful means in line with existingagreements and the norms of international legality  inkeeping with the new spirit which now inspires internationalrelations as well as with the aspirations of our world afterpeace and stability in this particularly sensitive region.Tunisia’s efforts on the Arab Maghreb’s level in itscapacity as current president of the Arab Maghreb Unionaim at creating the necessary conditions that would enableus to make progress in building the Maghreb andstrengthening its role in the international arena. Building theedifice of the Maghreb is part and parcel of the currentdevelopment of international relations  which favoursregional groupings. We for our part are doing everything wecan to ensure that the Arab Maghreb Union keeps pace withevents in a way that will make it possible to establishfruitful relations in the international context and moreparticularly with the regional Arab  European andMediterranean groups so that  as a group it may serve as aninstrument of peace and cooperation and a bastion ofsecurity and stability.The dispute between Libya  a member of the ArabMaghreb Union and three Western countries is a source ofdeep concern for us. Tunisia has worked hard within theMaghreb framework and at the Arab level to find anegotiated and honourable settlement that would safeguardthe interests of all parties and spare the region the risk ofany escalation of tension and instability.Tunisia has always worked for strengthening peace andcooperation in Africa. It is our hope that in future Africawill reap the beneficial side-effects of the profoundinternational political and economic changes that have takenplace  so that it may devote its efforts to development.Tunisia  which has welcomed the process of change inSouth Africa  and looks forward with optimism to seeing theApril 1994 elections restore this great African country to aplace worthy of its standing within the African family  callsupon all political parties to respect the agreement that hasbeen concluded  and to implement it in good faith so that thepeoples of Azania can see an end to racism and the adventof a new era of democracy.The establishment  at the most recent Summit of theOrganization of African Unity  of machinery for themanagement and settlement of conflicts in Africa is also asource of great satisfaction. In our view  this is evidence ofthe determination of the African Heads of State to turn thepage once and for all on wars and disputes and to embarkupon a new era based on dialogue and fruitful cooperation.Henceforth  Africa will have to rely essentially on itsown resources. However  it does need the support of theinternational community so that its efforts may succeed inachieving the goal of African development and Africanstability.Attention should be drawn to the suffering of manyAfrican States as a result of upheavals and conflicts such asthose witnessed by Somalia  Liberia and Angola  which havenow become sources of major concern for the entireinternational community. The international community mustnot remain unmoved by such events  which undermine wholeStates and sap their potential. We believe that theinternational community is capable of contributing genuinelyto national reconciliation in those countries  and that by sodoing it will make it possible to eliminate all the othersources of tension in the continent.18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe profound changes in international relations haveundoubtedly imparted a global dimension to the problems ofthe world. International solidarity and cooperation in thenew shape they have taken  have become an absolutenecessity whether the issue in question has to do with themaintenance of peace  disarmament  the upholding of humanrights  or with addressing problems relating to theenvironment  demography and development.On November 7th  Tunisia charted for itself anunswerving course in that area and boldly has taken severaldecisive steps toward laying the foundations of a State thatfunctions under the rule of law  through institutions thatuphold fundamental freedoms. Thus the concepts andprinciples of human rights  freedom  pluralism  the rule oflaw and State institutions  have become constants on whichall Tunisians unite around their President Ben Ali  in orderto devote themselves to laying the foundations of oursociety.Tunisia has spared no effort to ensure the success of theInternational Conference on Human Rights in Vienna  tofacilitate the successful elaboration of a common approachand to identify the appropriate machinery to ensure respectfor human rights.My country remains convinced that development combatting poverty  the settlement of disputes that arise fromforeign occupation  the elimination of racism and fanaticism are all absolute imperatives in defending human rights ofpeople  ensuring the stability of States and enabling theirpeoples to progress.In this respect  I should like to highlight one particularscourge namely the dangerous phenomenon of extremismand terrorism  especially that type of extremism which donsthe garb and mask of religion while  in spirit and action  itconstitutes a total negation of democracy and human rights.Tunisia  which unmasked in time the doublespeak ofthat type of extremism  has been able  through an overallstrategy of political  economic  cultural and socialachievement  to contain this phenomenon and thwart itsdesigns. Consequently  our country now enjoys safety stability and continued progress.We have listened with great attention to PresidentWilliam Clinton when he spoke this morning of the riskswhich continue to threaten security and stability throughoutthe world  particularly extremism - racial extremism aboveall - and religious extremism  which breed hatred andterrorism. Tunisia continues to appeal to the internationalcommunity to intensify its efforts to contain thisphenomenon which sows anarchy and chaos in the bosom ofthe international community and hampers the developmentprocess.It is high time for the international community as awhole to give serious thought to this phenomenon  to defineits various forms and manifestations and to devise aninternational course of action and a legal framework tocombat it. We should also look for just foundations thatwould reinforce the laws of asylum now in force in allStates.It is obvious that while the right of asylum acquires ahumanitarian character and is essentially a part of Statesovereignty  the granting of asylum should be in accordancewith certain ethical rules and principles which must berespected.Tunisia believes that the right of asylum is one of thosecommon human values which must not be used for thepurposes other than those for which they were created.The persistence of old problems and conflicts whichdrag on in various parts of the world  delays in developmentwhich plague a considerable segment of mankind highlightthe fragility of peace and security. Consequently  it isessential to work for genuine disarmament. It was inkeeping with this thinking that Tunisia acceded to the Non-Proliferation Treaty  the Treaty banning the development ofbiological weapons and signed  in January 1993  in Paris  theConvention on the Prohibition of the Development Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on TheirDestruction.I hardly need to recall that the concept of securitytranscends the purely military aspects and embraces variouselements that encompass political stability and economicsecurity. This means we have to draw up an agenda fordevelopment as a necessary prerequisite for the success ofAn Agenda for Peace.The right of both present and future generations to livein a healthy environment is today at the very centre of theconcerns of the international community and is one of themain concerns of my country.To this end  Tunisia adopts a policy that combinespreventive and remedial environmental programmes. Thatpolicy has yielded so far  many tangible results  in areassuch as the conservation and safeguarding of naturalresources  the protection of fisheries and coastlines  and theForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 19improvement of the quality of life. Ratification of theinternational conventions which followed the Earth Summitand the creation of a national Commission on SustainableDevelopment are all tangible facts which reflect Tunisia’scommitment to the implementation of the decisions of theRio de Janeiro Summit.It goes without saying that steps taken at the nationallevel can only be viable to the extent that the internationalcommunity succeeds in identifying the interrelationshipsbetween the problems of the environment and those ofdevelopment.In this connection  there is need for a new approach inaddressing the issues of North-South relations. This meansmoving towards strengthening of a multilateral economicsystem in order effectively to respond to the priorities of thepoorer countries.Tunisia has constantly given concrete expression tocooperation between the North and the South in its variousaspects because it is convinced of the interdependence of theinterests of the two groupings and the link between thegrowth and volume of assistance provided by the countriesof the North. That is why it would be judicious to formulatea new approach to international cooperation which wouldencompass development assistance  trade  investment and thetransfer of technology.To avoid a North-South schism  the developed countriesmust take account of the economic problems of the countriesof the South  especially those problems that relate to thedevelopment process as well as the problems relating to therestructuring of their economies and to indebtedness.We cannot deal with international trade without takingup one vital question  namely the necessity of establishing alink between the transfer of technology to the developingcountries and capital flows.In this connection  it must be recalled that indebtednessand debt-servicing  in the case of the developing countries in most cases is the main obstacle that impedes furtherdevelopment and hampers full participation in the worldeconomy.Although Tunisia has always honoured its financialcommitments I should like in this connection to reiteratesome proposals we made earlier on this subject: inparticular regarding the rescheduling of debt by creating aspecial fund to finance job-creating development projects.There is no doubt that such projects  in addition to theirdirect return which would be beneficial to the recipientcountries  will have the effect of settling populations in theiroriginal regions and thus contribute to reducing migratoryflows to wealthier countries.In this very Hall  President Zine El Abidine Ben Aliproposed a contract for peace and development that in ourestimation  would strengthen the existing capabilities andenhance potential in the States of the North and of the Southalike.In his recent address to the European Parliament atStrasbourg in June 1993  President Zine El Abidine Ben Alifurther proposed organizing a conference on the developmentof the Maghreb States with a view to establishing a newpolitical  economic  social and cultural partnership betweenthe Maghreb and the European States.Before concluding  I wish to touch on the question ofthe restructuring of the organs of the United Nations. I wantagain to welcome the initiatives of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali to adapt the universal Organization’s structures to theongoing changes in international relations  to rationalize theactivities of the United Nations system and to reorganize themethods of its functioning. The elements of the proposedreform package should be carefully considered and discussedby all Member States with a view to making theOrganization’s new structure more efficacious.The projected reforms - whether involving enlargementof the Security Council  redeployments in the Secretariat orcuts in spending - deserve our attention to the extent thatthey take account of the interests of the developingcountries. We think the reforms should emphasize theprinciple of equality among Member States and guaranteedecision-making balance among the Organization’s variousorgans  and particularly with respect to the Security Counciland the General Assembly.Let me conclude by reiterating my wishes for thesuccess of the work of the forty-eighth session; we count onit to realize the hopes of the peoples of our world."
"163",6998,"TUR",48,1993,"At the outset  I wish tocongratulate Ambassador Insanally on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly. The fact that he wasselected to guide our deliberations signifies the confidencethat Member States have in his well-known professionalqualities. I am sure that  under his guidance  the presentsession of the Assembly will tackle the issues on its agendawith courage and realism.I would also like to place on record our appreciation forthe competence and wisdom of his predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev  and for his outstandingperformance in steering the work of the General Assemblyduring an eventful year.My delegation takes joyful pride in welcoming Andorra the Czech Republic  Eritrea  Macedonia  Monaco and theSlovak Republic to the family of nations. We believe thattheir admission represents yet another milestone in furtherconsolidating the universality of this Organization. There isno doubt that our community will be enriched andstrengthened by their contribution to the realization of theideals of the United Nations.The excitement and hopefulness of 1989 already seemto be part of a distant past. We both welcomed and wereunprepared for the events that marked the dramatic end ofthe cold war. They generated a tidal wave of optimismabout the future of international relations. Fervent talk abouta rapidly changing world was the order of the day when weentered the present decade. Little was done  however  todetermine and shape the dynamics and scope of the change.It was more or less taken for granted that this change wouldturn out to be for the better. That did not prove to be thecase. Accordingly  the creation of a new  desirableinternational system continues to top the political agenda asthe most challenging task of our times.The past 12 months have demonstrated yet again thatthe new world in the making might at times be as dangerousas the old  if not worse in certain respects. Nevertheless  weshould resist the impulse to indulge in a dark pessimism forwhich there can be no legitimate cause. The crucial phaseof history we are going through calls for reflection andpositive action  not a defeatist mood. The internationalcommunity should not stand by in desperation and watchconditions deteriorate. It must display the will to redirectthe course of history towards our expectations. Theredefinitely exists a political space for constructive initiativesand a basis for cooperative action to that end.It is the United Nations which defines and guards thatpolitical space. Indeed  the United Nations is the foremostsymbol of modern internationalism. In these turbulent post-cold-war years  hardly a day passes without the OrganizationForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 35being called upon to take the lead on some important task.These tasks include missions for preserving or restoringpeace and security  the upholding of the rule of law  andmissions to ensure the survival of mankind  to help save theenvironment  to combat social scourges and to rescue the so-called failing societies.Since the cold war drew to a close and the conflicts ofthe transition era rose to the fore  United Nationspeace-keeping operations have undergone considerableexpansion in terms of their functions  size  geographical areaand degree of complexity. This process has occurred intandem with the rapid evolution of the internationallandscape. The same background conditions have promptedthe emergence of preventive diplomacy  peace- enforcementand peace-building as new concepts awaiting urgenttranslation into practical and mutually supportive instrumentsat the disposal of the international community. Turkey’sresponse to this urgency is reflected in our contribution topeace-keeping operationsAs highlighted in the Secretary-General’s report entitled""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  effectively managing ofthe crises currently confronting us and responding adequatelyto the challenges ahead call for the elaboration of a sharedvision for the future of our Organization.In this connection  the focus of priority attention shouldbe the Security Council. Today  the prestige and credibilityof the United Nations depend more than ever on theeffectiveness of that principal body. There is a widespreadcall for the Security Council to become more responsive tothe needs of the current international scene. This can bemade possible only by making the Council morerepresentative of the new geopolitical realities. In otherwords  the post-cold-war environment requires a freshapproach towards the Council’s renovation and restructuring.Hence  the discussion on the twin themes of equitablerepresentation and membership enlargement is very timely.Turkey firmly believes that enlarging the SecurityCouncil membership would enhance its effectiveness.Enlargement should not be conceived of only as an increasein the number of members  but should also envisage thecreation of a new category of seats to be held by States thatcould be qualified as semi-permanent members.Semi-permanent membership in the Council could rotateamong a specific number of States designated according tocertain objective criteria: population; geopolitical posture;economic potential; record of contribution to themaintenance of international peace and security; andequitable geographical distribution. Since Turkey fullymeets these criteria  it considers itself qualified as acandidate for that new category of membership.A Security Council more responsive  representative transparent and accountable is a requirement inherent in thespirit of Article 24 of the Charter. Hence  thedemocratization of its structure would ensure more activeparticipation in the Council’s work. The moral ground forthe full implementation of the Council’s resolutions wouldthereby be strengthened.Few  if any  would contest the fact that it was thetragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina that dispelled theeuphoria prevalent during the earlier period of the post-cold-war era. Genocide and ""ethnic cleansing"" were thehallmarks of the tragedy. They were conducted withimpunity. We could neither halt  nor roll back the Serbianaggression. Nor could we alleviate  in earnest the sufferingof the survivors.The example of a civic State  embracing all its citizensas equals  irrespective of their ethnic origin or religion  wasgiven to us in Bosnia where a mature multiculturalcivilization had evolved over many centuries. No lamentover its destruction at the hands of ethnic chauvinism couldbe exaggerated. Moreover  denying the Bosnians the meansfor their legitimate self-defence amounts to a failure in duesupport for democracy against tyranny. A most serious blowhas been dealt to the moral essence of international law andto the contemporary principles of conduct among nations.Any document endorsing the consequences ofexpansionism  genocide and ""ethnic cleansing"" cannot usherin real peace. No peace throughout history has been lastingwhen based on rewarding injustice  aggression and racism.We cannot relieve our conscience by fabricating realpolitikexcuses for our inaction and silence. Appeasement is nopolicy  but partnership in wrongdoing.The stakes in Bosnia are much higher than those relatedto the survival of the Bosnian State and its people. Theyinclude the validity of our hope to do away with ethnic andreligious warfare in the future. The betrayal of Bosnia as amulticultural  multi-ethnic State  invalidates this hope - andwith it the fundamental principles of our Organization. Ifwe allow dictatorship and adventurism to get away with thecrimes they have committed in Bosnia  the post-cold-wardisorder may worsen. Continued denial of the right of theRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to defend itselfaggravates the responsibility of the international communityfor what is happening there. Should Bosnia andHerzegovina disintegrate  not only the Balkans and Europe 36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionbut the whole world  will eventually suffer the bitterafter-effects.Turkey will continue to pursue actively the course ofjustice and legitimacy to support the brave people of Bosniaand Herzegovina in their struggle for survival anddemocracy.The sinister success of Serbian expansionism in Bosniahas emboldened aggressors elsewhere. A tragedy of similarproportions is occurring in the Caucasus  where Armenianshave occupied a fifth of Azerbaijani territory. Peace andstability in a sensitive region neighbouring Turkey has beenseriously undermined. Security Council resolutions 822(1993) and 853 (1993)  calling for the immediate unconditional and complete withdrawal of the occupationforces  are being ignored.It should be borne in mind that short-term militaryopportunism is not compatible with long-term interests.Moreover  it is fraught with unpredictable dangers. Neitherin the Balkans nor in the Caucasus - nor  for that matter anywhere else - will Turkey ever accept the acquisition ofterritory by force. Unless such gross violations ofinternational law are prevented and the principles of theUnited Nations Charter vigorously upheld  the presentturmoil and confusion cannot be replaced by a just andpeaceful order.It is with these thoughts in mind that Turkey stronglyendorses the observations made by the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  in his statement on 30 Augustlast  at the sixty-sixth session of the Institute of InternationalLaw in Milan. There he appropriately referred to ultra-nationalism and micro-nationalism as two of the greatestdangers menacing today’s international society. Heunderlined that  by strengthening the nation State as the mainsubject of international law  multilateralism preserves theworld community from these two great perils. Hisadmonition that""Ultra-nationalism today may still be a temptation  attimes  for a number of major Powers nostalgic for theperiod of hegemony""is of particular relevance at this juncture of post-cold-wardevelopments.Indeed  the darkening shadows of ultra-nationalism andmicro-nationalism  ethnic chauvinism and neo-racism haveloomed like phantoms behind the scenes in the crises thathave erupted during the last two years. The internationalcommunity has to cure itself of these diseases. We shouldnot let irredentist  hegemonic tendencies plague our future.The newly emerging geopolitical pluralism of Eurasia has tobe kept alive with a moral commitment to the quest forglobal democratic interdependence.Most of the threats to international peace in our timeare bred in climates of intolerance. We have to develop anew mind-set for the recognition and acknowledgment ofother peoples’ right to be different. We have to enlarge ourcapacity for give and take.Tolerance is the foundation of civil society. To builda just and peaceful world order  such societies mustproliferate. To that end  we need to promote a culture oftolerance all over the world.In this spirit  and as a follow-up to resolution 47/124 Turkey will submit during the current session a draftresolution proposing the proclamation of 1995 as the UnitedNations Year for Tolerance. Adoption of that draftresolution would help to accelerate the pace of the effortsmade in the struggle against all forms of fanaticism fundamentalism  discrimination and persecution.Forty-eighth session - 30 September l993 37Tolerance and social development are correlatedconcepts. Accordingly  my Government attaches greatimportance to concerted action at the global level aimed atsolving social problems and easing the tensions they cause.Hence  we are amply satisfied that the Chilean initiative forthe convening in March 1995 of a World Summit for SocialDevelopment has borne fruit. Turkey will prepare for thisSummit in earnest  and looks forward to contributing to itssuccess.In this connection  Turkey welcomes the Secretary-General’s latest report on the work of the organization  inwhich he courageously addresses the gravity of the situationstemming from the difficulty in raising funds fordevelopment aid experienced since the end of the cold war.He accurately observes that the poorer countries no longerhold the same interest for the rich as they did in the previousdecades of ideological competition. My Governmentbelieves that activities for development are just as importantas peace-keeping operations. Indeed  it is those activities including their humanitarian assistance dimension  whichprovide the foundations for global peace and security.Turkey  stretching its budgetary means to the utmost continues to be increasingly active as a donor andcontributor in the fields of economic and humanitariansupport and solidarity.Since the beginning of 1992 we have implemented aneconomic assistance package amounting to $2 893 million.The package includes technical assistance  project financing training grants and soft loans  made available to 32 countriesin four continents. We are firmly committed to continuingour efforts in this domain. To increase efficiency in termsof coordination  we have set up the Turkish InternationalCooperation Agency.Over the same period 28 countries in three continents stricken by natural and/or man-made disasters  have receivedhumanitarian aid worth a total of $213 million from Turkey in cash or in kind  as well as various forms of relief andaccommodation for refugees.Offering as they do a gloomy general picture  the past12 months are nevertheless not totally bereft of reasons foroptimism  which include: the processes culminating in therestoration of democracy in Haiti and Cambodia; the positivedevelopments leading towards the building of a democratic united  free and non-racial South Africa; and the peacefulevolution of Eritrea to independence. A new diplomacy fordemocracy seems to be making headway. All of us mustbring our full energies to bear on this phenomenon so thatit may gain momentum. That momentum  in its turn  willgive impetus to the consolidation of peace  becausedemocracies seldom fight each other.The only way to advance towards democracy isprogressive and sustained democratization. The distancecovered in this process is measured by the degree of respectfor human rights and the rule of law. The convening of theWorld Conference on Human Rights earlier this year enabledthe international community to identify clearly theindispensable common denominators needed in the buildingof pluralistic civil societies. The Conference re-emphasizedthe importance of the global task of promoting andprotecting all human rights and fundamental freedoms  andconfirmed the commitment of the international communityto securing the full and universal enjoyment of those rightsthrough increased and sustained international cooperation andsolidarity.The Vienna Declaration includes a comprehensivedefinition of terrorism as any activity aiming at thedestruction of human rights  fundamental freedoms anddemocracy  threatening the territorial integrity of States anddestabilizing legitimately constituted Governments. Westrongly endorse the call by the Conference to continuetaking the necessary steps to prevent and combat terrorism.The historic breakthrough achieved in the Middle Eastpeace process holds the promise of concord and cooperationnot only between the Palestinians  Israel and their Arabneighbours  but on a much wider regional scale. Its positiveripple effects may set in motion multi-dimensional dynamicsthat could transform an entire area  stretching from theAtlantic to the Gulf and from the eastern Mediterranean tothe Indian Ocean  into one of harmony  dialogue andco-prosperity.As a country that neighbours the Middle East  has arecord of constructive involvement in the region’s affairs andgood traditional ties with all the parties to this dispute Turkey hails with the utmost satisfaction this momentousshift from enmity towards reconciliation.The momentum so gained should be fully utilized.Irreversibility of the process is not enough; the process mustadvance at an accelerated pace towards the ultimateobjectives defined in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)and 338 (1973).The wise  far-sighted and courageous architects whodesigned this blueprint for rebuilding amity and peace in theMiddle East may  as ever  rest assured of Turkey’s firm38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionsupport for and contribution to their mission. We arecommitted to assisting their endeavours in every way.Three years after the outbreak of the Gulf crisis thepeople of Iraq are still subjected to hardship. Thisregrettable situation results from the Baghdad Government’sreluctance to comply fully with the requirements of theSecurity Council resolutions relating to the Gulf Warsettlement. Compliance would tangibly demonstrate Iraq’sinterest in resuming its place in the international community.However  we cannot remain indifferent to the sufferingof the people of Iraq. My Government firmly believes thatthe international community must urgently considerimaginative ways to break this vicious circle.Turkey has been forthcoming in providing Iraq withhumanitarian assistance since 1991. By the same token  wehave decided to launch a new humanitarian assistanceprogramme worth $13.5 million aimed at the entire needypopulation of northern Iraq. Our approach is withoutprejudice to Iraq’s sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity.Along with the Iraqi people  a number of countries particularly Iraq’s neighbours  are also exposed to theadverse effects of the continued economic sanctions. Theinternational community should also devise a set of measuresaimed at redressing their mounting losses.My Government is concerned over the worseningsituation in Jammu and Kashmir. We wish to see thedispute between Pakistan and India over the Kashmir issueresolved through the resumption of sustained dialogue. Tothat end  Turkey will continue to support Pakistan’sendeavours in pursuit of a negotiated settlement of thislong-standing problem.As to Cyprus  it is certainly not my intention to indulgein a consideration of the past. I am quite aware that this isnot the time  not would it be profitable  to enter intorecriminations over history. What is important is tounderstand the issue correctly while acknowledging the factsunderlying the present problems and the profound mistrustbetween the two communities. We must take carefulaccount of those problems and the present difficulties  butwe must build for the future.Today the Cyprus question has reached a stage wherethe common desire and purpose of the internationalcommunity is to promote an early and comprehensivesolution. To that end  the Secretary-General continues hismission of good offices. As ever  Turkey supports theSecretary-General’s efforts aimed at bringing about a freelynegotiated  just and viable settlement. No doubt therealization of that objective requires a display of goodwill understanding and patience by both negotiating partners inthe island. Moreover  it also calls for a carefully balancedand determined approach in order to heal the profoundmistrust driving the parties apart. It is with suchconsiderations that Turkey has endorsed the concept ofconfidence-building measures  the scope and contents ofwhich must be acceptable to both communities.Whatever the reasons that may still divide the twosides  the negotiating process must continue. It is high timefor all concerned to display realism and act with vision insearch of a negotiated  durable solution.At present a campaign is under way for early generalelections in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Weearnestly hope that once the elections are over the TurkishCypriot side will again be able to continue to play itsconstructive role in the negotiating process.Turkey lies at the very epicentre of several regionsmaking up the most turbulent part of the Northernhemisphere. We are actively engaged in the post-cold-warsearch for new approaches to build peace throughmultilateral action. Our objective is to reinforce theinternational security system. Only the United Nations canprovide legitimacy to regional arrangements and institutionsshould the latter decide to act in the fields of militarilybacked preventive diplomacy  peace-keeping and peaceenforcement.All three of those categories of action are in demand onTurkey’s periphery. My Government deploys all of itsavailable assets to help defuse and resolve these crises. Westrive to create and consolidate interlinked areas of solidarityand processes of cooperation.In that effort we proceed from two basic tenets. First we believe that the evolution of the internationalenvironment towards a better future is not only desirable but in certain conditions  also possible. Secondly  we are of theopinion that such a future may materialize only through thereinforcement of respect for the rule of law along with theuniversal observance and implementation of the principles ofdemocracy and tolerance.The United Nations was created to preserve peace.However  it cannot be expected to help resolve the collectivesecurity problems of our times unless its Member States arewilling and prepared to assume their responsibilities asForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 39upholders and enforcers of the United Nations Charter andthe contemporary norms of international behaviour.With the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of theOrganization to be celebrated in two years’ time  all of ushere must admit that the main objective defined in theCharter  namely  ""to save succeeding generations from thescourge of war "" has not yet been achieved. In thestrengthening of peace and security our immediate task isfully to mobilize the potential of the United Nations forresolving regional and local conflicts  which haveproliferated since the end of the cold war.For the future well-being of all nations  it is high timeto act with the vision and forbearance that peace requires.Turkey stands committed to continue making its owncontribution to attaining that objective."
"164",7060,"TZA",48,1993,"Iam delighted to extend to you  Sir  on behalf of theTanzanian delegation  our sincere congratulations on yourwell-deserved election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session. Over the past twoweeks you have already demonstrated your considerablediplomatic skills and leadership qualities. We look forwardto a productive session under your guidance.I would also like to extend my delegation’s appreciationto your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev  forthe leadership he provided to the forty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly.The Secretary-General and the staff he leads havecontinued to give of their best to our Organization. Over thepast year they have demonstrated a remarkable capacity totake on additional responsibilities despite dwindlingresources. We owe them a debt of gratitude and they havea right to expect our support as they carry out the work wehave entrusted to them.6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionDuring the past year  the Czech Republic  Slovakia Monaco  Eritrea  the Former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia and Andorra have joined the United Nations assovereign and independent States. It gives me great pleasureto extend to them a warm welcome and sincerecongratulations and to say how much we look forward toworking closely with all of them in the common endeavourto make our world a better place for our peoples and for allmankind.Another year has passed since we last met in thegeneral debate and pledged to intensify our efforts to satisfythe aspirations of our peoples for world peace and security for economic and social justice and for progress anddevelopment  in conditions of freedom and human dignity.It is proper that as we start another session  we should takestock of the progress made towards the realization of theseaspirations.The problems of southern Africa remained a majorpreoccupation of my Government during the past year. Mydelegation commends the international community for itscontribution in the search for solutions to the problems ofapartheid in South Africa and the conflicts in Angola andMozambique.Over the last 12 months  the advance towards theeradication of apartheid has brought the goal nearer thanever before. The call by the representatives of the majoritypeople of South Africa  notably by President NelsonMandela of the African National Congress of Azania (ANC) for the lifting of virtually all remaining economic and tradesanctions means that the progress made thus far  and theprogress soon to be made  represent profound andirreversible change in terms of the Declaration on Apartheidand its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa.Whatever happens  South Africa will never be the same.A very important recent signal suggesting that theturning-point is very close was the fixing of 27 April 1994as election day for all South Africans. My delegationwarmly welcomes this development and urges all concernedto work to achieve that target. The most importantdevelopment  however  has been the enactment last month ofthe legislation necessary for the establishment of anindependent electoral commission  an independent mediacouncil and an independent broadcasting authority as well asa Transitional Executive Council.Regrettably  there remain many obstacles on the road.Violence remains the most serious obstacle impedingprogress towards the establishment of a united  democraticand non-racial South Africa. With 20 000 murders per year according to records compiled by the Southern AfricanResearch and Documentation Centre  South Africa’sreputation of being the most violent country in the world iswell deserved. The leadership of the democratic forces inthe country must be commended for denying the forces ofdeath and destruction the satisfaction of derailing the peaceprocess. But the threat remains real and great  as evidencedby the brutal assassination of Chris Hani in April and thestorming by a right-wing racist white group of thenegotiations at the World Trade Centre in June.International monitoring of the violence has providedsome reassurance to the victims of apartheid violence. Thetemerity and audacity shown by the perpetrators of violenceand the blind eye turned to it by some members  includingleaders  of the country’s security forces  argue for a muchlarger  higher-profile United Nations presence in SouthAfrica. I urge the United Nations to respond positively tothe urgent pleas of the victims of violence for more UnitedNations monitors.Another obstacle is the non-participation by somegroups in the peace process and the threat of violence issuedby some of them. This is yet another argument forincreasing the presence and raising the profile of the UnitedNations  and of the world community as a whole  in SouthAfrica.Angola poses a similar but more urgent challenge to theUnited Nations. If it has a conscience  the internationalcommunity simply cannot allow the continuation of aconflict that is estimated to be claiming a thousand lives aday. It must act to stop this carnage.At the same time  we must make every effort to enablethe United Nations to recover from the considerable damagedone to its credibility and moral authority by its inability torespond adequately and promptly to the grave challengesposed by Jonas Savimbi. The adoption of Security Councilresolution 864 (1993) on 15 September 1993 has served toput Jonas Savimbi on notice that the United Nations will nolonger allow his obstinacy and prevarication to continue tothwart the will of the Angolan people  whose hopes forpeace and an opportunity to improve their lives have been sorudely shaken by his greed for power. UNITA and Savimbimust be left in no doubt that there is more to come if theycontinue to ignore the pleas of the international communityfor a cease-fire  for a return to the Bicesse Accords and forrespect for the electoral verdict of the Angolan people.Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 7This applies equally to UNITA’s obligation to allowand to facilitate access by humanitarian and relieforganizations to the victims of the conflict. Many reliefpersonnel have exposed themselves to serious danger inorder to help victims of the conflict. We commend them fortheir heroism and compassion. The best form of gratitude however  is to ensure that those responsible for this criminalconduct receive appropriate punishment.Although different  Mozambique offers some parallelswith Angola  and it remains to be seen during theimplementation of the Mozambican peace accords whetherthe correct lessons have been learned from the Angolanexperience. The delay in the implementation of the GeneralPeace Agreement is a matter of great concern because of theobvious threat it poses to the cease-fire. We are pleased tonote that the Security Council has taken the same seriousview of the delay. We are pleased also to note that at longlast the leader of RENAMO  Mr. Afonso Dhlakama  hasbeen able to overcome the difficulties which until recentlyprevented him from meeting with President Chissano. Wewelcome the talks between the two leaders and commendPresident Chissano for bending over backwards toaccommodate RENAMO. But we are concerned that thegood will and magnanimity of the Government ofMozambique are not being reciprocated by RENAMO andits leadership. Instead  we observe disturbing signs of itsfollowing in the footsteps of Savimbi.For example  the Government is still not able to provideadministrative services in the areas under the control ofRENAMO. The United Nations has a duty to prevent sucha blatant violation of the General Peace Agreement. But more ominously  RENAMO seems to be contriving to createa situation in which it hopes to persuade the world to acceptthe holding of elections before the process of demobilizationand the integration of forces has begun. We must spare noefforts to enable the United Nations to do all in its power toprevent an Angola-type situation from emerging inMozambique.Regrettably  as the year continued there were moredisappointments than successes. With the exception ofAngola  perhaps the most disconcerting were the setbackssuffered by the peace efforts in the former Yugoslavia - inparticular in Bosnia and Herzegovina - in Afghanistan andin Somalia  where the turn of events has led to a whollyunexpected and unwelcome confrontation between the UnitedNations and one of the factions in the tragic fratricidalconflict plaguing that country.We must do all we can to protect and preserve theintegrity and moral authority of the United Nations inSomalia. Those responsible for the killing of United Nationspeace-keeping forces and for instigating attacks against themmust be left in no doubt about the dire consequences of theircriminal conduct. But it goes without saying that the UnitedNations forces must themselves act with maximum restraint.Because Somalia is such a new experience for theUnited Nations  the outcome of its operation there is ofcrucial importance to the international community. TheUnited Nations cannot afford to fail in its mission ofhumanitarian assistance  peace-building and peace-keepingin Somalia. Nor can it afford serious mistakes. Mydelegation therefore welcomes the ongoing debate on howbest to achieve the United Nations mission in Somalia. Thecall for the United Nations to refocus its attention on theoriginal mandate and to pay greater attention to the searchfor a political solution  along the lines of the Addis AbabaAgreement  deserves most urgent attention.The cease-fire in Liberia  while holding  will remainfragile while tensions remain high and the end of the crisisis not in sight. The countries of the Economic Communityof West African States (ECOWAS) must be commended forundertaking an extremely costly and dangerous peace-keeping mission in Liberia on behalf of the internationalcommunity. They need more than the moral and politicalsupport of the world community. We therefore welcome theestablishment  by Security Council resolution 866 (1993) of22 September 1993  of the United Nations Observer Missionin Liberia (UNOMIL)  which will work alongside theprecedent-setting African peace-keeping effort under theauspices of ECOWAS to help resolve the Liberian conflict.The people of Western Sahara are understandablyfrustrated that  five years after the adoption of the UnitedNations plan for a referendum in Western Sahara  theinternational community has still not been able to give8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionthem an opportunity to exercise their right toself-determination. It is not good enough to tell them thatevery effort is being made to overcome the problems whichhave prevented the holding of the referendum. After fiveyears of discussion of the modalities of implementation  theyhave a right to ask whether all the parties have beennegotiating in good faith.Another African conflict-resolution initiative whichdeserves urgent United Nations support is the PeaceAgreement between the Government of Rwanda and theRwandese Patriotic Front (RPF)  which was signed inArusha  Tanzania  on 4 August 1993 after a year of arduousand protracted negotiations. As Facilitator in thenegotiations  Tanzania pays tribute to the parties to thenegotiations for their spirit of give and take  which enabledthe negotiations to succeed. We pay tribute to theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) for its invaluable rolethroughout the peace process. We also pay tribute to theobserver countries - Belgium  Burundi  France  Germany Senegal  Uganda  the United States and Zaire - and to theUnited Nations for their encouragement and support. Norshould we forget the invaluable contribution of Mali Nigeria  Tunisia and Zimbabwe  which provided personnelfor the Neutral Military Observer Group (NMOG II)  whichhas been monitoring the cease-fire.As implementation of the Agreement begins  prioritymust now be given to the establishment of the neutralinternational force. The joint delegation of the Governmentof Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front currentlyvisiting the United Nations has been stressing that everythingelse hinges on the establishment of that force. I echo theirappeal for speed in establishing the force. My delegationtherefore welcomes the timely adoption of Security Councilresolution 872 (1993) on 5 October 1993  authorizing theestablishment of the United Nations Assistance Mission forRwanda (UNAMIR)  and urges its speedy implementation.Comparisons are inadequate for measuring the sufferingor damage endured by people in a war  but it is difficult tothink of another current conflict in which a whole people hasbeen subjected to the suffering  inhumanity and indignitiesthat have been imposed on the Muslim population of Bosniaand Herzegovina. The inability of the United Nations tooffer any hope to the Bosnian Muslims is one of the greatesttragedies of our time. It is bad enough that the internationalcommunity has failed to put an end to the atrocities whichcontinue to be inflicted on the Bosnian Muslims. But for theworldcommunity in these circumstances to continue to deny themthe right to acquire the means with which to protectthemselves is incomprehensible. The least that the UnitedNations can do is to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia andHerzegovina in order to enable the people to defend theirfamilies and their country.At long last there are signs of an emerging solution tothe long-festering sore of the root cause of the Middle Eastproblem - the question of Palestine - the persistence ofwhich has for 40 years posed a serious moral dilemma forthe international community’s sense of justice  fairness andequality. The agreement signed in Washington on13 September 1993 between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) on mutual recognition  whichalso provides for limited autonomy for Palestinians in theGaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho  has beenrightly hailed as a major breakthrough in the Middle Eastnegotiations. My delegation joins in welcoming thisdevelopment and in congratulating Israel and the PLO on thecourage they have shown in taking this bold step towards theresolution of the intractable question of Palestine. The firststep is always the most difficult to take. We are  therefore hopeful that Israel and the PLO will now be able to movequickly to advance the process towards a just and lastingsolution to the question of Palestine and thus open the waytowards a comprehensive settlement of the Arab/Israelconflict.For the people of Cyprus - another vexed question thathas defied solution for nearly 20 years - a meaningful newworld order must be one that respects the unity  sovereigntyand territorial integrity as well as the non-aligned status ofthat country  and restores a sense of hope to the twocommunities for a future of partnership and cooperation incomplete equality and human dignity. It is a matter of greatdisappointment that the hopes raised by the resumption earlyin the year of negotiations under the good offices of theSecretary-General proved to be premature.In Cambodia  the efforts of the United Nations to finda just and enduring end to the long-running conflict havebegun to bear fruit. The successful organization andsupervision of the Cambodian elections concluded animportant and crucial phase of the peace effort. However the people of Cambodia are not yet out of the woods. Thereis still a lot of healing of wounds to be done. We applaudthe efforts being exerted to enable those who walked out ofthe peace process to rejoin it as the phase of reconciliation reconstruction and development begins.Forty-eighth session - 7 October l993 9There is good news too with regard to the situation inCentral America. There  the situation has continued toevolve positively  thus rewarding the internationalcommunity in its efforts to encourage the region to findregional solutions to its problems.My delegation welcomes the growing involvement ofthe Security Council in the search for solutions to manyconflicts around the world. But the Council’s capacity torespond to the growing demands for its intervention and thereadiness of the international community to continue torepose its trust and confidence in the Council will depend onits ability to institute the necessary reforms.One such reform that has been called for is theexpansion of the Council to take account of today’s vastlychanged circumstances in comparison with 1965  when theCouncil was last expanded. I need not stress that anyexpansion must take account of the need to ensure equity ingeographical representation. This also applies to the call forconsideration to be given to increasing the number ofpermanent members.Another reform relates to the need to address theproblem of selectivity by the Council in responding tovarious conflicts. Unless the Council is seen to treat equallyall challenges to its authority  it runs the risk of losing theinternational community’s support and trust  which arecrucial if the Council’s actions are to be accepted aslegitimate.In addition  the old problem of the outdated veto is stillwith us and failure to do something about it will not makeit go away. The very encouraging practice of reachingdecisions by consensus has reduced the demand for theabolition of the veto. This has helped  but it is not enough.So long as the veto exists  the threat of its use will continueto affect the outcome of debates. One member will alwaysbe able to thwart the will of the international community.How the Council does its work is also a matter of greatinterest and concern to the international community. Thecall for transparency is a very legitimate one  but of greaterconcern is the growing conviction on the part of a largesegment of the membership of the United Nations that theCouncil has been stretching its interpretation of the Charterto include things not foreseen in Chapter VII  such ashumanitarian emergencies  human rights  ecological threats drug trafficking and the like. While the Council must beenabled to respond to new situations  there is a real dangerthat it will allow itself to be guided not by the Charter butby the dictates of a few Member States.Disarmament has always been a major preoccupation ofthe international community for reasons that are self-evident.There are far too many weapons around the world - morethan nations need for their legitimate defence. The prioritygiven to the chemical weapons Convention reflects theinternational community’s concern about the great dangerposed to international peace and security by this particularweapon of mass destruction. Regrettably  nuclear arms which pose an even greater threat  have not received thepriority consideration they deserve. While we applaud theagreements concluded by the United States and the RussianFederation for sharp reductions in their nuclear arsenals  thefact should not be overlooked that  even after the STARTTreaty  there are today in their stockpiles five times more ofthis category of nuclear weapons than existed at the time ofthe signing of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons in 1968  and the level is the same as it was whenthey began negotiations nine years before the START Treatywas signed. The reality of the nuclear threat becomes moreevident if we take account of the nuclear-weapon stocks ofthe other nuclear-weapon States. That is why we must urgeall nuclear-weapon States to accord the highest priority tonuclear disarmament.My delegation has always regarded the non-proliferationTreaty  despite its flaws  and a comprehensive test-ban treatyas important international instruments that can advance thecause of nuclear disarmament. It goes without saying thatbefore the non-proliferation Treaty can perform this role  itsinherent flaws - especially its provisions discriminatingbetween nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear-weapon States -must be addressed. The two major nuclear-weapon Stateshave agreed on some reductions in their stockpiles. Theyneed to go much further and to make clear that the objectiveis the eventual elimination of those stockpiles  which meansthat they must stop  reverse and eventually put an end tovertical proliferation. The 1995 Review Conference of theTreaty will be a success to the extent that it comes to gripswith these flaws.The most hopeful recent development towards acomprehensive test-ban treaty has been the voluntarymoratorium or restraint on testing unilaterally agreed to byall the nuclear-weapon States. That is why we welcome thedecision of the United States of America to extend itsmoratorium. We very much hope that this extension willpersuade the other nuclear-weapon States to maintain theirmoratoriums and that the halt can be used to negotiate acomprehensive test-ban treaty under the auspices of theConference on Disarmament or the Amendment Conferenceof the partial test-ban Treaty.10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThe world economic statistics for the period 1992 to1993 send mixed signals. Overall  despite strong growth ina number of developing countries  there was negligiblegrowth in the world economy. For much of the Africancontinent  per capita output has continued to decline  placingthe continent in a precarious situation. The average growthof gross domestic product in Africa reached a new low of1.4 per cent in 1992  owing in part to drought  civil wars political instability and the long-term effects of deterioratingterms of trade as a result of the inequitable operation of thepresent world order.The United Nations agenda for the development ofAfrica in the 1990s  adopted by the General Assembly at itslast session  seems unlikely to fare any better than itspredecessor  the United Nations Programme of Action forAfrican Economic Recovery and Development  1986-1990.As became obvious during the review of the Programme ofAction carried out in 1990  that initiative fell short of thecontinent’s expectations. Nevertheless  Tanzania believesthat both the United Nations and the international communityat large still have the ability to play a greater role inassisting the continent to overcome its poverty.Recovery of investments is crucial to the long-termimprovement of the economic performance of the Africancontinent. However  contrary to earlier expectations economic reform has not brought a significant increase ininvestments. Throughout Africa  it remains far below itspeak level of the mid-1970s as a result of foreign exchangeconstraints arising from deteriorating terms of trade andlimited capacity to import capital goods  and because of thedebt burden and debt servicing.Tanzania welcomes the initiative taken by some donorcountries to address the problem of the debt crisis by writingoff part of the bilateral official debt of the least developedcountries. However  this is only part of the solution to theproblem. Apart from debt-relief measures  Africa needs afresh infusion of financial resources to improve the rate ofinvestment and to accelerate the economic growth ofaffected countries.It is for this reason that Tanzania welcomes theinitiative of the Government of Japan to organize  incollaboration with the United Nations and the GlobalCoalition for Africa  the Tokyo International Conference onAfrican Development in October 1993  with a view tohighlighting the issue of African economic development asone of the central themes on the international agenda for thetwenty-first century. My delegation hopes that the TokyoConference will come up with concrete recommendations onmeasures designed to help the African continent overcomeits problems once and for all  as well as to remind theinternational community of its commitment to Africa and theneed to help the continent face the challenges of the twenty-first century from a position of strength.We have been walking the road from Rio for more thana year now. In Rio we made a strong commitment toprotect our planet by promoting sustainable developmentthrough a global partnership. Though a basic framework tomake the world’s environment healthier in the twenty-firstcentury was laid out at Rio  we have not  so far  begunmaking those commitments a reality. The truth is  the Earthis environmentally poorer than it was a year ago.The high-level Commission on SustainableDevelopment has been formed to monitor progress in theimplementation of Agenda 21 and other activities related tothe integration of environmental and developmental goalsthrough the United Nations system. Allow me to expressmy delegation’s hope that this Commission will be anaction-oriented body which will effectively translate thecommitments made in Rio into a reality  and that it will notend up being financially strapped  as has often been the fateof other United Nations institutions.A milestone reached at Rio was the decision to preparean international convention to combat desertification anddrought. The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee forthe elaboration of this convention has already held its firstand second substantive sessions and it is hoped that hopefully by this time next year  a convention to combatdesertification and drought will have been finalized. Whilewelcoming the progress made during the first twosubstantive sessions  Tanzania wishes to call for maximumsupport and cooperation from all countries to ensure thesuccess of the global convention  which has particularrelevance for Africa. The convention should be lookedupon  not only as a mechanism to attract resources  but alsoas a global partnership in combating a global phenomenonthreatening the sustainable development of over 900 millionpeople worldwide.There is no end to our expectations in fulfilment of theUnited Nations. As the largest world family  it has to takecare of all the members of the family  rich and poor  ableand disabled. The world would be a better place for mankindif we in the United Nations act expeditiously  judiciouslyand fairly. After all  it is the people who constitute theStates that need help."
"165",7103,"UGA",48,1993,"I wish  on behalf of theUganda delegation  to join those representatives who havealready congratulated Mr. Insanally of Guyana on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the United NationsGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. His election tothis high office is a tribute to his personal qualities and alsoan honour to Guyana  with which Uganda enjoys warm andfriendly relations. Given his wide experience  and especiallyhis intimate knowledge of the United Nations  I amconfident that he will successfully guide its deliberationsduring the session. In this effort  he can count on Uganda’scooperation and support.I wish also to express the appreciation of my delegationto Mr. Insanally’s predecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev ofBulgaria  who presided with distinction at the forty-seventhsession.Our appreciation goes  equally  to the distinguishedSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who hasprovided dynamic and courageous leadership to ourOrganization. He has come to grips with one of the biggestForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 29challenges to the international community - conflictresolution - and his incisive reports are an inspiration to usall.It is with happiness that  on behalf of the people andGovernment of Uganda  I express a warm welcome to theCzech Republic  Slovakia  Eritrea  the Former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia  Monaco and Andorra as newMembers of the United Nations. We look forward toworking closely with them in our common efforts to fulfilthe objectives and achieve the goals of the Organization.Allow me to convey to the people and Government ofIndia Uganda’s profound sympathy and solidarity followingthe tragic earthquake that struck that country last week causing enormous destruction and massive loss of life.The dramatic end of the cold war created a wave ofoptimism. The ideological rivalry and the attendantconfrontation between the major Powers yielded tounderstanding and cooperation  and the nightmare of thenuclear annihilation of the world receded - even if  in ourminds  it was not totally eliminated. We believe that we arewitnessing the dawn of a new era that promises thebeginning of a new order based on peace  justice and equity- as envisaged in the United Nations Charter - both withinand between nations. Whether we can succeed in attainingthat lofty goal is one of the challenges of our time.However  the events of the last few years havetempered this sense of optimism. We see contradictorydevelopments - some positive and others negative. On theone hand  there are positive developments in disarmament the resolution of conflicts  and the emergence of democraticgovernance in many countries. But  on the other hand  wehave witnessed the dangers of ethnic and religiousintolerance  which have generated centrifugal forces in manyparts of the world  often with debilitating tolls in human life suffering and the destruction of property. I wish to cautionagainst the danger of making purely ethnic and religiousconsiderations the basis for forging a modern State. Thechallenge is to find democratic solutions for peaceful andequitable coexistence in a heterogeneous society.The divide between North and South  reflectingaffluence on the one hand and widespread poverty anddeprivation on the other  is widening. The same divisionbetween the haves and the have-nots is reflected withinmany nations. Clearly  the deterioration of economicconditions in developing countries  if not adequatelyaddressed  can only lead to despair and frustration. In thelong run  such developments will pose a danger tointernational peace and security. The internationalcommunity should keep at the top of its agenda the urgenttask of ensuring that the positive changes ushered in by thedemise of the cold war equitably benefit all mankind. It isincumbent upon us to encourage and promote the positivetrends while endeavouring to eliminate or minimize thenegative aspects. Marginalization of developing countriescannot be in the interest of a better world. We shouldmuster the will to face the political  economic  ecologicaland social challenges that stand in the way of theemancipation of the developing countries.At the last session of the General Assembly theSecretary-General showed the way forward in his ""AnAgenda for Peace""  when he outlined his views on how theUnited Nations should carry out its task of maintaininginternational peace and security. He underscored the needfor an early warning system for crisis situations and the needfor timely preventive action  and he suggested peace-buildingmeasures that need to be taken. Uganda supported  andcontinues to support  the Secretary-General’s endeavour inthis area.In our view  a critical pillar of conflict resolution  bothat the international and the regional level  is the political willof the parties to the conflict and a commitment on their partto translate that will into practical actions. Where that willand commitment exist  solutions have been forthcoming even to what were perceived as intractable problems.Another critical element in this regard is the capacity toenforce solutions where agreements exist. When a group’smajor consideration is military victory  contrary to theagreements reached  this may call for legitimate internationalintervention. I have in mind  for example  a number ofagreements brokered between the parties by regionalorganizations or the United Nations which have then beendeliberately scuttled for no legitimate reason. The situationsin Yugoslavia  Somalia  Liberia and Angola are vividreminders of the need for such a capacity. It is untenablethat the international community should fail to act whilesenseless loss of life is perpetuated or chaos obtains in acountry  as was the case in Somalia and Liberia. As manyspeakers have stated  sovereignty should not be used to holda population hostage. A capacity to intervene in suchsituations should be in place. This is the question that weshould ponder in the course of our deliberations  with a viewto establishing parameters for such eventualities.30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionIn our continent  Africa  the contradictory positive andnegative trends have also manifested themselves  both in thepolitical arena and the economic sphere. In southern Africa we are on the verge of achieving the goal the internationalcommunity has always sought  namely  dismantling apartheidand putting in place a democratic and non-racial Governmentin South Africa. Here we have an example of political willand determination  and the capacity to translate that will intoreality.Uganda welcomes the progress made in South Africaand the decision to establish the Transitional ExecutiveCouncil (TEC)  the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC)and the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA). Theseare vital steps that should pave the way for free and fairelections next April  which should lead to the establishmentof a transitional Government based on universal adultsuffrage. We salute Mr. Nelson Mandela and other leadersof the liberation movements and President de Klerk for theirvision and statesmanship  which have made this progresspossible.With regard to the call to lift sanctions against SouthAfrica in response to this progress  Uganda’s approach hasalways been guided by the position of the people of SouthAfrica  the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  theCommonwealth and the United Nations. We are thereforesupportive of the statement adopted on 29 September in NewYork by the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa which recommends the lifting of all economic sanctions with the exception of those relating to the arms embargo andnuclear matters  as recognition of the progress made thus far.We also agree with the Ad Hoc Committee’s call forvigilance until the Transitional Executive Council isestablished and for the establishment of full diplomaticrelations following the installation of an elected interimGovernment of national unity.As regards Mozambique  Uganda welcomed the signingof a peace accord between the Government of Mozambiqueand RENAMO on 4 October 1992. We had hoped that bynow all obstacles to the implementation of the accord wouldhave been settled. Addressing the Assembly on 27September  President Chissano  outlined the progress madein the revival of the country’s economic and social activityas a consequence of a cease-fire being effectively honoured.The deployment of the United Nations Operation inMozambique (ONUMOZ) provides an atmosphere conduciveto implementing the provisions of the General PeaceAgreement. We commend the Government of Mozambiquefor the flexibility and statesmanship they have demonstrated.We call on RENAMO to reciprocate equally and to complywith Security Council resolution 863 (1993)  so that thepeople of Mozambique can embark on the important task ofnational reconstruction in an atmosphere of peace andstability.Uganda deeply regrets the resumption of hostilities inAngola  which clearly has negative consequences for thewhole region. Remarkable progress had been made culminating in the United Nations-supervised elections lastyear. Unfortunately  the hopes and aspirations of the peoplewere dashed by the resumption of hostilities whichinterrupted the electoral process. The only way forward liesin national reconciliation and the acceptance of the rules ofdemocratic governance. Uganda supports Security Councilresolution 864 (1993)  the implementation of which wouldpave way for a lasting solution. It is incumbent uponUNITA to abide by this resolution.In our own region Uganda welcomes the agreementbetween the two parties  the Rwandese Government and theRwandese Patriotic Front  on a process of nationalreconciliation and the installation of a broad-basedtransitional government. Uganda  like other countries in theregion  is ready and willing to support the Rwandese peoplein their endeavour to find a lasting settlement of theirproblems. This would also help foster stability andcooperation in our subregion. I wish to pay a tribute toPresident Ali Hassan Mwinyi and the Government of theUnited Republic of Tanzania  to the Organization of AfricanUnity  and to all those who have been helping the parties toreach this accord.The United Nations has a critical role to play in theimplementation of the Rwanda agreements. Both parties tothe conflict requested the United Nations to provide a neutralforce. We are happy to see that this request has receivedpositive consideration by the Security Council. The Councilhas accepted the Secretary-General’s recommendation for theestablishment of a neutral force known as the United NationsAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). In themeantime  Uganda has agreed to the deployment on theRwanda-Uganda border of the United Nations ObserverMission Uganda-Rwanda (UNOMUR) - as part and parcelof confidence-building measures - and stands ready to giveadditional support as and when requested.The conflict in southern Sudan continues to be of greatconcern to  and a source of anguish for  us in Uganda. Thecivil war has escalated rather than abated  resulting in lossof life  increased refugee flows  and the displacement of thepopulation to neighbouring countries  Uganda included. Weurge the parties to the conflict to cooperate in support ofForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 31regional efforts designed to find a lasting solution. I wishalso to appeal to the international community to continueproviding humanitarian assistance and to be supportive ofnegotiations for a peaceful settlement.The situation in Somalia is a vivid example of bothnatural and man-made disasters. Uganda welcomed thedecision of the Security Council in 1992 to providehumanitarian assistance to the Somali people and to restoreorder in Somalia. The United Nations operations helped toend massive starvation and brought hope to the people ofSomalia. Uganda is also supportive of the second UnitedNations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II)  whosemandate is to provide an appropriate atmosphere forcontinued humanitarian assistance and for reconstruction andrehabilitation  and to facilitate an overall political settlement.We were encouraged by the Addis Ababa agreement ofMarch this year whereby various Somali political forcesagreed upon a programme of disarmament and reconciliation.It is sad that the situation in Somalia took a dramatic turnfor the worse with the killing of members of the UnitedNations peace-keeping force. We regret the loss of life andattacks on the peace-keeping force. I wish to express oursincere condolences to the bereaved families and theirrespective Governments. It remains our conviction that theseincidents  reprehensible as they are  should not lead theUnited Nations to divert from  let alone abdicate  itsresponsibilities towards the Somali people. Much has beenachieved. Normalcy has been restored to much of thecountry  although chaos and armed resistance continue in anumber of areas  especially in and around Mogadishu  wherethey imperil international efforts. We call on Somalipolitical leaders to cooperate with the IntergovernmentalAuthority on Drought and Development (IGADD)  theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the UnitedNations in efforts aimed at achieving peace andreconciliation and setting in motion transitionalarrangements  including the establishment of a broad-basedgovernment. I wish to take this opportunity to commendUnited Nations personnel  the countries which have providedmaterial and financial support  and the volunteers who haverisked their lives in this worthy cause.As regards the situation in Liberia  Uganda supports theinitiative of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) for the settlement of the crisis. Wewelcomed the Cotonou Agreement signed on 25 July 1993 which provides for a cease-fire and for the transitionalarrangement leading to elections early next year. TheECOWAS Miliary Observer Group (ECOMOG) has clearlybeen a stabilizing force in Liberia. That is why it has beenentrusted with the supervision and implementation of theCotonou Agreement. We look forward to the fullimplementation of this accord.All this provides an example of the matching of thepolitical will of the parties to the conflict to the capacity inthe region to implement the agreed settlement.Equally  the Security Council decision to make it easierfor the United Nations to supplement regional efforts in thesearch for agreements and in their implementation is mostwelcome. Apart from enhancing the regional capacity forpeace-keeping  the Security Council decision helps toengender confidence.At the OAU Summit held in Cairo in July this year African States agreed to set up  within the OAU  amechanism for conflict resolution. The positivedevelopments in Liberia and Rwanda  where the OAU andthe pertinent leaders in the subregion have effectivelydischarged this role  are indicative of the potentialities of theregional mechanism.In the Middle East  the mutual recognition between thePalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel  togetherwith the agreements signed between them  constitute abreakthrough of historic proportions. This is yet anotherillustration of the dictum that where there is a will  visionand statesmanship  a way forward will be found. Thisdevelopment holds the promise for concord and cooperationin the Middle East region as a whole. We welcome theDeclaration of Principles on Palestinian interim self-rule inthe occupied territories. These arrangements  whichenvisage a five-year transition period  are an important steptowards a comprehensive and lasting settlement inaccordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and338 (1973). We commend Chairman Arafat and PrimeMinister Rabin for the courage and statesmanship they havedisplayed. We encourage all of them to persevere in thetask ahead and on the journey they have begun. I wish alsoto express Uganda’s appreciation to Norway  the UnitedStates  the Russian Federation  and all those who wereinstrumental in the reaching of this historic accord.Three years have elapsed since the outbreak of the Gulfcrisis. We are glad that the sovereignty of Kuwait wasrestored. It remains our hope that  with positivedevelopments elsewhere in the region  it will be possible forthe people in the Gulf to be reconciled and to solve theoutstanding problems so that harmony and cooperation canbe re-established. This requires  among other things 32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioncompliance with Security Council resolutions relating to theGulf War settlement.Uganda supports the efforts by the Secretary-General toensure an overall settlement of the Cyprus problem. Anysettlement  while taking into account the legitimate interestsof the parties  should safeguard the sovereignty  unity andterritorial integrity of Cyprus.As regards the Korean peninsula  Uganda supports theaspiration of the Korean people to peaceful reunification.We encourage them to continue their dialogue towards thisobjective.In Cambodia we have just witnessed the fruitfulcompletion of the peace process in accordance with the ParisAgreements. Under the auspices of the United NationsTransitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) theCambodian people have been able to exercise their right tovote and to decide on their own Government in the generalelections for a constituent assembly. We are happy to seethat a new democratic Constitution  with a constitutionalmonarchy has been peacefully promulgated. I wish toexpress the gratitude of the Uganda delegation to theSecretary-General and the UNTAC personnel who  under theable leadership of Mr. Yasushi Akashi  the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General  have contributedtowards a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodianquestion. Our appreciation goes equally to Viet Nam France  Australia  China  the United States of America andthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) which  at different stages  contributed to the peace process.It is to us a matter of deep regret that in the formerYugoslavia  instability  strife and war based on ethnic andreligious differences continue unabated. In pursuit of thereprehensible notion of ""ethnic cleansing""  atrocities arebeing committed. In spite of the grave situation  it has notbeen possible for the Security Council and the internationalcommunity to act decisively to put an end to the agony andsuffering there. The injunctions of the Security Councilcontinue to be flouted with impunity. We reject andcondemn the notion of ""ethnic cleansing"". I wish  however to commend the United Nations Protection Force for theefforts it has made under the most difficult of conditions.On disarmament  Uganda is encouraged by the progressachieved in the wake of the demise of the cold war. TheUnited States and the Russian Federation under START IIhave significantly reduced their nuclear arsenals. We wereencouraged by the decision of the United States to extendthe moratorium on nuclear tests until 1994  by thedeclaration of Russia not to resume testing even if othersdid  and by France’s commitment not to be the first toresume. In spite of the recent set-backs  we hope that thismoratorium will hold. Uganda  however  believes that acomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is the ultimatesolution. As a State party to the non-proliferation Treaty we shall continue to participate actively in the preparatoryprocess leading to the 1995 Review Conference. We supportthe extension of the Treaty  subject to periodic reviews. Weshall also seek to remove the imbalances in the presentTreaty and to secure increased assistance for developingcountries in the area of the peaceful application of nuclearenergy.We maintain that there exists an intrinsic relationshipbetween the disarmament process and development.Developing countries paid a heavy price during the height ofthe cold war as world attention was focused on acquiringadditional armaments under the doctrines of deterrence.Many of them were trapped in civil conflict arising fromideological wars. As the resources devoted to buildingarmaments are released in the disarmament process  theseshould be applied for development both within and betweennations. Unfortunately  at the international level  we haveyet to see the peace dividend being channelled towardsassistance to developing countries.At the national level  Uganda  after the restoration ofpeace in the country  has now embarked on a process ofscaling down its army to a level which the economy cansustain and which at the same time meets our legitimatedefence needs. This is a bold decision by the Government which  in the long run  should release resources fordevelopment purposes. I wish here to express ourappreciation to those countries and organizations which haveagreed to assist us in the resettlement and integration ofdemobilized soldiers within the civilian community.This session is taking place in the aftermath of themomentous World Conference on Human Rights that tookplace in Vienna. That Conference reaffirmed thecommitment of the international community to try to securethe full and universal enjoyment of human rights. We hopethat as a result there will be increased awareness in theworld of the importance of human rights and a determinationto build the requisite capacity at the national and local levelsto ensure their enforcement.Linked with the human rights issue is the question ofdemocratic governance and the rule of law. Democraticgovernance promotes human rights. In Uganda  as part ofthe restoration of democratic civilian rule  the ConstitutionalForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 33Commission has already produced a draft constitution. Theelection of a Constituent Assembly  which is to deliberateand agree on the Constitution  will be held in December thisyear or early next year.Whether in Africa or anywhere else  thedemocratization process may be difficult  but it is anessential ingredient for peace  stability  the rule of law  andthe full respect and enjoyment of human rights. This isparticularly urgent in developing countries  in Africa inparticular. They are essential aspects and conditions of thedevelopment process. We must therefore bring our fullenergies to bear so that the democratization process maygain momentum.One of the major objectives of the United Nations enshrined in the Charter  is the promotion of economic andsocial progress. In our quest for peace  it is imperative toaddress the economic and social challenges  which  toooften  are the fundamental causes of conflicts in manyregions.The present world economic situation is very grim.There has been a prolonged recession in the developedcountries which  in turn  has had a negative effect on theworld economic situation. This has been devastating for thedeveloping countries  which have had to labour in a harshinternational environment. The crippling external debt is oneof the major obstacles for developing countries. In Uganda for example  it is estimated that we shall spend about 60 percent of our projected export receipts on debt servicing. Thedebt problem has been exacerbated by the unfavourableterms of trade  especially the collapse of the prices ofcommodities  which are the mainstay of our economies.Coupled with the reduction of resource flows  this hashampered our development. Yet  while still experiencingthese conditions  our countries have undertaken structuraladjustment reforms which call for heavy sacrifices on thepart of the population  especially the very vulnerable people.For these programmes to achieve the desired objectives ofsustained growth  it is imperative that further measures ondebt relief  including debt cancellation  be put in place  moreso in respect of sub-Saharan African countries. There is alsoan urgent need to increase significantly the volume ofresource flows in support of development efforts in thesecountries. We look forward to the urgent and balancedconclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral tradenegotiations. We are hopeful that a successful conclusion ofthese negotiations would increase world trade and increasethe access of our products to world markets. This shouldhelp to increase our export earnings.Regrettably  for Africa the critical economic situationand the trend of marginalization continue. It is crucial toarrest and reverse this trend if Africa is to succeed or evensurvive in the geopolitical and economic system of thetwenty-first century. We need to enlarge our economicspace. Forging regional integration is an imperative ifAfrica is to end its underdevelopment and to be integratedinto the global economy.African integration will create economies of scale which are essential for the diversification of the Africaneconomies  making full use of Africa’s natural resources increasing self-sufficiency and strengthening the continent’sposition within the global economy. It is precisely for thisreason that the Organization of African Unity adopted theAbuja Treaty creating an African Economic Community.The Treaty stipulates  inter alia  the strengthening ofsubregional economic groupings. In this regard  thecountries of the Eastern and Southern Africa PreferentialTrade Area have resolved to establish a subregional commonmarket. A treaty to this effect will be signed in Kampala Uganda  on 4 November this year. We appeal to theinternational community to be supportive of regionalintegration by providing assistance to put in place thenecessary infrastructures.The Rio Earth summit was an important milestone onthe road to forging a global consensus on sustainabledevelopment. Uganda welcomes the adoption of Agenda 21 which spelled out measures to be adopted by theinternational community. As a follow-up  Uganda has drawnup a National Environment Action Plan to address ourenvironmental problems. We welcome the establishment ofthe Commission on Sustainable Development and of theNegotiating Committee for an international convention ondrought and desertification  in line with the wishes ofAfrican countries.In spite of the progress made  we notice a reluctance onthe part of the donor community as regards fulfilling thecommitments agreed upon in Rio. This is especially truewith regard to providing new and additional resources. Iwish to stress that for us in Uganda the cause ofenvironmental degradation is poverty. Forests  for example are being depleted daily because the people use their trees asa source of energy. To reverse this trend we need capital toexploit hydro-electric power or solar energy  both of whichwe have aplenty. We urge the international community toappreciate this problem.As regards reform of the United Nations  we maintainour position that we shall support those measures which34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionimprove efficiency and which do not distort the prioritiesthat have been agreed on  and which reflect the interests ofall Member States. We are also supportive of the proposalsfor the enlargement of the Security Council to reflectpresent-day realities. We reaffirm that an important criterionto take into account is that a country  big or small  seekingmembership of the Security Council must fully embrace  andbe seen to act in accordance with  the underlying values ofthe United Nations mandate for peace  respect for humanrights  democratization and other accepted internationalnorms. It is also important that the composition of allUnited Nations organs accord with the principles of theCharter  notably the principle of sovereign equality ofnations and the principle of democracy. It is with this inmind that we shall examine all proposals for restructuringthat are before us.We stand at a historic watershed on account ofcontradictory trends which characterize the current transitionto a new world order yet to be shaped and defined. Wehave  one hopes  a unique opportunity to construct a firmfoundation for the edifice of a future in which the interestsof all of us can be adequately catered for."
"166",7150,"UKR",48,1993,"In joining my colleaguesin congratulating you  Sir  on your election to the high andresponsible office of President of the General Assembly  Ishould like to point out that it is a great honour for apolitician and diplomat to guide the work of this universalforum representing practically all the States of the world. Ihope that your activities in this important position willpromote substantive discussions at this session and theadoption of constructive decisions  and that the work of theforty-eighth session will become a memorable page in yourbiography.At the same time  I should like to thank Mr. Ganev President of the previous session of the General Assembly for his contribution to the Assembly’s work.Soon we shall commemorate the fiftieth anniversary ofthe Teheran Conference  whose decisions laid down thefoundations of the United Nations. It was 50 years ago thatthe participants in that Conference  while discussing theissue of creating an international organization  expressedconfidence that the accord among them would ensure lastingpeace  and declared the lofty responsibility of all the UnitedNations in safeguarding peace for succeeding generations.As long ago as 1918  an outstanding Ukrainianpolitician and writer  Mikhail Hrushevskiy  stated that""Properly creating history is more important than depictingit positively"".We are proud of the fact that Ukraine took an activepart in laying down the foundation of the Organization andthat today  along with other members of the internationalcommunity  it is making a worthy contribution to attainingthe noble goals of the United Nations. To our mind  themajor result of nearly 50 years of the Organization’sexistence is the fact that world war has been averted. Thisis to the credit of the United Nations  a universal forum ofStates  a unique Organization without which it is impossibleto imagine present-day international relations.Today  when the new dominant feature of internationalrelations is the transition from bipolarity to a qualitativelydifferent world order based on comprehensive security anda balance of interests  the world is witnessing the secondbirth of the United Nations. For Ukraine  it is of specialsignificance that the United Nations renaissance coincideswith the building of our independence  our regainedstatehood and the revival of Ukraine as a sovereignparticipant in European and world politics.For Ukraine  which today is trying to find its place inthe world balance of power  its United Nations membershipis one of the most important international guarantees of itsnational security and independence. After the disintegrationof the USSR and the disappearance of the Warsaw TreatyOrganization  our country is compelled to exist next to azone of decreased stability and of alienation and eventension  irrespective of who is the initiator and what is thesubject of discord. Ukraine finds itself in the epicentre ofalmost all European developments: every crisis emerging onthe continent may affect us in one way or another.6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionThese factors led to the initiative by Mr. LeonidKravchuk  the President of Ukraine  concerning the creationin the Central and East European region of a space ofstability and security which would include all countries inthe Baltic and Black Sea zone and that would become  in thefuture  an integral part of the European system of security.At the same time  this Central and East European space ofstability and security would be a reliable link for developinga broad-based transatlantic system of security taking in thearea from Vancouver to Vladivostok  that is  the wholeregion covered by the Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe (CSCE). Implementation of this ideawould be a worthy contribution to preventive diplomacy.The basic prerequisite for the creation of such a spacemight be the implementation of the principle of security foroneself through security for all  the main goal of whichwould be the development of a system of internationalrelations in the region that would rule out threats to peaceand stability such as those emanating from the presentconflicts on the territories of the former Yugoslavia andUSSR.Ukraine is capable of playing a constructive role in theformation of such a system. As a State which is situated inthe centre of the European continent and possesses vasthuman resources and scientific potential and a strongindustrial and agricultural complex  Ukraine is ready tocontribute more to the formation of a new  prosperousEurope. In accordance with the principles of a new Europe we aspire to build a democratic State of law that iseconomically strong  politically active  peaceful and  in thefuture  non-nuclear along with others  in which individualrights are respected and guaranteed regardless of nationalityor other distinctions.In this context  I should like to dwell on the problem ofnuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine. As is wellknown  we inherited from the former USSR a huge nucleararsenal  the third largest in the world in terms of its combatpotential. The declaration on the State sovereignty ofUkraine proclaimed the intention of our State to becomenon-nuclear in the future.And this is not a mere declaration. Ukraine is doing asmuch as it can towards its implementation. The dismantlingof the strategic missile complexes has started. An agreementhas been signed with Russia on the utilization of thestrategic missiles’ nuclear warheads. We do not exclude thepossibility of conducting negotiations on this subject with athird party.However  the full-scale implementation of the nucleardisarmament programme is linked to the need to solve anumber of problems. Where do we get the money todismantle and eliminate the strategic nuclear weaponslocated in Ukraine? According to our estimates approximately $2.8 billion are needed for these purposes.How do we ensure reliable guarantees of national securityfor our State?There arises also the problem of returning to Ukraine -or obtaining compensation for - nuclear components obtained from nuclear warheads  which  after reprocessing can be used as fuel for nuclear power stations. This alsoapplies to the nuclear materials extracted from the warheadsof tactical missiles removed from Ukraine in 1992.And finally  what should the thousands of servicemendismissed from the missile forces do? We have no completeanswers to these and other questions; so far the promises ofhelp exist only in statements and on paper.The Verkhovna Rada  the Ukrainian Parliament  isdeeply involved in these questions and is looking foropportunities to adopt balanced decisions  in the shortestpossible time  taking into consideration the interests both ofUkraine and of the international community as a whole.At the same time  I should like to stress that whileconsidering this issue we should also take into account theexternal situation. For today  instability and internalstruggles in neighbouring countries sometimes spill overtheir frontiers and threaten Ukraine’s national security andterritorial integrity. This is most especially so in the case ofthe well-known decision by the  now former  SupremeSoviet of the Russian Federation concerning the status ofSevastopol. There have also been attempts to question thestatus of Crimea as a whole. In this connection  I shouldlike to state explicitly that the Republic of Crimea is aninseparable part of Ukraine. Crimea  as a part of Ukraine could play an appropriate role in the region and make adecisive contribution to consolidating the Black Sea regionas a zone of peace and stability. In this context  I shouldlike to express profound gratitude to all the countries especially to the members of the Security Council  that gavetheir unambiguous assessment of the illegal encroachmentsupon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine andmanifested their support for our State. Again  we areconvinced that the complicated issues of inter-State relationscan be solved only through firm and energetic action on thepart of the international community.Forty-eighth session - 30 September l993 7In our opinion  the objective basis for cooperationbetween Ukraine and other countries lies in the formation ofa stable and secure system of international relations. In thepresent circumstances  the basis of this system is respect forthe principal postulates of international law  according towhich the inviolability of the frontiers and territorial integrityof sovereign States is recognized as one of the prerequisitesfor international peace and security. The former empireshave vanished  and like them imperialistic thinking  such asunilateral interpretations by certain States of legal successionissues and their other actions that are incompatible with thenorms and ethics of international relations should alsodisappear.We hope that an understanding of contemporaryrealities will facilitate the further normalization anddevelopment of Ukraine’s relations with other countries onterms of mutual respect  a balanced search for compromisesand the renunciation of extreme rhetoric. Genuineconditions for such developments are already in existence and it is a worthwhile task to use them to foster mutuallybeneficial economic relations and to ensure wide-rangingcontacts between peoples.Ukraine  as one of the founders of the Commonwealthof Independent States  is actively developing cooperationwith the CIS countries. We regard the Commonwealth as aninternational mechanism for multilateral consultations andtalks that is contributing to the process of formingqualitatively new full-scale  bilateral relations betweenparticipating States and is promoting solutions to theproblems that they face after the disintegration of the USSR.Our relations with the Baltic States are developing in apositive way.Ukraine unswervingly supports the efforts of the worldcommunity to find a formula for settling the conflict in theformer Yugoslavia. We consider that a real solution to thisproblem is possible only through taking into account theinterests of all States in the region  and those of ethniccommunities  on the basis of the relevant decisions by theUnited Nations Security Council and of the cornerstoneprinciples of international law.We take it as given that all countries involved in theattempt to settle this conflict  and the relevant internationalstructures  must approach the issue very carefully  especiallywhen the use of force is implied. It must be borne in mindthat the use of force might lead to extremely undesirableconsequences  frustrate the negotiating process and result inan escalation in the conflict and its spread to other areas ofthe former Yugoslavia.Our position on the settlement of conflicts on theterritory of the former Soviet Union is similar. In thisconnection  we should like to welcome the role played bythe United Nations and the CSCE in Transdnestria and thejoint efforts of the international community in searching forways to stop the bloodshed in Nagorny-Karabakh.Tragic developments have taken place in Georgia.Signed agreements have been violated  the bloodshed persistsand people continue to perish. As long ago as21 September  Leonid Kravchuk  the President of Ukraine appealed to the President of the Russian Federation  whichis a guarantor of the tripartite truce agreement of27 July 1993  and to the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations to take all possible measures to stop the escalationof the conflict and to activate the mechanism contained inthe agreement. Regrettably  the attempts to stop thedangerous developments have been frustrated and thesituation is running out of control  threatening the stabilityof the Caucasus region as a whole. The internationalcommunity should immediately call on the potential of theUnited Nations Charter in order to bring the situation backonto a course of settlement through political dialogue.At the same time  I should like to draw attention to atruth that is as old as the hills but which is regrettably oftenforgotten: preventing disease is much cheaper and moreeffective than treating them. A similar idea was expressedyesterday by Mr. Kinkel  my colleague from Germany. Anemphasis on active  preventive diplomacy that wouldforestall conflicts should become the dominant feature ofcontemporary international relations. The fact that the issueof Sevastopol was addressed at a meeting of the UnitedNations Security Council  the activities of the CSCEmissions in Kosovo  Sanjak and Vojvodina  and thedeployment of United Nations military contingents in TheFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are  to our mind good examples that illustrate this truth.In fact  reviving the peacemaking activities of theUnited Nations has become one of the more vivid examplesof the transformation in United Nations political thinking and is embodied in the conclusion that diplomatic languageshould replace the language of the gun in inter-Statecommunication.Ukraine is taking an active part in this process. Morethan a year has elapsed since a Ukrainian battalion was sentto the former Yugoslavia to participate in the United Nationspeace-keeping forces. From the point of view of Ukraine as a new and independent State  the multilateral peace-keeping efforts of the United Nations remain the8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionOrganization’s most effective instruments in its performanceof its major function  the ensuring of international peace andsecurity. Ukraine is ready to continue active participation inthe peace-keeping activities carried out under the auspices ofthe United Nations or the CSCE.The prestige and authority that Ukraine has gained asa result of its participation in United Nations peace-keepingoperations have not come easily. Lately  human lossesamong peace-keepers from the United Nations Blue Helmetshave increased. The rise in the number of peace-keepingoperations and their expansion may result in further losses.That is why it is our belief that it is urgently necessary towork out a document to define the status of United Nationspeace-keeping personnel and to make provision for amechanism to protect them. This would be a logicaldevelopment of the provisions of resolution 47/72  adoptedby the General Assembly at the initiative of Ukraine  withsponsorship by over 50 States  and of the relevant SecurityCouncil resolution  resolution 868 (1993) of29 September 1993.Ukraine is interested in strengthening peace  securityand stability in the nearby Middle East region and welcomesthe decisions reached between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization on mutual recognition and theagreement on Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza strip andJericho signed on 13 September in Washington. The first important step has thus been taken on the road to a completesettlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.Ukraine welcomes the developments in South Africa which make it possible to lift economic sanctions againstthat country. We hope that wisdom and a balanced approachby all the participants in the negotiating process in thatcountry  and active work on the part of the TransitionalExecutive Council  will become a solid basis for thesuccessful holding of elections and the formation of ademocratic  non-racial and united South Africa.Our State is paying great attention to the experience ofthe countries of the Asia-Pacific region. The extraordinarilyfast pace of developments in some of the countries in thisregion is evidence of the effectiveness of pragmaticapproaches to solving complex political  economic and socialissues.The process of a practical development of relations withthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)countries has been initiated. We see this grouping aspotentially one of the best trade and economic partners forUkraine  inasmuch as trade between the ASEAN States - andthe region as a whole - and the countries of Eastern andCentral Europe flows through Ukrainian ports.We shall facilitate by all possible means thedevelopment  and the maintenance on the proper level  ofrelations with the States of Europe  North and SouthAmerica  the Middle East and Africa.I should like to dwell briefly on the present-daysituation in Ukraine. Frankly  we are experiencing difficulttimes now. In addition to the establishment of our ownState and the rebirth of our national culture and spirit  weare undergoing a transformation to a new system with newcivic and economic parameters. Our scholars  specialists andstatesmen have not yet succeeded in proposing a programmeof economic reforms in keeping with Ukraine’s realpotential  its historical traditions and the mind-set of itspeople. And now we have to make major adjustments to theprocedure and sequence of the reform process.Our goal is a market  socially-oriented economicsystem  directed at meeting the needs of our people. Itshould take into account economic interrelations that were objectively  formed in the CIS  opportunities for foreigninvestment in our economy  and a step-by-step integration ofthe Ukrainian economy into that of the European Communityand the world.Important steps have been taken in this regard. Byadopting a law on ownership  the Verkhovna Rada hasopened the road to privatization as the principal means forthe transition to market-based economic relations. Importantdocuments have been approved concerning thedenationalization and privatization of enterprises  land andhousing. Ukraine has declared its intention to become anassociate member of the CIS economic union  and isengaged in active negotiations within the framework of theCommission of the European Communities.However  the situation in the State remains extremelycomplicated.In overcoming the crisis  the international community including our compatriots abroad - the representatives of theUkrainian diaspora - could play an important role. Ourlegislation sets out favourable conditions for foreigninvestment in the Ukrainian economy  and a number ofmeasures have been adopted concerning participation by ourState in the European and world communities and thedevelopment of bilateral trade and economic relations.Forty-eighth session - 30 September l993 9It is important to find areas that could appeal to ourpartners and to proceed to develop and implement specificcooperation programmes and projects. An example of thiskind of cooperation can be seen in the activities that we haveinitiated with Commission of the European Communities andin the framework of the Black Sea economic cooperation.We are also ready to participate actively in carrying outthe economic programmes being implemented within theframework of the United Nations.In this context  we are heartened by the increasingattention being paid by the United Nations and its bodies andby the economically developed countries to the processes oftransition to the market economy being undertaken in theEastern and Central European States. Favourable conditionsfor broadening cooperation between the United Nations andStates with economies in transition  including Ukraine  haveopened up as a result of the formation of integrated missionsby the United Nations and the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme in this field. We hope that these missions willbe given permanent status.We place great hope in assistance by the internationalcommunity in mitigating the consequences of the Chernobyldisaster. I must say that after the appointment of UnitedNations Under-Secretary-General Mr. Eliasson as the UnitedNations Coordinator of International Cooperation forChernobyl  activities in this area have acquired new impetus.I hope his efforts will find support in the General Assemblyand will contribute to strengthening international cooperationfor this purpose.In addition to the expenditures needed to mitigate theafter-effects of the Chernobyl disaster  which account for aconsiderable part of the national income  the losses resultingfrom the imposition of economic sanctions by the SecurityCouncil against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia havebecome another great negative factor for our economy.Consequently  by the end of 1993  Ukraine will havesuffered direct losses of more than $4 billion in the Statesector alone.Today we need real efforts on the part of theinternational community to assist Ukraine in overcoming thenegative impact of the sanctions against the Federal Republicof Yugoslavia on Ukraine’s economy as well as on theeconomies of a number of other countries. Our delegationis ready to propose a draft resolution which would deal withthe implementation of the relevant recommendations of theSecurity Council and the General Assembly.Regretfully  the serious economic difficulties associatedwith the factors that I have mentioned were not taken intoconsideration when the international community last yearadopted the decision  contrary to the provisions of the UnitedNations Charter  to increase Ukraine’s contribution to theUnited Nations regular budget by 58 per cent. Theassessment imposed on Ukraine is not fully commensuratewith its capacity to pay  and is a great burden on itseconomy. As a result of great efforts  this year we havemanaged to contribute $6.5 million to the United Nationsregular budget  which otherwise could have been directed atsolving the problems caused by Chernobyl. However  wecannot meet our financial obligations in full  for the reasonsI have mentioned.In this context  the Government of Ukraine urges areconsideration of the scale of assessments for the UnitedNations regular budget and an amendment of the existingsystem of financing United Nations peace-keepingoperations. Our delegation is ready to offer grounds for thisposition during discussion of the relevant items by the FifthCommittee.The world has experienced great changes since thefoundation of the United Nations. This is understandable for  as Heraclitus said  ""Nothing endures but change"". Thatis why the issue of reforming the United Nations system isa quite natural one. Current realities raise new problems forthe world community. Even though the danger of a globalnuclear conflict has been practically eliminated  the ""local""wars and regional conflicts breaking out all over the worldare causing serious concern.Interethnic armed conflicts and economic instabilitycreate favourable grounds for terrorism  the arms trade andthe production and trafficking of drugs  and directly affectthe security of United Nations Member States. TheChernobyl nuclear power station disaster  the environmentaldisorder in the Aral Sea area  the danger of an ecologicalcatastrophe as a result of destruction of tropical forests andthe depletion of the Earth’s ozone layer are but a veryincomplete list of the ecological problems facing mankind.The need for change is also becoming especially urgentand even inevitable as a result of the significant events ofthe past few years that have radically redrawn the politicalmap of the world; more than two dozen new independentStates have emerged  thus considerably increasing the UnitedNations family. Let me extend to them my sincerecongratulations.10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionUkraine shares the view that the present quantitativecomposition of the Security Council  its functioning and itsworking methods require appropriate adjustments  taking intoconsideration the new regional realities and the appearanceof new participants in the international community.Implementing this proposal would increase the Council’sdegree of legitimacy as the body that is entrusted by theUnited Nations Member States with the principalresponsibility for maintaining international peace andsecurity. At the same time  it is important to preserve theCouncil’s ability to respond effectively to emergencies thatrequire prompt intervention.In changing the structure of the United Nations SecurityCouncil  it is very important to take into account theexistence  beyond its present membership  of participants inthe international community that are potentially capable ofplaying an important role in the Organization’s activities atthe present time and that have substantial financialobligations to the United Nations. It is also very importantto preserve in the Security Council the basic principle ofequitable geographic representation.The working methods of the most representative UnitedNations body - the General Assembly - also requiremodification. It is in our interest to direct its activities  tothe maximum possible extent  towards further consolidatingthe principles of justice  democracy and development. Thedelegation of Ukraine supports the decisions of the forty-seventh session aimed at increasing the effectiveness of theGeneral Assembly and at rationalizing the work of its MainCommittees.We are ready for further dialogue on the issuesconcerning structural changes in the sessional and subsidiarybodies of the General Assembly. This means  in particular further decreasing the number of resolutions that arerepeated and duplicated from year to year and redistributingthe functions of subsidiary bodies.In our view  the reform should also involve theactivities of the main economic and social forum of theUnited Nations  the Economic and Social Council  andshould also be reflected in the structure and workingmethods of the Organization’s Secretariat. Ukraine fullysupports the actions of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  theSecretary-General  aimed at extending the reforms in theSecretariat  and who is acting firmly in order to increasethe role and authority of the Organization  in keeping withthe requirements of the time. We are facing the task ofreorienting the United Nations social and economic activitiesin order to implement specific projects in the interest of allStates  including those now on the way to the free market.For the reforms to be successful  it is also important toensure  in practice  real zero growth in the Organization’sbudget  and the effective use of its financial assets byreorientating them towards priority fields of activity.The United Nations will soon mark its fiftiethanniversary. This jubilee is a special date in the calendar ofinternational life  but  moreover  it will be celebrated at theturn of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It is wellknown that all historic dates look towards the future.Therefore  the best way to celebrate this anniversary is toconcentrate on outstanding issues  analyse the emergingsituation and determine what the prospects are for futuredevelopment. That is why  perhaps  it is time for the worldcommunity to get together  as it did after the world wars and creatively reappraise the realities of thepost-confrontational period and  where necessary  amendexisting structures of security and cooperation and divisionof labour in order to determine the world order for thetwenty-first century. These are the considerations thatimpelled President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine to initiatethe idea of convening  within the framework of the UnitedNations fiftieth anniversary celebrations in 1995  a globalinternational peace summit conference.In advancing the idea of holding such an event underthe auspices of the United Nations  we take it as given thatthis is the Organization that can convene global conferencesof Ministers and Heads of States or Governments in order toweigh up complex issues and suggest comprehensivesolutions. Therefore  all our thoughts today are directedtowards tomorrow  to which we should come havingdiscarded the heavy burden of the confrontational era andhaving drawn upon the best of the Organization’s pastactivities  which have enriched us with invaluableknowledge. From the collective wisdom manifested in theactivities of the United Nations  we can tap the optimism sonecessary for mankind today  and the faith in its positivestrength and in its future.In conclusion  I should like to cite some words byMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General  which hepronounced during his recent visit to Ukraine:""Deep involvement in the great currents of historygives Ukraine a special insight into the world today. ItForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 11qualifies Ukraine to play a full role in the new UnitedNations.""I wish to assure you that Ukraine will spare no effort incontinuing to prove the rightness of his words."
"167",7196,"URY",48,1993,"Mr. President  Uruguay wishes to express its satisfaction and its trust in you  upon your election as President of theGeneral Assembly and as a representative of our region.Your capabilities are recognized by all  and your sense ofimpartiality and justice are the best guarantee of success inthe important work entrusted to us.We also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General onhis work over the last year  which was clearly described inhis report to the General Assembly. His personal leadershipand decisiveness certainly contribute to international peaceand security.Finally  we are happy to welcome the Czech Republic the Slovak Republic  the Former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia  Monaco  Eritrea and Andorra as new MemberStates. We are pleased to see this confirmation of theOrganization’s dedication to universality and openness  asForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 13given form in Article 4 of the Charter  to which Uruguay hasalways adhered.Ideological concepts are today lagging behind a realitythat persists in reaffirming the validity of freedom as a pointof reference in every effort to regain and preserve humandignity. The great challenge of our time is to find acollective answer to the dizzying changes that are occurringas this century comes to its close. The technologicalrevolution and the spread of democracy are the two factorsthat will empower humankind in its most genuine flowering.In the political field  the new international order that weare seeing emerge is nourished by the fall of political andmilitary blocs  the collapse of ideological borders and adeepening of disarmament. Cooperation is replacingconfrontation. The elements of power are being reallocatedin the light of the new variables that offer a renewedchallenge to the multilateral organizations in the internationalarena.In the economic field  technological development hasreplaced traditional comparative advantages withcompetitiveness and excellence. Quality is the basis for theproduction of goods and services. These trends  if strippedof their human element  would be little more than amaterialistic expression lacking the necessary sense ofsolidarity. A new order cannot be summed up simply as areallocation of the outward expressions of power. Theglobal nature and the interdependence that characterizeinternational relations today find their ethical content andlegal expression in the continuing validity of the fundamentalprinciples of international law.In this context  we are facing today new horizons andbetter prospects for understanding between nations. In thisrespect  we hail with particular satisfaction the peace reachedin the Middle East between the State of Israel and thePalestine Liberation Organization  and we welcome it as anexample and symbol of the new era of cooperation whichnations must carry forward on the threshold of the newcentury.Also  within the Latin American region  Uruguay ispleased to point to the consolidation of the peace processesin El Salvador and Guatemala. This has been achievedthrough the efforts made by their peoples and Governments with the constant support of the international community.The practice of direct diplomacy  with mechanisms forpolitical consultation and coordination  has been successful.In this context  Uruguay wishes to stress the role played bythe Organization of American States in the grave crisessuffered by Peru  Guatemala and Haiti.We can add little to a diagnosis on which we all agree.Our responsibility lies in our capacity to propose solutions both in our own domestic spheres and internationally; this isa challenge that every generation faces  taking nationalfeelings as the basis for a leap forward towards prosperityand the expression of the international community as a basisfor the credibility that nurtures the hopes of the greatdispossessed majorities.Uruguay wishes here to emphasize three particularlyimportant issues: the relationship between internationaltrade  development and political stability; the newarticulation of the concept of collective security; and  lastly the problems of human rights and the environment as part ofbroadening the concept of integral development.The dissoluble interdependence between developmentand political stability is obvious. Freedom in its mostcomplete expression admits of no ambiguous interpretation.And  just as human rights cannot be subject to the whims ofGovernments  neither can free trade be limited by thepressures of national or sectoral interests. Political freedomand free trade are two sides of the same coin.The opening of markets between developed anddeveloping countries cannot therefore be seen as a zero-sumexercise; rather  it is an undertaking of benefit to all.Greater competitiveness powers the process that begins withgrowth  is strengthened by a better distribution of wealth andis consolidated by the credibility of democracy and itsinstitutions. This shared responsibility makes no allowancefor double-talk from any side.In our capacity as Chairman of the NegotiatingCommittee of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at the ministerial level  wewish to express our concern over the obstacles in the way of14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionconcluding the Round. After seven long years ofnegotiations  certain trends continue to obstruct themultilateralization process. Bilateral negotiations arecurtailing opportunities for reaching a comprehensive balanced result that takes into account all the interests atstake  and particularly those of the developing countries  inaccordance with GATT’s own norms.For several years now Uruguay has been working hardto make structural adjustments in its economy. Policies tomake trade more open  both domestically and internationally have been put in place with the aim of modernizing theindustrial sector  facilitating technological innovation andincreasing competitiveness so as to achieve  in the finalanalysis  a more efficient integration into the world economyand world trade.Deregulation of production  reform and modernizationof the public sector as well as strict fiscal adjustments aimedat balancing the use of the country’s financial and monetaryresources have supplemented external liberalization policieswhich have placed us among those who have reduced tariffand non-tariff barriers at the fastest rate.This great effort of adjustment carried out by Uruguay- in a similar fashion to many other developing countries -has been achieved not only in the framework of deep social economic and political difficulties  but has also beenundertaken unilaterally without any compensation at all fromits partners in the international system  especially the moredeveloped countries.Thus Uruguay emphasizes once again its firmestrejection of all protectionist policies which continue to beapplied by some highly industrialized countries. These areclearly incompatible with the rules of GATT and with thestatus quo commitments agreed at the beginning of theUruguay Round. At the same time  they are a disincentivefor the efforts made in the framework of democracy tostrengthen institutions and to have an appropriate socialdialogue.It is disquieting to witness the behaviour of manycountries which preach the virtues and benefits of the freemarket and economic liberalism but at the same time closetheir borders to trade from countries whose well-beingdepends to a significant degree on access to such markets.Therefore  Uruguay calls once again and mostemphatically on all nations  especially the major tradingpartners  to make possible a successful conclusion of theUruguay Round negotiations  in which comprehensivenessand balance are values to be preserved in a strengthenedmultilateral framework.In this context  Uruguay also believes that regionalintegration is the best path towards internationalparticipation. Today nothing can be done individually.Interrelationships exist between large economic blocs; nocountry can escape that reality.The creation of economic blocs must be interpreted asa consequence of a process of integration and liberalizationof world markets. Blocs are a tangible approximation  anintermediate step  to the goal of free trade  the ultimate goalof GATT. Furthermore  this is the thrust of Uruguay’sresolute participation in the Southern Cone Common Market(MERCOSUR) and of the integration efforts of the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement  the Group of Three  theAndean Pact and the bilateral agreements within the LatinAmerican Integration Association.Uruguay recognizes that the new concept ofinternational security includes institutional  legal and politicalaspects. From an institutional standpoint  we must avoidextensive use of the powers of the Security Council based ona sense of pragmatism that might undermine the criteriagoverning the delicate balance between the main organs ofthe United Nations. The disappearance of bipolarity enablesa new political reality to pervade the Council’s decisions. If on the one hand  the traditional situations caused by the coldwar have been unblocked  on the other hand  there must becareful control of the trend towards possible excesses ofpower by those nations enjoying a privileged situation.Uruguay shares the thoughts of the Secretary-Generalexpressed in paragraph 80 of his document ""An Agenda forPeace"" (A/47/277):""The powerful must resist the dual but opposite calls ofunilateralism and isolationism if the United Nations isto succeed.""The General Assembly must reassert its authority on thebasis of the Articles of the Charter which define its functionsand powers. In the area of peace and security  the GeneralAssembly’s constitutional limitations are set out in Articles12  24 and 36 of the Charter. These we abide by.Nevertheless  its primacy is clear in the economic and socialareas.To revitalize the General Assembly is to identify itsoriginal mandate  reaffirming its areas of authority andgiving this organ  in which we are all permanentlyrepresented  stronger involvement in the Organization’sForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 15activities. This is the way to contribute to equity and thebalance of power established by the Charter. We alsobelieve in strengthening the International Court of Justice both in its administrative and consultative functions.What I have said does not weaken our support foradapting the Security Council to the new international realityby reforming its composition and working methods. Thisprocess must gain general consensus and respect theprinciple of the sovereign equality of States. Only in thisway can we ensure greater representation  transparency andefficiency.We also believe that all this energy for renewal must beinjected appropriately into the Organization’s bureaucracy.The United Nations is the sum of its organs  including itsspecialized agencies. An improvement in efficiency must gohand in hand with possible global transformations. We muststrive to rationalize our operational systems in order tostreamline administrative procedures  which often amassthrough inertia hundreds of initiatives which wanderaimlessly  at great cost  through the machinery of aninsatiable bureaucracy.International security also finds its most genuineexpression in strict compliance with international law. Inthis context  which is fraught with uncertainty andunpredictable events  the principles of self-determination non-intervention  the peaceful settlement of disputes and theobservance of good faith in the fulfilment of internationalobligations must be interpreted not as concepts that arevague or not properly drawn up by a naive legal system  butas the pillars of international relations.It is also out of political realism and pragmatism thatUruguay turns to the law as the main shield for its defence.Our former Ambassador to the United Nations Dr. Carlos María Velázquez  has said that the smallcountries""need to know  for reasons of our true national interest how far we can go and - most important - where wecan be taken. Respect for the law and internationalbehaviour that follows legal rules are the only pathtowards a consolidation of the values of culture freedom and dignity.""Uruguay  true to its tradition  continues to interpretArticle 51 of the Charter strictly and continues to claim thecompensation to which it is entitled under Article 50 as aconsequence of the losses caused by the Gulf War. It doesso not only for material reasons  but because it believes thatcollective security is based on the credibility of the rules thatregulate it.Just as Uruguay is a jealous guardian of the principlesof international law  it is genuinely open to all thoseundertakings which  in fulfilment of an internationalmandate  constitute an indispensable contribution to worldpeace and security. Thus  we believe that peace-keepingoperations are an essential part of the multilateral policy ofthe United Nations  without prejudice to the necessary effortsbeing made in the field of preventive diplomacy.Uruguay has increased the number of armed forcespersonnel placed at the disposal of the United Nations. Thenumbers are highly significant in relation to the country’spopulation and the size of its military. It has also expressedto the Secretary-General its readiness to host regionaltraining centres for United Nations peace-keeping forces.Our armed forces adopt a professional approach topeace-keeping missions  in which they are representatives ofthe international community. It gives them satisfaction tosee their efforts contributing to establishing peace betweenStates and to regional and national reconciliation  as inCambodia  where  at last  democratic values and respect forhuman rights prevail.We are concerned  however  over the risk of theseoperations’ being discontinued because of delays in thepayment of countries’ contributions. It would be contrary tothe principle of universality if  owing to these difficulties only countries with vast financial resources could participatein such operations.We believe that this policy of collective security mustbe supplemented by a policy of disarmament and a universalban on nuclear weapons. The signing of internationalnon-proliferation agreements and the adoption of theConvention banning chemical weapons  which was signed inParis last January  constitute progress in this field - progressthat we endorse. We are also pleased to highlight thecontribution of our neighbours Argentina  Brazil and theRepublic of Chile through their implementation of regionalagreements aimed at ensuring the peaceful use of nuclearenergy and the non-proliferation of all types of weapons ofmass destruction.Stability and balance are threatened by poverty on avast scale - widespread and critical poverty. Social16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessiondevelopment implies giving priority to social expenditure but only where this is made possible by real growth allowing for a reduction of the voluntary sector that isdeveloping in many of our societies. Collective security  aswell as ethics  must be taken into account in our approach tothis entire problem. Uruguay therefore attaches greatimportance to Chile’s welcome initiative in the convening ofthe World Summit for Social Development  to be held in1995. This will provide a great opportunity for serious studyof the scope of the concept of social development.The ultimate beneficiaries of the integral developmentof the nations of the international community must be manand his environment. We therefore wish to highlight herethe importance of action on issues related to human rightsand preservation of the environment.At present  technology and international peace andsecurity are based on a narrow interpretation of the conceptof human rights. Words and speeches are useless if  asPresident Clinton suggested  while we are gathered at thisGeneral Assembly thousands of children in the world aredying of hunger. What of the essence of democracy can werescue if  as in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in many otherplaces  we look on helplessly as people indulge in behaviourthat we thought had been eradicated for ever?The concept of human rights - their intrinsic worth andnature - is not affected by political  religious  sectional oreven State interests or considerations. The ethical heritageof contemporary international society cannot allowconcessions in the defence of these rights and principles.Any concession would affect the credibility of theinstitutions and values of freedom and human dignity as thebases of democracy.During the Vienna World Conference on HumanRights  the States parties solemnly reaffirmed theircommitment to promoting respect for and protection of thoserights. In this context  our country supports theestablishment of a high commissioner for human rights  inthe framework of the international system.Moreover  Uruguay repeats President Lacalle’sstatement to the Secretary-General of our country’swillingness to help in the evacuation of children who areinnocent victims of hatred and intolerance. We hope thatinertia will not prevail over political decisions or humansensitivity. Those who suffer and die in the midst ofcollective insanity must not be held hostage to bureaucraticstructures. If this happens  the documents approved at theWorld Summit for Children in September 1990 will havebeen relegated to the rhetorical scrapheap of its meetings.Integral development implies careful consideration ofthe problems of the environment. The concept of sustainabledevelopment requires a link between environmental issuesand economic and social issues. In this context  States mustundertake bilateral and multilateral commitments  by meansof conventions  going beyond mere statements. This is alsoan aspect of the North-South dialogue and of action to dealwith the conflicts of interests that it entails. Uruguay hasincorporated in a cross-border agreement with Brazil theconcept of responsibility for environmental degradation. Itwishes to reiterate the need to establish a legal system toresolve environmental disputes through codification ofinternational environmental law  in the spirit of theresolution adopted at the Rio Summit in 1992.Finding a way to force States to accept responsibilityfor non-compliance with the rules for protection of theenvironment continues to be the basis for a fair relationshipbetween the industrialized countries and the developingcountries.Such are the main issues of concern to Uruguay. In theframework of all the ambivalence  all the areas of light andshadow in the international arena  we are taking part in thissession of the General Assembly - as we have done since thefoundation of the United Nations - in the hope that deedswill be shown to be more eloquent than words."
"168",7244,"USA",48,1993,"Let me first congratulate you Sir  on your election as President of the General Assemblyfor this session.Mr. Secretary-General  distinguished representatives andguests  it is a great honour for me to address you and tostand in this great Hall  which symbolizes so much of thetwentieth century - its darkest crises and its brightestaspirations.I come before you as the first American President bornafter the founding of the United Nations. Like most of thepeople in the world today  I was not even alive during theconvulsive world war that convinced humankind of the needfor this Organization  nor during the San FranciscoConference that led to its birth. Yet I have followed thework of the United Nations throughout my life  withadmiration for its accomplishments  sadness for its failuresand the conviction that  through common effort  ourgeneration can take the bold steps needed to redeem themission entrusted to the United Nations 48 years ago. Ipledge to you that my nation remains committed to helpingmake the United Nations vision a reality.The start of this session of the General Assembly offersus an opportunity to take stock of where we are as commonshareholders in the progress of humankind and thepreservation of our planet. It is clear that we live at aturning point in human history.Immense and promising changes seem to wash over usevery day. The cold war is over. The world is no longerdivided into two armed and angry camps. Dozens of newdemocracies have been born.It is a moment of miracles. We see Nelson Mandelastand side by side with President de Klerk proclaiming adate for South Africa’s first non-racial elections.We see Russia’s first popularly elected President Boris Yeltsin  leading his nation on its bold democraticjourney.We have seen decades of deadlock shattered in theMiddle East as the Prime Minister of Israel and theChairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization reachedpast enmity and suspicion to shake each other’s hand andexhilarate the entire world with the hope of peace.We have begun to see the doomsday weapons ofnuclear annihilation dismantled and destroyed. Thirty-twoyears ago President Kennedy warned this Assembly thathumanity lived under a nuclear sword of Damocles that hungby the slenderest of threads. Now the United States isworking with Russia  Ukraine  Belarus and others to takethat sword down  to lock it away in a secure vault  where wehope and pray it will remain for ever.It is a new era in this Hall as well. The super-Powerstandoff that for so long stymied the work of the UnitedNations  almost from its first day  has now yielded to a newpromise of practical cooperation.Yet today we must all admit that there are twopowerful tendencies working from opposite directions tochallenge the authority of nation States everywhere and toundermine the authority of nation States to work together.From beyond nations  economic and technological forces allover the globe are compelling the world towards integration.These forces are fuelling a welcome explosion ofentrepreneurship and political liberalization. But they alsothreaten to destroy the insularity and independence ofnational economies  quickening the pace of change andmaking many of our people feel more insecure. At the sametime  from within nations  the resurgent aspirations of ethnicand religious groups challenge Governments on terms thattraditional nation States cannot easily accommodate. Thesetwin forces lie at the heart of the challenges  not only to ournational Governments  but also to all our internationalinstitutions. They require all of us in this Hall to find newways to work together more effectively in pursuit of ournational interests and to think anew about whether ourinstitutions of international cooperation are adequate to thismoment.Thus  as we marvel at this era’s promise of new peace we must also recognize that serious threats remain. Bloodyethnic  religious and civil wars rage from Angola to theCaucasus to Kashmir. As weapons of mass destruction fallinto more hands  even small conflicts can threaten to take onmurderous proportions. Hunger and disease continue to takea tragic toll  especially among the world’s children. Themalignant neglect of our global environment threatens ourchildren’s health and their very security. The repression ofconscience continues in too many nations. And terrorism which has taken so many innocent lives  assumed ahorrifying immediacy for us here when militant fanaticsbombed the World Trade Center and planned to attack eventhis very Hall of peace.Let me assure the Assembly that whether they be theplotters of those crimes or the mass murderers who bombedPan Am flight 103  my Government is determined to see thatsuch terrorists are brought to justice.At this moment of panoramic change  of vastopportunities and troubling threats  we must all ask ourselveswhat we can and what we should do as a community ofnations. We must once again dare to dream of what mightbe  for our dreams may be within our reach.For that to happen  we must all be willing honestly toconfront the challenges of the broader world. That has neverbeen easy. When this Organization was founded 48 yearsago  the world’s nations stood devastated by war orexhausted by its expense. There was little appetite forcooperative efforts among nations; most people simplywanted to get on with their lives. But a far-sightedgeneration of leaders from the United States and elsewhererallied the world. Their efforts built the institutions of post--war security and prosperity.We are at a similar moment today. The momentum ofthe cold war no longer propels us in our daily actions. Andwith daunting economic and political pressures upon almostevery nation represented in this room  many of us areturning to focus greater attention and energy on domesticneeds and problems  and we must.But putting each of our economic houses in ordercannot mean that we shut our windows to the world. Thepursuit of self-renewal in many of the world’s largest andmost powerful economies - in Europe  in Japan  in NorthAmerica - is absolutely crucial  because unless the greatindustrial nations can recapture their robust economicgrowth  the global economy will languish. Yet the industrialnations also need growth elsewhere in order to lift their own.Indeed  prosperity in each of our nations and regions alsodepends on active and responsible engagement in a host ofshared concerns: for example  a thriving and democraticRussia not only makes the world safer  it also can help toexpand the world’s economy; a strong GATT (GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade) agreement will createmillions of jobs world wide; peace in the Middle East buttressed as it should be by the repeal of outdated UnitedNations resolutions  can help to unleash that region’s greateconomic potential and calm a perpetual source of tension inglobal affairs; and the growing economic power of China -coupled with greater political openness - could bringenormous benefits to all of Asia and to the rest of the world.We must help our publics to understand this distinction:domestic renewal is an overdue tonic; but isolationism andprotectionism are still poison. We must inspire our peoplesto look beyond their immediate fears towards a broaderhorizon.Let me start by being clear about where the UnitedStates stands. The United States occupies a unique positionin world affairs today: we recognize that and we welcomeit. Yet  with the cold war over  I know many people askwhether the United States plans to retreat or remain activein the world; and if active  to what end? Many people areasking that in our own country as well.Let me answer that question as clearly and plainly as Ican. The United States intends to remain engaged and tolead. We cannot solve every problem  but we must and willserve as a fulcrum for change and a pivot point for peace.In a new era of peril and opportunity  our overridingpurpose must be to expand and strengthen the world’scommunity of market-based democracies. During the coldwar  we sought to contain a threat to the survival of freeinstitutions; now we seek to enlarge the circle of nations thatlive under those free institutions.For our dream is of a day when the opinions andenergies of every person in the world will be given fullexpression  in a world of thriving democracies that cooperatewith each other and live in peace.With this statement  I do not mean to announce somecrusade to force our way of life and doing things on othersor to replicate our institutions. But we now know clearlythat throughout the world  from Poland to Eritrea  fromGuatemala to South Korea  there is an enormous yearningamong people who wish to be the masters of their owneconomic and political lives. Where it matters most andwhere we can make the greatest difference  we will thereforepatiently and firmly align ourselves with that yearning.Forty-eighth session - 27 September l993 9Today  there are still those who claim that democracyis simply not applicable to many cultures and that its recentexpansion is an aberration  an accident in history that willsoon fade away. But I agree with President Roosevelt  whoonce said: ""The democratic aspiration is no mere recentphase of human history. It is human history.""We will work to strengthen the free market democraciesby revitalizing our economy at home  by opening worldtrade through GATT  the North American Free TradeAgreement and other accords  and by updating our sharedinstitutions  asking with you and answering the hardquestions about whether they are adequate to the presentchallenges.We will support the consolidation of market democracywhere it is taking new root  as in the States of the formerSoviet Union and all over Latin America  and we seek tofoster the practices of good government that distribute thebenefits of democracy and economic growth fairly to allpeople.We will work to reduce the threat from regimes that arehostile to democracy and to support liberalization ofnon-democratic States when they are willing to live in peacewith the rest of us. As a country that has over 150 racial ethnic and religious groups within our borders  our policy isand must be rooted in a profound respect for all the world’sreligions and cultures. But we must oppose everywhereextremism that produces terrorism and hate.And we must pursue our humanitarian goals ofreducing suffering  fostering sustainable development andimproving health and living conditions  particularly for ourworld’s children.On efforts from export controls to trade agreements topeace-keeping  we will often work in partnership with othersand through multilateral institutions such as the UnitedNations. It is in our national interest to do so. But we mustnot hesitate to act unilaterally when there is a threat to ourcore interests or to those of our allies.The United States believes that an expandingcommunity of market democracies not only serves our ownsecurity interests  it also advances the goals enshrined in thisbody’s Charter and its Universal Declaration of HumanRights.For broadly based prosperity is clearly the strongestform of preventive diplomacy  and the habits of democracyare the habits of peace. Democracy is rooted incompromise  not conquest. It rewards tolerance  not hatred.Democracies rarely wage war on one another. They makemore reliable partners in trade  in diplomacy  and in thestewardship of our global environment. And democracies with the rule of law and respect for political  religious andcultural minorities  are more responsive to their own peopleand to the protection of human rights.But as we work towards this vision  we must confrontthe storm clouds that may overwhelm our work and darkenthe march towards freedom.If we do not stem the proliferation of the world’sdeadliest weapons  no democracy can feel secure.If we do not strengthen the capacity to resolve conflictsamong and within nations  those conflicts will smother thebirth of free institutions  threaten the development of entireregions and continue to take innocent lives.If we do not nurture our people and our planet throughsustainable development  we will deepen conflict and wastethe very wonders that make our efforts worth doing.Let me talk more about what I believe we must do ineach of these three categories: non-proliferation  conflictresolution and sustainable development.One of our most urgent priorities must be attacking theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction - whethernuclear  chemical or biological - and the ballistic missilesthat can rain them down on populations hundreds of milesaway.We know this is not an idle problem. All of us are stillhaunted by the pictures of Kurdish women and children cutdown by poison gas. We saw SCUD missiles drop duringthe Gulf War that would have been far graver in theirconsequences if they had carried nuclear weapons. And weknow that many nations still believe it is in their interests todevelop weapons of mass destruction or to sell them or thenecessary technologies to others for financial gain.More than a score of nations likely possess suchweapons and their number threatens to grow. Theseweapons destabilize entire regions. They could turn a localconflict into a global human and environmental catastrophe.We simply have got to find ways to control these weaponsand to reduce the number of States that possess them bysupporting and strengthening the International AtomicEnergy Agency and by taking other necessary measures.10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionI have made non-proliferation one of our nation’shighest priorities. We intend to weave it more deeply intothe fabric of all of our relationships with the world’s nationsand institutions. We seek to build a world of increasingpressure for non-proliferation but increasingly open trade andtechnology for those States that live by acceptedinternational rules.Today  let me describe several new policies that ourGovernment will pursue to stem proliferation. We willpursue new steps to control the materials for nuclearweapons. Growing global stockpiles of plutonium andhighly enriched uranium are raising the danger of nuclearterrorism for all nations. We will press for an internationalagreement that would ban production of these materials forweapons for ever.As we reduce our nuclear stockpiles  the United Stateshas also begun negotiations towards a comprehensive ban onnuclear testing. This summer I declared that to facilitatethose negotiations  our nation would suspend our testing ifall other nuclear States would do the same. Today  in theface of disturbing signs  I renew my call on the nuclearStates to abide by that moratorium as we negotiate to stopnuclear testing for all time.I am also proposing new efforts to fight theproliferation of biological and chemical weapons. Today only a handful of nations has ratified the chemical weaponsConvention. I call on all nations - including my own - toratify this accord quickly so that it may enter into force by13 January 1995. We will also seek to strengthen thebiological weapons Convention by making every nation’sbiological activities and facilities open to more internationalscrutiny.I am proposing as well new steps to thwart theproliferation of ballistic missiles. Recently  working withRussia  Argentina  Hungary and South Africa  we have madesignificant progress toward that goal. Now we will seek tostrengthen the principles of the Missile Technology ControlRegime by transforming it from an agreement on technologytransfer among just 23 nations into a set of rules that cancommand universal adherence.We will also reform our own system of export controlsin the United States to reflect the realities of the post-cold-war world  where we seek to enlist the support of our formeradversaries in the battle against proliferation. At the sametime as we stop deadly technologies from falling into thewrong hands  we will work with our partners to removeoutdated controls that unfairly burden legitimate commerceand unduly restrain growth and opportunity all over theworld.As we work to keep the world’s most destructiveweapons out of conflicts  we must also strengthen theinternational community’s ability to address those conflictsthemselves. For as we all now know so painfully  the endof the cold war did not bring us to the millennium of peace.Indeed  it simply removed the lid from many cauldrons ofethnic  religious and territorial animosity.The philosopher Isaiah Berlin has said that a woundednationalism is like a bent twig  forced down so severely thatwhen released  it lashes back with fury. The world today isthick with both bent and recoiling twigs of woundedcommunal identities. This surge of bitter conflicts hasplaced high demands on the United Nations peace-keepingforces. Frequently  the Blue Helmets have worked wonders.In Namibia  El Salvador  the Golan Heights and elsewhere United Nations peace-keepers have helped to stop thefighting  restore civil authority and enable free elections. InBosnia  United Nations peace-keepers  against the dangerand frustration of that continuing tragedy  have maintaineda valiant humanitarian effort. And if the parties to thatconflict take the hard steps needed to make a real peace  theinternational community - including the United States - mustbe ready to help in its effective implementation.In Somalia  the United States and the United Nationshave worked together to achieve a stunning humanitarianrescue  saving literally hundreds of thousands of lives andrestoring conditions of security to almost the entire country.United Nations peace-keepers from over two dozen nationsremain in Somalia today - and some  including braveAmericans  have lost their lives - to ensure that we completeour mission and that anarchy and starvation do not returnjust as quickly as they were abolished.Many still criticize United Nations peace-keeping  butthose who do should talk to the people of Cambodia  wherethe United Nations operations helped turn the killing fieldsinto fertile soil for reconciliation. Last May’s elections inCambodia marked a proud accomplishment for that war--weary nation and for the United Nations. And I am pleasedto announce that the United States has recognizedCambodia’s new Government.United Nations peace-keeping holds the promise toresolve many of this era’s conflicts. But the reason we havesupported such missions is not  as some critics in the UnitedStates have charged  to subcontract American foreign policy but to strengthen our security  to protect our interests  and toForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 11share among nations the costs and effort of pursuing peace.Peace-keeping cannot be a substitute for our own nationaldefence efforts  but it can strongly supplement them.Today there is wide recognition that the United Nationspeace-keeping ability has not kept pace with its risingresponsibilities and challenges. Just six years ago  about10 000 United Nations peace-keepers were stationed aroundthe world. Today the United Nations has some 80 000deployed in 17 operations on four continents. Yet untilrecently  if a peace-keeping commander called in fromacross the globe when it was night-time here in New York there was no one in the peace-keeping office even to answerthe call. When lives are on the line  we cannot let the reachof the United Nations exceed its grasp.As the Secretary-General and others have argued  ifUnited Nations peace-keeping is to be a sound securityinvestment for our nation and for other United NationsMembers  it must adapt to new times. Together  we mustprepare United Nations peace-keeping for the twenty-firstcentury. We need to begin by bringing the rigours ofmilitary and political analysis to every United Nations peacemission. In recent weeks in the Security Council  our nationhas begun asking harder questions about proposals for newpeace-keeping missions. Is there a real threat tointernational peace? Does the proposed mission have clearobjectives? Can an end point be identified for those whowill be asked to participate? How much will the missioncost? From now on the United Nations should address theseand other questions for every proposed mission before wevote and before the mission begins. The United Nationssimply cannot become engaged in every one of the world’sconflicts. If the American people are to say ""Yes"" to UnitedNations peace-keeping  the United Nations must know whento say ""No"".The United Nations also must have the technical meansto run a modern  world-class peace-keeping operation. Wesupport the creation of a genuine United Nations peace-keeping headquarters with a planning staff; with access totimely intelligence; with a logistics unit that can be deployedon a moment’s notice; and with a modern operations centrewith global communications.United Nations operations must not only be adequatelyfunded but also fairly funded. Within the next few weeks the United States will be current on our peace-keeping bills.I have worked hard with the Congress to get this done. Ibelieve the United States should lead the way in beingtimely in its payments  and I will work to ensure that wecontinue to pay our peace-keeping bills in full. But I amalso committed to working with the United Nations to reduceour nation’s assessment for these missions. The assessmentsystem has not been changed since 1973  and everyone inour country knows that our percentage of the world’seconomic pie is not as great as it was then. Therefore  Ibelieve our rate should be reduced to reflect the rise of othernations that can now bear more of the financial burden.That will make it easier for me as President to make suremy country pays in a timely and full fashion.Changes in the United Nations peace-keeping operationsmust be part of an even broader programme of UnitedNations reform. I say that  again  not to criticize the UnitedNations but to help improve it. As our Ambassador Madeleine Albright  has suggested  the United States hasalways played a twin role in regard to the United Nations:""First friend and first critic.""Today  corporations around the world are finding waysto move from the industrial age into the information age -improving service  reducing bureaucracy and cutting costs.Here in the United States  Vice President Al Gore and I havelaunched an effort literally to reinvent how our Governmentoperates. We see this going on in other Governmentsaround the world. Now the time has come to reinvent theway the United Nations operates as well.I applaud the initial steps the Secretary-General hastaken to reduce and reform the United Nations bureaucracy.Now we must all do even more to root out waste. Beforethis General Assembly is over  let us establish a strongmandate for an office of inspector general  so that it canattain a reputation for toughness  for integrity  foreffectiveness. Let us build new confidence among ourpeople that the United Nations is changing with the needs ofour times.Ultimately  the key for reforming the United Nations as for reforming our own government  is to remember whywe are here and whom we serve. It is well to recall that thefirst words of the United Nations Charter are not  ""We theGovernments""  but ""We the peoples of the United Nations"".That means  in every country  the teachers  the workers  thefarmers  the professionals  the fathers  the mothers  thechildren  from the most remote village in the world to thelargest metropolis - they are why we gather in this greatHall; it is their futures that are at risk when we act or fail toact; and it is they who ultimately pay our bills.As we dream new dreams in this age when miraclesseem possible  let us focus on the lives of those people  andespecially on the children who will inherit this world. Let12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionus work with a new urgency  and imagine what kind ofworld we could create for them over the coming generation.Let us work with new energy to protect the world’speople from torture and repression. As Secretary of StateChristopher stressed at the recent Vienna Conference  humanrights are not something conditional  bounded by culture but rather  something universal  granted by God. This GeneralAssembly should create  at long last  a high commissionerfor human rights. I hope it will do this soon  and withvigour and energy and conviction.Let us also work far more ambitiously to fulfil ourobligations as custodians of this planet  not only to improvethe quality of life for our citizens and the quality of our air water and the earth itself  but also because the roots ofconflict are so often entangled with the roots ofenvironmental neglect and the calamities of famine anddisease.During the course of our campaign in the United Stateslast year  Vice President Gore and I promised the Americanpeople major changes in our nation’s policy towards theglobal environment. Those were promises to keep  andtoday the United States is doing so. Today we are workingwith other nations to build on the promising work of theUnited Nations Commission on Sustainable Development.We are working to make sure that all nations meet theircommitments under the global climate Convention. We areseeking to complete negotiations on an accord to prevent theworld’s deserts from further expanding. And we seek tostrengthen the World Health Organization’s efforts to combatthe plague of AIDS  which is not only killing millions  butalso exhausting the resources of the nations that can leastafford it.And let us make a new commitment to the world’schildren. It is tragic enough that one and a half millionchildren have died as a result of wars over the past decade.But it is far more unforgivable that during that same period40 million children have died from diseases completelypreventable with simple vaccines or medicines. Every day- this day  as we meet here - over 30 000 of the world’schildren will die of malnutrition and disease. As theDirector of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Jim Grant  has reminded me  ""each of [those children] hada name and a nationality  a family  a personality and apotential"".We are compelled to do better by the world’s children.Just as our own nation has launched new reforms to ensurethat every child has adequate health care  we must do moreto get basic vaccines and other treatments for curablediseases to children all over the world. It’s the bestinvestment we’ll ever make. We can find new ways toensure that every child grows up with clean  drinkable water- that most precious commodity of life itself. And theUnited Nations can work even harder to ensure that eachchild has at least a full primary education - and I mean thatopportunity for girls as well as boys.To ensure a healthier and more abundant world  wesimply must slow the world’s explosive growth inpopulation. We cannot afford to see the human race doubleby the middle of the next century. Our nation has at lastrenewed its commitment to work with the United Nations toexpand the availability of the world’s family planningeducation and services. We must ensure that there is a placeat the table for every one of the world’s children. We cando this.At the birth of this Organization  48 years ago - anothertime of both victory and danger - a generation of giftedleaders from many nations stepped forward to organize theworld’s efforts on behalf of security and prosperity. OneAmerican leader during that period said this: ""It is time westeered by the stars rather than by the light of each passingship."" His generation picked peace  human dignity andfreedom. Those are good stars. They should remain thehighest in our firmament.Now history has granted to us a moment of evengreater opportunity  when old dangers are ebbing and oldwalls are crumbling. Future generations will judge us  everyone of us  above all by what we make of this magicmoment. Let us resolve that we will dream larger  that wewill work harder  so that they can conclude that we did notmerely turn walls to rubble  but instead laid the foundationsfor great things to come.Let us ensure that the tide of freedom and democracyis not pushed back by the fierce winds of ethnic hatred. Letus ensure that the world’s most dangerous weapons aresafely reduced and denied to dangerous hands. Let usensure that the world we pass to our children is healthier safer and more abundant than the one we inhabit today. Ibelieve - I know - that together we can extend this momentof miracles into an age of great works and new wonders."
"169",7269,"UZB",48,1993,"May I express my gratitude for the honour of representingfor the first time  as Head of State  the independent countryof Uzbekistan at the United Nations General Assembly.We see the United Nations as a unique institution forthe discussion and solution of the most urgent issues facingall States and regions and the world community at large.The United Nations is a great symbol of the good will ofnations to live in peace and accord has become a clear signof mankind’s spiritual progress. At a time of radical historictransformation and growing interdependency in the modernworld  the global role and significance of the United Nationsis growing correspondingly as a political instrument for theworld in the consideration and solution of common humanproblems.Independent Uzbekistan  recognized by all States  hasnow become a full-fledged member of the United Nations.Embassies of many countries and offices of variousinternational agencies have been opened in the Republic. Iam pleased to acknowledge the fruitful activities of theUnited Nations Office in Uzbekistan  the opening of whichwas undertaken on the personal initiative of the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.I should like to take this opportunity  on behalf of mypeople and the Government of Uzbekistan  to express sinceregratitude to the United Nations and all its Member States fortheir recognition and support of my country’s independence.Uzbekistan  with its population of 22 million constitutes both the geographical and political basis ofCentral Asia. One of the most ancient world civilizationsemerged in the region  and this land was crossed by theGreat Silk Road. The history of my people goes back deepinto the past  being more than 3 000 years old. Once-prosperous empires and kingdoms in the territory of ancientTuran  Transoxania and Turkistan had a marked impact onthe development of world culture.The cities of Tashkent  Samarkand  Bukhara and Khivahave been known far and wide since time immemorial andhave had trade links stretching from China to Spain andfrom Europe to the Indian Ocean. These cities were notedfor magnificent architectural structures and attractedoutstanding thinkers  scholars and artists from all parts of theworld. The great Tamerlane turned Samarkand into a capitalcity of his empire and was famous as a patron of scholars philosophers  architects  poets and musicians. Spiritual intellectual and aesthetic values have had a profound effectin shaping the way of life and traditional culture of ourpeople. We are proud of our history and revere the memoryof our great ancestors  the thinkers of the East: Al-Bukhari Al-Termezi  Ahmad Yassavi  Bahaudin Naqshbandi Al-Kworazmi  Beruni  Avicenna  Nawai  Ulugh Beg andmany others who made an invaluable contribution to worldcivilization.Having declared its independence  Uzbekistan has nowentered an era of spiritual and intellectual renaissance andradical transformation in the economic  political and socialspheres. We have embarked on the building of ademocratic  lawful and secular society with an open-marketeconomy and a strong system of social welfare. There isconsent among the people of Uzbekistan on the need directions and forms of developing political institutions  andthere is now perceptible progress towards democratictransformation. The new Fundamental Law of the Republicof Uzbekistan  adopted last December  has been highlyreceived by independent international experts and meets theessential criteria of a democratic constitution while ensuringall human rights and basic freedoms of citizens. Free andcontested general elections have been held for Head of Stateand the Parliament. There is a clear separation of powers inthe country  and the multi-party system is gaining strength.Our people have regained their freedom following morethan 100 years of oppression and now have an opportunityto decide their own destiny  develop their culture and bringabout their spiritual renaissance. The Republic  inhabited bypeople of more than 100 nations and nationalities  providesall ethnic groups with broad and equal opportunities for thedevelopment of their national cultures  traditions andlanguages. We are proud that  despite the difficulties oftransition  Uzbekistan has been able to preserve politicalstability  peace and ethnic accord.The Republic of Uzbekistan is a country of greatpotential  unique natural resources and a promising future.About half of its population is below the age of 18. It isthird in the world in cotton production  eighth in goldextraction  tenth in the production of copper and is amongthe leading nations in deposits of rare metals and strategicraw materials. Uzbekistan possesses huge energy resourcesand has much more to offer the world market. It has longtraditions of craftsmanship  trade  commerce and farmingand is a great country for tourism. The Republic has apowerful scientific  intellectual and spiritual potential.Research carried out by our scientists in the fields ofmathematics  physics and biology has won renown farbeyond the region. But our principal wealth is an open hard-working  hospitable and proud people noted for itssense of honour and dignity.Free Uzbekistan has chosen its own path to reformingsociety and has elaborated its own model for transition to ademocratic society and a free market economy. At the sametime  we are quite aware that the Republic - which earlierserved as a raw-materials appendage of the former SovietUnion  exporting cheap raw materials and importinglow-quality finished products - with a hypertrophiedeconomy and devastated environment  can hardly beexpected to overcome in a short span of time the situation ithas inherited. Given the high birth rate  acute problems ofemployment and considerable material difficulties  economicand spiritual development can be expected to outstrippolitical transformation. We must work out a solid legalfoundation  educate people in living in a law-abiding society encourage tolerance of diverse views and opinions and above all  change the mentality of the people  whose outlookwas shaped by the command-administrative andtotalitarian-distributive system we lived under for the last74 years.Any other approach  or a thoughtless acceleration ofevents  may lead to conflicts and civil confrontation in manycountries of the former socialist camp. As we have seen such approaches have led to civil confrontation  inter-ethnicclashes and the further proliferation of problems  rather thanto their solution  and may discredit the very idea of a free -market economy and democratic reform. This can be seenquite clearly from the examples of those countries that arenow going through a very difficult time in their history. Ithas become evident today that there are no universal modelsof social and economic development that are equallyacceptable to all countries. There seems to remain nomarked difference between the orthodox concepts ofcapitalism and socialism. The need has emerged to shapenew and free thinking without ideological indoctrination which would reveal the entire diversity of the forms andways for each country’s transition to an entirely newcondition.Taking into consideration the concrete situation mentality and traditions of the Uzbek people  we haveproclaimed five basic principles of our reform. First  wehave proclaimed the priority of the economy over politicsand the de-ideologization of both domestic and externalForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 3economic relations. Secondly  we consider that the Stateneeds to play the role of main reformer and initiator ofdemocratic transformation in our Republic during thetransition period. Thirdly  we proclaim the preservation oflaw and order and the supremacy of law. Fourthly  webelieve it is of exceptional importance to have a strongsocial policy protecting the interests of all citizens  especiallythe neediest and those requiring Government support.Finally  we believe the transition to free-market relations willhave to be carried out gradually  on an evolutionary basis.A popular saying in our country goes  ""Never destroy the oldhouse before you have built a new one.""Social stability and State security are vital factors indemocratic reform. Hardly any other problem can be solvedwithout them. Uzbekistan has steadfastly and consistentlysupported security and stability in all regions  especially inour own  Central Asia. The specific characteristics of ourregion and its geopolitical situation are such that negativedevelopments may trigger world-wide instability. Suffice itto say that about 60 million people associated with various -and I stress  various - ethnic and religious groups live inCentral Asia. Both nuclear and conventional arms oftremendous destructive force have been accumulated in thisregion  and any violence may result in disasters ofunforeseeable magnitude.In this connection  one cannot avoid discussing thesituation in Tajikistan and on the Tajik-Afghan border. Onecould argue about the political interests of the partiesinvolved; however  there is no doubt that the bloody conflictin Tajikistan has arisen as a result of the unlawful efforts ofone of the sides to seize power through the force of armsand intimidation and maintain it on the basis of continuedmaterial and ideological interference from the outside. Thus numerous political forces and different parts of thepopulation have become involved in this armed conflict. Ithas been internationalized also because financial andlogistical support of anti-government fighting units withmilitary equipment  as well as training centres  were locatedbeyond the borders of Tajikistan.The Government of Uzbekistan is concerned at thecontinued conflict in Tajikistan and on the Tajik-Afghanborder  primarily because for centuries the peoples of CentralAsia have been linked by close economic  spiritual andcultural relations. At the present time  there are in essenceno real borders in the classical sense among the countries ofthe region. That is why any outbreak of conflict for purelygeographical reasons may affect the whole region.We are also concerned at the uncontrolled accumulationof modern arms in huge quantities. Where do they comefrom  and who is arming the extremists and terrorists? Whatis the world community doing  and what should it do toprevent the flow of arms into zones of fratricidal conflict?These burning issues  which affect millions of people andentire nations  are awaiting a solution.The problem of Tajik refugees has become extremelyserious as their conflict escalates. Tens of thousands ofpeaceful people have been compelled to leave their homes.Uzbekistan is sending food products  medicine and othervital necessities to Tajikistan and is encouraging the returnof the refugees  and through the United Nations officesupports the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees for the rendering of humanitarian assistance.Uzbekistan resolutely condemns extremism  terrorism religious fanaticism and fundamentalism in any form. It isin favour of the peaceful resolution of conflicts by politicalmeans  of holding negotiations between opposing parties  andof non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States and it is prepared to render further humanitarian assistanceto the Tajik people  primarily to refugees returning fromAfghanistan. In the early stages of the conflict in Tajikistan Uzbekistan twice drew the attention of the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to theurgent need for thorough consideration of the situation andits settlement within the framework of the United Nations.We are grateful to the United Nations and to theSecretary-General for their prompt response to the concernwe expressed and for their efforts to settle the conflict. Webelieve that the international community will properlyappreciate this contribution to peace. A United Nationsmission headed by Mr. Kittani  the Secretary-General’sSpecial Envoy  has been working fruitfully in the region.Data collected by the mission have  in our view  providedan opportunity to draw objective conclusions as to the natureand the driving forces of the conflict at a meeting of theUnited Nations Security Council.Nevertheless  there is hardly any basis today on whichto talk about sufficient attention being paid to the situationon the Tajik-Afghan border in the light of the currentsituation in Tajikistan as well as in Afghanistan. We havenot understood the scale and potential of this conflict and itsglobally devastating consequences. I should like to take thisopportunity to appeal to participants in this session of theGeneral Assembly to express their constructive views onways of solving this problem.4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionUzbekistan would welcome the convening of a standingUnited Nations seminar on security  stability and cooperationin Central Asia. Tashkent  a city with peacemakingtraditions  steeped in the spirit of international cooperationand ethnic accord  is prepared to be the venue for thisseminar. In accordance with Article 52 of the UnitedNations Charter  the parties involved could discuss  withinthe framework of the United Nations seminar  thepossibilities of setting up an effective system of regionalsecurity in Central Asia.Such a system could contemplate measures for thepreservation and restoration of peace in case of conflicts andwars  including collective sanctions of a diplomatic financial  economic and other nature against those whotoday would venture to violate peace and existing borders and produce recommendations for the United Nations on theestablishment of stability and lasting peace in this region.Uzbekistan supports the idea of a new role for theUnited Nations as a global institution in safeguardingsecurity on Earth  which was advanced by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in his ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  which he outlinedin the Security Council on 31 January 1992. We invite theSecretary-General to pay a visit to the Central Asian region including the Republic of Uzbekistan. I am sure that theauthority of the United Nations and the Secretary-Generalwill make it possible to prevent the negative development ofevents in the region.In ""An Agenda for Peace""  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghaliattaches great importance to preventive diplomacy in today’sworld  which coincides fully with our own view. From thislofty international rostrum  I wish to call upon the UnitedNations to strengthen further its peacemaking work specifically in zones of emerging conflicts.It must unfortunately be admitted that  in many cases authoritative international agencies react to conflict situationsnot when - speaking figuratively - they smell smoke  butonly afterwards  when the fire has already flared up and isalmost impossible to put out. To prevent the escalation ofconflicts  the international community should abandon therole of passive observer it so often plays and instead adoptthe stance of an active peacemaker.It would be expedient in this regard to establish aspecial group under the United Nations Security Council toanalyse and forecast emerging international conflicts for thepurpose of rapidly preparing recommendations for theSecurity Council  other United Nations agencies and theworld community so that the necessary measures can betaken.Current realities in the world today show that thesecurity of one nation cannot be guaranteed at the expenseof another State and that regional security can be viewedsolely in concert with global security. On this basis Uzbekistan is in favour of the total abolition of nuclearweapons. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons will have to become a more efficient treaty unrestricted by any time limits. Our Republic will activelyparticipate in preliminary negotiations for the preparation ofa conference on the prolongation of this Treaty. Uzbekistanis a staunch supporter of proclaiming Central Asia anuclear-free zone.We are firmly determined also to hold negotiations onsigning the chemical weapons Convention. Uzbekistanconsiders that we need international control over theproliferation of chemical and bacteriological weapons inCentral Asia.I should like to draw particular attention  among othertop-priority problems  to the question of stepping up ourcommon efforts against narcobusiness. We would like to seea large-scale cooperation in the struggle against this scourge this white death. It is a secret to no one that a largepercentage of the narcotics consumed throughout the worldare produced in and transported through Central Asia.Concentration of narcobusiness in a single region aloneprovides sufficient ground for the world community to focusits efforts on the elimination of this horrible business.Uzbekistan is ready to cooperate in this area with allinterested countries and organizations. We would welcomethe establishment  under the aegis of the United Nations  ofa regional commission on Central Asia for the coordinationof joint efforts in the fight against narcobusiness.We also favour greater United Nations involvement incontrolling the environment and preventing global ecologicaldisasters  and we are ready to facilitate the implementationof that noble mission by all available means.Like so many regions of the planet  Central Asia facesan ecological disaster on an unprecedented scale. First andforemost  there is the tragedy of the Aral Sea. In recentyears it has lost two thirds of its volume  its water table hasshrunk by half and its shoreline has retreated 80 kilometers the content of mineral salts has increased fourfold  2 millionhectares of arable land have become desert  and sandstormsrange at distances greater than 300 kilometers from it. Allthis adversely affects the sanitary and health situation in theForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 5region. In its ecological and socio-economic consequences the problem of the Aral Sea  according to United Nationsexperts  is one of the major calamities of the twentiethcentury.The death of the Aral Sea may have unpredictableaffects the whole world. We appeal to the world communityto render assistance in saving the Aral Sea and the adjoiningzone. In light of the global nature of this disaster Uzbekistan would appreciate the establishment of a UnitedNations special commission on the Aral Sea which  incoordination with the region’s Governments  and throughUnited Nations channels  would attract internationalresources and opportunities for the solution of this ecologicaltragedy. As a first step  this commission could hold aninternational conference under United Nations aegis inNukus  bordering on the Aral Sea.Uzbekistan became independent at the end of the coldwar. This new epoch requires a new and sober assessmentof all problems facing the United Nations and the worldcommunity. We are concerned by the growing suspicionbetween the advanced countries of the North and thedeveloping countries of the South. We regret that the formerideological intolerance between East and West is now beingreplaced by ethnic and religious intolerance. We are alsoconcerned about the growing trend towards fundamentalism extremism and terrorism.In our view  under the circumstances  the UnitedNations should be the world’s principal tool for theprevention of new hotbeds of confrontation which couldjeopardize human progress. We believe that urgent andeffective measures are now necessary so that a key organ ofthe United Nations - the Security Council - can adequatelyreflect the socio-economic  ethno-cultural  religious andspiritual diversity of today’s world; its currently conservativestructure should be reconsidered.The world’s nations are on the threshold of a newmillennium. They want to face a bright  promising futureand leave behind the cataclysms of past global ideologicalconfrontation. There is growing conviction that there is noalternative to peace  cooperation and universal security.What will the future of mankind be like? What kind ofnew era is opening? Will it succeed in overcoming theheavy legacy of the past? Will it achieve openness andsincerity in inter-State relations  eliminating mutualsuspicion  distrust and diktat  particularly the latter? Thefuture of the community of nations depends on the answersto these questions. Uzbekistan is determined to progresssteadily towards the achievement of its national objectives in harmony with the common interests of the worldcommunity and the deep democratic processes thatcharacterize the current level of its development. The Uzbekpeople are aware that hard times still lie ahead but they areassured of a great future in the single family of mankind."

We in CARICOM aresteadfast in our commitments  and this demonstration ofhemispheric solidarity augurs well for continuedstrengthening of our ties  not only in placing candidates inimportant positions in the international arena  but even morecritically in promoting and securing the best interests of ourmember countries in the post-cold-war world.I wish to take this opportunity to express our deepappreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Stoyan Ganev  formerForeign Minister of Bulgaria  for the able and inspiredmanner in which he guided the work of the GeneralAssembly at its forty-seventh session .I wish also to thank the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the extraordinary role he isplaying in shaping the future of the international system.St. Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes therepresentatives of the States newly admitted to membershipof the United Nations  namely  the Czech Republic Slovakia  The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Eritrea  the Principality of Monaco  and Andorra. Weparticularly wish to congratulate the people of Eritrea onwinning the long battle for their self-determination  and weexpress the hope that their diligence in the pursuit ofpolitical independence will be combined with an appropriatestrategy for economic achievement.The admission of a nation to this body always marks asignificant event in the international arena as it takes usanother step forward towards the objective of universalrepresentation.Adherence to the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations Charter and the right of the world’s peoples to self-determination are the main barometers used in the admissionof States to membership of this body of nations. However the Republic of China on Taiwan  a nation of over21 million inhabitants  which today has one of the mostvigorous economies in the world  is excluded frommembership of the United Nations. In this post-cold-warera  when a number of countries which once had a singleidentity and representation in this Organization now findready admission as separate and sovereign members  it isappropriate that all States capable of maintaining suchsovereign identity be so recognized. Moreover  the Republicof China on Taiwan has demonstrated its capacity to be inthe forefront of world economic development and should beprovided with an opportunity to participate in  and contributeto  the programmes of the United Nations.My delegation heralds the signing of the UnitedNations- brokered Governors Island Accord last July byPresident Aristide and the military-backed Government ofHaiti  headed by General Raoul Cedras  as an historicopportunity for the Haitian people  the hemisphere  and theprinciple of democratic rule. The interim period untilPresident Aristide’s return to Haiti on the 30th of this monthmust be a time for healing and laying the groundwork for asmooth take-over  and for a concerted rehabilitation processaimed at bringing some measure of economic and politicalstability to that long-suffering country.My delegation takes this opportunity to reiterate oursolidarity with the Haitian people  who have struggled overthe past months amidst persistent and blatant human rightsabuses and political repression. We hail the efforts andinitiatives taken by the United Nations  the Organization ofAmerican States  and the Government of the United Statesof America in bringing the usurpation of authority to an end.Let us pray that the clear message from the resolution of theHaitian crisis by international response will halt theambitions of the various military aspirants there.As the United Nations moves to perform itspeace-keeping  peacemaking and peace-enforcing roles inForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 7many troubled areas around the world  harassment  beatingsand murder of its personnel  both civilian and military  areon the rise. Earlier in the year a number of United Nationspersonnel in the Middle East and Cambodia were slain.These killings followed the murder of a nurse working withthe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for PalestineRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in Gaza and of aUnited Nations driver in Afghanistan. This year the worldhas also been shocked by the deaths of a number ofPakistanis  Italians  Moroccans  Americans and nationals ofother countries serving in the United Nations Operation inSomalia (UNOSOM).My Government takes this opportunity to express itscondolences to the Governments and peoples of thosecountries whose nationals paid the ultimate price in theirdesire to bring peace and deliver humanitarian assistance tothe suffering peoples of the world. We also wish to expressour sympathy to the bereaved families of all those UnitedNations personnel who died in the line of duty. MemberStates must be reminded of their responsibility to protectUnited Nations workers and of their obligation to actpromptly and effectively to deter  prosecute and punish allthose responsible for violence.We salute the courage and commitment of thosededicated people who continue to accept considerablepersonal risks in order to carry out United Nations missions.The international community must take appropriate steps toprotect its members and we eagerly await the submission ofconcrete proposals designed to enhance the safety andsecurity of United Nations forces and personnel.It is evident that the perceived disarray in the UnitedNations military operation in Somalia is fuelling instabilityin the country and detracting from the achievement of theoriginal goals of restoring peace and security and ensuringthe distribution of humanitarian relief  thereby paving theway for the re-establishment of civil society in the countryat large. Naturally  these objectives cannot be achievedunless the international community continues to work inearnest to ensure that disarmament is achieved throughoutthe country in conformity with the provisions of the AddisAbaba agreement of March 1993  to which all factions aresignatories.In this regard  my delegation is of the view thatappropriate measures must be taken against those whocontinue to impede disarmament  in direct contravention ofSecurity Council resolutions and the Addis Ababaagreement. My delegation welcomes signs of a willingnessto negotiate on the part of rebel forces.From this point on all actions by the United Nations inSomalia should be aimed at winning the trust of the Somalipeople as a prerequisite to the re-establishment of peace andsecurity  national reconciliation  restoration of the SomaliState and the reconstruction and development of the country.My delegation congratulates the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO)  under the leadership of Mr. YasserArafat  on concluding an agreement with the RabinGovernment of Israel to end hostilities among their peoples.We see this as a significant first step that will fail unless itleads to the implementation of the resolutions long agreed toin the United Nations on the territories occupied by Israeland the acceptance by the United Nations of Palestine tomembership. Just as my delegation has persistently endorsedthe right of Israel to exist within secure borders  we assertthe same right for Palestine. At the forty-fifth session of theAssembly  when we were discussing the invasion of Kuwait my delegation called on this body to demonstrate consistencyin responding to its resolutions  and we do so again.We wish to congratulate the Government of Norway onthe pivotal and historic facilitating role they played in theprocess of mediating in the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. Weadmire the dignified manner of their contribution andsubsequent response.The rapidly deteriorating situation in Bosnia andHerzegovina cries out for urgent resolution. The state ofaffairs cannot be tolerated much longer. Immeasurable harmin both human and material terms has already been done and the Serbs and Croats appear to be bent on thedismemberment of Bosnia and Herzegovina through borderchanges  by force and by ethnic cleansing. The internationalcommunity cannot agree to a solution dictated by the Serbsand Croats at the expense of the Bosnian Muslims. We alsocannot accept any territorial solution unless it has theagreement of the three parties. My delegation wishes tostate unequivocally that the measures necessary to bringabout a reversal of the Serbian aggression must include theimmediate immobilization of heavy weapons  placing themunder effective international control  and the effectiveenforcement of comprehensive sanctions on the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia until all the conditions in therelevant Security Council resolutions are met. Mydelegation calls on all those with the resources to influencea return to normality in this part of the world to honour theirmoral responsibility.The end of the cold war has resulted in a new spirit ofcooperation between erstwhile enemies. Ongoing8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionrestructuring of the world body is designed to enhance thecapacity of the Organization for preventive diplomacy peace-keeping and peacemaking. Regrettably  these changesdo not mean the end of bloody regional conflicts. The strifein Bosnia and Herzegovina  Nagorny Karabakh and Liberiacontinues. In Angola  Sudan  Afghanistan and Tajikistanthere is conflict and distress.The demands on the United Nations for peace-keepingand peace-building are increasing daily in the number ofoperations and personnel as well as in the scope of theirmandates. But in order to bring peace and security to thesetroubled areas the international community must redouble itsefforts to bring about a resolution of their conflicts.One of my country’s most important priorities issupport for the right of all peoples living under colonial oralien domination and/or foreign occupation to self-determination and independence. Stressing our commitmentto the goal of the complete eradication of colonialism  weonce again pledge to strengthen our solidarity with all thosecountries facing aggression or intervention or interference intheir internal affairs.Consistent with this position  we strongly condemn thecontinuous efforts of certain segments of South Africansociety to perpetuate the system of apartheid. At the sametime  we welcome the recent progress towards theestablishment of a non-racial democracy  paving the way forthe first non-racial elections  scheduled for April 1994  andthe eventual reintegration of that country into theinternational political and economic community.We welcome the adoption by acclamation on Friday  8October  of the General Assembly resolution in support ofMr. Nelson Mandela’s call for the immediate lifting ofsanctions against South Africa.The delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines isparticularly pleased that four vital pieces of legislation setting up  the Independent Electoral Commission  theIndependent Media Commission  the IndependentBroadcasting Authority and the Transitional ExecutiveCouncil have been adopted by both the Negotiating Counciland the South African Parliament  and are in the process ofbeing enacted into law.With the changing world environment the Organizationhas been catapulted into new prominence and there has beenrenewed hope  and high expectation  as well as new ideas onthe functioning of the General Assembly. The samemovement of change is also of vital importance in theSecurity Council and in the economic and social fields. Letus not lose the momentum in our quest to give new life tothe Organization.The General Assembly is a body that has beenfunctioning below the capacity envisaged by its foundingfathers. On the other hand  we have a Security Council thathas expanded in scope and power without a correspondingincrease in its membership or a reorganization of itsfunctions. The need has also been established forstrengthening the role of the Economic and Social Councilthrough a better distribution of its functions and arationalization of its activities.My delegation is of the view that at a minimum theSecurity Council should be expanded to allocate permanentseats to Japan and Germany and up to six new rotating seatsto be filled on a regional basis in order better to reflect theincreased membership of the United Nations and thechanged international situation. Certainly  we do not grantto Japan and Germany the recognition they richly deserve.The Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit was about nationsjoining together in common resolve to do a better job in thefuture and to offer our children the hope for a brightertomorrow. The centrepiece of this international effort Agenda 2l  is a blueprint for our planet which theGovernments of the world adopted by acclamation. With thecreation of a Commission on Sustainable Development andthe restructuring of the economic and social functions of theUnited Nations  we now have the institutional arrangementsin place to ensure that the measures prescribed by Agenda21 are adequately addressed.In the interim between Rio and the convening of thefirst substantial session of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment  it appeared to many that the spirit of Rio wasbeginning to fade away  due in part to the failure of theindustrialized countries to make firm financial commitmentsto the programme approved at UNCED. There is  however renewed hope because  since the June session of theCommission  machinery has been firmly put in place tofollow up on pledges made at the Rio Summit.The establishment by the Commission of two workinggroups to tackle the thorny issues of financial flows andtechnology transfer to the developing countries of the South in addition to reviewing mechanisms for innovative financingof Agenda 21 and for analysing conditions that determine theflow of financial and economic resources  such as debtrelief  terms of trade and commodity prices  is a positiveapproach  and it should give new impetus to theForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 9implementation of the global plan which the Rio Summitadopted to protect the world from environmental degradationthrough the twenty-first century. We wish to thank thosewho have contributed to the Global Environment Facility which makes grant funding available to poor countries sothat they may properly shoulder their share of environmentalresponsibilities in our global community.As we observe new trends in the world economy  it isnoteworthy that there is potentially greater capacity forgrowth of real consumption in developing countries than inthe developed ones. Those of us who live in small islandStates have limited options in response to the internationaleconomic environment. The banana industry  which is thelifeline of our economies in Saint Vincent and theGrenadines and the other countries of the Windward Islands is currently under threat of extinction. My delegation wishesto record  at this session of the General Assembly  ourgratitude to the European Economic Community for itssupport for this vital component of our economies.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a small developingarchipelagic State  with all the generic circumstancesassociated with small size  limited resources  geographicaldispersion and relative isolation from markets. Naturally wealso have advantages  which we continue to exploit in thenational interest. Development in all its forms is ofparamount national importance to us. In this regard  welook forward with enthusiasm to the World Summit forSocial Development in 1995  the International Conference onPopulation and Development in 1994  and the GlobalConference on the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States  which is scheduled to convene inBarbados in 1994. It is our fervent hope that theinternational community will recognize the specialcharacteristics and developmental needs of this category ofcountries  which have not changed in the new configurationof world politics. We pray also that there will be tangiblebenefits following the conclusion of these Conferences.The United Nations has designated 1993 theInternational Year for the World’s Indigenous People.Forced off their ancestral lands by settlers and colonizers indigenous peoples in many parts of the world have faceduntold discrimination and poverty and are often affordedlittle say in their political future. It is no surprise  therefore that they are increasingly seeking to exercise their full rangeof human rights. The world’s communities are urged totreat minorities and indigenous peoples  and personsbelonging to them  on the basis of equality  and to takemeasures that would  inter alia  facilitate their fullparticipation in all aspects of the political  economic  social religious and cultural life of the society.My delegation is proud to state that in Saint Vincentand the Grenadines the indigenous people  the Caribs  arefully integrated into Vincentian society and are beneficiariesof all rights and freedoms under our Constitution. Theyparticipate fully in the political process  and today an activerepresentative in the House of Assembly is a descendant ofJoseph Chatoyer  the Paramount Chief of the Caribs and anational hero of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. OurGovernment has also taken specific steps  through its landreform and distribution policy  to empower the Caribs  whoare the main beneficiaries of the Government’s acquisitionof the area formerly occupied by Orange Hill Estates  andthe subsequent distribution  with title  of economically viableplots to them.My Government will ensure that our indigenous peoplecontinue to participate fully in national society and that theirviews are solicited and taken into consideration indecision-making processes that affect them and the nation asa whole.My delegation is proud to co-sponsor a draft resolutionof the Standing Committee of Caribbean MinistersResponsible for Foreign Affairs of the CaribbeanCommunity calling for the annual observance of anInternational Day of Indigenous Peoples. I hope that thisdraft resolution  when brought before this body  will beadopted by acclamation and will receive unanimousfollow-up support from Member countries.The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadineswelcomes and values highly the deepening of relationsbetween the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and LatinAmerica in general. We are also encouraged by the degreeof cooperation which is being developed betweenCARICOM and Central America. In the increasinglycompetitive world environment  which is gradually beingdominated by large trading blocs  it is imperative for ourcountries in Latin America and the Caribbean to forge closerties through economic and other forms of functionalcooperation.My Government totally condemns the illicit production trafficking in and consumption of drugs. These harbingersof violent crime and corruption pose a serious threat to thehealth and well-being of our economies and our people endanger our democratic institutions and jeopardize nationaland regional security.10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionWe are firmly convinced that only integrated regionaland international efforts can effectively address the drugproblem  and  accordingly  we stress the need for increasedlocal  regional and international cooperation. Greateremphasis should be placed on programmes that generateemployment and income for persons attracted to drugproduction and trafficking as a means of livelihood. Theseshould be pursued concurrently with programmes for theprevention of drug use and the rehabilitation of drug users.The appropriate measures must also be taken to strengthenour judicial institutions to ensure that the perpetrators ofdrug abuse and related crimes are brought to swift andeffective justice.We in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are closelyobserving the evolution of democracy in the States ofEastern Europe and the territories of the former SovietUnion  as well as its consolidation worldwide. We agonizedwith freedom-loving peoples when the Russian constitutionalcrisis threatened to ""put democracy under a shade."" Weregret the loss of life that resulted from the struggle forcontrol  and we hope that the emergence of a full- fledgedsystem of democracy  with the ultimate power residing in thehands of the people  will not be impeded by any self-servingacts on the part of major players.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes theconstitutional resolution of the political impasse in Pakistan.As a member of the Commonwealth  we welcome Mrs.Benazir Bhutto back as Prime Minister of her country andlook forward to meeting her in Cyprus at the CommonwealthHeads of Government meeting.My delegation wishes to reiterate its resolutecommitment to the democratic ideal and the concomitantfree enterprise system. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines like the other countries of CARICOM  has gone through ahistoric constitutional journey  from Crown ColonyGovernment  with its limited franchise  to full politicalindependence under universal adult suffrage. We haveadhered to the principles and practice of participatorydemocracy and the market economy  even when these idealswere not as pervasive and mandatory as they are today. Wehave stayed the course  by choice and conviction  and ourpeople have reaped the benefits. They will have it no otherway.In this post-cold-war era we are determined to maintainthe gains of our democracy which we have accumulated overthe years  even as we face the increasing difficultiesassociated with the marginalization of small States in theface of bloc consolidation and other emerging trends of ourtime."
"171",7361,"VEN",48,1993,"Allow me  on behalf of Venezuela  to extendto you  Sir  our very special congratulations on your electionas President of the General Assembly at its forty-eighthsession. It is of great significance to us that the PermanentRepresentative of Guyana - a country with which wemaintain special relations of friendship and cooperation -should be directing the work of this important Assembly.The President of Venezuela  Mr. Ramon J. Velásquez  wouldhave liked to be present on this important occasion.However  the current situation in the country necessitates hisremaining in Caracas.In recent months Venezuela has had to assumeexceptional responsibilities. Yesterday marked the end ofour term as president of the Security Council. During thatterm  events of vital importance have taken place in theworld. In particular  during the past 12 months we havewitnessed with horror the re-emergence of hatreds  barbarismand episodes of ethnic cleansing that we thought had beenconsigned for ever to the saddest and blackest pages ofhistory. In the conflict that is tearing apart the formerRepublic of Yugoslavia  Venezuela has played an importantrole - a role widely recognized by the other members of theCouncil - in the protection of human rights. Acting withinthe framework of the international bodies  we have sought above all  to restore peace to that tormented region.The United Nations has accumulated a wealth ofexperience in the deployment of operations for themaintenance of order - even in some situations in whichpeace had not yet been attained. With the new situation inthe world  an organization that was established for purposesof dialogue and negotiation is faced with challenges of adifferent kind. From the maintenance of order in atraditional sense  it has moved on to operations that includemilitary aspects  humanitarian  institutional and electoralassistance  the monitoring of human-rights issues and evendevelopment aid. In recent months the United Nations hasplayed an active and varied role against an ever-changinginternational background.This year  too  the world has seen the emergence of newhopes. In one of the most strife-torn regions of the planet where there appeared to be no prospect of understanding orfuture coexistence  two old enemies  the State of Israel andthe Palestine Liberation Organization  have taken significantsteps towards a joint search for peace and the harmoniousdevelopment of the two peoples. Venezuela welcomes theWashington agreement between Israel and the PLO  and willwork within the framework of the United Nations to achievea body of measures and resolutions that will help to erasethe hatreds of a past that is still too close. Similarly  wesupport the peace initiatives and the process ofdemilitarization and the non-proliferation of nuclear weaponsthat have always been an essential part of the work of thisAssembly.Forty-eighth session - 1 October l993 9During our months on the Security Council  we haveexperienced  at first hand  the accelerated pace of worldevents today. We are concerned at the uncertainty of theroads to be taken and the instability that prevails in manycorners of the world. There are no longer any ideologies established values or clear directions. Nevertheless  amidstall the confusion a few issues have emerged which couldbecome the single prevalent ideology of mankind. These arehuman rights  the defence of democracy and the protectionof the environment.Last June  in Vienna  the United Nations sponsored thatremarkable encounter  the World Conference on HumanRights. We engaged there in a fruitful dialogue betweenGovernments and non-governmental organizations  with theaim of working together to wipe out the injustices that stillexist in our countries. In Vienna  we came to realize thatthe protection of human rights has become a topic of interestto people of different races from all parts of the world. TheConference confirmed the universal value of those rights andreaffirmed that democracy  human rights and developmentare equally important and mutually reinforcing objectives.The further improvement of democracy might begin inthis Organization  where the reform of the Security Councilcontinues to be necessary in order to make its decisionsmore representative. The General Assembly must attach theproper importance to the discussion of this issue. Venezuelashares the general concern with making the United Nationsa more transparent and democratic Organization. The newinternational scenario calls for a more representative SecurityCouncil without exclusive rights that discriminate againstsome Member States.In the context of the defence of democracy  the UnitedNations and regional organizations have made outstandingefforts  especially in Haiti  where it is our hope that thelawfully constituted Government will be restored  and inGuatemala  where forces attempting a coup d’état weredefeated by the weight of civil society. Today  democraticregimes prevail in almost all of Latin America. However our democracies are still young and have experienceddifficulties in recent months.In Venezuela  we have overcome a severe politicalcrisis which undoubtedly had the result of strengthening ourinstitutions. Following a process which took place entirelywithin the framework of the law  Mr. Ramón J. Velásquezsucceeded to the highest office. He is a distinguishedhistorian  respected by all political forces in the country forthe honesty he has shown in his career and for his profoundknowledge of the Venezuelan mentality.Democracy is a system of values within which respectfor institutions is not only a duty but a necessity. Therehave always been attempts in Latin America to justify theuse of force. Order  the fight against terrorism orcommunism  the inefficiency of the State: these reasonshave often been used to justify regimes that  finally  did notre-establish order but abolished freedom. In the past  thishas happened in Venezuela. Today  we have the serenity ofwaiting for our institutions to function  and we can now saywith pride that democracy persists in Venezuela and that wehave been able to overcome a serious political crisis.Nevertheless  our future is clouded by economicdifficulties. The defence and maintenance of democracyrequires the full cooperation of the industrialized countriesin the search for a form of economic development that willafford our impoverished peoples a life of dignity. Hence we support the proposal by the President of the GeneralAssembly  Mr. Samuel Insanally  for a summit to discuss theworld’s economic problems and agree on programmes ofaction to solve them. We agree that the ""Agenda for Peace""put forward by the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  should be complemented by anagenda for development which would place socio-economicproblems on the same level as those of a purely politicalnature. The establishment and preservation of democracyinvolves reaching a balanced and equitable global growthrate.Balanced growth was the central topic of the firstsession of the Commission on Sustainable Development inNew York. The establishment of that Commission is one ofthe most significant outcomes of the Earth Summit in Rio deJaneiro. There is an intimate link between the issue ofdevelopment  the financial resources required in order toattain it and the strict protection of the environment. Despitethe lack of encouraging results  we still believe firmly in theRio Declaration on Environment and Development  and wewish to draw particular attention to Principles 3 and 4  whichread as follows:Principle 3:""The right to development must be fulfilled so as toequitably meet developmental and environmental needsof present and future generations.""Principle 4:""In order to achieve sustainable development environmental protection shall constitute an10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionintegral part of the development process andcannot be considered in isolation from it.""Accordingly  we are greatly concerned at what ishappening on Venezuela’s Amazonian border. My countryhas attached very special importance to the preservation ofnature. Fully 17 per cent of our territory consists ofspecially protected national parks in which economicactivities are closely monitored and restricted. On thesouthern border  in particular  we have had the support ofscientific organizations and universities in the establishmentof the Alto Orinoco-Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve  coveringan area of 60 000 square kilometres. In this zone  by law economic activities must be compatible with the fragility ofthe tropical forest ecosystem. Particular importance isattached to the cultural and linguistic heritage of theindigenous peoples  whose way of life has always beencompatible with preservation of the environment.Over the past five years  unfortunately  we haveundergone a true invasion whose results are disastrous forthe environment and which has introduced a climate ofviolence hitherto unknown in the area.The cause is illegal mining  which  while takingadvantage of the forested and inaccessible nature ofAmazonia  is destroying rivers and whole hectares ofvegetation. This phenomenon has reached a scale largeenough to cause concern  to the point that it is escapingcontrol by the States. Just recently - last July - illegalminers massacred a group of Venezuelans  of the Yanomamitribe. Brazil and Venezuela  where the criminal act wascarried out  have established an ad hoc commission toinvestigate the facts and to make sure that the criminals arepunished. But the fact that these events can occur gives aclear idea of the seriousness of the situation we are facing inAmazonia. Trees are being cut down  the sources of ourgreat rivers are being deforested  the waters of the greattropical forest are being polluted with mercury and theindigenous population  the original inhabitants of the region are being murdered.The Amazonian border of Venezuela  2 200 kilometreslong  has been preserved. On our side there is the biospherereserve  and in Brazil there is the Yanomami park established in 1992 and covering 94 000 square kilometres.Nevertheless  the deaths of the indigenous Venezuelans showthat violence and destruction are beginning to penetrate theseprotected areas. Illegal mining is a business behind whichare the gold and diamond transnationals that arm them provide them with machinery and build landing strips in theforest. They are deforesting Amazonia. Each year an areaof forest the size of Portugal is destroyed. They are wipingout plants and animals: it is estimated that1 200 000 species will disappear in the next 25 years. Theyare annihilating the local population  and this in 1993  whenthe whole world is commemorating the International Yearfor the World’s Indigenous People.Therefore  Venezuela addresses the internationalcommunity to denounce this serious environmental situation.All the countries of the Amazon Basin have clearlyproclaimed our sovereignty over the land in question.Amazonia belongs to us  but we have the responsibility toprotect it  now and for future generations. We must worktogether to preserve our tropical forest. Each country in theregion is making special efforts to take up the challenge ofsustainable development in this zone where the ecologicalbalance is so precarious. We particularly welcome theestablishment in Brazil of the Ministry of the Environmentand the Conservation of Amazonia  which will undoubtedlybe an important factor in solving the problem. Only openand sincere dialogue between the countries of the region willenable us to resist the gold and diamond multinationals thatare destroying  without regard for morality  this importantpart of the heritage of mankind.We must live up to the environmental commitmentsentered into at the Rio Summit. We need technical supportand political  economic and social backing to confront theeconomic interests that are destroying our heritage. I appealto the mining transnationals to understand that developmentdoes not mean destruction; to international agencies to helpus implement the principles of sustainable development inthis zone; and to the wealthiest countries to understand that while poverty and ignorance persist among large segmentsof the population in Latin America  violence andenvironmental destruction will continue.The United Nations has performed a monumental taskin convening the Earth Summit and the Conference onHuman Rights  and now the major meetings on populationand social development. The resolutions adopted at theseconferences are now being violated in Amazonia. Venezuelais making a great effort to ensure the preservation of theenvironment  often in areas to which access is extremelydifficult. We are fighting for human rights among peoplewho are not accustomed to respecting the law. We aretrying to proceed in accordance with the principles ofsustainable development  standing up to the companies thatare seeking only to extract the wealth of the soil at a rapidpace. These are difficult tasks  but we are convinced thatthis effort is necessary in order to conserve our Amazoniaand preserve it for future generations of our peoples and alsoForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 11for future generations of all mankind. The United Nationsis the appropriate forum for the whole world to learn of ourefforts to preserve this territory  its biodiversity and theintegrity of its rightful inhabitants."
"172",7400,"VNM",48,1993,"Onbehalf of the delegation of the Socialist Republic of VietNam  I should like to extend to Ambassador Insanally warmcongratulations on his election to the presidency of thisforty-eighth session of the General Assembly.We regard highly the vast efforts made and positiveachievements attained by His Excellency theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  in hisposition of lofty responsibility  towards the cause of peace international security  development and cooperation amongnations. In April of this year it was with warmth and highesteem  and moved by a desire to enhance Viet Nam’scooperation with the United Nations  that our Governmentand people welcomed the Secretary-General in our country.We wish to congratulate the new Members of ourUnited Nations family.In the year since the previous session of our GeneralAssembly  the world has offered us a chiaroscuro picture ofopportunities intermingled with challenges  of hopes mixedwith anxieties. The threat of a global war of annihilationcontinues to recede  and we are witnessing an increasingtrend towards dialogue and cooperation  in new forms andthrough new mechanisms  in different regions and on aworld-wide scale. The progress towards restoration of peacein a number of places  especially in Cambodia and the12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionMiddle East  brings glad tidings to the whole world anddemonstrates that in our day and age it is still possible through peaceful negotiations  to settle conflicts that wereonce fierce and protracted.However  humanity’s conscience and reason remainprofoundly disturbed by the bloody conflicts which areinflicting death and pain on peoples and provoking regionaland international instability  by potentially explosivetendencies to increase armaments in certain parts of theworld  by the widening gap between the developed and thedeveloping world and by other important and pressingproblems of a global nature  such as demographic explosion environmental degradation  dangerous diseases  transnationalcrime  and so on.In an unstable world whose evolution is fraught withcomplexities  the United Nations  while taking account of thedirect responsibility of nations concerned  is facing majorchallenges in the discharge of its primary responsibility namely the restoration and preservation of peace andstability. Never before has the United Nations been presentand active in so many hot spots across the continents as it istoday. In this regard the Secretary-General has given us acomprehensive approach to the problem in his report ""AnAgenda for Peace"". (A/47/277)It is the earnest desire of the people of Viet Nam thatpeace  closely linked with national independence andsovereignty  be primary components of the new world order.We endorse the view expressed in the report of theSecretary-General on the work of the Organization (A/48/1)that""States and their sovereignty are increasinglyrecognized as indispensable building-blocks ofinternational order and problem-solving"". (A/48/1 para. 13)Respect for the national independence  sovereignty andidentity of each country  the strengthening of internationalcooperation  and the settlement of disputes through peacefulnegotiations and mutual accommodation  considering peace stability and cooperation to be the fundamental  long-terminterest of each State and of the international community:all these are guiding principles in inter-State relations principles that the United Nations and its Member Statesmust respect. The Security Council is vested with theprimary responsibility for the activities of the United Nationsin respect of the restoration and safeguarding of peace. Thismission  however  devolves not solely on the SecurityCouncil but on all nations. Member States should thereforehave a say in determining the objectives and guidingprinciples for decisions and actions undertaken by theSecurity Council with regard to international peace andsecurity. Only by so doing can the United Nations truly bea universal Organization and a common instrument for thecommunity of nation-States. The principles of respect forthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  ofnon-coercion and non-interference in the internal affairs ofStates  of attainment of the consent of the parties concerned and perseverance in the settlement of disputes throughpeaceful negotiations: such are the principles that shouldgovern the Security Council’s decisions.Today the world is witnessing miraculous advances inscience and technology. In that world  however  somehundred countries and with them billions of human beingsare in danger of falling behind in the general advancementof mankind  while the wealth and property of the world areconcentrated in the hands of a few developed countries. Thegap in development levels is steadily widening. This together with the accumulated external debt burden  has putdeveloping countries at a constant disadvantage inNorth-South economic and trade relations. This realitycarries potential challenges to security and stability  bothregional and international. We should therefore fullycomprehend  now more than ever  the interrelation betweenpeace  security and development.We support the proposal for the United Nations to workout a comprehensive and effective ""agenda fordevelopment""  considering the implementation of such anagenda through enhanced resources as a fundamental factorfor the establishment of a new  sound and equitable worldorder. Development programmes of the United Nations andassistance from highly developed countries to developingcountries  especially poor countries  are undertakings whichdo not benefit one side only; rather  they are necessary forthe overall stability and development of the world and thevarious regions as well as of each State. We are of the viewthat attaching political conditions to development assistanceand cooperation runs counter to the principle of equality andmutual benefit of wholesome international relations.On the other hand  poor countries hope that the rapidlyincreasing cost of peace-keeping operations will not affectthe ability of the United Nations in the field of developmentcooperation  and they wish to see balanced attention on thepart of the United Nations to both the Agenda for Peace andthat for development.One important direction of the United Nations activitiesthat reflect the broadening attention given in this regard byForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 13the international community is the promotion of democracyand human rights. The World Conference on Human Rightsheld in Vienna last June clearly pointed out the closerelationship between democracy and human rights. In ourview  one should accord equal importance to  and promoteconcurrently  democracy within each country and democracyin inter-State relations. Respect for human rights must gotogether with respect for equality among States as well asbetween the United Nations and Member States. The UnitedNations itself needs to reform its organization and mode ofoperation so as to ensure democracy  justice and equality forall Member States.An enlargement in the membership of the SecurityCouncil to enhance its representativeness  the promotion ofgreater transparency in the work of this body of authoritywithin the United Nations system  the strengthening of theeffectiveness of the General Assembly  the improvement ofthe relationship among the United Nations organs  togetherwith perfecting the mechanisms and streamlining themachinery to ensure better efficiency and effectiveness ofthe United Nations activities - all these are urgent demandsfacing us as we are approaching the fiftieth anniversary ofthis Organization. Together with many other countries -member States of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in particular - Viet Nam considers human rights to beprimarily the concern and interest of each country  thepursuit of democracy and human rights in one country to be first and essentially  the responsibility of that country andnation. At the same time  States may cooperate with oneanother in the promotion of democracy and human rights onthe basis of respect for national independence andsovereignty  the right to self-determination  the right of anation to choose its own path of development  in accordancewith the purposes and principles set forth in the UnitedNations Charter  the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsand the two basic International Covenants on Human Rights.We consider using imposed standards of human rights anddemocracy as preconditions for inter-State cooperation to bea manifestation of inequality and lack of democracy ininternational relations.The Vienna Conference identified areas of agreementand at the same time revealed outstanding differences ofviews on human rights. We hope that  proceeding from thecommitment to the common cause of human rightsprotection and promotion  from the recognition of both theuniversality and the specificity of human rights  countrieswill engage in a dialogue in a spirit of mutual respect witha view to achieving a unity of purpose in a diversity of waysand means of implementation in the field of human rights.The Vienna Conference also put forth recommendationsaimed at consolidating and strengthening the role andeffectiveness of the United Nations in regard to humanrights. To achieve this end  it is our view that we shouldmake full use of the relevant existing machinery andmechanisms of the United Nations and enhance theirefficiency and effectiveness. Taking account of the need tostreamline its machinery  the Organization must carefullyscrutinize and weigh any initiative for the establishment ofnew mechanisms.Viet Nam is a country that has lived through protracted devastating wars in which the use of millions of tons ofbombs  ammunition and toxic chemicals has causeddestruction of the environment  misery  loss of life andserious consequences for several generations now. It hasbeen undertaking a process of renewal  overcoming manydifficulties and challenges to achieve stability  developmentand integration into the international community.Located in the most dynamic region for development inthe world  Viet Nam has both assets and difficulties opportunities and challenges stemming from its specifichistorical circumstances  natural conditions and itsgeopolitical and geoeconomic position. We are now facingthe acute challenge of how to overcome  soon  our state ofpoverty and underdevelopment  and join the mainstream ofprogress in the region. The only way is to tap all domesticresources  which  first and foremost  means bringing into fullplay the dynamism and creativity of every Vietnamese  andat the same time expanding international cooperation infriendship with all countries based on the principle of mutualrespect for national independence and sovereignty  and onequality and mutual benefit.This imperative need impels us to initiate and step upefforts towards renewal in every sphere of social life; at itscore  this is focused on a market economy and on perfectingthe rule of law in a State that is truly of the people  by thepeople and for the people.The process of renewal focuses on the economic fieldwith a view to developing a multisectoral economy operatingunder the market mechanism  to establishing an economicsystem that is open both domestically and externally  and toimproving the functions and management patterns of theState. Under embargo conditions  and at a point wheresources of major assistance from the countries of the Councilfor Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) are no longeravailable  the renewal process has helped Viet Nam’seconomy overcome the most difficult hurdle and end therecession  reduce and maintain control over inflation  achieveaverage growth in gross domestic product of 7.2 per cent14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionduring the past three years  1991 to 1993  accumulateinitially modest levels of domestic savings  and graduallyimprove the life of the people.Viet Nam has been attracting increasing foreign directinvestment and development assistance. On behalf of theGovernment and the people of Viet Nam  I should like toexpress our sincere thanks to various agencies of the UnitedNations system  such as the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the United Nations Children’s Fund  the UnitedNations Population Fund  the World Food Programme  theFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations the World Health Organization  the United Nations IndustrialDevelopment Organization  the Economic and SocialCommission for Asia and the Pacific and others  as well asmany Governments and non-governmental organizations inthe world  for maintaining  resuming and increasingdevelopment and humanitarian assistance to Viet Nam.We highly appreciate the timely support extended bythe Governments of France  Japan  Sweden and othercountries  together with the international financialinstitutions  for helping Viet Nam settle arrears with theInternational Monetary Fund  thereby creating abreakthrough initiation of credit assistance from internationalmonetary and financial institutions; such assistance isabsolutely essential for building up socio-economicinfrastructures in Viet Nam.Our appreciation goes also to the many companies from nearly 50 countries  that have come to Viet Nam forinvestment and business cooperation at this initial stage ofour development.In our journey towards a dynamic and sound marketeconomy that is well-managed at the macroeconomic level and achieving healthy  rapid and sustainable growth aimedat achieving the objectives of a prosperous nation  a strongcountry and a civilized and equitable society  we still facenumerous difficulties  weaknesses and challenges. At thisjuncture  increased assistance from the United Nations international financial institutions and non-governmentalorganizations  as well as cooperation and support fromvarious countries  is extremely valuable and meaningful.On the basis of the fundamental approach of having asocio-economic development strategy up to the year 2000 inwhich the human person constitutes both the end and thedriving force  Viet Nam is simultaneously carrying outeconomic reforms and a step-by-step renovation of thepolitical system in order to promote the rights of people andcitizens’ rights  both economic and political  cultural andsocial. Strenuous efforts have been made to establish theState’s rule of law through the promulgation of the amendedConstitution of 1992  the election of the new NationalAssembly Legislature  an enhancement of the power andresponsibilities of the elected organs and a stepping up ofthe law-making process.In accordance with our nation’s tradition ofhumaneness  we stand for abolishing prejudice andvengeance  and for looking towards the future. Thosepreviously in the ranks of our adversaries have all been freedand given full citizens’ rights. All Vietnamese who wish fora prosperous and strong Viet Nam  and who respect thelaws  will find a place in the great unity of the nation  evenif they are of different political opinions.The process of renovation and the policy of universalnational unity constitute the prime mover for development inthe country and at the same time bring into full play thepotential of Vietnamese overseas to contribute to theconstruction of their former homeland.Viet Nam has concurrently deployed a foreign policy ofopenness  diversifying and multilateralizing its relations offriendly cooperation with all other countries  thus creating afavourable international environment for our country’srenovation and development.In that spirit  Viet Nam has actively contributed to thepeaceful solution of the Cambodian question and hasimplemented the Paris Agreements and cooperated with theUnited Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. Wehave established relations of good-neighbourliness withCambodia in the hope that Cambodia will become a countryof peace  independence  neutrality and non-alignment thatentertains friendly relations with other countries.We wish to congratulate the new Government inCambodia  and stand ready  together with that Government to settle  jointly  any questions of mutual concern. Weexpress the wish that the Cambodian Government and theUnited Nations will take effective measures to protectVietnamese residents living peacefully in Cambodia  and toForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 15ensure their safety and the same rights and benefits as areenjoyed by people from other countries who are resident inCambodia.Viet Nam is sparing no effort in building up friendshipand cooperation with neighbouring countries and ispersevering in its policy of peaceful negotiations to findsatisfactory solutions to border and territorial disputes at seaas well as on land. While working for solutions  allconcerned parties should refrain from doing anything thatfurther complicates the situation and from the use or threatof use of force to settle disputes.The fact that relations between the United States andViet Nam have not yet been normalized 20 years after theend of the war is not normal nor is it in consonance with thetrend of our time. With the desire to close the book on thepast and to look to the future  Viet Nam wishes and standsready to normalize relations with the United States on thebasis of equality and mutual respect and withoutpreconditions. This would meet the aspirations and interestsof the peoples of the two countries  and would serve peace stability  cooperation and development in the region andthroughout the world.Viet Nam still has tens of thousands of people missingsince the war  and their remains have yet to be found; andmillions of war victims need help. We are deeplysympathetic towards the sentiments of American familieswhose loved ones went missing in the Viet Nam war  andhave cooperated  are cooperating and will continue tocooperate actively with the American Government andpeople on the missing-in-action question. We consider thisa purely humanitarian issue.I am confident that the goodwill and conscience of theAmerican and Vietnamese peoples  together with theimmediate and long-term interests of the two countries  willsoon prevail over the existing obstacles so that relationsbetween the two countries can be normalized.Allow me to conclude my statement with the hope thatthe United Nations will rise to the challenge of seizing theopportunities and surmounting the challenges so that it trulybecomes an institution to which all Member States entrusttheir aspirations and in which their views are heard and theiractions coordinated. For its part  Viet Nam  in its effortstowards renewal  development and integration with theinternational community  will always be a positive factor forpeace  national independence and social progress  and asincere and reliable cooperation partner in the region as wellas in the world."
"173",7466,"WSM",48,1993,"It is always an honour anda great pleasure to address the General Assembly. My firsttask  a happy one  is to congratulate you  Sir  most warmlyon your election as President of the forty-eighth session ofthe General Assembly. We know that in your hands thiswill be a session of accomplishments.Let me also thank your able predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria  for hisoutstanding service during the forty-seventh session.I would next express our concern and sadness over therecent disastrous earthquake in India and extend to theGovernment and  especially  to the families affected ourprofound sympathies.Two years ago  when I last stood here  there was asense of high expectation  for we were witnessing the dramaof political changes to a new world. Many new nationStates emerged from that process. We welcome the newest -and some of the smallest - Members of our global familywho joined us this year: the Principality of Andorra  Eritrea the Czech Republic  the Principality of Monaco  The FormerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Slovak Republic.As a small State itself  Samoa is particularly pleased to addits welcome  assured of the contribution these new Memberswill make to our common effort.Let me also pay a tribute to the Secretary-General andexpress to His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali ourdeepest admiration and appreciation for the spirit of reformand quality of leadership he brings to the work of theOrganization.With one voice we in this Hall have hailed the endingof East-West tensions. We are right to do so. It hasbrought about deep and positive changes. Now  as neverbefore  the international community has real opportunities forcooperation and peace. In Washington  barely a month agotoday  leaders of two great peoples  men of magnificentcourage and foresight  seized such an opportunity for theIsraelis and Palestinians. In our global village there is animperative to secure a comprehensive  just and durablesolution to the overall Arab-Israeli conflict. In turn  thatpeace effort needs to be able to draw sustenance - moral political and financial - from the whole family of nations.Most warmly we applaud the courage and vision of this boldstep. From our distance  and no matter how inadequate  Ipledge to the people of Israel and to the PalestiniansSamoa’s entire support.But the new opportunities for cooperation in this post-cold-war era are being severely challenged by conflicts thatrage in many lands and by the human misery they cause.Tragedy and carnage are seemingly endless in Bosnia  inSomalia  and in territories of the former Soviet Union. Inother areas  too - far too many - we witness daily the mostshocking violations of the human person and wantondisregard for the rule of law. This year alone  there havebeen close to 25 substantial conflicts in the world.And war is not the only scourge. For we have notfreed our world of hunger  poverty or illness. Millions ofpeople have fled from internal strife and persecution  famineand natural disasters. Millions more are migrating foreconomic reasons.In my part of the world  island communities now liveunder the constant threat of ecological disasters. A rise insea levels and destructive tropical cyclones are particulardangers. The evidence we have is that these are the globaland adverse effects of induced climate change. They preyon the natural vulnerabilities of many lands and theirpeoples  and severely undermine the national livelihood andeconomic development efforts of many Governments.My purpose is not simply to catalogue misery and thenegative  but rather to point to the vastness of our task.There is no scope for retreat - we must advance withresolve. The world cries out for responses and solutions.And the fact is  the world is now looking more and more tothe United Nations. We do not  for a moment  delude12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionourselves about the complexities of these conflicts or thedepth of longstanding animosities - least of all  in theterritory of the former Yugoslavia. But I am compelled tosay that the horrors being perpetuated in Bosnia offendcommon decency and almost every principle for which thisOrganization stands.That is why we feel that the international communityhas not been swift or decisive enough in taking action to endthe calculated brutality in Bosnia and avert the devastationof so much that is sacred in that land. We pray for thespeediest possible settlement  one that is comprehensive andhas realistic prospects for the lasting peace and economicprosperity of all concerned. There should be no reward foraggression.The grim outlook for many troubled areas of the worldshould not  however  cast a shadow over the hope typifiedby the Palestinian-Israeli peace accord. Cambodia is a highpoint in peacemaking  and we rejoice in this specialaccomplishment for the people of that ancient country andfor the United Nations  as we do in the announcement in thisAssembly by Nelson Mandela of the imminent demise ofapartheid. South Africa’s move towards a multiracial anddemocratic society is the attainment of a dream we have allshared for so long. We pray for the peaceful success of theannounced general elections in April 1994.We are indeed at a turning-point - a point at whichwe should now turn to the healing process. We must putbehind us the divisiveness and acrimony which havecharacterized the debates and the decisions of past years.Almost every speaker in this debate has focused onpeace-keeping and the unprecedented demands being madeof the United Nations. Our support of United Nationspeace-keeping operations is total  as is our acceptance ofpreventive diplomacy as fundamental to ""An Agenda forPeace"". We have no military resources or experience  andwe have been able to assist only by way of our assessedcontributions. But it is clear to us that failure to provideadequate financial and other resources undermines both thepeace effort and the authority of the United Nations.It seems to be generally acknowledged that  in thespace of some two years  the cost of United Nations peace-keeping has quadrupled to a level currently four times largerthan the United Nations regular budget. In our humbleopinion  peace-keeping at such a level cannot possibly besustained without adequate and improved financing andfinancial management. Above all  peace-keeping objectivesand mandates need to be clearly identified and managed.There is everything to be gained by the application of theprinciples of accountability  consistency and transparency.Peace-keeping at current levels has compounded thetragedy of war through the loss of United Nations staff andpersonnel. In the strongest terms  we condemn the attacksand deliberate targeting of United Nations peace-keepingforces wherever they occur. We support early and effectiveinternational measures and necessary arrangements withinthe United Nations system for the full protection of UnitedNations personnel and forces  as well as action against thosewho commit acts of violence against our messengers ofpeace.In all this  the Security Council is the vital link. Wenow have a proposal before the Assembly to take a closerlook at the arrangements and strengthening of the SecurityCouncil. We also acknowledge the useful report theSecretary-General has sent us on the various viewsexpressed. Our own concern is for the efficacy andeffectiveness of the Council. So long as these are assured Samoa would support the required reforms to the SecurityCouncil. But  no doubt  we should all take sufficient timeto ponder these matters.In the wider aspect  we believe that no amount of forceand no measure of peace-keeping can sustain peace andsecurity without attention to the root causes. The generalexperience is that human misery  brought about by povertyand the denial of human and democratic rights  is the realand fundamental problem. We therefore uphold the beliefexpressed by many leaders from this rostrum that socio-economic development and democratic reforms areessentialto the prevention of political and social crises. We think thisshould remain a major preoccupation of the United Nations.We believe deeply in the underlying importance ofhuman rights in all United Nations activities. In this respect we welcome the Declaration and Programme of Actionproduced by the World Conference on Human Rights inVienna and the acknowledgement in unquestionable terms ofthe universality of human rights. The results of the ViennaConference constitute a significant advance in the promotionand protection of human rights  not least in the recognitionthat development has a true claim to be considered a humanright.We agree with and support the proposal to establish aUnited Nations high commissioner for human rights. Suchan office could serve as a strong focal point for coordinationof the currently fragmented branches of the United Nationshuman rights system and could help to ensure that humanForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 13rights are integrated into the work of all United Nationsprogrammes.The very basis of human rights is the right of peoplesto determine their own future and governance. This isfundamental  and it is something very close to our hearts given our experience and the political evolvement of ourown State. The South Pacific Forum has continued to callon the metropolitan countries to take into account the wishesof the people in the Territories and to respect their right toself-determination.We welcome the ongoing dialogue between France andall parties in New Caledonia regarding the future of theTerritory. The peaceful evolution towards self-determinationin New Caledonia is in accordance with the principles of theUnited Nations Charter. Its attainment was made possible bythe constructive intervention of the United Nationsdecolonization Committee and by the willingness of theGovernment of France  the parties in New Caledonia and theSouth Pacific Forum to show restraint to give fullconsideration to each other’s concerns and sensitivities.What we see in New Caledonia today stands as a testamentto the cooperative spirit characteristic of the Pacific regionand as a true example of peaceful and preventive diplomacyat work.At the same time  we acknowledge and respect theviews and interests of those Territories that wish to continuewith the status quo.Peace  stability  security and the preservation of ourenvironment are crucial to the South Pacific region. Ourcommitment to these objectives is unwavering  and Samoa together with its regional partners  will continue to call fora permanent end to nuclear testing  to the dumping ofchemical and toxic wastes and to the transportation of thesematerials in our waters. The South Pacific Forum countrieshave continued to urge the remaining nuclear-power Statesto heed our concerns and to accede to the Protocols of theSouth Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. That Treaty is theparamount symbol of the region’s strong feeling about andcommitment to a nuclear-free environment. We areencouraged by recent indications from some of these Statesthat they will reconsider their current positions on the Treatyand on other nuclear-related issues that are of concern to theregion.Samoa is particularly pleased about the extension of thenuclear-testing moratorium. However  we are deeplydistressed to have learned last week of a breach of thatmoratorium. I have cause to believe that substantialnumbers in the Assembly share our concern and our earnestprayer that no further tests will be carried out and that othernuclear Powers will not resume their nuclear-testingprogrammes. It is our dearest hope that such testing willone day cease - permanently. We also urge all Member States -the nuclear Powers in particular - to work towards the earlyconclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty.We welcome the unique opportunity offered by the endof the cold war to focus and develop comprehensive-nuclear-disarmament initiatives. We stand ready to do what we canin support of these. We should say  however  that theprospect of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and - worse -of their acquisition by unfriendly parties is of major concernto us  as  of course  to the world community as a whole. Itunderscores the urgent need for the control  reduction andeventual elimination of these deadly weapons. TheNon-Proliferation Treaty  which is a vital part of thedisarmament process must be extended indefinitely when itcomes up for review in 1995.We look to the nuclear-weapon States to take the leadin the nuclear-disarmament process and  at the same time  toillustrate with concrete action their full commitment to ourcollective goals and objectives. The South Pacific regioncannot continue to be a testing ground for nuclear devices;or to be a dumping ground for chemical wastes; or to beexposed to contamination by toxic wastes and otherenvironmentally threatening substances.Environmental security is crucial to Samoa and othercountries of the South Pacific. The United NationsConference on Environment and Development  held in Rioin 1992  provided us with an opportunity to put our globalhouse in order - an occasion of promise  of rising hopes.The setting of Agenda 21 and the establishment of theCommission on Sustainable Development are only first steps.Implementation is the difficult task - the true test.Like other places  our small island States and low-lyingatolls face a host of constraints. Isolated and ecologicallyfragile  small island States like my own are amongst themost vulnerable to external economic  trade and climaticfactors. Without international cooperation  and without anintegrated approach  the outlook is not promising.The Global Conference on the Sustainable Developmentof Small Island Developing States - to be held in Barbadosin April 1994 - will provide a first opportunity to implementAgenda 21 and to reaffirm commitments made in Rio. Wefirmly believe that international attention  focused at nextyear’s global conference  will provide valuable guidance14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessiontowards a sustainable-development effort worldwide. Itseems to us that if there is failure to secure sustainabledevelopment for small island States  there will be no realchance of success elsewhere.The work of the Preparatory Committee remainsincomplete. But the stakes are too high forinconclusiveness  so a resumed preparatory session beforethe Barbados Conference is essential.I should say that our call for international cooperationis fully matched by our resolve to do what is necessary andpossible at the domestic level. As a country  weacknowledge and accept primary responsibility for ourenvironment and development. To this end  we havecompleted a national environment-management plan  haveput in place the necessary legislative framework and havetaken steps to adhere to the appropriate internationalConventions.In all of this  we have had the fullest cooperation of theSouth Pacific Regional Environmental Programme - anorganization established by the Pacific region and partnercountries to coordinate not only national and regionalactivities but also the region’s participation in world-wideinitiatives on the environment. This underlines our basicbelief that the total efforts of all nations  acting responsiblyand in concert  will be crucial if we are adequately to protectour environment and our planet.I should note the general satisfaction of my delegationwith the world-wide debate  which is now under way  aboutthe future of development - and  thus  about our commonfuture. The United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment was a special landmark. A few months ago contrary to predictions  the Vienna World Conference onHuman Rights registered important accomplishments. Nextyear  we shall see the particularly crucial Conference onPopulation and Development; thereafter  the Conference onwomen  and then the social-development Summit.Yesterday  we heard Papua New Guinea’s initiative onopportunity and participation. We consider this a pertinentproposal  and that it is an important element in the overalleffort to involve citizens and to enhance  in particular  theeconomies of developing countries.These global conferences and initiatives will map outnew priorities and courses of action requiring from Statesand ordinary citizens the highest degree of commitment andcooperation. Meantime  we will need to concentrate onstrengthening and revitalizing our Organization if we are torespond efficiently and effectively to present and futurepriorities. To this purpose  Samoa supports all remedialreforms to the United Nations system to ensure optimum useof scarce resources.Next year has been declared  by the Assembly  theInternational Year of the Family. In two years’ time  theUnited Nations will mark its fiftieth anniversary. This givesus all reason to move ahead with our work  resolved toimprove the condition of our world and the well-being ofour global family."
"174",7509,"YEM",48,1993,"It gives me pleasure to convey to you  Sir  on myown behalf and on behalf of the delegation of Yemen  mymost sincere congratulations on your election to thepresidency of the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. I have no doubt that you deserve the trust thathas been placed in you by the Member States of this greatinternational Organization. Your personal qualities  longexperience  sagacity and tact make you eminently qualifiedto conduct the deliberations of this session with excellenceand effectiveness. Just as your election attests to your highstanding at the international level  it bespeaks the esteem inwhich your country is held by other countries the worldover. We wish you every success in the important tasksassigned to you and trust this session will achieve itsimportant goals so as to strengthen the functioning of theUnited Nations and its organs and enhance theireffectiveness.I should also like to take this opportunity to express ourthanks and appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Ganev ofBulgaria  for the important role he played in guiding thework and deliberations of the forty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly.I cannot fail to extend my best wishes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his tireless effortsaimed at strengthening the work of our great Organization upholding the principles and achieving the goals of itsCharter. We should also like to express our appreciation forhis annual report (A/48/1) on the work of the UnitedNations  in which he deals with the most important items onthe agenda of this session.We should also like to avail ourselves of thisopportunity to welcome those States that have recentlyjoined the United Nations and wish them every success.Their presence here among us attests to the international anduniversal nature of the Organization and contributes to theattainment of our common goals  in accordance with thepurposes and principles of the Charter.This is the fourth session in which the Republic ofYemen is represented by one delegation  whereas in the pastit was represented by two. On 22 May 1990  our countryregained its unity after about two centuries of disunity in thecourse of which a power struggle raged between theoccupiers of various parts of the country. This reached itspeak on 30 November 1967  when Yemen was divided intotwo States.Although that miraculous unitary achievement of fouryears ago seemed impossible  our people and its wise leaderswere able to bring it about  and other peoples that are stilldivided may look upon our example with hope. Our peoplefought and made many sacrifices over many generations forthe attainment of that objective. The unity of our homelandhas been characterized by pluralism  multilateralism anddemocracy.Furthermore  on 27 April of this year the Republic ofYemen crowned its march towards democracy with generalparliamentary elections that were free  impartial and honest.Representatives of international organizations that defenddemocratic ideals participated by following those electionsclosely and monitoring their proper procedure. Western andArab monitors welcomed that democratic exercise in Yemen and The New York Times described the events in our countryas ""a true Arab revolution"". In the light of all this  webelieve we are justified in feeling a sense of pride as wetake part in this session against the backdrop of suchachievement by a country that has worked two miracleswhich no one thought possible only four years ago.Our success in opting for democracy on the basis ofpluralism and the multiparty system clearly demonstrates thatthe seeds of democracy can germinate in any soil once it isplanted and is not the preserve of any special soil. No oneshould marvel  however  at the success of democracy in ourcountry. Yemen  as historians know  was the first cradle ofthe practice of ""Shura""  that is to say parliamentary activity from as far back as the days of the Kingdom of Sabã 2 800years ago. This is attested to in the Holy Koran and otherearlier books of revelation.Three years have passed since the unfortunate invasionof Kuwait by Iraq and the second Gulf crisis that ensued.My country continues to suffer the terrible consequences ofthat crisis. One million of our expatriate countrymen had toreturn to Yemen as a result of that war  and yet we have notreceived any external assistance from any quarter whateverto lighten the burden of that return. The Republic of Yemenis and has always been against the use of armed force inresolving conflicts. We reject the idea of the acquisition ofthe territories of others by force. That is why our positionon this situation remains unchanged. We consider thatKuwait is a sovereign  independent State and not part of anyother State. Since the Republic of Yemen is an Arabcountry that  geographically  is part of the ArabianPeninsula  we have been deeply chagrined by what happenedbetween the two neighbouring  sister countries of Iraq andKuwait  and by the resultant deep cracks in the edifice ofArab solidarity. For that reason  the Republic of Yemen has12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessioncontinued to urge the Iraqi leaders to carry out all that iscalled for in international resolutions. In that context theresponsiveness and readiness to cooperate demonstrated untilnow by the Government of Iraq are cause for optimism andshould lead us to review the sanctions that are now in place.Similarly  ensuring the territorial integrity andsafeguarding the sovereignty and independence of theRepublic of Kuwait are an absolute necessity. None theless  this can never be achieved in a lasting and definitivemanner unless the two countries reach a mutually acceptableformula of agreement and the Arab countries  in particular as well as the international community as a whole  guaranteestrict adherence to such agreement so that neither of the twocountries may breach it. Such agreement should make itpossible to reassure the State of Kuwait that the events of2 August 1990 will not recur and also make it possible toresolve all outstanding issues so as to prevent any futuredispute.There is no doubt that our Kuwaiti brethren are wellaware of the fact that the sovereignty  independence andsecurity of Kuwait cannot be guaranteed indefinitely bydependence on international protection alone but must haveits solid basis in sound and equitable relations between theircountry and Iraq in the framework of a climate of securityand fraternal reconciliation in the region.Given Iraq’s readiness to cooperate in theimplementation of Security Council resolutions  we believethat the blockade against Iraq is no longer justified. Indeed the suffering of the Iraqi people has reached an intolerablelevel  and we do not believe that the internationalcommunity is prepared to accept the death of innocentwomen  children and old people because of lack ofmedication. At the same time  my country reaffirms theneed to preserve the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq and we ask that there be no further destruction of Iraq’seconomic  scientific and social infrastructures.Following the establishment of the Republic of Yemen my country declared that one of the goals of Yemeni unityis to contribute to the security and stability of our region andto promote cooperation and integration between all itscountries. In pursuance of that objective  relations betweenOman and Yemen have been strengthened and have becomea model to be followed. However  this sound beginning isbut a key  albeit an important key  to the doors which  whenfully opened  will allow movement on the economic  securityand trade tracks towards economic integration and securitycooperation between all the region’s countries especially nowthat between Yemen and Oman there are the initial stepstowards easy access for passengers and goods. There is nodoubt that Yemeni-Omani relations are of specialsignificance to the future stability and prosperity of theregion. They represent a practical and important beginningto the much needed process of putting the Arab house inorder both at the regional and the Arab levels. They are alsorelations that pose no threat to the interests of others as theyare open  transparent and well-defined as regards their endsand means.Similarly  Yemen’s relations with other sister countriesare based on historic kinship and religious links and on thefact that we all belong to one and the same Nation. That isthe reason why Yemen has always stood by its brethren inneighbouring countries and in the Arab world in general andhas always endeavoured to raise such relations to the levelthat would enable it to perform its role vis-à-vis Arab andinternational issues.As regards the border issues between Yemen and SaudiArabia  Yemen has been engaged since November 1972 intalks with our brethren in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ina climate of goodwill and with a genuine desire to turn anew leaf. Following initial contacts last year in Geneva  ajoint committee of experts was set up to negotiate the borderproblem that lies at the forefront of the two countries’bilateral concerns. That committee has held five rounds ofnegotiations  the most recent of which was held at T’az twomonths ago. In the meantime  other contacts have beentaking place between President Ali Abdullah Saleh andKing Fahd  Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques  through anexchange of letters  the last of which was the letter Idelivered to His Majesty King Fahd. Notwithstanding thecomplexities of the border problem between the two sistercountries  we continue to be optimistic as to the outcome ofnegotiations  since both countries are desirous of seeing thetalks crowned with success and since good intentions existon both sides. This makes it easier and possible to resolveproblems. Everyone is well aware that factors tending torapprochement between the two countries outweigh thefactors of discord. I can say that my last contact withKing Fahd  Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques  waspositive and that I found him to be aware of the need forfraternity and cooperation between our two countries.The deplorable situation in Somalia demands that  inaddition to what the international forces are doing toestablish peace and security there and in addition tointernational support  further efforts should be deployed toinitiate national reconciliation between the various factions.We urge the international community to redouble its effortsat the humanitarian level and we invite the factions inForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 13Somalia to rise to the level of their responsibilities and towork on a basis conducive to reconciliation  to rejectfactionalism and false sensitivities and to see that thecountry’s interests triumph over narrow  factional ones sothat it may be possible to rebuild what has been destroyedby that cruel war and pursue the path of development andprogress.Although Yemen previously had the honour of takingpart in the efforts deployed to achieve national reconciliationthrough the Conference held in Djibouti two years ago  andalthough the national groups in Somalia have not committedthemselves to implementing the resolutions of thatConference  we shall spare no effort in working for thedesired comprehensive national reconciliation in Somalia. Itis only fair to commend here the role performed by ourSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and theinterest he takes in the Somalia tragedy. Let us pray thatGod the all-powerful will guide the leaders of the variousfactions in Somalia towards reconciliation so that peace mayprevail over all parts of that sister country and enable it towork towards reconstruction and development and to resumeits place as an active member of the internationalcommunity.Any observer who is familiar with the history of theArab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East region will becertainly aware of the fact that the identity and destiny ofPalestine have been at the core of the Arab-Israeli problemfrom the very outset  and the fuse that detonated the terribleexplosion of conflict from as far back as the Britishmandate. Since then  the Palestinian cause has continued tobe the focal point of the conflict  which has lasted fordecades and has led to three bloody wars; taken thousandsof lives and caused millions to leave their homes; brokenapart thousands of families; destroyed property; and causedincalculable losses. Therefore  it is no wonder that the justsettlement of the question of Palestine is the key to resolvingthe conflict and restoring peace.Our country’s prompt support for the agreementbetween the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel inWashington on 13 September stemmed from ourcommitment to the Rabat Arab Summit Conferenceresolution which recognized the Palestine LiberationOrganization as the sole legitimate representative of thePalestinian people as well as our respect for the right ofevery people to choose its own course and exercise its ownwill in full freedom. Having said all this  we view theagreement as an important first step towards a just  lastingand comprehensive peace in the region  as was stated by theCouncil of Ministers of the Arab Nations in Cairo lastmonth. None the less  this step by itself and in itself willnot bring about peace unless it is followed by moresignificant steps at the levels of other Arab-Israelinegotiating tracks. This will depend on Israel’s earnestnesswith regard to withdrawal from all the Palestinian and Arabterritories it has continued to occupy since June 1967.If we tell ourselves that Israel  at long last  has come tothe realization that it is unrealistic to hold on to the policyof depending on naked force due to the military superiorityit enjoys  as a means of guaranteeing its continued existence imposing its hegemony over the Arab people in Palestineand the neighbouring Arab States and imposing a peace thatwould be tantamount to capitulation - I say that if we tellourselves anything of the sort  we shall be indulging inwishful thinking until such time as Israel demonstrates thetruthfulness of its declared intentions and passes the test byadopting sound positions in current and future negotiationswith the Syrians  Jordanians and Lebanese and bywithdrawing from all the territories it now occupies. It mustalso accept the establishment of the independent State ofPalestine  which would include Gaza and the West Bank with Jerusalem as its capital  while the Republic of Yemenappreciates the important role played by the two co-sponsorsof the Arab-Israeli negotiations and  in particular  the role ofthe United States of America  it hopes that this role will besuch as to prompt Israel to abandon the policy of force andarrogance which it has pursued out of its feelings of militarysuperiority  and because of the international support andprotection it has always enjoyed as well as the specialtreatment extended to it by the Western Powers. It is timethe States of the world at large  and in particular the UnitedStates  shouldered the responsibility of curbing Israeliarrogance  especially after the crimes  killings  acts ofintimidation and terrorization  the bombings  destruction andatrocities it has perpetrated for decades in Palestine andother Arab countries. Those are acts that will shamemankind for a long time to come and that will torture thehuman conscience.We do hope that the Gaza-Jericho agreement betweenthe PLO and Israel and the agenda between Jordan andIsrael will be accompanied by Israeli-Syrian agreements andIsraeli-Lebanese agreements in the near future. This shouldlead to the return of the Golan to Syria and to Israel’swithdrawal from southern Lebanon. We also hope that suchagreements will be followed by others that would lead toIsrael’s total withdrawal from all the Palestinian territories including Al-Quds and all the other Arab territories that arestill under occupation. It is also our hope that the Israeliauthorities will finally desist from the arbitrary measures andacts of criminality against all our brethren in Palestine  in14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionLebanon and in the other occupied territories. If the battlefor peace has been joined  it shall not be won unless Israelshows a great deal of courage  abandons its arrogance andrealizes that this is the most difficult battle of all.The end of the cold war and the emergence of thebeginnings of a new international order that is beginning totake shape to rid the world of wars and conflicts require thatlasting  total peace should prevail in the Middle Easternregion on a fair and stable basis so that its peoples maytackle the task of development and improve their standardsof living. This requires that all the States and peoples of theworld should take a firm stand in opposing any attempt tocreate obstacles in the path of peace  or to impose peace byforce. Our world will not enjoy peace until peace embracesevery part of the globe.Like many other countries  Yemen has followed withdeep concern the attacks against southern Lebanon and theBekaa Valley by Israel in the month of July  in full sight ofthe international community. Yemen  while stressing theimportance of respecting Lebanon’s independence  territorialintegrity and sovereignty and safeguarding its right to livewithin recognized international borders  condemns Israel’scontinued occupation of southern Lebanon  and demandsunconditional Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon inimplementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978).The international community should take a firm stand inorder to compel Israel to refrain from these acts ofaggression and to compensate the people of Lebanon for theenormous losses they have sustained.It is inadmissible  illegal and immoral for peoples  onthe eve of the twenty-first century  to suffer from injusticeand to be exposed to physical liquidation for ethnic orreligious reasons. The most horrendous example of this isthe case of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The United Nations since it was created  has never faced a more seriouschallenge than the one that confronts it now in that peacefulEuropean Muslim country. It is very difficult indeed tounderstand the stance of the international community withregard to that situation. In practice  all the slogans haveturned out to be no more than hot air. Developments inBosnia and Herzegovina squarely put a heavy burden of guilton the shoulders of the international community andespecially the major Powers  with regard to the collectivemassacring of Muslims at the hands of the Serb and Croatfascists. As long as we  as an international community continue to fail to face up to such a situation  and tosafeguard the right to life of the unarmed people of Bosniaand Herzegovina  how could we pretend to champion humanrights on this planet? In the most restrained terms  we canonly say that the world’s stance vis-à-vis what is happeningin Bosnia and Herzegovina will be a stigma  a brand of Cainon the brow of the age and of the human race  for alleternity.Consequently  this blatant defiance calls for practicalmeasures by the international community to deter aggression to intensify moral support and humanitarian assistance andto strengthen the steadfastness of the people of Bosnia andHerzegovina with a view to ending this tragedy. We inYemen join the other countries of the world in calling for anend to this aggression that Belgrade supports  and for a haltto the genocidal atrocities perpetrated by the Serb aggressorsin Bosnia and Herzegovina.We support the request by the Non-Aligned Movementfor the venue of the negotiations to be moved from Genevato United Nations Headquarters here in New York as thosenegotiations are now at a critical juncture  and moving themto New York would strengthen the parties’ confidence especially that of the Bosnia and Herzegovina side  which isthe party that has to make the biggest sacrifice.The World Conference on Human Rights held inVienna in June 1993 has studied the question of humanrights  reviewed the fundamental precepts relating to thoserights and underscored the need to implement them and toprovide humanitarian assistance to the victims of war andnatural disasters. Unfortunately  many of the tragicsituations which afflict people arise from certain crises andpolitical conflicts that degenerate into armed confrontations.The use of force and economic blockades that ensue resultin untold suffering for innocent civilians  especially the mostvulnerable  namely  women  children and the elderly  whoare always the principal victims of such wars and blockades.The situation in South Africa continues to be cause forconcern for most Member States of this Organization. Thelatest news does not justify too much optimism. Over thepast two months  there have been several massacres andkillings. That is why the most recent events should promptus - and the United Nations - to monitor this situationclosely so that the goals contained in the 14 December 1989United Nations Declaration on Apartheid and its DestructiveConsequences in Southern Africa may be implemented.The decision to deploy a peace-keeping force in SouthAfrica  a decision that has been welcomed by Inkatha  is amajor step in leaving behind the cycle of violence  murderand massacre in the country  and may well make it possibleto establish a democratic and non-racial regime. Here weshould like to emphasize the importance of having all theForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 15parties understand the need for peace  especially in view ofthe forthcoming democratic  non-racial elections scheduledfor next year. We hope that the elections will be successful and that they will mark a positive turning-point.Just a few days ago  we had the honour of hearingMr. Nelson Mandela address the Special Committee againstApartheid  and we could feel his confidence in the future.We hope that the dialogue that has now begun in SouthAfrica will make it possible to establish a democratic  non-racial regime.The Secretary-General  in his annual report on theactivities of the United Nations  declared that politicalprogress and economic development are inseparable. Yemenbelieves that  to revitalize economic growth in thedeveloping countries and enable those countries to continuetheir political and economic adjustment programmes  thedonor countries and the industrialized countries must provideeconomic and technical support  and the United Nationsmust continue to play its role in promoting cooperationbetween the developing and the industrialized countries inorder to achieve the objective of economic integration on anequitable basis. It is also important to lighten the poorcountries’ debt burdens  to increase financial flows towardsthem and to provide them with technical assistance in orderto enable them to continue their programmes of adjustmentand to achieve economic and social development.As underscored by the meeting of the Ministerialcommittee for the economic development of the countries ofthe Non-Aligned Movement held last May in Bali  Indonesia the economic situation in the developing countries hasworsened. World economic growth is suffering from agrave imbalance and the gap between the developing and thedeveloped countries has widened. The economic recessionhas led to the growth of protectionism and decliningdevelopment assistance. Furthermore  the increase inindebtedness and the burdens of debt servicing have resultedin capital outflows in the case of the developing countries.This is a situation that threatens the very existence of thosecountries and not only the prospects of economic and socialdevelopment. We must refer in this respect to failure by theindustrialized countries to honour their commitments in linewith the agreements  strategies and international resolutionsrelating to the inflows of development assistance to thedeveloping countries  especially those included in theinternational strategy for the eighties which called for theallocation by the industrialized countries of 0.7 per cent oftheir Gross National Product to development assistance.Instead of implementing those resolutions  the industrializedcountries have resisted every attempt to formulate and adopta new strategy for the 1990s. They have also failed toimplement the programme for the 1990s that had beenagreed upon at the Paris Conference. This has been a realsetback for the economic and social development of the leastdeveloped countries.We do say that the principal responsibility fordevelopment lies with the developing countries themselves but national efforts alone are not enough: there must also bea degree of international support and assistance. Nationalefforts must be backed up by appropriate internationalefforts.We feel that the international economic system must befair and equitable towards the developing countries. Thiscannot be the so without political will  wisdom and courage.A great deal of work awaits the United Nations  andthis is why this session of the General Assembly is ofspecial importance. The international community must availitself of this opportunity to develop a concept of cooperationbetween countries  within the framework of the UnitedNations  with a view to strengthening international peace andsecurity and economic stability the world over. This shouldalso help to strengthen the Organization  because theOrganization is the ideal framework for building that worldof peace and stability on the basis of international legality.In this connection  the United Nations must implementthe Charter without selectivity or double standards  for theCharter is the ideal framework for coordinating internationalefforts. As the international community must build a betterworld within the framework of the United Nations to ensurepeace and development  we  the family of nations  must havethe foresight and resolve to face up to the problems thatarise with the universal character of the United Nations inmind."
"175",7654,"ZWE",48,1993,"Allow me to begin bycongratulating you  Your Excellency Ambassador SamuelInsanally of the Republic of Guyana  upon your election tothe presidency of the General Assembly for this forty-eighthsession. Your well-known diplomatic skills and yourcountry’s long-established positions of principle augur wellfor the successful conduct of the work of this session.I also wish to pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. StoyanGanev of Bulgaria for the able manner in which he steeredthe work of the Assembly during a particularly challengingforty-seventh session.May I also take this opportunity to say a special wordof congratulations to the Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  on his outstanding stewardshipof the United Nations during these critical times  when theworld body is increasingly being called upon to respondpromptly and effectively to complex situations all over theworld.As the fiftieth anniversary of our Organizationapproaches  there is great merit in our taking stock of whatthe United Nations has achieved in the maintenance of peaceand security and in fostering international cooperation fordevelopment. It is also our duty at this session to exploreways and means of further strengthening this body so that itis better equipped to fulfil its purposes and principles asenshrined in the Charter.The admission of new States to the community ofnations upholds the principle of universality that we so muchcherish. In this connection  it is important for us to takenote of and applaud the historic agreement that has beensigned by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization which heralds a period of peace after more than four decadesof bitter and destructive fighting. It is our hope that one daythe State of Palestine will earn its deserved place as aMember of this Organization. We would  at the same time like to pay tribute to those countries and organizations thatwere instrumental in bringing the negotiations to a fruitfulconclusion.The fact that the membership of this Organization hasincreased dramatically to 184 surely suggests an urgent needto restructure it so that it serves the world community betterin the vastly changed circumstances. The end of the cold-war era has finally placed the United Nations at centre stageof international affairs for the maintenance of peace andsecurity and the strengthening of international cooperation insocial and economic development.However  the arrangements made for the maintenanceof international peace and security need a thorough review.At a time when great emphasis is being placed on theprinciple of democracy at the national level  there is no validreason for not extending the same principle to the sphere ofinternational relations.The principle of sovereign equality among States is animportant provision of the Charter. The General Assemblyand its style of work represent the embodiment of thisimportant principle. It is the only organ that enjoysuniversality of membership; therefore  its relationship withother organs of the Organization should reflect this pre-eminent status. Consequently  in the revitalization andrestructuring process  the end product should be areinvigorated General Assembly capable of asserting itself inits relationship with other organs of the United Nations.The Security Council is assigned by the Charter theprimary responsibility for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. The recent proliferation of situations ofconflict  instability and tension around the globe calls forgreater participation and involvement of the generalmembership in the workings of the Council. There istherefore need to adjust its membership  structure andmethods of work to reflect the changes which have occurredin international relations since 1945.The first obvious change in our Organization is thedramatic increase in its membership. Consequently  the ratiobetween the General Assembly and the Security Council hasprogressively declined from 5 to 1 in 1945  through 8 to 1in 1965  to 12 to 1 in 1993. Clearly  the Security Councilhas become less representative and needs to be enlarged.The second change relates to the configuration of powerin political  economic and military terms which created thenotion of permanent membership and the veto in theCouncil. Present realities dictate that the privileges enjoyedby the permanent members of the Security Council bemodified and that the composition of the Council be altered but with due regard to the provisions of Article 23 paragraph  1 of the Charter  which accords due importanceto""the contribution of Members of the United Nations tothe maintenance of international peace and security andto the other purposes of the Organization"" subject  of course  to membership that is democraticallyelected and fully accountable to the total membership of theOrganization on whose behalf the Security Council acts. Itwill take time to negotiate and put the changes in place.However  in the intervening period there is nothing toprevent the Organization from implementing interimmeasures which may go some distance towards redressingthe present discrepancies.The mere expansion of the membership of the SecurityCouncil will not amount to much for Africa  Latin Americaand Asia unless the question of equitable geographicdistribution is adequately addressed. At present  these threeregions are grossly underrepresented  in terms of both non-permanent and permanent members. Africa and LatinAmerica do not even wield a single veto  whereas the Groupof Western European and Other States  and Eastern Europe now wield four of the five vetoes in the Council. Moreover the Group of Western European and Other States  andEastern Europe  are allocated 7 of the 15 seats  leavingAfrica  Asia and Latin America to share the remaining 8  anarrangement that is totally inequitable and thereforeunacceptable.It is clear that the Security Council  through a liberalinterpretation of the concept of international peace andsecurity  has encroached on the jurisdiction of other organsin the system. We are concerned by the apparent impressionoften created by the Council that majority votes in theCouncil constitute international law  regardless of theprovisions of the Charter and other relevant internationalstatutes.The Security Council acts on behalf of the entire UnitedNations membership. Therefore  any tendencies or practicesthat may be interpreted as contradicting the norms andprinciples of transparency  accountability and democracyshould be avoided. To this end  we should evolve a systemthat would ensure more participation by interested MemberStates that are not members of the Security Council. Thiswill make it possible for such Members to have ameaningful input during the informal meetings of theSecurity Council. It is also desirable that the Council keepthe general membership well informed regarding the stageand nature of discussions and negotiations undertaken.If we have addressed ourselves at some length to theissue of the Security Council it is because the responsibilitiesit shoulders have manifestly increased in number andcomplexity. It is our view that only through a process ofinternal institutional reform  which we believe is longoverdue  can the moral authority and effectiveness of theForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 3Security Council in discharging its mandate be enhanced andacknowledged. It is our hope that the current negotiationson this matter will be successfully concluded to coincidewith the celebrations marking the fiftieth anniversary of thefounding of the United Nations in 1995.I now turn to the vital role of the Assembly as thecentral and universal forum for deliberation. Africa fullysupports the efforts under way to revitalize and rationalizethe work of the General Assembly. We believe that theexercise must be comprehensive  taking into account theexpanded membership of the world body as well as theprinciple of sovereign equality of all States. The reformprocess must also fully address the need for the otherprincipal organs of the United Nations system to report tothe General Assembly  as provided in the Charter.As I have already noted  the tasks facing the UnitedNations today have increased with the unprecedentedmushrooming of peace-keeping operations all over the world.Bitter armed conflicts continue to ravage lives and destroyproperty  stretching the much-needed administrative andfinancial resources of the Organization to the limit. Let ustherefore redouble our efforts in support of the increasedcommitment and responsibilities of our Organization.The recent successes of the United Nations in bringingpeace to Cambodia  El Salvador and Haiti and in facilitatingthe referendum in Eritrea are testimony to what can beachieved by our Organization acting in a concerted manner.It is in this context that we particularly welcome theSecretary-General’s proposals in his report ""An Agenda forPeace""  relating to cooperation between the United Nationsand regional organizations in resolving conflicts  inpeacemaking as well as peace building. We in Africa havetaken a positive step in this direction. At the thirtiethsummit meeting of the Organization of Africa Unity (OAU) held at Cairo in June this year  we adopted a mechanismwhose primary objective is the anticipation and preventionof conflicts. Its mandate will be guided by the principles ofthe OAU Charter  in particular the sovereign equality ofStates. Where conflicts have already occurred  the functionof this mechanism will be peacemaking and peace building.Even with our meagre resources  we are proud to say thatAfrica has already established a Special Fund to supportOAU activities in conflict prevention and settlement.In southern Africa we continue to be bedeviled byconflicts in Angola  Mozambique and South Africa. InMozambique  however  we welcome the recent talks betweenPresident Chissano and RENAMO leader Afondo Dhlakama which have cleared some of the major obstacles to the peaceprocess. We therefore urge the United Nations to continueits efforts to put the peace process back on schedule toenable elections to be held in October 1994.In Angola we are gravely concerned at the continuedescalation of fighting between UNITA and the legitimateMPLA Government. This has caused untold loss of life andproperty. We believe that the efforts of the United Nationsand the OAU should be aimed at achieving a cease-firebetween the two warring parties and creating favourablecircumstances for the deployment of United Nations peace-keeping operations while negotiations for peace take place.UNITA should accept the results of the September 1992democratic elections  which were declared free and fair byinternational observers  including the United Nations.On South Africa  we applaud and support the currentnegotiations to bring about democratic change in thatcountry  particularly the recent agreement regarding thefuture  and indeed ongoing  establishment of the TransitionalExecutive Council. We are  however  dismayed to note theintensification of violence and the withdrawal of the InkathaFreedom Party and the white conservatives from thenegotiations. These actions threaten the smooth progresstowards the goal of democratic elections currently set forApril 1994. We therefore urge the two parties to return tothe negotiating table  as this is the only way forward. TheUnited Nations should also seriously consider a more activerole in the prevention of violence.The President of the African National Congress (ANC)has appealed to the United Nations for the ending ofsanctions against South Africa  and we are glad that therehas been response from a number of countries to that appeal.Zimbabwe fully supports the appeal  and we are glad that astage has now been reached when we can judge the processto be more or less irreversible.In Somalia we commend the efforts of the UnitedNations in the difficult mission to restore normalcy to thattortured country. In Liberia and Rwanda  while peace hasremained elusive  we are glad that current OAU and UnitedNations efforts to resolve the crises have begun to bear fruit.It is our hope that recent positive developments on the long-standing question of Western Sahara will result in a just andequitable settlement. The untiring efforts of the Secretary-General and the United Nations in seeking lasting solutionsto these conflicts on our continent and elsewhere particularly those emanating from the disintegration of theformer Yugoslavia and Soviet Union  deserve ourunqualified support.4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth sessionAs equal members of this family of nations  we believethat peace-keeping  peace-building and peacemaking mustnot be the preserve of a few economically or politicallypowerful countries. We stand ready to cooperate with theinternational community in seeking solutions to the manyproblems facing the world today  by participating in peace-keeping operations or mediation efforts  or by providing anyfacilities or expertise at our disposal. However  unless allMember States commit themselves to timely payments oftheir assessed contributions for these efforts  some countrieswill find continued participation difficult.We are fully aware that issues involving violentdisputes or armed conflicts are not the only concerns of theinternational community. Other issues  such as trade andeconomic growth  as well as international cooperation fordevelopment  are matters of primary concern. We note withconcern from the World Economic Survey  1993 that for thethird year in succession the rate of growth of world outputin 1993 will be below that of world population. It is alsoevident from the Survey that the end of the East-Westideological divide has not brought with it a commensuratenarrowing of the economic disparities between North andSouth. Instead  these disparities have become morepronounced than ever before.The problems confronting the developing countriestoday are manifold. Terms of trade continue to deteriorate as high prices of imported manufactured goods and risingprotectionism in developed countries become the order of theday. The socio-economic crisis in the developing countrieshas been further exacerbated by the crippling burden of debt.The flows of official development assistance  upon whichthey are dependent  has declined in recent years  while directinvestment has constituted only a marginal percentage of allinflows to these countries  particularly those in Africa.In Africa  the least developed and most marginalized ofall the world’s regions  the majority of countries areundertaking economic reform measures. They have madegreat sacrifices and encountered untold difficulties inimplementing these reforms. In southern and eastern Africain particular  the capacity to implement and keep theseeconomic reforms on course was further undermined by thedevastating drought which swept the region in 1991-1992.Yet these countries have continued to demonstrate theircommitment to the reforms aimed at improving the standardof living of their people.Our sacrifices alone are not enough to ensure thesuccess of our economic reform programmes. In this regard we must once again reiterate the imperative need for an openand equitable international trading system and the provisionof adequate financial resources. We therefore call for anearly conclusion of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral TradeNegotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT). We also call again on the developed countries toachieve without further delay the target of 0.7 per cent oftheir gross national product for official developmentassistance that was set over 24 years ago by this veryAssembly.Africa’s economic and social progress in general  andin the context of the implementation of the New Agenda forthe Development of Africa in the 1990s in particular  willremain severely hampered as long as the continent’s debtburden continues to be as acute as it is today. Standing atclose to $290 billion at the end of 1992  the continent’s debtis equivalent to 100.1 per cent of its gross national product while it is an alarming 108 per cent for sub-Saharan Africa.With Africa continuing to be a net exporter of financialresources  is it any wonder that many of our humandevelopment needs and social services have gone unmet?We believe that there is a clear and compelling need tofind a lasting solution to Africa’s indebtedness. While wewelcome some of the positive steps taken by some creditorcountries towards debt relief  as well as the importantinitiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions in this regard we believe that an unacceptable gap still remains betweenrhetoric and action  and that more decisive measures can betaken to address this crisis.Africa believes that the commitment it made togetherwith the international community  when the New Agendawas adopted in 1991  must be renewed and translated intoconcrete action. Fully cognizant of the fact that Africa’sdevelopment is primarily our responsibility  we haveproceeded courageously to implement our side of thecommitment  particularly in the promotion of regional andsub-regional economic cooperation and integration and thecreation of an enabling environment for foreign anddomestic investment. We therefore call upon theinternational community to buttress our efforts by addressingin a concerted manner the major constraints which I havehighlighted.Africa does not seek charity. Mindful of the need topromote sustainable and self-sustaining development on thebasis of self-reliance and the interdependence of MemberStates  the countries of Southern Africa signed in August1992 a regional treaty establishing the Southern AfricaDevelopment Community (SADC). Foremost among ourobjectives are the achievement - through regionalForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 5integration - of development and economic growth  thealleviation of poverty  the enhancement of the standard andquality of life and the support of the socially disadvantaged.Through the various regional economic organizationssuch as the Eastern and Southern African Preferential TradeArea (PTA)  the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS)  and the Arab Maghreb Union  Africancountries are trying to further their aim of achieving self-sustaining development. These efforts will eventuallyculminate in the formation of an African EconomicCommunity  whose foundations have already been laid.Furthermore  it is our objective to evolve common politicalvalues  systems and institutions  and to promote and defendpeace and security in the region. It is our earnest hope thatthe international community as well as organs of the UnitedNations system and the multilateral financial institutions willcontinue to render their invaluable and generous assistancein order to ensure the success of our regional integrationefforts.Zimbabwe is fully committed to achieving thesustainable utilization of our natural resources and theprotection of our environment in order to attain sustainabledevelopment. In this context  we note with appreciation theprogress made so far in establishing the institutionalmechanism for the follow-up of the decisions taken duringthe United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro  Brazil  in June last year. Inparticular  we commend the Commission on SustainableDevelopment for the constructive and positive manner inwhich it conducted its work during its first substantivesession in June.We welcome the stress that the Commission has placedon some of the areas critical to the successfulimplementation of Agenda 21  including the urgent need tosupport national efforts to achieve sustainable consumptionand production patterns and lifestyles and the need for asupportive international economic environment.Issues such as the alleviation and reduction of poverty the creation of remunerative and productive employment andsocial integration are at the core of the endeavours of allcountries  but more urgently of developing countries. It isappropriate that these constitute the basis of our deliberationswhen we convene in Copenhagen  Denmark  in March 1995for the World Summit for Social Development.These themes are all equally vital. It is gratifying thatthe international community has pronounced itself on themon many occasions as indeed have States individually andseverally. The theme of social integration  for example  wasaddressed in a special way when two years ago we held asummit meeting on children here in New York. We adoptedprinciples and guidelines which should govern the treatmentand development of children in all our countries. Weshould  in translating these principles into practice  work toremove the status and stigma of society’s marginal peoplefrom our children. The children are our future. We have aduty to the future for them by the positive and practicalmeasures we take today for their protection  education anddevelopment.Of great importance to us also are issues of populationand the advancement of women. In this context wewelcome and support the convening of the WorldConference on Population and Development in 1994 inCairo  Egypt  and of the World Conference on Women inBeijing  China  in 1995.In this regard let me underscore the conclusion of theWorld Economic Survey 1993 that the social concerns ofdeveloping countries  and the major issues of developmentin other areas of the world  cannot be resolved in theabsence of world economic growth. It is our fervent hopethat just as the United Nations has considerably strengthenedits role in the political and humanitarian fields  its role in theeconomic  social and related fields will likewise bestrengthened in order adequately to meet the emerging newrealities and their impact on the developing countries.Let me conclude by calling upon all Member States toremember that just as the new international situation dictatesthe need to strengthen  democratize and streamline theoperations of the United Nations and its constituent bodies so also is it incumbent upon us to make an exceptionalcontribution in pursuit of the noble goals of justice  peaceand development. This we believe can be achieved only ifall Members live up to their obligations under the Charter."
