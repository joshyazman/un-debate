"1",18,"AFG",43,1988,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to express to Mt. Dante Caputo my sincere congratulations on his well-deserved election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. We are confident that his wisdom and experience will ensure constructive and fruitful deliberations on the very important  indeed vital  issues before the Assembly. I assure him of the full co-operation of my delegation to that end. May I also express our deep appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  for the exemplary manner in which he presided over the deliberations of both the Assembly's forty-second session and its third special session devoted to disarmament. I should also like to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General Hr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his competent and excellent management of theaffairs of the Secretariat of our Organization. We are particularly gratified athis devotion to the cause of international peace and security  demonstrated in hisrelentless efforts to ensure the peaceful resolution of regional conflicts indifferent parts of the world. We congratulate him on the outstanding Success hehas scored in these efforts. That success testifies to the enhancement of the roleof the United Nations.The General Assembly is in session at a time when the world seems to havereached a critical juncture in history. Recently  we have witnessed a number of promising developments in different spheres of international relations which  if sustained  will have far-reaching positive consequences for the future of humankind. The general relaxation in relations between the Soviet Union and the United states  progress so far achieved in disarmament negotiations  the intensification of efforts in seeking peaceful solutions to regional conflicts  and greater awareness of the need for multilateral co-operation in solving the conflicts  political  security  economic and ecological ills afflicting our world are all manifestations of a general improvement in the international climate.It is regrettable  however  that the atmosphere of international relations is still plagued with various unresolved problems and conflicts.  If not solved in the interests of regional and international peace and security  these problems could seriously jeopardize the progress achieved so far. The danger of war and  worse  of nuclear holocaust still looms large  while the upward spiral of the arms race continues unchecked. The tendency to resort to the threat or actual use of force  interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States and various forms of political and economic coercion is strong in international relations. Old concepts  attitudes  policies and doctrines continue to govern the behaviour of States towards their neighbours and other countries of the world. This is a situation which is of grave concern to the international community.The world community has welcomed with joy and relief the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles. The destruction of an entire class of nuclear weapons is  indeed  a historic achievement and a turning point. Men and women in every corner of the world are awaiting with great hope the successful delusion of ongoing negotiations on a 50 per cent reduction of the strategic nuclear arsenals of the two great nuclear Powers. Their hope is that this will prove a happy prelude to the achieved of the long-cherished objective of general and complete disarmament.A comprehensive nuclear-test ban is obviously the most significant step towards building the confidence necessary for the further reduction and total elimination of nuclear weapons. Pending total elimination  a treaty on the Prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons  coupled with acknowledgment of the universally accepted dictum that a nuclear war cannot be won  and a solemn pledge by all nuclear Powers not to be the first to resort to the use of such weapons  constitutes an essential first step towards assuring man that the macabre vision of total annihilation may indeed be avoided. The establishment of nuclear-free .ones and measures for enhancing nuclear non-proliferation will also serve this purpose.While nuclear disarmament is indeed of prime importance  considerableattention should also be paid to conventional disarmament. Newly emergingtechnologies capable of producing new generations of conventional weapons of massdestruction have highlighted the need for the urgent adoption of measures towardsthe limitation  reduction and total elimination of conventional weapons  in thiscontext  a radical reduction in the strength of standing armies is also of prime importance.The conclusion of a treaty banning the development  production  stockpiling and use of all types of chemical weapons  including binary weapons  is also of Paramount importance. We welcome the progress made in the Conference onDisarmament towards a chemical-weapons-ban treaty and the successful review of the Convention on biological weapons.The global economic situation is of particular concern to all the developing countries  while the scientific and technological revolution has provided mankind with the know-how and tools to deal successfully with the problems of underdevelopment  such as hunger  poverty  disease and illiteracy the prospects the steady progress of the developing countries remain bleak. Inequitable conditions for Participation in international trade  coupled with the burden offoreign debt and debt servicing  are frustrating their efforts towards development and progress.The sharp decline in commodity prices  the deterioration in the terms oftrade  high interest rates  the protectionist measures adopted by developed countries and the reverse flow of financial resources have deepened the economic crisis that threatens the future of the developing countries. The least developed countries in particular are in a very precarious economic situation. in view of this reality  the need for the establishment of a new international economic order on a Just and equitable basis acquires greater urgency. It is also important to recognize the relationship between disarmament and development. Only the additional human  technological and financial resources released through disarmament can successfully cope with the development needs of the world.Without any doubt one significant manifestation of the general improvement of the international climate is the positive trend towards solving regional conflicts through political means. In the Geneva talks between Iran and Iraq  in Angola  Kampuchea  Nicaragua  Cyprus and Western Sahara dialogue and negotiations have raised high hopes for lasting peace and tranquility for the people of the various regions. These noble efforts deserve full support by the international community.In the Middle East  the situation remains tense owing to the policy of aggression  military occupation and expansionism pursued by Israel. Complete and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from all occupied Palestinian and other Arab lands  including the Golan Heights and Jerusalem  is the key to a lasting peace in the Middle East. It has been universally recognized that the question of Palestine constitutes the core of the Middle East problem  without full restoration of the undeniable rights of the Palestinian people  inc1uding their right to statehood  no just and lasting solution to the Middle East problem is conceivable.We who1e-hearted1y welcome the cessation of hostilities and the commencement of the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. We wish both sides every success in theGeneva talks  under the auspices of the united Nations  in establishing lastingpeace and normal relations between the two neighbouring Islamic countries.In South Africa  the abhorrent polio  of apartheid continues unabated  depriving millions of human beings of their elementary human rights and freedoms. The Pretoria regime also poses a grave threat to International peace and security through constant acts of aggression against the front-line States  particularly Angola and Mozambique. The negotiations between the interlocutors aimed at resolving the problems of southern Africa by peaceful means are to be commended. The cessation of aggression against Angola and of interference in its internal affairs is the key to normalization of the situation in that country.We support the immediate independence of Namibia  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization  SWAPO  the sole and legitimate representative of the Namibian people  through the full implementation of the united Nations plan for the independence of Namibia endorsed in Security Council resolution 435 (1978).The Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan also warmly welcomes the dialogue among the Kampucheans. It is our hope that this dialogue will soon result in peace and tranquility in Kampuchea and co-operation between the countries of Indo-China and members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).The talks in Nicaragua have also raised high hopes of the restoration of peaceand normal life in that country  if this is to be achieved  it is essential that outside interference in its internal affairs be ended.The dialogue in Cyprus is also encouraging  we reaffirm our support for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus.My Government also supports the independence   woeful reunification and national unity of Korea through dialogue and reconciliation.We welcome and support Security Council resolution 621 (1988)  on preparations for holding a referendum in Western Sahara  under the supervision of the United Nations in co-operation with the Organization of African Unity.It is our firm conviction that constant renewal of our faith in the purposes and principles of the United nations Charter is the only firm guarantee of an improved international climate. The role of the United Nations in safeguarding international peace and security and proofing global operation is indeed vital. The Organization has played a unique and outstanding role in codifying the norms of international conduct  with the aim of making the world an orderly placein which to live. It has also demonstrated its vast potential for the peacefulsettlement of conflicts  we believe that it is time for the United Nations to play a central  primary role in the field of disarmament as well.The Republic of Afghanistan  as a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement. It is firmly committed to the purposes and principles of the Movement. The Movement's recent ministerial Conference at Nicosia demonstrated once again the validity and relevance of the principles of non-alignment in the contemporary world and their positive impact on positive trends in international relations. The Republic of Afghanistan will continue to play a positive and constructive role in the Movement.The signing of the Geneva Agreements on the situation relating to Afghanistan has been welcomed by the international community as a historic achievement. Statements made so far in the general debate at the forty-third session of the General Assembly have clearly indicated that international support  for which we are grateful  we are particularly grateful to the Secretary-General. Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and his Personal Representative  Mr. Diego Cordovez  for their all-round efforts in the Geneva process. Based on the principle of the United Nations Charter  particularly those of non-interference and non-intervention  the Agreements map out a comprehensive political settled which is in the interest not only of the people of Afghanistan but also of the peoples of the entire region and the cause of international peace and security.The Republic of Afghanistan signed the Geneva Agreements in good faith and with a firm resolve to implement all its provisions in letter and in spirit.True to our good intentions  the Republic of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union have strictly abided by the provisions of the agreements. The return of Soviet troops from Afghanistan commenced on 15 May 1988. and 50 per cent of the troops had been withdrawn by 15 August  as provided for in the Agreements. The republic of Afghanistan has given every assistance to the united Nations Good offices Mission for Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNGOMAP) in performance of its duties.Much to our regret  however  four and a half months after the entry into force of the Agreements the hope of the people of Afghanistan - indeed  the hope of the entire international community - for the restoration of peace in our country has not yet been fulfilled. War and bloodshed have not subsided. People are being killed  public and private property destroyed and acts of terror perpetrated by armed extremist edition. Kabul and many of other cities have come under aconstant barrage of rockets with a range of from 20 to 36 kilometers  136 suchrockets were fired on the City Of Kabul in the course of a single day. These blindrocket attacks have claimed 760 innocent victims  including women and children  while 346 houses and 45 public buildings have been destroyed. Only two days ago 25 rockets were fired on Kabul. One of them hit a bus station in front of the Ministry of Education  claiming the lives of 35 persons and injuring 163.Why does this situation continue after the signing of the agreements?  From where are all these lethal weapons pouring into Afghanistan? The sole reason for this situation is the non-implementation of the Geneva Agreements and their open violation by the other main signatory.In contravention of the explicit provisions of the instrument on mutualrelations  particularly those relating to non-interference and non-intervention  centers on its territory for training  arming and equipping extremist groups have not been dismantled. The earmarking of modern weapons  including Stinger missiles  long-range artillery and mortars and ground-to-ground rockets for the extremist opposition groups and their transfer to Afghanistan are continuing. A guarantor of the instrument on non-interference and non-intervention is continuing to sendweapons and equipment to armed extremist groups. The events at Spin Boldak demonstrated that Pakistani militia even participated in the attack carried out bythe extremists. At the present time similar situations exist in the provinces ofKandahar and the Kunars.At the same time I should like to point out clearly that the Government of Afghanistan is directing all its efforts to the implementation of the Geneva Agreements and the settled of the internal situation t  rough dialogue and the establishment of a broad-based Government  with the participation of the seven commanders inside Afghanistan and other influential personalities within and outside the country  with this in view   Afghanistan is firmly in favour of improving its relations with all its neighbours and strongly opposed to any action that could heighten tension in its relations with them. Afghanistan has neverresorted to small- or large-scale border violations either on land or from the air  and has nothing to do with the internal incidents occurring in neighbouring countries.  We firmly believe that such actions not only are contrary to the Geneva Agreements but will delay and complicate the solution of existing problems.On the other hand  the Government of the Republic of Afghanistan has so far brought to the attention of the government of Pakistan 547 cases of open violations  by means of 87 notes presented to UNGOMAP. However  the other side has created serious obstacles to UNGOMAP'ss investigation of these violations. On the pretext of the existence of tribal conflicts and a lack of security prevented from visiting areas which are used for the transfer of weapons to Afghanistan and where large depots of such weapons are located. Contrary to clear provisions of the Geneva Agreements. UWGOMAP has not been granted freedom of movement in the territory of Pakistan. On the contrary  UHGCMAP has to request prior permission from the Pakistan authorities before it can visit areas where violations are taking place  while the Agreements provide that inspections should he completed within 48 hours  it takes two to three weeks to get permission for UNGOMAP visits. Obviously  that is time enough to transfer weapons depots to otherareas or to transform a military training centre into a school.This being the case  can it still be claimed that violations have in fact been investigated in accordance with the provisions of the Agreements? In such circumstances no one can really talk about investigations  because the fact is that Violations are taking place and the Agreements are not being implemented.Furthermore  in spite of our continued requests  meetings between the two sides toreview violations have yet to take place  although the Agreements provide that suchmeetings should take place within 48 hours.We recently proposed a meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the twomain signatories and the two guarantors to review the process of the implementationof the Agreements. Regrettably  however  Pakistan and the United states have not responded positively to this practical request.Agreements  mixed commissions for facilitate the return of Afghan refugees should have been established a long time ago. However  four and a half months after the entry into force of Agreements  the other side has shown no readiness to implement this important provision. If theAfghan refugees are such a heavy burden  then why have such commissions not beenestablished on the basis of the provisions of the third instruct of the GenevaAgreements  as is the wish of the Republic of Afghanistan and of the Afghanrefugees? On the contrary  conditions and prerequisites being created withrespect to their return.As to the Government of Afghanistan  it has taken all the necessary steps to receive the refugees. A ministry has been established for this purpose  which has so far welcomed 152 000 returnees. To assure the refugees  and with due respect to the traditions of our people  border areas have been proclaimed non-military zones. An agreement has been concluded with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and its office has been opened in Afghanistan. A similar agreement has been concluded with the International Committee of the Red Cross.In this connection  we sincerely appreciate the initiative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to launch an appeal for international relief assistance to the people of Afghanistan. We warmly welcome the designation of Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan  an internationally renowned personality with rich experience in international humanitarian efforts  as the co-ordinator of such assistance. I should also like to express our gratitude to all those countries which have shown readiness to assist in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.Although in the present circumstances internal efforts for peace andtranquility inside Afghanistan are adversely affected by continued interferencefrom outside  the policy of national reconciliation has opened its way in the mindsand hearts of the Afghan people  inside and outside the country. After an intervalof 15 years  an elected parliament  in which different parties are represented  isfunctioning in the country  A new coalition Government  including 18 non-partymembers out of a total of 31 meters  has received a vote of confidence from the parliament.In this connection  let me reiterate that we deeply believe in negotiations and reconciliation and it is our conviction that  through dialogue  agreement on the mechanism for the formation of a broad-based coalition government could be achieved. The fact is that if the Geneva agreements are implemented and interference from outside is thereby stopped  the Government and people ofAfghanistan  through the continuation of the national dialogue establish peace and national accord in their country. Tired of years of fratricidal war. the people of Afghanistan  both inside and outside the country  will join hands in a coalition government to reconstruct their land  which has suffered through 10 long years of war and destruction.The Government of the Republic of Afghanistan is making every effort to ensure that  on the one hand  the situation relating to Afghanistan is throughstrict implementation of the Geneva Agreements and. on the other  that on the basis of the establishment of a genuine coalition inside. Afghanistan  as a non-aligned and neutral country  will pursue a policy with regard to the improvement ofregional and international relations that will correspond to the balance of interest of all the other countries of the world  including the Soviet Onion  the United states  Pakistan  India  China  Iran  the Islamic countries and members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. At the same time  we hope that the new leadership in Pakistan  taking into consideration the existing realities  will adopt a constructive position towards the elimination of the existing tense situation  and will play its roleimproving the relations between the two countries and the situation in the region through the strict implementation of the Geneva Agreements. These agreements constitute a firm basis for this purpose  which is in the interest of all the peoples of the region and the cause of international peace and security.It is profoundly clear that it was in the light of increasing interference from abroad that the Government of Afghanistan had called for Soviet assistance  to enable the people of Afghanistan to repulse the threat from outside. At present the withdrawal of Soviet troops is in place in accordance with the time-frame envisaged in the Geneva  Agreements  but  at the same time  interference has not ceased. If this situation is not corrected in time  South West Asia will continueto remain a region of conflict  tension and a threat to international peace security  m such cases  Afghanistan and the Soviet Union reserve the right to adopt coordinated measures as called for by the situation. In the light of the signing of the Geneva Agreements and the continued implementation of the policy of national reconciliation  we do not see any need for the discussion of item 30 on the agenda of this Assembly. It is our conviction  however  that any such discussion should focus on the need for the strict implementation of the Geneva Agreements. We are ready to work towards a consensus resolution  taking into consideration the concerns of all the sides. Nicosia proved that  given the political will and the existence of a genuine resolve to make a constructive contribution to the restoration of peace  stability and security in our region  it should not prove difficult to reach such a consensus.Recently  our world has arrived at the threshold of a new era of understanding  of mutual efforts for peacefully resolving conflicts and for promoting peace and disarmament. It is the great hope of the world community that this trend will not prove ephemeral but acquire a permanent character. We are ready to co-operate towards this noble end. We are particularly willing to co-operate in turning our own part of the world into a region of peace  stability  co-operation  understanding and good-neighbourliness in the interest of all our Peoples and of the cause of international peace and security.

"2",57,"AGO",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of my Government I wish to express to you  Sir  our appreciation and satisfaction at your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. We are sure that your talent and experience  as a politician and as a diplomat  will enable you to make a great contribution to the success of this session. Your election is a recognition of the importance of this factor and  at the same time  a well-deserved tribute to the country you represent. We therefore offer you our very best wishes for success in the difficult task entrusted to you.We also wish to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic  for the exemplary and brilliant manner in which he presided over the forty-second session  thus  making a contribution to the strengthening of the United Nations.To the Secretary-General  Hr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  we pay sincere tribute for everything he has done in the cause of peace and prosperity for all mankind  in spite of the political and economic obstacles and other drawbacks faced by the Organisation today. We are sure that  with help from all of us and support for the diplomatic and political commitment he has always demonstrated  there will be hope for a lessening of tension throughout the world and for the achievement of the  peace that now begins to shimmer in the distance and will ultimately bring great joy to you all. In the international situation there are signs of hope for lessened tension and for the peace so anxiously awaited by all mankind.The Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (INF Treaty)  now ratified  the progress made in the field of disarmament  in the framework of the talks between the United States and the Soviet Union and the Geneva Conference on Disarmament  the search for a negotiated settlement of the different conflicts that have been proliferating around the world - all of these are important landmarks on the way to achieving the fundamental goal of the United Nations  which needs to be pursued both in qualitative and in quantitative terms. We believe that those achievements are part of the solution to the problems that all mankind is facing today.The radical changes we are witnessing today in the political situation in southern Africa are a consequence of a change in the balance of power  which now favours the peoples of the region engaged in a struggle against the hideous racist regime of South Africa. That is reflected in successive South African military defeats at the hands of the Angolan army and in the intensification of the liberation struggles of the peoples of Namibia and South Africa.Acknowledgement of those facts  plus the military defeat inflicted on the racist South African forces at Cuito Cuanavale  led the Pretoria Government to sit down at the negotiating table with the Governments of Angola and Cuba  with the mediation of the United States of America  to negotiate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the establishment of peace and security in our country.The Governments of Angola and Cuba  which have demonstrated a true spirit of integrity and flexibility throughout the talks  brought to the negotiating table a set of principles set out in a negotiating platform presented in 1984 by Comrade President JosÃ© Eduardo dos Santos to the Secretary-General. As that platform is well known to all  I shall not dwell on it here.The Government of the People's Republic of Angola has never accepted and will never accept the fictitious link some have sought to establish between the presence of Cuban internationalist troops in our territory and the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the independence of Namibia. It is a prerequisite for the achievement of a just  lasting and honourable peace in southern Africa  that the goals set in the negotiating platform be attained.Attempts to establish a parallel between the withdrawal of Cuban internationalist troops and the independence of Namibia prove the arrogance and bad faith of a regime that is defying the entire international community  that continues to trample on the most fundamental rights of its own people by imposing the inhuman apartheid system  which is blocking the right of the Namibian people to self-determination and independence  and that pursues a systematic policy of aggression and destabilisation against the front-line States.I am obliged to reiterate that Cuban internationalist troops are in Angola at the invitation of the Angolan Government  in keeping with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter  while South African troops occupy the Territory of Namibia illegally  in violation of the relevant United Nations resolutions.The Governments of Angola and Cuba  wishing to help resolve the problems of south-western Africa  also brought to the negotiating table a specific timetable for the withdrawal of Cuban internationalist troops from Angola  with a view to facilitating the implementation of Security Council 435 (1978)  on the independence of Namibia. But it must be made perfectly clear that this gesture in no way implies de jure or de facto acceptance of the policy of ""linkage"". It should be understood  rather  as one more contribution by our Governments towards the achievement of peace in Angola and of independence for Namibia.Angola's firm commitment in this regard and our efforts to initiate a peace process are well known.Several meetings held in Luanda and Cape Verde were followed by a series of peace talks in London  Cairo  Now York  Geneva and Brazzaville. A protocol was signed in Geneva regulating the withdrawal of South African troops from Angolan territory as provided for in Security Council resolution 602 (1967); there was also agreement on the cessation of hostilities along Angola's southern border  and the installation of border control posts jointly monitored by Angola  Cuba and South Africa. That  along with the designation of 1 November as the date for initiating implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the presence of a United Nations technical tea  in Namibia/ are the clear results of the quadripartite talks. This shows how important and necessary it is for us to proceed with dialogue in order ensure peace and security in southern Africa. As President JosÃ© Eduardo dos Santos pointed out in a recent statement at the Franceville summit""Our intention is to make the peace process in southern Africa irreversible  and we shall do everything in our power to make that happen.""Should South Africa and its allies persist in their obstinate policy of hindering the peace process by making demands which by their very nature constitute crude interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Angola - demands that we can never accept - history will in due course be the judge of their actions.The Angolan Government has repeatedly declared that/ under its policy of clemency and national harmonisation/ all Angolans are entitled to free themselves from the domination of foreign interests and to integrate themselves into the society we are in the process of building. That policy  recently reiterated by the President of the People's Republic of Angola  aims at the implementation of a peace process inside Angola  a process that draws on the history and experience of other African countries which have experienced similar situations. Assurances regarding the implementation of such a process after the Brazzaville quadripartite talks were given by the highest Angolan authorities at the Franceville summit on 5 October.The People's Republic of Angola considers that there has been much progress in the quadripartite talks. But this does not mean we can decrease our vigilance; we must rather increase our solidarity with and our unwavering support for all peoples of the southern African region and all liberation movements struggling against colonialism and apartheid. It is important to stress that the important consultations held at New York between Angola  Cuba and South Africa  with the mediation of the United States  were essentially exploratory in nature. Contrary to reports in the international media  their purpose was to prepare for the signing of a subsequent formal agreement. There is still a long way to go. At stake are the sovereignty  security and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola.I must mention here the efforts of the People's Republic of the Congo  and particularly of President Denis Sassou Nguesso  towards success in the quadripartite talks.My Government will never shirk its duty to extend all necessary support to the fraternal people of Namibia in its just struggle for independence  under the leadership of its sole legitimate representative  the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO).Together with a21 other peace-loving peoples  the Angolan people continue to extend all possible support to the heroic people of South Africa  which  under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and other patriotic forces  is struggling against the inhuman apartheid system. We take this opportunity to call upon Pretoria's allies to cease forthwith all co-operation with the inhuman regime and to impose the comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa for which the international community at large has been calling for so long.The development in the Maghreb region give us some reason to hope that  should all parties co-operate fully with the Secretary-General and with the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  a just  lasting and politically acceptable settlement of the conflict will be found on the basis of OAU resolution 104 and relevant General Assembly resolutions. We reaffirm our total support for the Sahraoui people and for the POLISARIO Front  and we call upon the parties to the conflict to do all they can to pursue the path of dialogue. We welcome the agreement signed by Ethiopia and Somalia and regard them as a positive step towards improving relations between those two countries  whose common wish is to live in a climate of peace in order to be able to overcome their underdevelopment and raise the living standards of their respective peoples. We hope that the dialogue that has now been initiated between Ethiopia and Sudan - two countries whose peoples are linked by economic  historical and geographical ties - will lead to the establishment of a climate of confidence and good-neighbourliness.As Africans  we have justified pride in welcoming the initiation of dialogue between Libya and Chad  two African countries that  under the aegis of the Organisation of African Unity  have been able to prove that it is possible to substitute dialogue for the force of arms in the settlement of regional conflicts.We once again feel obliged to associate ourselves with all those who have demanded that the Zionist regime of Israel withdraw unconditionally from all Palestinian and other Arab territories which it is illegally occupying and where it is engaging in the most inhuman atrocities against the Arab peoples. We associate ourselves also with the international demand for the convening as soon as possible of an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of the sole end legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).A major development to which special reference must be made - because of its importance for peace in the Persian Gulf - is  without any doubt  the cease-fire and the resulting talks now taking place between Iran and Iraq  under the auspices of the Secretary-General  with a view to bringing peace to those two countries that have been fighting each other for eight years now. We call upon these two fraternal countries to pursue the path of dialogue and refrain from any act that may hinder the process now under way. We welcome the signing of the Geneva agreementÂ· between Pakistan and Afghanistan and hope that this will help to establish a climate of peace and security in the region.With respect to the Kampuchean question  we believe it imperative to seek a political settlement that can contribute to the establishment of peace and stability in South-West Asia. We appreciate the promising results of the meeting held in July this year in Jakarta  Indonesia  at which the parties to this regional conflict showed optimism about the possibility of settling it. In this connection  we hail the positive attitude of the Vietnamese Government  which  in keeping with the goal of contributing to the establishment of peace in the region  has decided to withdraw before the end of this year a part of its Military contingent stationed in Kampuchea.We are also continuing to pay special attention to the situation in the Korean peninsula and to the Korean people's efforts to bring about an independent  reunified nation. We once again express our total support for the proposals made by the People's Democratic Republic of Korea that the Korean people be enabled to decide their future without interference or foreign intervention.To the East Timor people fighting against foreign occupation and for self-determination and independence  under the leadership of their revolutionary FRETILIN  we once again affirm our unwavering support. Furthermore  we take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the stance that the Portuguese Government has been taking in its capacity as the legal administering Power of the Territory of East Timor. In this connection  we call on that Government as well as on the Secretary-General to continue their efforts to find a just and permanent settlement of the question  in the framework of General Assembly resolution 37/30. Central America remains one of the regions of the earth most affected by instability. There  the policies of intervention  aggression  blackmail and interference in the internal affairs of the States concerned represent a threat to their sovereignty and development and to international peace and security. The People's Republic of Angola believes that this line of conduct is incompatible with a wish to see fewer regional conflicts and to achieve a political settlement of the differences. We therefore cannot agree that these confrontations should be viewed as ideological or as an East-West conflict.Nicaragua and Panama are clear examples of that situation. They are currently the victims of coercive political and economic measures. We wish to reaffirm the importance and validity of the Esquipulas II peace plan and also the need for compliance by all parties with the Panama Canal Treaty.We also express again our unwavering support for the Government and fraternal people of Cuba and their legitimate claim to regain the illegally occupied Guantanamo Naval Base from the United States and to be compensated for the material damage resulting from the occupation.We unequivocally support General Assembly resolutions 41/11 of 27 October 1986 and 42/16 of 10 November 1987  which declare the southern Atlantic a zone of peace and co-operation. We call on the States of the region to contribute to that end by Adopting measures designed to achieve the objectives of the Declaration.We are all in favour of dÃ©tente  dialogue and co-operation between States  regardless of their political or ideological differences or their stages of development. We believe also that the acme race  particularly when it involves nuclear weapons  makes the establishment of a programme for general and complete disarmament urgent. The resources used by the armaments industry could be channelled to the developing countries that are the victims of the constantly deteriorating world economic situation. We are sow approaching the end of yet another decade in which there has been a series of political convulsion in almost every region of the world. That is a source of great concern to the international community as a whole. During this period  some countries have been able to take important steps forward in seeking solutions to the various economic problems they face. However  despite their efforts  the majority of these countries have not succeeded in achieving anything more than a palliative that has not met their expectation for the settlement of certain problems that could really have been solved  to a large extent  with the political will and help of other countries.As I have just said  we are approaching the end of another decade. At the beginning of this decade we had hoped for better results for mankind as a whole. It is therefore distressing to note that  despite the efforts made  the world economic situation is constantly deteriorating. The current crisis in the world economic system  which is obsolete and unjust  claims its principal victims in the developing countries. It is against that background  therefore  that we believe it to be important  indeed urgent  to establish a new international economic order that is real  fair  equitable and capable of responding to the growing concerns of more than two thirds of the human race.At the beginning of this decade the United Nations adopted resolution 35/56 establishing a strategy by means of which the developing countries could achieve a growth rate of 7 per cent within the framework of the International Development Strategy. To that end  it was agreed also that the developed countries should contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for the benefit of the developing countries in general  and 1 per cent for the benefit of the least developed countries. Today  eight years have passed and we are still facing a manifest lack of political will on the part of cone developed countries to apply  the principles agreed upon. The consequences of this have been the stagnation in  and the reduction in the growth rates of  the majority of the developing countries.We believe that the existing gap between our two groups of countries is constantly increasing rather than narrowing  despite the measures taken each year by the majority of those countries to bring about economic recovery. In that connection  we reaffirm our complete support for the recent decisions taken and the positions held by the States members of the Non-Aligned Movement. We are sure that they constitute the basis for future negotiations between the North and the South  taking into account the need for the revitalised  closer and fairer co-operation between the two groups of countries that which we believe is imperative.We wish to focus for a moment on some questions that are of the greatest concern to us and that  in our opinion  are among the major impediments to the development of our countries. First  I wish to say that the international monetary and financial system will not be able to operate smoothly unless ell countries share the responsibility for the settlement of the problems relating to the malfunctioning of that system's institutions and mechanisms. Otherwise we shall continue to witness en uncontrolled flow of our resources to the developed countries. These resources could be utilised for the economic development of the countries of the South.  There is therefore an urgent need for the restructuring of the present international monetary and financial system so as to render it more viable and capable of securing wider and more just world co-operation. Today a problem of undeniable importance is the inordinate level of the debt of the developing countries  which reached the astronomical figure of $1 200 billion in 1987. We therefore deem it appropriate to appeal to the multilateral financial institutions and the creditor countries to review  together with us  the impracticability of the mechanisms of the international monetary system now in force. We reaffirm once again the need for an international meeting to be held as soon as possible on the debt of the developing countries  to enable debtors and creditors together to work out a solution to this thorny issue. For the low-growth countries of the African continent  the debt situation has become critical. The continued drop in prices of commodities  the main exports of the African countries  is an insurmountable obstacle to both their participation in the world economy and the effective implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990  which are essential pre-conditions for real recovery in their economies. We accordingly endorse the position of African Heads of State at the OAU summit meeting in December 1987 on the convening of an international conference on external debt in Africa. The economic crisis has seriously affected the developing countries capacity to take a more active part in international trade. The economies of those countries are concentrated on the export of one or a few commodities or manufactures  and at the same time those products suffer from instability in developed countries and are the victim of protectionist measures on the part of the market-economy countries - measures that are in flagrant violation of the rules and principles of international trade and incompatible with the commitments undertaken by those countries in various international bodies. We must therefore continue to concentrate our efforts on achieving real adjustment in the structure of international trade and implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The People's Republic of Angola is convinced that the international community can create the condition necessary for this to be close. The interdependence of States  of which we are totally aware  should lead us to a greater sensitivity concerning the food crisis. We note with deep regret the deterioration in the food and agriculture situation in many developing countries  especially African countries  which are experiencing a serious food deficit. The international community should support more strongly the International Fund for Agricultural Development in order to enable it to embark upon its second decade on a better and more solid financial footing. The People's Republic of Angola  a developing country which has never experienced a single day of peace since it achieved independence in November 1975  is an integral part of the international community and cannot remain silent with regard to the world in general or the problems of the underdeveloped countries in particular. Its contribution to minimising the countless economic and social problems affecting mankind is still very weak. We have been making efforts  together with others  to achieve the just peace so badly needed by the heroic Angolan people to solve the economic problems we continue to experience.' In this connection my Government has taken certain measures within the framework of the Economic and Financial Recovery Programme and has been enacting legislation that will make its implementation possible. I wish to take this opportunity to appeal to the international community to increase its support and programmes of assistance for the People's Republic of Angola with a view to helping repair the damage caused by the war of aggression and destabilisation waged by South Africa. This damage  in material terms - equipment  highways  bridges  roads  railroads and so forth - amounts to more than $12 billion  cost the lives of more than 50 000 people  caused the displacement of 200 000 families and created close to 150 000 refugees.In conclusion  Mr. President  allow me to reiterate our sincere wishes for your complete success in conducting the proceedings of the forty-third session of the General Assembly and to assure you of the fullest co-operation of the Angolan delegation whenever necessary and at all times.The struggle continues. Victory is certain."
"3",104,"ALB",43,1988,"ï»¿Allow me  on behalf of the delegation of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania  to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina on his election to the post of President of the Assembly and to convey to him our best wishes for the successful discharge of hisimportant duties. We also congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  on his efforts to enhance the role of the United Nations in the cause of peace.For more than four decades now  each year  at each of its sessions  theGeneral Assembly has discussed major problems of concern to the internationalcommunity. These deliberations have sought to strengthen the role of the UnitedNations in finding solutions to problems relating to the aspirations of peoples forfreedom  independence  national sovereignty and independent development. If theUnited Nations has not always been able to discharge its functions  it is becausethe super-Powers have tried  in various ways  to use it to promote their ownpolicies and interests. SO many times the United Nations machinery has beenmisused to stifle the criticisms of Member States. Doubtless these attitudes runcounter to the interests of the overwhelming majority of States  which wish to seethe United Nations make sincere efforts to carry out its mission as a universalOrganization in keeping with the Charter.At present we are seeing signs of detente. We cannot but welcome this trend.Nevertheless  the fact is that we are living in a world fraught with contradictionsand confrontations. We are far from a real  lasting peace. Relations between theSoviet Union and the United States have entered a period of adjustment based ontheir political  economic and military interests. Indeed  recent decades haveshown that confrontations and arrangements between them have become cyclical.Their policy has not really changed its basic trend towards hegemony. One of themost important and constant parameters of this policy is the accelerating arms race.The most recent testimony to this was the third special session of the UnitedNations devoted to disarmament  which was held in June this year and ended withoutany result - even without the adoption of a final document. Outside the UnitedNations  as Members are aware  the two super-Powers  the United States and theSoviet Union  have reached an agreement on missiles which they hailed as a newstage in the process of disarmament  whereas here at the United Nations at aspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  the voices ofreason of Member States on the problem were ignored. This shows that thesuper-Powers consider questions of disarmament as matters exclusively within theirCompetence and interests and that they minimize the role of other States in thisarea  deeming it negligible. This tendency to monopolize world affairs and toexercise diktat over 'international relations is a real danger for sovereign peoplesand States. However important their role may be in view of their economic andmilitary potential  it cannot in any way replace the role of the internationalcommunity  in which all States must have an opportunity to state their views and todecide jointly on questions relating to the destinies of peoples and humanity andto international peace and security.The world economic situation is a source of real concern and cannot bedivorced from the political situation.Unbalanced international relations continue to penalize primarily thedeveloping countries  as a result of which most of them become increasinglyimpoverished and experience grave and widespread backwardness. Therefore theestablishment of international economic relations on the basis of equality has nowbecome a matter of great urgency.The economic situation and at the same time the political situation areindicators of the fragility of current international security.Without underestimating the value of any initiative taken to lessen tension in the opinion of my delegation  the Treaty between the United States and theSoviet Union on Euro-missiles does not yet mean that peace in Europe and the worldhas become more secure. As long as there is still confrontation between the twopolitical and military blocs on the continent of Europe and as long as the conceptof security is based on the balance of power  it will be difficult to talk abouttrue security. Life has shown us that the policy of blocs - the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact - and the military presence of thesuper-Powers limit the national sovereignty of other States that are members ofthem and kindles and increases the spirit of distrust and confrontation. By itstotally independent policy outside of blocs  Albania has  in its own way  made itsmodest contribution to the cause of peace in the Balkans and in Europe.Peace  international security and co-operation are one and indivisible. Therecan be no peace on one continent while there are tensions and conflicts in otherparts of the world. There can be no true security in Europe if the Middle East orother areas are in flames and in a state of insecurity.Albania has always been against regional conflicts and in favour of anegotiated settlement of discards. These conflicts  which have brought sufferingand poverty to the countries involved  have always been exploited by theimperialist Powers to the detriment of peoples and of peace.The Albanian Government welcomes the steps taken recently by the partiesdirectly involved in the conflicts to extinguish these hotbeds of tension. In ourjudgment  when it is a matter of putting an end to regional conflicts  it isimportant to define settlements that are acceptable to the parties involved  and not short-term solutions imposed from above. Similarly  we believe that it is justas important that the main contributions to these settlements should come from theStates of the region where the conflict is taking place since they are the onesmost interested in having a cease-fire in seeing peace established.We cannot disregard the fact that  frequently  conflicts are kindled orextinguished depending on relations between the United States and the SovietUnion - in most cases  even at their instigation. Therefore  to allow them then tobecome the arbiters of these conflicts would be to let the seed of discord andconflict remain. This can be seen very clearly from what is now taking place inAfghanistan. Those who committed aggression  as well as those who have constantlyfanned its flames throughout the conflict  are now posing as the saviors of thesituation  acting as guarantors of the Afghanistan agreement.But what kind of guarantors can these two super-Powers  the United States and theSoviet Union  be  if even after the agreement they continue to support andencourage the adversaries  in order to impose on the Afghan people a governmentthat would defend the interest of one or both of them? The Afghan people should befree to decide their own future without any foreign interference.The Albanian people and its Government welcomed the cease-fire between Iraqand Iran  which was welcomed by freedom-loving people throughout the world. Weappreciate the steps taken by the two countries to put an end to a war that hasserious consequences for the two neighbouring peoples and which is fraught withdanger for overall peace and security. We hope that this wisdom and thisdetermination will characterize the negotiations now under way between the twocountries. We cannot fail to stress that peace in this region is still threatenedby the presence of foreign fleets in the Persian Gulf. Peace cannot be preservedby the gunboats of the super-Powers; it can be preserved only by the peoples of theGulf States themselves. For all those who have sent warships into the region thequestion of the withdrawal of the fleets will be the real touchstone of their truedevotion to international peace and security.This year the Middle East has witnessed some very important events. Theuprising of the Palestinian popular masses which broke out on the West Bank andGaza against the Israeli occupiers and which has been resolutely carried on formore than a year now has created a new situation and the immediate task at hand isfor the Palestinian people to achieve their legitimate national aspiration fortheir own land. Doubtless  a lasting solution to the problems of the Middle Eastis impossible without a solution being found to the Palestinian problem. TheGovernment and people of Albania  consistent in its support of the just cause ofthe Arab peoples  will continue  as we have done in the past  to supportunreservedly the struggle of the suffering people of Palestine and that of allfraternal Arab peoples  to oust Israeli aggressors from the occupied territories.As a Mediterranean country  we cannot fail to be concerned about thepersistent presence of the war fleets of the super-Powers in the Mediterranean andwe cannot fail to stress the danger it involves. Their presence has not only madethe sea one of those militarized zones in the world  but has also more than oncecreated a dangerous situation.The most recent proposals for the so-called demilitarization of theMediterranean also seek to justify the balanced presence of the fleets of thesuper-Powers. In order for the Mediterranean to become a sea of peace andco-operation  the war fleets must be withdrawn and the bases and foreign troopseliminated.The development of friendly relations between our States and the Balkan Statesis a basic  ongoing tenet of the foreign policy of Albania. Albania not onlyproclaims the advantages of  and the need for  a policy of good-neighbourliness but by implementing it in practice has done its utmost to establish a politicalclimate favouring understanding  trust and true co-operation among the countries ofthis area.The Albanian Government has never sought conflict in the Balkans. It deems itits duty to work towards the establishment of stability in our region and theconstant improvement of the situation. Destabilization of any Balkan country wouldharm the balance of that area and peace in general. We believe that thoseprimarily concerned with the security and stability of the Balkans are the peoplesand States of the region themselves. They cannot fail to appreciate the importancefor them of keeping foreign elements at bay.In our view  the existence of different political and social systems in the Gulf countries should not become an obstacle to the development of State relations. Recognition of this fact and respect for it constitute an important premise for Balkan co-operation. We welcome the meeting of the foreign ministers of the Balkan States as a positive development  one that is helping to establish a spirit of understanding  trust and co-operation in our region. We are convinced that joint efforts could lead to steady progress in this positive process.Of course  the Balkans have problems. These are basically of a bilateral nature  but they also affect the region as a whole. However  common sense andrealism should prevail over the sad past  dominated by heated emotion. They should prevail over a present that is sometimes full of prejudice and actions fraught with consequences. One of the most acute problems  one that continues to be of concernto the States of our region  is that of the nationalities and minorities living in the territories of various countries. In the treatment of this rather thorny problem  on which the level of relations between Balkan countries has often depended  it would be necessary to proceed without undue emotion  but with wisdom  political wisdom  in a spirit of justice  keeping in mind specific historical facts  free from any narrow spirit of nationalism. This policy would help to strengthen understanding and trust between neighbouring countries. It would help to lessen and eliminate tension and to pave the way towards bilateral and multilateral cooperation. When minorities and nationalities enjoy all rights without discrimination  they become cohesive factors within a country  elements of rapprochement and friendship between peoples and countries of the region.Just as the extension of multifaceted relations between States is to their  advantage  the democratization of relations between various nationalities withineach country  equality between nations  nationalities and minorities  theirpromote friendship between them. We believe that the peoples and States of thecultural and economic emancipation help to bring people closer together and toBalkans  which cannot fail to have learned from their past and present history  arecapable of achieving that.The economic situation in Africa is of concern to the United Nations  which inMay of 1986 held a special session of the General Assembly devoted to thisquestion. Quite rightly Africa continues to be concerned with the gravity of thissituation  which in many cases has amounted to destitution and in which adisquieting shortage of food is threatening whole regions with real famine.The causes of this situation must be sought in brutal colonial domination and inthe present neo-colonial exploitation  which  in the most diverse forms and ways devours the rich resources of the continent and its cheap commodities  guaranteeingever-higher profits for the exploiters.Similarly  the imperialist  racist policy of the South African regime  whichimposes inhuman oppression and violence on the Azanian and Namibian peoples and isa permanent threat to the countries of southern Africa  is fraught withconsequences for the peoples and countries of Africa.The Government. and people of Albania supports unreservedly  and will continueso to support  the struggle of the Azanian people for freedom  the struggle of theNamibian people for national and social liberation and the struggle of all Africanpeoples against racism  apartheid and neo-colonialism. The People's SocialistRepublic of Albania also supports the efforts of the Korean people to bring aboutthe independent reunification of its homeland.Humanity is at the threshold of the twenty-first century. The mind andintelligence of man have made possible unprecedented progress in discovering thesecrets of nature  as reflected in discoveries that have become milestones inscience and technology and open up great possibilities for progress in discoveringnew horizons. We are bound to state  however  that the achievements of science andtechnology  instead of fully serving the cause of progress for the betterment ofmankind are often  because of imperialist policies  used to serve the arms race andpreparation for war. It is inadmissible that the achievements of science  insteadof being the priceless asset of the whole of mankind  should be made the monopoliesor domains of those that use them not only as a source of super-profits but also asa method of exerting pressure on and dictating to others. On more than oneoccasion during the past decade the majority of Member States  in particular developing countries  have forcefully raised the question of the transfer of technology as one of the goals of efforts to establish more just and equal international economic relations. Despite everything  these just demands have so far fallen on deaf ears.At the present time we are facing another negative phenomenon. Although by its very nature this problem may seem to be purely ecological  which it is  there is also a marked political overtone. I refer to the covert or overt efforts ofsome States to rid their territories of industrial waste  including toxic andradioactive waste  and dump it in other countries  primarily the developingcountries.It is therefore a paradox and unfair that the industrially advanced countries instead of transferring to the developing countries the technology that would helpthem to make progress  are offering to transfer waste  including toxic waste. Asif not content with the exploitation and other injustices they have imposed onthose countries  the big Powers are now committing against them acts that areinadmissible even from the most elementary human standpoint.It is true that the concern arising from ecological problems has now taken onregional  even world-wide  dimensions. The safeguarding of the environmentalbalance has now become a real concern for the Adriatic and Mediterraneancountries. The dumping of industrial waste  particularly from the chemicalindustry  has caused intolerable pollution  especially in the northern Adriatic.This is a semi-closed sea and the consequences of this type of pollution are evenmore serious.My country associates itself with the first steps towards co-operation in theecological sphere on an approach to problems regarding the protection of theenvironment in the Balkan peninsula and in neighbouring areas.The People's Republic of Albania pursues a totally independent foreignpolicy. Its centuries-long history  as well as the history of the past 40 years has taught the people of Albania to place its freedom  independence and completesovereignty  which are the basis of our State policy  above all else. Mostimportant of all  it has not considered these assets apart from the context of whatgoes on outside our country  apart from the freedom and independence of otherpeoples. we therefore respect other people and  at the same time  ask for: theirrespect. Accordingly  we are not afraid to co-operate with other States we desiresuch co-operation. We see it as Q way to promote our own development and tocontribute to the development of international relations and co-operation. It isimportant also that this co-operation be based on equality and mutual advantage and that it do no damage to the sovereignty or social system of any country.The delegation of Albania has stated the views of its Government on some ofthe most basic"" questions relating to current developments with the sincere desireof making its modest contribution to the consideration of certain agenda itemsbefore the Assembly. It will spare no effort  together with other Member States to help to ensure that the work of this session will be as fruitful and successfulas possible."
"4",172,"ARE",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of the United Arab Emirates it gives me great pleasure to extend to Ambassador Caputo ray heartfelt congratulations on his election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-third regular session. His election reflects the appreciation of the international community for the leading role played by Argentina at the regional level in Latin America and at the international level  especially at the United Nations. It also reflects the confidence the international community places in hire and in his ability to guide the proceedings of this important session with wisdom and confidence.It also gives me great pleasure to convey my sincere thanks to his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  for presiding so ably and judiciously over the previous session  its resumed sessions  and the special session.I would like  on this occasion  to reaffirm the confidence of my country in the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez dÃ© Cuellar  for his continued efforts to enable the Organization to cope with the problems it faces. I would also like to congratulate him on his efforts to enhance the role of the Organization  and to settle international and regional disputes peacefully and through negotiations. Most of his endeavours have been successful this year.The forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly is meeting in unique international circumstances in the wake of a number of international political developments  including the peaceful settlement of numerous regional disputes. Foremost among these developments was the summit meeting between the leaders of the two super-Powers last May. This meeting led to a great accomplishment with regard to disarmament  namely the ratification of the Treaty which calls for the elimination of shorter and intermediate-range nuclear missiles. The meeting also led to political achievements that will have positive far-reaching consequences  since the two super-Powers expressed their determination to reduce the tension existing between them by replacing lack of trust by open dialogue. In that summit meeting the two super-Powers created an atmosphere of detente  even agreement on the settlement of certain regional conflicts.This session is also unique in another respect; the fact that it is being held against the background of the United Nations success in settling a number of difficult regional problems. Through its various median isms  the United Nations has been instrumental in settling the problem of Afghanistan  and in stopping the war between Iran and Iraq. In addition  the Secretary-General has taken an initiative for the settlement of the Cyprus problem  and for the opening of a dialogue between the parties in the Namibian question in order to implement Security Council resolution 433 (1978).These achievements represent an important turning-point  signalling the opening of a new phase in international politics. We in the United Arab Emirates welcome these accomplishments and hops  or rather urge  that they be utilized for promoting peaceful coexistence and co-operation among nations in order that we may reach a new and more advanced stage of international relations. This stage should be based on respect for  and equality among  all nations  as well as on the right of all peoples to secure their freedom and independence. To reach this advanced stage  the following conditions must be met.First  the two super-Powers should not only sustain the new favourable political atmosphere existing between them  but they should also work diligently to promote it on the level of their bilateral relations  as well as on the level of their respective military blocs. Secondly  the success of the United Nations in solving certain regional problems must be a lesson to all of us. We must renew our confidence in the Organization and its effectiveness. We must enhance its role through the commitment of all States  especially the great Powers  to the Charter of the United Nations  and to its purposes and principles. We must also benefit from the organs of the United Nations in all fields  particularly the Security Council  which should be used as a forum for the conduct of negotiations with respect to urgent international problems  and which should be utilized for the adoption of preventive and other measures.The United Nations has become the basis for the international order of the future  and the instrument through which collective efforts can be undertaken to solve international conflicts and controversies  and to reduce the possibility of escalating regional conflicts into nuclear confrontations among the big Powers. The United Nations has also had many accomplishments in economic  social  human  legal  and other fields. In the light of all this  it is incumbent upon all of us to maintain these achievements  and to expand upon them by enhancing the role of the United Nations.Thirdly  we must utilize the existing favourable conditions by reinforcing the prevailing trend towards solving regional conflicts through the mechanism of the United Nations. We must above all expand the scope of this trend to cover other regional and human problems  most notably the Palestine question and the problem of racial discrimination in South Africa.	.	.My country welcomed the recent decision of the Islamic Republic of Iran to accept  as Iraq has done  Security Council resolution 598 (1987) as a basis for ending the war between the two Islamic countries. We also welcomed the decision of the two belligerents to cease fighting and to enter into direct negotiations in order to resolve all their outstanding problems. In this context  we express our appreciation for the role played by the United Nations Secretary-General in achieving the cease-fire and in bringing the two parties to the negotiating table. We also thank him for his continuous efforts to narrow the gap between the two parties.We  in the United Arab Emirates  consider the cease-fire agreement  and the subsequent direct dialogue  to be a major turning-point in the process of restructuring the future relations between the two countries. We hope that the recent developments will lead to an agreement on just and equitable peace principles that will leave no room and no pretext for resorting to arms once again in the future.As a Gulf country  we look forward to the restoration of peace and security in our region  a peace that is just and acceptable  and that is based on good-neighbourly relations among all Gulf countries  big and small  and on non-interference in internal affairs. We are following the negotiations very carefully  and we are certain that the two countries have a vested interest in the restoration of peace. We believe that good intentions will inevitably lead to this end. We shall do our best to make this happen. Despite international detente and the movement towards the settlement of a number of regional conflicts  the Middle East problem - with its core issue  the Palestine question - is still unresolved. It is still a source of tension and deep anxiety  and peace is not at hand. The Palestinian people are still suffering from oppression  imprisonment and torture under the brutal fist of Israeli occupation. Even though Israel 's aims in rejecting peace and insisting upon occupation are clear to everyone  it is difficult for us to understand the attempts of certain big countries to isolate the Palestine question from the trend of international peace. It is to be noted that Israel persists in creating obstacles  which the United States endorses  in order to obstruct the convening of an international peace conference. The convening of this conference has won the universal support of the international community.The crux of the problem is the fact that one of the two super-Powers fully endorses the aggressive policy of Israel and refuses to recognize the existence of the Palestinian people  who are oppressed and deprived of their basic rights. Indeed  this super-Power works jointly with Israel in a futile attempt to stamp out the Palestinian identity  hoping to remove the Palestinian people from the pages of history. But through its valiant uprising  which Israel has tried to crush with all its instruments of oppression  the Palestinian people has clearly demonstrated its full awareness oÂ£ its national rights  and its determination to secure those tights.For seven decades the Palestinian people has been tenaciously struggling for freedom  independence  and the ending of occupation. We are confident  therefore  that this long struggle will lead to freedom and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State. The present trend at the United Nations to use its mechanisms for resolving certain regional conflicts and problems affirms the validity of the view that the only mechanism for achieving a just and permanent peace in the Middle East is the holding of an international peace conference. This conference is to be held in accordance with General Assembly resolution 38/58 C  under the auspices of the United Nations  and with the participation on an equal footing of all the concerned parties  including the Palestinian people as represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  its sole  legitimate representative.Lebanon is still a source of danger and deep concern for all of us. This fraternal country will not return to normalcy unless Israel withdraws from Lebanese territory  ceases to meddle in its internal affairs  and stops its aggression against Lebanese towns and villages. We urge our brothers in Lebanon to put aside their differences and resolve their disputes through open dialogue  in order for Lebanon to regain its vanguard position in the fields of culture and progress.My country has followed with interest the process of negotiations and what has been reached so far with respect to the question of Namibia and putting an end to South Africa's continued aggression against Angola. We hope that the Pretoria regime will not renege on its commitment to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which constitutes a comprehensive blueprint for the independence of Namibia. In this connection  we wish to reaffirm our support for the struggle of the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). Despite the progress achieved with respect to the question of Namibia  the policy of apartheid  adopted by the white minority regime in South Africa  has been made more evil in its practices  thus causing more death and destruction. We strongly condemn the Institutional regime of this policy  which denies the basic rights of the overwhelming black majority. This violates the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and contradicts the tenets of justice and human progress. My country also strongly condemns the continuous acts of aggression  terrorism and destabilisation perpetrated by the Pretoria regime against the African front-line States.My country is a firm believer in the Charter. We therefore support its organs and call for the use of the mechanisms provided by those organs. We also wish to emphasize the need to abide by the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States non-recourse to the threat or use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes.Guided by this belief  the United Arab Emirates welcomed the conclusion of the Geneva Accords last April for the settlement of the question of Afghanistan. The mechanisms provided by the Secretary-General played an important role in the conclusion of these Accords and in the involvement of the two super-Powers in guaranteeing their implementation  including non-interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and full respect for its independence and sovereignty.We also welcome the recent dialogue among the parties to the Kampuchean problem and the constructive role played by the Governments of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in this regard.We also welcome the ongoing dialogue to solve the problems and conflicts confronting the countries of Central America. In this regard  we support the initiatives of the Contadora Group and the Support Group.Concerning Korea  we urge the North and South to settle their differences through free dialogue unhampered by pressure and pre-conditions  This should defuse the crisis and bring about the unity the Koreans so earnestly seek. We welcome the readiness of the Secretary-General to help the two Governments. With respect to Cyprus  we commend the Secretary-General for his latest initiative  which has had s more favourable response from the parties to the conflict. We also welcome the decision of the leaders of the Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities to co-operate with the Secretary-General  as well as their desire to meet without any pre-conditions and their setting of 1 June 1989 as the date for reaching a negotiated settlement for the Cyprus problem in all its aspects. We hope that the settlement will be just  comprehensive and durable. We also hope that within its framework  security and coexistence will be ensured for the two communities and that the settlement itself will guarantee the sovereignty  territorial integrity  and non-alignment of Cyprus.The third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament was held this year in a favourable international atmosphere of dÃ©tente. The successful results of the bilateral negotiations on disarmament conducted between the two super-Powers encouraged many participants in the special session to believe that those achievements could be transformed into new incentives for multilateral negotiations. Like many others  we nurtured the ambition that through consensus we would be able to agree on a final document that reflected the new developments in the field of disarmament. 3ut our ambition exceeded the prevailing realities owing to the lack of sufficient political will on the part of certain countries for arriving at a fruitful and successful conclusion to that session. As the Secretary-General has stated in his report on the work of the Organization  ""Disarmament and the regulation of armaments ... will remain a decisive test of the improvement of international relations and the strengthening of peace."" (A/43/1  p. 13) In this regard my country reaffirms its support for the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones  especially in the Middle East. We also reiterate our support for and commitment to the United Nations resolution declaring the Indian Ocean a zone of peace  and look forward to the elimination of all obstacles that have so far prevented the convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean.The improvements in international relations witnessed on the political level have not been reflected to the desired degree in the state of the international economy. Serious economic structural imbalances still persist. As a result  the prices of raw materials have become unstable and have even declined. Moreover  the policies of protectionism  the discriminatory practices and the restrictions imposed on the exports of developing countries have a detrimental effect on the process of development. They also cause an escalation in the crisis of foreign indebtedness faced by the developing countries.We believe that it is impossible to enhance international detente without consolidating the economic foundations upon which it rests. This requires a stronger spirit of co-operation and the enhancement of die role of international economic agencies  it also requires the adoption by the advanced countries of more flexible policies and the introduction of structural reforms in the system of international economic relations. We emphasize the importance of strengthening the role of the United Nations and its specialized agencies  as they constitute the main forum for dialogue and negotiations with respect to international co-operation for development. We also stress the need to abide by the principle of multilateralism and to pursue an integrated approach to the various problems pertaining to finance  currency  indebtedness  commerce and the resources devoted to development. Similarly  we call on all States to adhere to the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and to refrain from using commercial restrictions  blockades or sanctions as political tools for conducting economic relations in a manner that violates the Charter This session provides all Members of our international Organization with a valuable opportunity to review and re-evaluate both the great achievements attained through collective co-operation and the setbacks and obstacles resulting from selfish as aggressive policies. The United Nations offers an important frame of reference for such re-evaluation. The challenge before us today is whether or not we shall be able to utilize this session by drawing on our past experience  both positive and negative  for the purpose of reaching the right conclusions. The historical record proves that peace and security are synonymous with mutual trust and that they are the only means of elevating the human race to the desired level of economic growth  cultural advancement and social stability.Modern history has taught us that the United Nations  through its organs and mechanisms  is able to lead human society to more understanding and co-operation. Can we vest our confidence in the United Nations? More important  can we trust each other in order that we nay build a world in which justice and mutual respect prevail and man nay enjoy freedom and stability? Future developments  in the shaping of which we all participate  will provide the answers to these questions. "
"5",219,"ARG",43,1988,"ï»¿In recent years those of us who have taken part in these debates have normally begun by giving a pessimistic description of the world situation and a list of conflicts and situations threatening international peace and security. The persistence of centres of tension and unjust situations and the emergence or worsening of certain disputes justified this gloomy picture and to some extent caused our warnings  our feeling of hopelessness faced with what appeared to be problems without a solution  to become a habit.The United Nations was not spared that criticism. There was scepticism because of what was regarded as a paralysis of the Organisation's capacity as a mediator. We believe that the facts show that the criticism was groundless  and that  as we have affirmed in the past  this alleged weakness of the United Nations was caused only by a lack of as  element or in many cases the feeling of resignation of its Members.In international relations there are two alternating tendencies: a period of co-operation follows one of conflict  like swings of a pendulum  though in practice the periods often overlap. It would seem that in recent years there has been a change from the phase of conflict towards that of co-operation.The United Nations has played a part in this new dynamic. In fact  in many instances it has created the necessary framework in which the way towards a final settlement of long-lasting conflicts may at last be found  through dialogue and negotiation.This year  and particularly in the last few months  a number of breakthroughs have taken place which can be attributed largely to the Organization. It gives me great satisfaction to begin this statement by expressing the recognition of the Argentine Government of the key role played by the Secretary-General. Mr. Perez de Cuellar has succeeded in giving orientation and drive to the trend of co-operation to which I have referred.On the question of Afghanistan  after six years the determination and perseverance of the Secretary-General and of his Special Representative  now Ecuador's Foreign Minister  Mr. Diego Cordovez  led to the signing in Geneva of the agreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan  guaranteed by the Governments of the United states and the Soviet Union.In the case of Iran and Iraq we have also arrived at a cease-fire. Argentina  a non-permanent member of the Security Council  reiterates its commitment to the establishment of a just  honourable and lasting peace within the framework of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  and urges both parties to redouble their efforts towards building the future of peace and co-operation that both nations deserve.I consider it appropriate to emphasize at this point the momentum gained lately by the United Nations peace-keeping forces. In recent decades we have actively co-operated in various peace-keeping operations. Also  as an additional contribution to this undertaking  the Argentine Government today contributes personnel to the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group.Within this framework we also notice positive signs in the Maghreb region  and we welcome the resumption of diplomatic relations last May between Algeria and Morocco. We also view with hope the development of the process of consultations by the President of the Organization of African Unity and the Secretary-General of the United Nations with the countries of the region. We trust that just and lasting solutions to the question of Western Sahara may be found.  We cannot fail to mention the encouraging aspects of certain other major issues. I refer here to the new talks that are taking place on Cyprus and South-East Asia and between the two Koreas. Recent developments also make it possible for us to look hopefully towards the future in southern Africa. We must not slacken our efforts until a just  democratic and egalitarian society has been established in an independent Namibia. The only internationally agreed basis for the peaceful settlement of that question is the United Nations plan for the independence of the Territory  contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). All the relevant conditions for implementing the plan have been met. We hope that the talks engaged in by the Governments of Angola  Cuba  the United States and South Africa may be a sign of a change in the attitude of South Africa  marked so far by defiance of the international community. However  if that is not so  and if  on the contrary  South Africa seeks to perpetuate illegally its policy of colonial occupation of the Territory of Namibia  the United Nations must take the necessary steps  including those provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter  to achieve its goal of making Namibia independent.In parallel with these situations  we cannot but regard with concern the persistence of certain problems  with respect to which we must redouble our efforts  so that they are not left out of the phase of co-operation that I have mentioned.The events that have been taking place since last December in the occupied Arab territories have added another element to the already unstable and explosive situation prevailing in the Middle East. A just and lasting solution to the situation in that region can be reached only if it includes both acknowledgement of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to live in their territory  with the authorities and form of government that they freely choose  and the right of all States of the region  including Israel  to live within internationally recognized boundaries. Argentina considers it necessary to open channels of negotiation in order to find viable formulas for all the parties concerned. In this context  the convening of an international conference  under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation and consent of all the parties  could be an appropriate mechanism.The situation in Lebanon is again causing particular concern to the people and the Government of Argentina and occupying their attention. The Lebanese people must be able to exercise their inalienable right to live free of all foreign interference  thus recovering their full sovereignty.Another question is that of ending the apartheid regime of the South African Government. The rejection of apartheid has been clearly reflected in many General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. There will be no peace in southern Africa until it is totally and definitively eradicated. The most appropriate  effective and peaceful way to achieve that is to apply mandatory sanctions against the Government of South Africa  under Chapter VII of the Charter.I should now like to refer to the situation in Central America  a question in which my country has a direct interest  and which affects in a special way the whole continent. Last year in this debate we highlighted the political will of the five Central American Presidents  who confronted the regional crisis by signing the Guatemala agreement. Our country  a member of the Contadora Support Group  has worked  and is continuing to work  towards a peaceful and negotiated solution to the problems of that region. We understand that the objectives sought by the United Nations can be achieved only if the principles of non-interference and self-determination are respected  without delays or conditions.We believe that peace is directly linked to the concept of development. That is why we have sponsored the plan of assistance and co-operation for Central America worked out by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and adopted by the General Assembly this year. Since the signature of the Esquipulas II agreement  the countries of Central America have taken important steps towards peace. That shows that the way that has been chosen is the right and the only appropriate one consonant with the principles of the United Nations.The difficulties that have emerged in recent months must be dealt with in the same spirit. We the countries of America that feel committed to contribute towards a solution to this crisis  are convinced that force  threat and economic coercion must be left behind - indeed  that they have become a thing of the past.Only through co-operation  increasing integration and effective political will it be possible to initiate economic development  which is the key to any future stabilization. We are convinced that Latin America has entered upon a period of active solidarity in the solution of its problems. The initiatives of the Contadora Group and the Support Group resulted in the creation of the permanent mechanism for consultation and concerted political action. The Presidents of the Group  at their meeting at Acapulco  established a dynamic system for unifying the criteria for consultation and negotiation  with the basic aims of promoting the peace  development and democracy of our peoples  aims that are in agreement with the basic principles of the United Nations. Our work also includes other fundamental areas in which we must strengthen the co-operate phase upon which we have now entered: I am referring to disarmament  to social and humanitarian affairs  and to international economic relations.Disarmament  while it contributes to detente  ought also to be its logical consequence. The heads of State and Government of India  Greece  Mexico  Sweden  Tanzania and Argentina have continued to work actively in the Group of Six on the initiative for peace and disarmament  particularly in the priority task of nuclear disarmament.The implementation of the Treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles is  undoubtedly  an important step in the process of disarmament. The possibility of reaching agreement on the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons is  in turn  another auspicious element in the area of bilateral disarmament. Both will undoubtedly benefit international peace and security. However  this new atmosphere is not yet reflected on a multilateral basis. We believe that the present session is a propitious occasion to reflect the possibilities offered by this new situation in the field of disarmament.The convergence in political will should allow the Conference on Disarmament to make progress on such priority issues as stopping nuclear-weapons tests and preventing an arms race in outer space  as well as on the early conclusion of the preparation of a convention banning chemical weapons on a non-discriminatory basis.With regard to Argentina  we cannot  in dealing with this central issue of the United Nations over-all policy on disarmament  fail to mention the situation in the South Atlantic. Our country has fully and resolutely supported the initiative of the General Assembly  as reflected in resolutions 41/11 and 42/16  in which the South Atlantic has been declared a zone of peace and co-operation. The South Atlantic has been subjected to an unjustified militarization by nuclear-weapon States  which have established bases  carried our manoeuvres and moved their naval units in the area without restrictions  thereby adversely affecting the security of the region as a whole.For that reason a firm and vigorous response was called for. The States that co-sponsored the resolutions to which I have referred have worked actively towards the establishment of a concrete and effective means of consolidating peace and security in the region pursuant to General Assembly resolution 42/16. The final document produced by those countries and signed at Rio de Janeiro last July sets forth some basic principles; the issues of peace and security are linked with those of development and militarily significant Powers are urged to reduce their military presence and show restraint in this regard  banning the introduction of nuclear armaments.In the social and humanitarian field  my delegation wishes to associate itself with the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Nor can we fail to refer to the question of drug trafficking. We are resolutely determined to fight against that scourge  and we acknowledge the effort being made by our Latin American brothers  despite the difficult economic circumstances they are experiencing.Progress in the political field is in sharp contrast with the prospects for international economic relations. The truth is that  with regard to the question of development  little or nothing has been accomplished in the past few years. The main consequence of this omission during the present decade has been that the developing countries  particularly those of Africa and Latin America  have not been able to contribute to the growth of the international economy in a manner proportionate to their potential.The growing external debt of those countries has caused a massive reverse flow of financial resources that is setting up insurmountable barriers against the imports of the developing world and is posing a formidable obstacle to the growth of world trade. Sharp increases in interest rates  restrictions on commodity trade and protectionist measures in the industrialized countries  along with the enacting of subsidies for their own agricultural exports  indicate the lack of a global development strategy.As part of any global strategy it is essential that substantial progress be made towards the liberalization of international trade at the new round of multilateral negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  for which the mid-term review  to be held at Montreal in December  should agree suggested by the Cairns Group at its meeting at Bariloche  upon long-term reform in agricultural policy  a contractual freeze and a gradual reduction in agricultural support and subsidy measures and other policies that cause the greatest amount of economic distortion.The new strategy for global development must focus on a lasting solution to the problem of debt  which encompasses  on the one hand  a continuing process of structural reforms in the debtor countries and  on the other hand  the reduction of the total amount of indebtedness and a real transfer of financial resources towards those countries.Development is also necessary to ensure global security  within the framework of interdependence which I mentioned earlier. This analysis of the international situation and the dynamic process in which we are immersed leads to me share with you some thoughts about the internal functioning of our Organization. In 1985  the United Nations decided to initiate a process of reform that would enable it to respond to the challenges facing it with the greatest effectiveness and efficiency. Since then many efforts have been exerted in the search for formulas acceptable to all. However  much remains to be done. We believe that if we are to rely on the United Nations as a suitable instrument capable of meeting the needs of our times  we must as soon as possible move beyond this transitional stage. We are convinced that we will find solutions satisfactory to all. To achieve that  we are willing to make our contribution and to co-operate in the quest for agreements that will enable us to implement the objectives we set forth in General Assembly resolution 41/213. At the same time it is indispensable that the Organization be provided with stable financing so it may be in a position to give us what we expect from it. Otherwise  we alone shall be to blame. Thus  each Member State must continue to make every effort to fulfil its obligations without imposing conditions not provided for in the Charter.I wish to conclude my statement by referring to two matters on our agenda that are of special importance to my country. The first is the question of Antarctica. Argentina is linked to that continent by sovereignty  history and continuity. As an original signatory of the Antarctic Treaty  Argentina has participated actively in creating an effective and flexible system  open to all States  which has kept the continent free from conflicts  ensured that it be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and prevented it from becoming a setting for international discord.The second is the question of the Malvinas  an old colonial issue that has existed since the earliest stages of Argentina's independent development. A settlement became a real possibility with the advent of the decolonization movement encouraged by the United Nations  The Assembly is aware of  and has shown unmistakable signs of agreeing with  the constant willingness of the Argentine Government to achieve a just and final solution to this matter  which has high priority in my country's foreign policy.Since 1965 a succession of resolutions have called for negotiations between Argentina and the United Kingdom to reach a peaceful solution of outstanding problems  in particular the problem of the future of the Malvinas Islands. These resolutions lay stress on Argentina's efforts to comply with the demands of the international community  but so far these have been repeatedly thwarted by the position of the British Government  which has refused to begin comprehensive negotiations   despite the efforts of the Secretary-General  whose mission of good offices to bring together the parties to the dispute has been and continues to be acknowledged by Argentina.The recent heightening of tension in the area owing to measures that deepen the differences between the two countries is another source of concern for the region and the worldÂ·  this makes the prompt resumption of bilateral contacts even more essential.While reaffirming its sovereign rights over the Malvinas  South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and the adjacent seas  Argentina reiterates its willingness to enter into a dialogue with the United Kingdom  a wide-ranging  sincere dialogue  without pre-conditions  which would take into account and respect the interests of the inhabitants of the islands so as to ensure their well-being and prosperity.On this issue  as well as on other regional and global problems  my country is ready to co-operate actively in fulfilling the fundamental purposes of this Organization."
"6",277,"ATG",43,1988,"ï»¿Mr. President  I extend my country's congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. His ability and experience are well-known and we look forward to his wise counsel.Permit me also to pay tribute to the former President  Mr  Peter Florin  for the skilful manner in which he directed our deliberations over the past year. His guidance was most encouraging as he manifested a keen commitment to international peace and worked with passion and zeal towards getting positive results.In 1939  the  forking classes of Antigua and Barbuda formed an organization which has proved to be the catalyst of advancement and a leading force in securing our nation's independence. In January 1989 we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the labour movement and we are pledged to continue working for the betterment of all of our citizens  while emphasizing the specific needs of workers - workers who express themselves openly and frequently on both domestic and International matters  workers who recognize the significance and importance of the United Nations and who embrace and are dedicated to the principle of peace. On their behalf  and on behalf of all the citizens of our twin-island State  I should like to offer s interest congratulations to the United Nations peace-keeping forces on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize  We also wish to acknowledge the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  in building the bridges for the establishment of peace  and for the further strengthening of the operational machinery of this Organization.In this  our forty-third session of the General Assembly  Antigua and Barbuda is pleased that there is now a mood of optimism present in international affairs. Yet  small countries such as Antigua and Barbuda have watched with dismay as more and more emphasis is placed on bilateralism by the more powerful and more dominant countries. This retreat from multilateralism  if allowed to continue  can lead to a decline in the role of the United Nations. Matters of interest to the global community necessitate the participation of all countries  irrespective of size  ideology or financial solvency. We adhere to the principle enunciated in the Nassau Declaration of World Order emerging from the 1985 Commonwealth Summit held in the Bahamas  that ""in the world of today and tomorrow  international co-operation is not an option but a necessity"".We must remind ourselves that multilateralism is an expression of solidarity among States endeavouring to promote their mutual interests and to resolve conflicts through peaceful means and methods. We believe that the strength of multilateralism can only be assessed by how well it serves the international community in times of crisis and tension. In short  to negate the principle of multilateralism is to retreat and to completely erode the role envisaged for the United Nations by its founders - that of promoting peace  security  economic development and the self-determination of peoples yet unfree. Antigua and Barbuda bemoans the affliction of the world-wide community by the internationalization of crime  particularly terrorism and trafficking in narcotics. Both are of deep concern to our twin-island community. It is essential that multilateral co-operation be strengthened in an effort to save our own and future generations from those scourges. In specific regard to drugs  we are encouraged that the international conference on drug abuse has assigned a greater responsibility to the United Nations. Drug abuse breaks down the framework of the society which earlier generations have worked so very hard to build. It destroys our youngsters and literally turns many into unrecognisable creatures. As transit points in the trafficking of drugs  our small nations can be put at the mercy of wealthy and powerful drug barons. The major market of consumption must therefore be called upon to apply greater initiative in co abetting the drug problem since a significant decline in consumption will do such to help eliminate production. It is evident  however  that only through concerted action between producing  transit and major consuming States  will the international community be able to put an end to this scourge.Since 1983  Antigua and Barbuda has been at the forefront on the question of Antarctica. It is therefore with deep regret that we learned of the decision of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties  (ATCP) to disregard totally and completely General Assembly resolution 42/46 of 30 November 1987 on the ""Question of Antarctica"". It is even further regretted that the racist regime of South Africa was allowed to participate in the ATCP negotiations held in Wellington from 2 Kay to 2 June 1988. Antigua and Barbuda was profoundly astonished when  during the general debate  one Member State declared that it is linked with Antarctica by its sovereignty  its history and continuity. The concept of sovereignty in regard to Antarctica is one that we cannot understand or consider. Antarctica must remain the heritage of all mankind  not the possession of a few large States. We will continue to work dauntlessly and steadfastly for consensus on the question of Antarctica and we pledge to continue pressing for a moratorium on negotiations to establish a minerals regime until all members of the international community can participate fully in such negotiations. We further appeal to the ATCP States to have the Secretary-General or his representative attend all meetings of the Treaty Parties.	'Antigua and Barbuda is but one of the many small voices expressing their concern over the Antarctic issue. A joint approach by developing countries and other countries not members of the consultative group is necessary to achieve positive results. The United Nations has not been able to produce a consensus resolution on Antarctica since the year it was first placed on the agenda. However  unless the ATCP States broaden representation of the decision-making process  the United Nations will continue to be used as the forum in which non-ATCP States express their concerns and gain support for their position.We take this opportunity to outline another position that is of primary concern to the economic planners in my nation. Since the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly  island developing countries have emphasized that there has been a lack of sustained empirical work cm our development experience. Enough attention has certainly not been paid to the problems centred around transportation  communication and marine issues. More examination needs to be given to the relationship between imports and exports and the problems involved in attracting foreign investment.Antigua and Barbuda and other island developing States have repeatedly stressed that the use of traditional economic indicators in assessing our well-being are neither apt nor realistic. The overwhelming reliance on per capita gross national product presents major distortions. It does not reflect the fact that our island nations are too small to provide for our populations economically many services routinely afforded citizens of larger countries. It fails to reflect our inability to penetrate markets for our embryonic manufacturing industries  whose production levels reflect small size. It does not give an adequate representation of our vulnerability that a single hurricane can set back our development 10 years or more  destroy 50 per cent of our housing stock  and completely devastate our agriculture and tourism industries  witness Jamaica and the effects of hurricane Gilbert. Therefore we once again present a case for the use of more reliable economic performance indicators and for special assistance to island developing countries.While recognizing the outstanding role the United Nations is playing in bringing about solutions to international problems  it is impossible for this Organization to continue its efforts at the same level with its existing financial situation. Consequently it behoves Member States to contribute to its support on a reliable and permanent basis  we say this even though it is most apparent that many countries are experiencing severe financial difficulties.Well we know that the international community has to harness itself to tackle the difficulties posed by debt  by trade and commodity problems and by human resources development. The debt crisis can  however  be properly addressed only if debtor and creditor countries fully realize that our mutual interest lies in breaking the deadlock. We call for an environment that gives impetus to progress within developing countries and for a more vigorous and healthy growth in international trade.Public anxiety has increased throughout the world with the knowledge that the greenhouse effect has begun to impact upon our planet and will cause even greater atmospheric changes in the years to come. The threat to the ozone layer has brought about the realization that no individual country acting alone can protect its own environment. We acclaim the adoption of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and hope that it will be followed by other measures to protect the atmosphere.The threat to the ozone layer initially generated by affluent societies is inextricably linked with those of poverty  economic development and population growth. The reality is that the world's population will possibly double by the middle of the twenty-first century and that this growing population will be driven to use increasing amounts of irreplaceable natural resources which in turn will lead to the emission of higher levels of pollutants into the air by industry. In addition  the practice of trafficking in and the dumping of toxic wastes needs to be halted by immediate international action. We consequently join Norway in issuing a call for a strict international regime to protect developing countries from becoming a dumping ground for hazardous wastes. In the Caribbean  reliant as we are upon our natural beauty and cognizant of the fragility of our ecosystems  the dumping of hazardous wastes must not be allowed.In this the fortieth anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  we are appalled by the numerous violations of human rights in so many countries.We are saddened by news of summary arrests and executions  the disappearance of individuals and the systematic practice of detention and killings of unarmed demonstrators. The protection of human rights is given high priority by my Government  and we firmly subscribe to the belief that human rights is for all people and all nations. To press for human rights is to join the struggle for democracy and advancement. South Africa  unfortunately  continues steadfastly with its evil policy of apartheid. The Secretary-General in his report stated that ""Developments in  or relating to  the continuance of a situation of racial discrimination  which is so repugnant to the spirit of our age  lend further for CG to the repeated - and hitherto unheeded - urgings of the international community that apartheid be dismantled"". (Ð/43/1  p. 5)We again call for the unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and all those incarcerated in South African gaols as a consequence of their struggle for their right to be free and to be liberated from all shackles of bondage in their own country.Antigua and Barbuda wishes to urge once again the adoption of mandatory sanctions of a comprehensive nature against the Pretoria regime.It is important here to reaffirm that apartheid cannot be reformedÂ·  it has to be abolished. The racist regime continues to stifle all opposition to its abhorrent practices  and this includes the insulation of South Africa from scrutiny by the international press and the banning of anti-apartheid organizations in that country. We consequently reaffirm our commitment to the just struggle of the oppressed people of South Africa and Namibia - people who remain undeterred despite the intensity of the brutality of the racist Pretoria regime. Antigua and Barbuda welcomes the prospect for peace in Angola and Namibia. Peace has evaded Angola since independence and the international community is looking forward to a withdrawal of all foreign troops from Angola's soil. Likewise  we look forward to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  in an effort to bring peace and ultimate independence to Namibia. We are understandably both hopeful and sceptical  for well we remember that five years ago the Lusaka Agreement was to have produced a cease-fire  a disengagement on the part of South Africa  and the establishment of a joint commission for the purpose of monitoring. This agreement  however  collapsed by the end of the year of its inception  be it recalled.In Central America  we recognize that the momentum for peace has faltered since the signing of the Esquipulas II agreement; yet we are certain that the principal merit of the agreement lies in the democratization it brings to the area. Antigua and Barbuda urges full compliance by all the parties concerned. We are appalled by the devastation of national economies and the misery generated by civil conflicts. It is our firm belief that these conflicts are tooted in poverty. There is thus a need for a broader approach than is now evident in the solution of Central America's problems. In the same vein  our hearts go out to the Panamanian people in this period of extreme difficulty  and it is our hope that there will be a quick resolution of the crisis. In Afghanistan  the determined efforts of the Secretary-General and of Diego Cordovez produced  through the Geneva Accords in April  a basis for all Afghans Î¿ exercise their right to self-determination. The fact that this is the first instance in which the two most powerful States have become co-guarantors of an agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Secretary-General is of particular importance  especially to those of us from developing countries. This approach signals the beginning of the end of proxy wars waged by nations whose material storages can ill afford the squandering of scarce resources brought on by wars. We therefore urge all parties involved to co-operate with the United Nations good offices mission.My country welcomes the new atmosphere which has emerged between the FrenchGovernment and the Malenesian Kanaks as much as we applaud the initiation of a dialogue over the past year between the parties to the Kampuchean conflict. The people of Kampuchea yearn for peace and the framework has to be established in which citizens of that country are able to have a government from among their own - a government which will guarantee basic and fundamental human rights. The yearning for peace is also evident in Cyprus. The fact that the two sides involved in the Cyprus conflict have expressed their desire to meet without pre-conditions and to attempt to reach a negotiated settlement on all aspects of their problems  augurs well for the future. We therefore encourage theSecretary-General to continue in his perseverance in obtaining a workable solution. I turn to the Middle East. The situation in the Middle East continues to have the propensity for generating repercussions in a far wider sphere. We therefore urge the United Nations to continue in its quest to find a lasting settlement to the Middle East question - a settlement which will guarantee the right of all States and peoples in the region to exist in peace within recognised and secure borders. The best hope for such a solution lies in the convening of an international peace conference specifically geared to problems of the Middle East. The interests of all concerned are best served through dialogue and negotiation in an atmosphere dedicated to peaceful resolution.A peaceful resolution in Lebanon is also desirable. The endless cycle of communal violence in Lebanon is most distressing. Antigua and Barbuda stands ready to endorse any proposal leading to full Lebanese sovereignty over the entire country which guarantees the withdrawal of foreign troops from the area.One final word. In South-East Asia we acknowledge the existence of two Koreas as a consequence of the Second World War. We have  however  been pleased to hear of the new policy of the Republic of Korea as enunciated in the special declaration of President Roh Tae Woo on 7 July 1988. The President's statement embodies an epoch-making six-point policy on inter-Korean affairs and lays the basis for a reconciliation between the two countries.The Republic of Korea is celebrating its fortieth anniversary. It has demonstrated full maturity  as evidenced by its hosting of the twenty-fourth summer Olympic Games in Seoul and the establishment of diplomatic relations with as many as 121 Member States of the United Nations. When we consider that there are other countries in the United Nations which had suffered the same divided fate as the Koreas  we can find no logical cause or explanation to deny the Republic of Korea membership in this body.We are indeed thrilled that the United Nations has been an important participant in the easing of world tensions. We believe that the United Nations must continue to play an ever-increasing role in international affairs if peace and justice are to become universal. Small nation States like my own look increasingly to international law for protection  and we are keenly aware of the role of the United Nations in promoting respect for law.As workers in Antigua and Barbuda prepare to celebrate 50 successful years of trade unionism  let us here commit ourselves in this forty-third session to securing for the world's peoples a greater degree of freedom and justice through this the parliament of parliaments. "
"7",324,"AUS",43,1988,"ï»¿I warmly congratulate Mr. Caputo of Argentina on his election to the important post of President of this General Assembly. Our two countries share important objectives in relation to Antarctica and the liberalization of trade in agricultural products. I also acknowledge the courageous role he personally has played in the consolidation of constitutional democracy in Argentina. It is a great pleasure  therefore  to see him presiding over our deliberations at this particularly auspicious time for the United Nations. This year of 1988 is not only a special one for Australia  marking our bicentenary  but also for the United Nations  marking as it does the fortieth anniversary of the? Universal Declaration of Human Rights  a landmark in the struggle of the international community to guarantee individual rights for all people. Not entirely coincidentally  it is also the fortieth anniversary of the presidency of this Assembly of one of the founding fathers of the United Nations  and one of its strongest voices on behalf of the small and middle Powers  Herbert Vere Evatt  then Foreign Minister of Australia  who worked strenuously for  and announced during his presidency  the adoption by the General Assembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.In preparing to address this Assembly for the first time  I turned for a little encouragement to the wisdom and writing of my distinguished Labour Government predecessor  and I was not disappointed. A very great deal that Mr. Evatt did and thought  and that was important to him  stands the test of those 40 years. Twice in his lifetime Mr. Evatt had seen the world tear itself apart. In the First World War both his brothers were killed. He had seen the League of Nations collapse into impotence and irrelevance. In the Second World War he had been Foreign Minister when Australia was in grave peril. To him  therefore# the introduction to the Charter - ""We  the people of the United Nations  determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" - was not just a resounding piece of rhetoric but a commitment born of despair and necessity.Fortunately  we have all been spared a third world war since then but this period has seen  tragedy and suffering wrought on our fellow human beings by a continuous epidemic of conflicts - both regional and internal - which have blotted the world's landscape. We have seen the return of chemical weapons. War has filled the refugee camps of the world. Violence has been father to suffering poverty and homelessness  on a scale that indicts us all.The United Nations has performed indispensable work in dealing with the tragic consequences of these conflicts  but the sad reality is that for most of the past four decades it has largely been blocked from performing the task for which it was pre-eminently created  the peaceful resolution of conflict itself. So it is with a profound sense of hope for the future that we look back over the past 18 months. From southern Africa to the Western Sahara  through the Middle East  the Mediterranean  across to Afghanistan and Cambodia  we see the United Nations  led by its Secretary-General  at last bringing to bear the collective will and commitment of the nations of the world.The Secretary-General and the United Nations peace-keeping forces thoroughly deserve their award of this year's Nobel Peace Prize. The Prize is a very timely  recognition of the commitment that this Organization must continue to assert: that deep-seated and genuine differences must be resolved without blood and agony for ordinary men and women caught up in conflicts not of their own making.In Afghanistan  despite many problems  the Geneva Agreements are holding. The Soviet Union has met the target for the withdraw of 50 per cent of its forces  and we urge that it maintain the agreed target of the complete withdrawal. Withdrawal will provide the conditions for the essential next step of allowing the people of Afghanistan to decide for themselves the form of government. The international community has a responsibility  through the United Nations  to assist in the reconstruction of that land devastated by invasion and war and to help provide for the millions of refugees it has created.We have all greeted with immense relief the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq  another extraordinary achievement of the United Nations. But we are deeply concerned that  although the fighting has stopped  there has been little apparent progress in talks between Iran and Iraq under the auspices of the Secretary-General. Australia urges both countries to bring about an enduring peace  in accordance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987) In southern Africa there is a distinct prospect that independence for Namibia is at hand but it is still only a prospect. As a traditional supporter of the United Nations peace-keeping activities  Australia reconfirms its willingness to participate in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group for Namibia Australia also fully supports the efforts of the Secretary-General towards resolving the conflict in Western Sahara. In recent weeks  the most promising meetings in many years have occurred between the President of Cyprus and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community  again under the auspices of the Secretary-General There have also been encouraging signs in my own region. My visit to New Caledonia three weeks ago and my discussions there with all major parties confirm that the process set in train by the Matignon and Oudinot accords not only is workable but has generated a whole new spirit of reconciliation and optimism. The process to which the Rocard Government and all the major groups in New Caledonia have committed themselves has Australia's support and that of the South Pacific Forum. We in the South Pacific share with France a determination to assist the peaceful evolution of New Caledonia to self-determination in a way which ensures that the legitimate interests of all the people of New Caledonia  including its indigenous Melanesian population  are fully protected  and their aspirations are given a chance to be realized.Once again  after many years  Korea is on the agenda of the General Assembly - but for the first time as a single item. Australia heartily endorses the common goal of this new item peace  reconciliation and dialogue in the Korean peninsula. Australia finds encouraging the recent willingness by both South and North Korea to consider resuming dialogue. We believe there is now a real opportunity to bring to an end 35 years of confrontation.There have also been important recent developments relating to the conflict in Cambodia. Talks are taking place among the concerned parties. The Jakarta Informal Meeting  ably presided over by Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas  realistically noted that a solution would require not only the withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces but also the prevention of the return of the genocidal policies and practices of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) draft resolution this year makes that point  and we welcome that statement.There remain  regrettably  a number of regional conflicts and tensions where there has been less progress.Australia is especially concerned about the seemingly intractable nature of the Arab-Israeli dispute. Australia's commitment to the State of Israel is firm; it may be traced back to Mr. Evatt's time and it has not wavered since. The right of Israel to exist within secure and recognized boundaries is and must remain an indispensable condition of peace. It is from this firm basis of commitment and friendship to Israel that we say that peace and justice for Israel will be found only when there is also peace and justice for the Palestinians. The right of self-determination for the Palestinian people  including  if they so choose  the possibility of an independent Palestinian State  must be recognized. Israel's friends can only view with concern the continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Recent events there put at stake its reputation and future as a liberal democratic State and risk increasing isolation from traditional friends and supporters  like ourselves  who place priority on respect for democratic ideals and fundamental human rights.It is also time for the Palestinians to take historic decisions regarding their relations with Israel. The Palestine Liberation Organization must reject  unequivocally  the use of terror  accept the process of negotiation and be prepared  clearly and without equivocation  to recognize Israel; To be durable  any negotiated settlement must take account of the legitimate interests also of the Syrian Arab Republic  Jordan  Lebanon and other countries of the region.In Burma we have witnessed tragic loss of life as the Burmese people have struggled for their political and economic rights. The Burmese people have our deepest sympathy  and I offer to them Australia's support in the period of reconstruction and reconciliation which must follow the resolution of the current crisis.While there is much still to be done  recent events do hold out prospects for peace that only a few years ago would have been thought of as naive fantasy. Who among us two years ago - even one year ago - would have envisaged  for example  that President Reagan would be able to stand before us at this time and say that in many regional conflicts the Soviet Union had shown a ""spirit of constructive realism""? The United Nations itself has been a crucial contributor to the improved East-West atmosphere. The United Nations needs the great Powers  but the great Powers also need the United Nations. There is a wide and growing agenda of issues that cannot be resolved by the great Powers acting unilaterally or bilaterally. The great Powers  alone or together  can hamstring the United Nations; but  alone or together  they cannot by themselves make it work. An effective United Nations requires the collective will and commitment of the whole international community. It is only when this is fully accepted by everyone that the recovery of the United Nations  with all its potential  will become permanent. There can be few areas where this is better exemplified than disarmament and arms control. The conclusion by the United States and the Soviet Union of the Treaty on the Elimination of intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  the first arms-control agreement eliminating an entire class of nuclear weapons  is a truly significant development  as is the acceptance under that agreement of highly intrusive provisions for verification  which  in turn  make further agreements possible. Great progress has been made towards concluding an agreement to cut by SO per cent strategic nuclear arsenals and for all those developments Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev deserve the gratitude of us all.But nuclear disarmament and arms control are not matters exclusively for those great Powers that currently possess nuclear weapons. For if there is nuclear conflict  it is not just the peoples of the nuclear-weapon States who will suffer. The peoples of the world will be devastated. As the potential victims of nuclear catastrophe  the peoples of all nations have the right to demand real progress and the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. They have the right to demand that the nuclear-arms race not take new forms  including its spread into outer space.One of the few things that has given the people of the world some confidence that nuclear catastrophe will not occur is that almost all the nations of the world have undertaken not to acquire nuclear weapons. Australia considers the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which embraces that commitment  to be perhaps the single most important arms-control agreement in existence. We consider its preservation to be of paramount importance to peace and security.We understand and have shared the frustrations many countries feel at the glacial pace of progress towards nuclear disarmament  but we do not believe that frustration is well served by bringing into question the Non-Proliferation Treaty itself. Does any nation really believe that its security or the safety of the world would be served by a world in which yet more States had nuclear weapons? Further nuclear proliferation would bring about an even more desperately dangerous world than the one we now inhabit. So we appeal once more to those countries that have not yet become parties to the Treaty to do so without delay. And  remembering - as we always must - the terms of the compact that lies behind the Non-Proliferation Treaty  in which the nuclear-weapon States undertook to negotiate nuclear disarmament in good faith and at an early date  we appeal once again to those existing nuclear-weapon States to accelerate the progress they have been making towards the elimination of those weapons.The urgent conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty to prohibit all nuclear tests by all States in all environments for all time would be a major barrier to the further refinement of nuclear weapons  and it would be an additional obstacle to prospective proliferation. I hope the Assembly will once more resoundingly call upon the Conference on Disarmament to resume work on its nuclear-testing item.The most immediate threat is posed by chemical weapons. The Secretary-General  after careful investigation  has found repeated use of chemical weapons in the Gulf region. We condemn such use without qualification or equivocation. We are convinced that the only solution to the increasing use and spread of these abhorrent weapons lies in the early conclusion by the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva of a comprehensive chemical-weapons convention. Australia actively supports all practical measures to advance the negotiations for a convention and to prevent the further erosion of international norms against the use of chemical weapons.In this context the proposal for an international conference on chemical weapons use  made last week in the Assembly by President Reagan  has the support of the Australian Government and  we hope  of all Member States of the United Nations. Ito give effect to that proposed we roust seek to ensure that the international conference is open to participation by all States  is convened as soon as possible this year and is attended at a very high level. The conference must have a clearly defined central purpose: a declaration that chemical weapons roust never be used and a commitment to bring into existence Ð° universal chemical-weapons convention  as currently being negotiated in Geneva  which would rid the world of chemical weapons for all time.One of the clear messages to come from the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament in June was that we all have a responsibility for disarmament. We cannot lay the blame for the state oÂ£ the world only at the door of whose who possess nuclear arsenals.The quest for greater security through higher and higher levels of conventional arms is only too well known too us all. The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development provided ample evidence. It is a simple proposition that more arms do not equal greater security. They feed the apathy of instability and the offers of those who choose to supply arms at levels that are well beyond those needed for self-defence. The only way that peace and security will ultimately be guaranteed is by universal acceptance of the principles of common security so well articulated by the Palme Commission in 1982  the thrust of whose conclusions is that no country can guarantee its own security by threatening others and that real security is achieved  not against other countries  but with them.While the founders of the Organization saw immediate issues of peace and security as the pre-eminent role of the United Nations  they also understood clearly that the roots of many of the world's conflicts lay in poverty  suffering and abuses of human rights. Australia insists that human rights know no boundaries. Human rights must always be high on the Organization's agenda. The repulsive and contemptible system of apartheid in South Africa is the most serious instance of institutionalized abuse of human rights facing us today  and we continue to urge the United Nations Security Council to adopt comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions as an effective means of bringing apartheid to a peaceful end.In the absence of such mandatory United Nations sanctions we have worked within the Commonwealth to develop an effective pattern of economic sanctions aiming particularly the banking and financial system  as well as strategies to meet South African propaganda and to strengthen the economic security of the front-line States in meeting destabilization by South Africa.Australia also recognizes that all countries must be answerable to the nations of the world on these issues  and we are willing ourselves to answer to the nations of the world for Australian policies and actions. Every year sees an anniversary of one kind or another  but 1988 is  as I have already said  a special one for my country. Two hundred years ago Europeans arrived to establish permanent settlement in Australia. Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders  of course  were there before us. They are  in fact  celebrating at this time not their bicentenary  but their bicentennial bicentenary - some 40 000 years of habitation on Australian soil. All too many of the 200 years of European settlement have been  for our original Australians  years of discrimination  cruelty and oppression  Australians today cannot reverse that history  but not are today's Australians responsible for it. Our duty today is to acknowledge the truth of our history and to redress it.In the past 20 years significant progress has been made. Aboriginal and Islander Australians have the same legal and civil rights as other Australians. We are taking special measures to accelerate access to services and to provide a basis for further economic  social and legal advancement. We are seeking to complete a compact or agreement with our Aboriginal people and Islanders  acknowledging their rightful place not only in the past of our ancient continent but in its present and future.Although much has been done to improve the position of Aboriginal Australians  much remains to be done. We have undertaken to the descendants of our original inhabitants - and I repeat that undertaking to the United Nations - that we will leave undone nothing that can be done co right this great wrong of our past. ... Social prejudice and discrimination have  no place in any contemporary society and have none in my country today. Over 20 years ago bipartisan agreement was achieved within Australia to bring to an end the abhorrent but long officially sanctioned racially restrictive immigration policy. I bring here now  on behalf of my Government  the solemn undertaking  recently confirmed by resolution of both Houses of our national Parliament  that never  again shall we allow race to be used as a criterion in the exercise of our sovereign right to decide who shall enter our country. That undertaking is made hot only as a reflection of deeply held principle but also because if Australia were to do otherwise we would deserve the censure of the world. Australia shares with developing countries the conviction that the United Nations has a major role to play in the areas of international trade and development. We have a commitment second to none to ensuring the success of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). That Round is a historic opportunity for the world to demonstrate conclusively its commitment to the multilateral trading system and to forestall the fragmentation into hostile trading blocs that damaged us all in the 1930s. The potential benefits of liberalization are great and the need is urgent. Results in key areas will be very important at the mid-term review of the Uruguay Round to be held at Montreal in December. Early results will enhance the confidence of the participants in the Round and establish a solid base for its ultimate success.As efficient producers of agricultural commodities  Australia and its fellow members of the Cairns Group of Fair Trading Nations in Agriculture have a common Interest in promoting a more liberal trading system in agriculture. The benefits  however  can be far more widely shared. Recent research indicates that food importers would benefit from liberalization and the removal of distortions in international agricultural trade. The adoption of market-oriented agricultural policies in the industrialized countries lies at the heart of the agricultural trade reform issue.Nor are our interests confined to agricultural trade reforms. Australia strongly supports efforts to strengthen the GATT framework  secure a broad-based liberalization of trade and extend multilateral discipline into new areas such as services and intellectual-property rights. The Uruguay Round provides an opportunity for us all to tackle these persistent and serious problems  an opportunity that might not come again soon.The value of the United Nations is demonstrated most particularly when the Organization helps resolve problems which respect no national boundaries. One such problem is the environment  especially changes to the world's climate. Australia and our island neighbours in the Pacific and Indian Oceans have already pointed to the potentially serious consequences of the warming of the Earth's atmosphere. The very existence of a number of our fellow countries in the world is at stake. It is only by a total international commitment that we can protect ourselves  and we look to the General Assembly to give a stronger focus to international measures for dealing with this threat to our environment.The Antarctic Treaty is a good example of international co-operation embracing environmental and disarmament concerns. It has grown from the original 12 signatories in 1959 to 38 with the accession in May of Canada. The disarmament provisions of the Antarctic Treaty ensure that the Territory is used only for peaceful purposes. The Treaty has promoted scientific research  environmental protection and conservation  has kept the continent free from international tensions  and deserves continuing support.This session of the General Assembly has commenced on a note of high optimism not least because of the commitment of the United States to meet its financial obligations to the United Nations and to pay its arrears. Australia has always maintained that all Member States must abide by their obligations to the Charter of the United Nations. All should pay their assessed contribution in full and on time  and Australia has always done so.The decision of the United States to meet its financial obligations should not give rise  however  to complacency about the need for reform. Much has been done to make the United Nations more efficient since the Group of 18 Intergovernmental Experts submitted its report on reform in 1986  but there is still much to be done  especially in implementing an improved budgetary process  ordering priorities and avoiding duplication. A strong  efficient United Nations is the best guarantee that the Organization will be able to meet the new and different challenges it confronts. It is only if the United Nations is strong and efficient that continued support can be guaranteed from the parliaments and the taxpayers of its Member States  This is especially the case at a time when new peace-keeping operations are likely to place much greater burdens on us all Australia will not shrink from its share of that burden now that the United Nations is succeeding in its pre-eminent role of peace-maker and peace-keeper. We have contributed personnel and financial resources to the peace-keeping force in the Gulf; we have committed funds for the rehabilitation of Afghanistan; we have committed ourselves in principle to providing 300 personnel to United Nations transitional arrangements in Namibia  It is against that background - and with those credentials  I guess - that we urge the Secretariat to ensure rigorous economy in developing its peace-keeping plans.The reform process should proceed at many levels. There is an urgent need for rationalization of the economic and social areas of the United Nations. The Secretary-General must have greater flexibility in adjusting the human resources of the Organization to meet emerging priorities such as peace-keeping  human rights  drug-control programmes and the status of women I began my remarks today by referring to Mr. Evatt  Lat me conclude the same way. Evatt was a towering figure in Australian life. He was one of our greatest lawyers  a judge of our High Court  Chief Justice of a State Supreme Court. He was Attorney-General; Foreign Minister and a Leader of the Opposition. He was a journalist and a writer - not always the same thing. For decades he was at the centre of political  social and economic change in our nation  often its most controversial figure. He was an ardent nationalist. But to this ardent nationalist nothing in his entire life's work was more important than this international Organization here in New York. For all his many achievements and titles and honours his modest grave in our national capital has inscribed on it only his name and the words ""President of the United Nations Assembly"".Evatt described in his characteristically straightforward way what he saw as the objective of the United Nations. In 1948 he pleaded for Governments to keep faith with their peoples. They wanted  he said  ""not very much just peace and justice and decent standards of living  for themselves perhaps  but mainly for their children.""Those words are simple and modest. They remind us that this place does not belong to the powerful or the wealthy  that it does not exist for diplomats or officials or statesmen. This Organization belongs to the ordinary men and women of our world. It was founded on a promise to those men and women that never again would their leaders bring upon them war  injustice and poverty. That promise has not to date been honoured.We have today a second chance  a chance to fulfil that 40-year-old promise to our peoples to bring them peace  justice and a decent standard of living.Let us get it right this time."
"8",371,"AUT",43,1988,"ï»¿It is with great pleasure that I congratulate Mr. Caputo on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. That election is a recognition of his own personal status  and also honours his country Argentina. Let me also convey our sincere thanks to his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  who presided so ably over the General Assembly at its forty-second session.A special tribute must also go to the Secretary-General. His untiring efforts to promote peace and international co-operation have been instrumental in the achievement of impressive breakthroughs in a number of regional conflicts. The Secretary-General's unflinching commitment to the principles and purposes of the Organization he has been called upon to lead ought to inspire all of us assembled here. Austria welcomes the turning-point in the perception of the United Nations  as it has always favoured the strengthening of the Organization and of the position of the Secretary-General as art essential factor not only in securing international peace but also in advancing the progress of mankind.Rarely before have we seen a more lively demonstration of what the United Nations can in fact achieve  as it pursues at an accelerated pace its major goal  namely the establishment and preservation of peace. The merits of this world Organization and  in particular  its Secretary-General  have again been universally recognized. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces fills us as a major troop contributor  with joy  satisfaction and pride. That award is a tangible manifestation of current developments. Member States now expect the United Nations not only to continue but also to expand its peace-keeping and peace-making role. It is therefore of paramount importance that the United Nations rests on a sound financial basis which in turn is an indispensable pre-condition for successful operations. A prolongation of the present financial crisis would cripple the prospects for new and more significant steps on the long and winding road towards reform and improvement of the Organization's procedures and practices. Reform is an ongoing and continuous process for which the Member States and the managers of the various programmes of the United Nations system are equally responsible. I am pleased to note that various measures taken by the Secretary-General have already perceptibly increased the efficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations.In past years we heard a lot about the United Nations crisis. Some voices even went so far as to predict the end of voluntarism. Certainly  we have to admit that United Nations activities still lack the essential financial underpinning. But the political crisis seems to be over. We see today a resurgence of multilateral diplomacy under the auspices of the United Nations. The Secretary-General has skilfully taken advantage of the prevailing new international climate.Within the time-span of a new months  agreements on Afghanistan were signed; a truce in the Gulf war was achieved; direct talks and negotiations between Iraq and Iran are under way; agreement was reached between the leaders of the two communities of Cyprus to reopening their dialogue; a solution of the question of Western Sahara was agreed upon in principle by those concerned; and  finally  the United Nations may well be about to play a vital part in the release of Namibia to independence. Let me state this unambiguously: Austria has always believed in the United Nations and its potential for the solution of international crises. My country is proud of the role the United Nations is playing today in peace-making and peace-keeping and will continue fully to support these activities in an internaticÐ»Ð°1 scenario marked primarily by a new East-West relationship.Peace-keeping operations are among the success stories of the United Nations. I am deeply convinced that Austria's participation in  and commitment to  peace-keeping operations is one of the most effective ways in which a neutral country can make its contribution to the preservation of peace. More than 25 000 Austrians have worn the blue helmet. At present close to a thousand Austrian soldiers are serving in Cyprus  on the Golan Heights  at various locations in the Middle East and - since a few months ago - also in Afghanistan and Pakistan  as well as in Iran and Iraq.Austria did not hesitate to participate in peace-keeping activities when it was asked to do so. It is our experience  however  that in some cases troop contributors have to shoulder a disproportionately heavy financial burden. This is the case notably with the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). The participation in a peace-keeping operation always entails considerable cost for the troop contributors  as the compensation offered by the United Nations never covers all the cost the troop contributor incurs. It is simply unfair to continue to discriminate against the Cyprus operation merely for historical reasons and one has to accept  in that case  that the reimbursement is chronically insufficient. It is high time for a solution to be found to rectify this anomaly. We therefore hope that the Secretary-General's endeavours to have the financing of UNFICYP based on assessed contributions by the membership at large will be successful in the year to come. Despite continued outrageous violations of human rights in many parts of the world  progress was achieved in the promotion and protection of human rights.Often we restrain ourselves from pinpointing specific situations in order not to jeopardize the maintenance of a dialogue which is a prerequisite for further positive developments in this area.The tenth of December will mark the fortieth anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human nights. The completion of the time-span of four decades since the adoption of that Magna Carta of all mankind is an appropriate moment for reflection on the remarkable achievements that have been made in the human rights field  the serious shortcomings that still persist in many areas and the challenges that lie ahead.Looking back to the origins of the Universal Declaration one must pay tribute to the courage and vision of its drafters  who were motivated by the ardent desire that the appalling disrespect for human life and dignity they had witnessed during their lifetime should never be repeated. Most regrettably  those rights are still violated to a large extent throughout the world.In Austria's view the aim of the protection of human rights is to ensure the dignity of the human person  to safeguard his social and economic well-being and to allow for the free development of his entire personality. We hold the opinion that all human rights are indivisible and interrelated. The dignity of the human being cannot be guaranteed  if the necessary economic  social and cultural pre-conditions do not exist. However  adverse economic and social conditions can never justify the denial of civil and political rights.The Declaration led to the adoption of a new approach concerning human rights whereby the community of nations recognized that respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the individual was no longer within the exclusive domain of national governments  but was a matter of concern for the international community at large. This conviction is shared by Austria: expressions of concern that human rights are not observed in a certain State cannot be considered as interference in the domestic affairs of that particular State. On the other hand issues of human rights ought not to be brought before United Nations organs to be used exclusively for political purposes.Let us now assess some of the major achievements of the United Nations in the human rights field: first  the ""common standard"" laid down by the Universal Declaration has been refined and elaborated in an impressive array of international instruments  for which the Declaration provided an inexhaustible source of inspiration. Important mechanisms have been developed within the Organization  or within special treaty bodies  in order to monitor the implementation of international human rights law. Suffice it to mention the International Covenants on human rights  the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  which have introduced sophisticated international control mechanisms.I wish to pay a special tribute to the Commission on Human Rights and its subsidiary organs - in particular  its special rapporteurs  who relentlessly endeavour to identify various violations of human rights and propose ways to improve particular situations. It is not the fault of the United Nations if the implementation of human rights norms remains imperfect.	.Let me highlight only a few of the problems confronting us. The question of the human rights of all persons subjected to any form of detention or imprisonment is still of the greatest concern. It is precisely when a person is totally in the power of others that the worst human rights abuses occur: flagrant denial of all human values  ranging from disrespect for the individual's personal dignity through different stages of degrading  inhuman and cruel treatment to the most atrocious and sophisticated means of physical and mental abuse  and finally to the deliberate action of human life. The entry into force of the Convention against torture  to which Austria has become a party  is certainly a major step forward in combating that particularly serious and  regrettably  widespread violation of human dignity. A convention against torture has been elaborated within the Council of Europe providing for a system of periodic visits by independent experts to places of detention or imprisonment. Since we believe in the universality of human rights  I should like to suggest that such a system of preventive visits be created on a global basis.Regrettably  intolerance  discrimination and even persecution on the grounds of religion or belief  continue in today's world on a large scale. Freedom of religion and belief is  however  a central element in the freedom of the human being. Where this freedom is denied all other fundamental freedoms are in danger. In this context  we place a high value on and consider important the inter-confessional dialogue  based as it is on recognition of the inherent dignity of the human person  as a means further to strengthen human rights.In order to facilitate concerted action by the international community in this field  the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief should be supplemented by a binding international instrument.The freedom of minorities of all kinds - ethnic  religious or linguistic - to preserve their specific heritage is another important human rights issue. Such minorities should be regarded not as elements for friction within a State or between States  but  on the contrary  as an enrichment of the States in which they live  as bridges between nations.To our most sincere regret there are cases - unfortunately  in Europe  too - where policies are put into effect which are designed to stifle the economic  social and  in particular  cultural development of persons belonging to minorities  leaving many of them no other choice than to seek refuge in foreign countries. Austria deplores such developments  which in fact are leading to the destruction of centuries-old cultures. Uprooting minorities  apart from the human suffering it entails  will further diminish our common cultural heritage. I wish to express the sincere hope of the Austrian Government that such policies will be reconsidered by those responsible for them  in the spirit of good-neighbourliness. We believe that the Third Committee ought to address this issue. Related to the issue of human rights is the struggle against drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking. In June of last year a World Conference on the issue was convened in Vienna. The participating States decided upon a comprehensive strategy document and issued a declaration. Work is at present under way on drafting a new convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The convention will be finalized at a conference of plenipotentiaries to be held in Vienna in December. Thus  important signals are being given that the international community considers the fight against drugs a priority area of international co-operation.At the same time  however  we must take care that the United Nations bodies dealing with drug abuse control which have to take on additional responsibilities are adequately staffed. Similar considerations are valid in respect of the crime prevention and social research areas of the Secretariat.We witness a growing awareness of global social dimensions  especially with regard to the interrelationship of economic and social progress. Social policies and social development must be at the heart of our concerns in the years to come. The capacity of the United Nations to respond to the increasingly important challenges of social concerns  the advancement of women  youth-related questions and questions of the elderly or disabled  must be further consolidated and strengthened.A further important topic at each session of the General Assembly is disarmament and arms control  issues which I addressed quite recently in my statement on 2 June this year at the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. I shall therefore  restrict myself to one particularly urgent question: the conclusion of a chemical weapons convention. The co-operation of the chemical industries in all countries and the readiness of all States possessing chemical weapons to destroy their stocks under appropriate international verification and renounce their future production or acquisition  are essential elements in that endeavour. Austria attaches the highest priority to the comprehensive and verifiable elimination of chemical weapons. With a view to contributing to the realisation of that aim  I recall that Austria is ready and would be pleased to be the host to a new mechanism to be established by the chemical weapons convention. Vienna already hosts the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  which has at its disposal highly qualified experts in the field of monitoring and verification. We should take advantage of that.In this context  I wish to refer to the statement I made on 14 April at the Conference on Disarmament. I referred to the need for all States to provide  at the earliest possible date  detailed Information on their actual arsenals  their chemical-weapons production facilities  and all other chemical-industry facilities that might fall under the future chemical weapons convention. The Austrian delegation  in consultation with other delegations  intends to pursue an initiative in that respect.The Conference on Disarmament  in Geneva  has done essential work in drafting such a convention. Austria is actively following those efforts and is co-operating in the work of the Conference. I remind the Assembly that Austria is a candidate for membership of that important body  which  in disarmament matters  acts as the trustee of the international community. Finally  as a signatory to the Geneva Protocol of 1925  my country notes with interest the United States proposal to convene a meeting of all the signatories to that document. The third follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  currently taking place in Vienna  has entered its final phase. By now  there is a realistic chance of consensus. In the coming weeks  among the 35 participating States on a substantial concluding document - consensus based on the important proposals offered by the neutral and non-aligned countries. We hope that this opportunity will be seized. It would reinforce the credibility and dynamism of the Conference by contributing to fuller implementation of past commitments and by providing for a programme of new reforms and areas of co-operation. Concrete new provisions should make possible the removal of more of the barriers between the peoples of East and West. The enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms  and the ability to meet and communicate freely with one another  continue to be vital to the attainment of the Europe we are aiming for.Negotiations on confidence- and security-building measures  as well as on conventional forces  are to be part of the outcome of the Vienna meeting. We are conscious of an increasing awareness of the urgent need to address the existing imbalances in conventional forces in Europe. In this respect a rapid conclusion of the Vienna meeting would also be of great importance.Given its specific geopolitical position and its deeply rooted commitment to democracy and to the observance of human rights  Austria's European policy is guided by two priorities. On the one hand we pursue our traditional policy of good-neighbourliness towards our Eastern European friends  with whom we maintain close and friendly relations. On the other hand  Austria is traditionally deeply involved in the ongoing European integration process. Therefore we are striving for full participation in the emerging unified internal market of the European Communities. Moreover  we do not exclude the option of future membership  while maintaining our status of permanent neutrality.Now I would like to say some words on our relations with Italy. Our bilateral relations also have been deepening continuously during the last year  and their present state can be described as excellent. Following the tradition of past years  I would like  however  to state that the political importance of the South-Tyrol question in Austro-Italian relations remains unchanged. On the basis of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly adopted in I960 and 1961  Austria and Italy agreed  in 1969  on a new arrangement for South Tyrol's autonomy. Whereas  in past years  Austria was compelled to express its concern about the delays in the realization of the so-called ""package"" of 1969  I am now in a position to report important and substantial progress  which brings this long-lasting dispute closer to solution.On 13 May 1988 the Italian Government approved certain measures to implement the package  including the granting of equal status for the use of the German language before court and police authorities  which is of fundamental importance for the protection of the German-speaking minority. Austria assumes that the relevant decree  and two other regulations that still require the approval of the Italian Parliament  will soon come into force.If we succeed in solving the outstanding questions  with a view to completing and safeguarding the autonomy of South Tyrol  we will also further enhance the ability of all ethnic groups to live together in a small but sensitive part of Europe  which has suffered many conflicts throughout its history. The fact that the respective measures are being carried out in accordance with General Assembly resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI) underlines the importance of the United Nations as a peace-generating force.This is a year of hope. We have witnessed a number of major and quite unexpected breakthroughs as regards the resolution of regional conflicts. I have already mentioned them. The United Nations has thus shown the world that it is not altogether unrealistic to hope for peaceful solutions to international conflicts. While there is promising progress in certain areas  the situation in the Middle East has unfortunately not improved since the last session of the General Assembly. On the contrary  the events in the occupied territories in recent months and the deplorable behaviour of the occupying Power have once again focused world attention on the urgent need to achieve a just and lasting settlement. The situation remains volatile. Stability in the region is further threatened by the continuous build-up and increasing sophistication of armaments. In order to decrease mutual fear and suspicion  all States in the area should accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and should submit all their nuclear facilities to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards regime. In the view of my Government  the only way to arrive at a just and lasting solution is by convening an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations  taking into account the necessity of withdrawal from occupied territories and the respect for the right of all States to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries. The recent developments in the area should bring new momentum into the search for peace and allow the Palestinian people  as represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization  finally to play its legitimate role in this endeavour. Forty years after the establishment of the State of Israel provided for in resolution 181 (II)  we might finally witness the Palestinian Arab people create their own State.Ten years after the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  the people of Namibia may well enter a new phase of their history  joining the community of sovereign nations. The independence of Namibia  for which the United Nations has accepted special responsibility  would be a prime achievement.As far as the United Nations Transition Assistance Group is concerned  Austria is prepared to participate with a police contingent and would consider making additional personnel available for other tasks related to the transition of Namibia to independence.In this connection  it is not necessary to reiterate that Austria remains fully committed to the cause of freedom and dignity for the people of southern Africa. Austria strongly rejects and firmly condemns apartheid. We are convinced that only the eradication of apartheid can lead to a peaceful solution.As far as the situation in Kampuchea is concerned  1988 brought some progress in the search for a political solution. The Jakarta informal meeting provided for the first time a framework for informal discussions among the parties directly involved and other concerned countries. There seems to be a sincere willingness on all sides to identify areas of common ground  and agreement to solve the Kampuchean problem through negotiations. Notwithstanding the progress made  there is however still a long way to go. Therefore  the International Conference on Kampuchea  chaired by Leopold Gratz  President of the Austrian Parliament  could be a useful forum for activities designed to assist the parties involved. The situation in Central America has been on our agenda for a number of years. The problems of the area ate still far from any agreed comprehensive solution. We all know that only pluralistic democratic societies closely co-operating in the spirit of good-neighbourliness can successfully address the underlying social and economic problems of the region. The United Nations remains the only comprehensive international forum for co-operation on economic and interrelated matters. The effective potential of international economic co-operation has clearly been demonstrated by the success of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  where a comprehensive and far-reaching political consensus on guiding economic principles has been achieved. Although much of the work of implementing the principles still remains to be done  the common acceptance of these principles in itself constitutes important progress.A tangible expression of economic Interdependence is international trade. A large part of world trade has been liberalized in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The changing realities and the Impressive gain of importance of new trade flows and sectors  however  continue to pose considerable challenges. The ambitious goal of the Uruguay Round of opening up markets in a series of new fields and of effectively combating all forms of protectionism is highly valued by Austria. Protectionism is nothing less than the unjustifiable refusal to make necessary adjustments in current changes in the world economy  such as technical development  structural imbalances of demand and supply and  last but not least  the appearance of new prospects. The raid-term review of the Uruguay-Round will  we hope  enable ministers to spur on negotiations in this spirit.As concerns the continuing debt problem of a large number of countries  Austria commends and further encourages measures such as improved debt rescheduling with official creditors  innovative debt arrangements with private creditors  and national policies vigorously mobilizing national and international resources by enhancing confidence  creditworthiness  market access and new investment. The recommendations of the Toronto summit meeting in favour of the poorest debtor countries constitute an important act of solidarity. Austria will fully support them.The necessary adjustment in a changing world economy aggravated by the debt burden requires adequate financing. The international financial institutions are to be given credit for their pace-making role in this context. The capital increase of the World Bank and the African Development Bank  the establishment of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility and  roost recently  the Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility of the International Monetary Fund  provide the needed financial basis for the most urgent remedies. In addition  they ate of utmost importance as a signal to private capital markets  encouraging them to join the common efforts. Austria attaches great importance to the success of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  1986-1990  which is based on a new and realistic policy consensus. However  as the Secretary-General pointed out in his valuable report for the recent session of the Ad Hoc Committee which undertook a mid-term review of the Programme  the continuing gravity of the economic situation in Africa requires further urgent: measures. The successful outcome of this session should provide an important impetus for the future. Its assessment and recommendations reflect the urgent need as well as the willingness of its participants to undertake further efforts to implement the Programme and to assist African States  many of which have instituted commendable and courageous reform measures.The environment has been a top-ranking issue on our agenda for many years. The rapid deterioration of our environment has created a new sense of responsibility for the environmental consequences of our activities. In the past year the report of the Brundtland Commission has been instrumental in raising the level of global consciousness of the interrelation of environment and development and the imperative need for making the transition towards sustainable development. Austria strongly supports an effective follow-up of this report within the global and regional framework of the United Nations system. We welcome in this context the initiative of the Norwegian Government concerning the holding in 1990  in co-operatic with the Economic Commission for Europe  of a regional conference at the ministerial level to review the process of the ongoing work in this field.Dramatic changes in our environment - such as the depletion of the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect  to mention only two of the most serious environmental problems of global dimension - may seriously threaten mankind's very existence. Concerted action is called for if we want to maintain or restore the ecological balance of our globe. I am pleased to recall at this point Austria's active contribution to the elaboration of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer  which we have ratified  and of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that deplete the Ozone Layer  which we have signed recently. Austria has also hosted several high-ranking scientific meetings under the auspices of the United Nations Environmental Programme  the World Meteorological Organization and the International Council for Scientific Unions on carbon dioxide emissions  which reflects our grave concern about the climatic changes. We hope that the elaboration of a protocol on the control and redaction of nitrogen oxide emissions will take us another important step forward in the implementation of the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution.It is our primary task to perform pragmatic and efficient day-to-day work.This should not  however  preclude our having a vision of the future. We must combine our forces in order jointly to master the challenges of the future. Therefore I should like to end my statement with some appropriate lines by Alfred Lord Tennyson: ""We dip into the future  far as human eyes can see.See the vision of the world and all the wonder that shall be.Hear the war-drum throb no longer  see the battle flags all furled in the parliament of man  the federation of the world."""
"9",442,"BDI",43,1988,"ï»¿In addressing this international gathering  I hove the honour to convey to the Assembly a message of fraternity and best wishes for every success from Major Pierre Buyoya  Chairman of the Military Committee for National Redemption and President of the Republic of Burundi  on the occasion of this forty-third session.I am also pleased to express on behalf of my Government warn and heartfelt congratulations to Nr. Dante Caputo  foreign Minister of Argentina  and the other officers of the Assembly on their election to guide our work and the unanimous expression of confidence it represents.We pay tribute to the President as not only an eminent  skilful diplomat  very familiar with the many difficult concerns of the international community  but a fervent defender of solidarity and co-operation between peoples in a spirit of dignity and sovereign equality. My delegation is determined to give him every assistance so that his noble task may be successfully accomplished. We join previous speakers in expressing our deep gratitude to Mr. Peter Florin  who conducted the Assembly's varied work competently and effectively as President of the forty-second session  with a devotion that redounded to the honour of the United Nations and his country  the German Democratic Republic.We also pay tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General  for his constant  tireless efforts in the service of the international community and for the outstanding successes he has scored - to his own credit and that of our Organization - during the past year. Before stating my country's position on some of the items before this Assembly  I wish briefly to describe the situation that has prevailed in Burundi since the establishment on 3 September 1987 of our Third Republic. I should like first of all to provide some information about the painful events that have ravaged two communes in the north of Burundi and that very nearly destroyed the stability of my country's social fabric.The international community heard of the grin events that shook Burundi in extremely far-fetched versions in that segment of the press that delights in the sensational; in most cases these accounts were in line with the version of the perpetrators of these crimes. I wish therefore to ahead some light on the events so members may have as dear a picture as possible and so the international community nay finally learn of the guilty d is in for nation put before it.It began in the province of Managara in Hgozi province  where the downtrodden populace rose up armed with spears and machetes to defend themselves against a non-existent enemyÂ·  they refused to withdraw  claiming that they were in danger of being killed. For several months the provincial authorities had noted the spread of seditious writings and cassette recordings stirring up racial hatred. These were being constantly distributed by small groups of Burundian refugees who entered the country from abroad. This subversive literature made these peaceable peasants believe in an imminent massacre  and tried to make them take pre-emptive action to forestall the imaginary enemy.It has now been established that these disturbed activists were seeking to sow confusion  evade governmental vigilance and cause a war with ethnic overtones in order to spread desolation throughout the entire country.When the authorities learned of the explosive situation and of these criminal plans  they tried first to understand the reasons behind them and then to calm the population by showing clearly that there was no civil war and that the country was calm. The people quickly realized that they had been manipulated. They re-opened roads they had cut off as a preventive measure  and returned to their homes in peace.All this took place very peacefully. In its spirit of tolerance the Government did not attempt to punish the perpetrators of the disturbance. It was believed that the misfits would see reason because the twisted ideas they were spreading would be quickly discredited through dialogue and persuasion. Unfortunately  just as the Government had begun to congratulate itself on the return to normalcy  violence erupted on 14 August 1988 in the neighbouring commune of Ntega in the adjacent province of Kirundo.This time  learning from their failure due to the peasantsâ refusal to believe lies  the organizers themselves took action and began the massacre. We know what happened then.Heavily drugged and armed with machetes  spears and clubs  they began a real blood-bath  killing men  women  children and old people alike. They put a radical stamp on their crimes by burning houses and crops and slaughtering livestock.Initially  the perpetrators of these horrors selectively attacked members of the Tutsi group and their property. They then executed those of their own ethnic group who refused to join in the massacre.Not satisfied with their crimes in the Ntego commune  the hordes of murderers extended the horror and killing to the neighbouring commune of Marangara. There too the r Î el a overcame the resistance organized spontaneously by the local people of all ethnic groups  and committed more of the same atrocities  destroying all human life in their path and setting fire to houses  coffee and banana plantations and forests. Given this unprecedented violence and the large loss of life  the Government was compelled to send in the army to halt the massacres and protect the people. The armed forces restored order in three days and with the greatest discipline.I take this opportunity to deny accusations made in certain press circles concerning the role of the Burundi army and to reaffirm that as of 20 August 1988 the situation was under control in the two affected communes and peace reigned throughout the rest of Burundi.Despite the army's effectiveness in halting the killing  Burundi cannot but lament the large human and material losses. During this period 5 000 lives were lost and material damage is estimated at 320 million. Few of the wounded survived the massacre  while large numbers of people fled to Rwanda and neighbouring Burundian communes  leaving behind them poverty and desolation in a region that had once been the wealthiest and most active in the country.Those are the grim facts that have plunged Burundi into sorrow.From the outset  the Government has pursued a policy of openness with respect to these facts. It regularly kept informed representatives of countries and international bodies residing at BujunburaÅ£ it invited a delegation from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  foreign diplomats and journalists to visit the troubled areas those who wanted to learn the facts in situ were authorized to do so. The Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was invited to carry out a fact-finding mission in Burundi  and a World Bank mission visited the country. Similarly  the Secretary-General of the United Nations may at any time send a fact-finding mission to Burundi if he thinks it necessary.To deal with the Ncega and Marangars tragedy  there was a great spontaneous urge of national solidarity  which enabled the Government to provide first aid to the victims of the disaster. On behalf of the Government and people of Burundi I should like to take this opportunity to thank the friendly countries and organizations that have so generously given emergency assistance and to reiterate our request to the international community for humanitarian aid.Apart from the material losses and loss of life  the events in Ntega and Marangara have once again threatened to destroy the solid social tissue that had always characterized our society. The existence of ethnic antagonism in Burundi is a recent phenomenon. It has been caused by social and political rivalries between the Hutu and Tutsi elite who divided power after independence in 1962.Subsequently  this antagonism increased further and periodically degenerated into bloody upheavals that were explained by international media often in a very peremptory way  thereby encouraging the demands of extremist groups and making calm dialogue almost impossible.We should point out that of all those who have spoken about these recent events In Burundi not one has condemned the actions of the rebels who have massacred innocent people. Many reports  and even certain official declarations  support the notion that these murderous rebels are seeking powerÂ·  and that. If their demands are heeded  there will be no further violence in Burundi. However justified their demands  nothing can legitimise the deaths of innocent people. To succumb to blackmail  the blackmail of terrorists  would be to compromise for ever our search for peaceful solutions.We note that awareness of ethnic origin  which is ages old in Burundi  is not a source of conflict that our oral pre'-colonial traditions were aware of. Under the political regime before colonization  the royal families that ruled used the two main tribes  the Hutus and the Tutsis  in guiding the affairs of state. The colonial regime  in its search for greater effectiveness of the indirect administration system  chose to deepen ethnic rifts by assigning to each tribe specific hierarchical roles. The system of modernizing the political regime eliminated the Hutus from the administration of the country.Mr. Jean Paul Harroy  the former Governor-General of Rwanda-Burundi in his book ""Burundi""  statedÂ·.""We should not simplify judgments  speaking of the dominant Tutsis  the oppressor Tutsis and the dominated oppressed Hutus. In agricultural Burundi  which is a land-locked   over-populated country  we saw two main groups facing each other  each made up of both Tutsis and Hutus  led by dynamic Baganwas. Further on  the author  speaking oÂ£ the colonial administration  saidÂ·. ""The political programme that advocated strengthening the authority of Mwarai and the chiefs unfortunately eliminated many Hutu chiefs by eliminating the small fiefdoms ""From 1957-1958  when the movement for independence was gathering strength in Africa and  in particular  in Burundi  the colonial agents did an about-face and sought an alliance with the Hutu elements in order to thwart national  the nationalism of the young cadres of whom the majority were Tutsis  They financed and created many parties  based for the most part on tribal ideology  whose objective was to oppose the Uprona party  which was alone calling for immediate independence. These living in Burundi at that time will recall the many tracts dropped from 'planes provided by colonial agents that  inter alia  carried such slogans as ""Bwengebuka na Bugor ihenda"" which means literally  the stupid and the clever people. The two adjectives were applied  respectively  to the Hutus and the Tutsis. The Tutsis were called ""Nilo-Hamitic"" and ""lords""  whereas the Hutus were called ""Bantu Negroes"" and ""serfs"" and a whole pseudo-scientific literature was developed on the basis of their respective height.That ideology  assisted by the goal of replacing the colonial agents in power  finally won over extremist elements from the Burundi elite who readied the point where they believed that they belonged to another race and that they should accede to power by exterminating the other ethnic group.That is the ideology being spread by the detractors of national unity - particularly the activists who have taken refuge abroad and who still refuse to return to the country to participate in its construction  despite the appeals  and guarantees of security and jobs offered them by the Third Republic.The evidence is very clear that these same terrorists organized the Ntega and Marangaras events. At some time they infiltrated Burundi  particularly the border communes  to preach hatred and genocide by means of tracts  cassettes and secret meetings.The motives of these misfits of Burundi society are clear. Their concern is to thwart the policy of national unity  social justice  democracy and progress being established by the authorities of the Third Republic under the guidance of His Excellency  Major Pierre Suyoya  Chairman of the Military Committee for National Salvation and President of the Republic. This policy  whose main points I now outline  was intended to deprive the terrorists once and for all of an audience within the country and to stop the flow of funds generously provided  ostensibly to serve a good cause  that of the ""oppressed majority"" freeing itself of the ""minority of oppressors""  or ""lords"". Anyone who is familiar with the real situation in Burundi can attest that our country is free of this social stratification.In internal policies  the government of the Third Republic has  since 3 September 1987  been pursuing a policy of harmonization and dialogue on all problems facing cur country. In this context the question of national unity is being thoroughly debated in party Meetings and during visits that the authorities of the Third Republic  headed by the President  have regularly paid to the provinces  the communes and the hilly areas.Many national cadres have been appointed to responsible posts in the administration of the party without any distinction as to ethnic origin. In order to strengthen this national unity  the Military Committee for National Salvation has just established a commission which has been asked to make a thorough study of ways and means to strengthen national unity. It consists of people chosen for their patriotism and integrity  representing all sectors of national life in Burundi.Political prisoners were released upon the establishment of the Third Republic and the Church-State conflict has been satisfactorily resolved. Thus  freedom of religion has been restored  religious leaders expelled under the Second Republic have been allowed to return to Burundi and seminaries and property requisitioned have been restored to the Church.The National Party for Unity and Progress which for a long time now has been the crucible of national unity  has been restructured to serve as an ideal framework for the practice of democracy in Burundi. General elections  with universal suffrage and secrecy  have been successfully organized to establish the basic organs of the party  and .this democratic process will apply at the highest levels of the party and the administration.In foreign policy  the Government of the Third Republic  faithful to its principles of good-neighbourliness  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  international co-operation  non-alignment and support for national liberation movements  has been conducting a policy of clear-sightedness  trust and ongoing dialogue. The authorities of the Third Republic were quick to normalize relationships with ail neighbouring countries  and enjoy relations of friendship and co-operation  free from suspicion and any other psychological barrier  with other countries and friendly organizations.With regard to economic and social matters  the Third Republic has given priority to developing the rural sector  where 90 per cent of our people live. Accordingly  the sixth five-year plan for social and economic development gives priority to the Ministers of Agriculture and Rural Development. Efforts are under way to develop social infrastructures  such as schools  health centres and drinking water facilities.Since the advent of the Third Republic  the approach taken by our President and our Government has been consistent; first  to recognize the problems  then to put them forward for discussion  and finally to carry out the solutions proposed and encourage the commitment of everyone to their success. The problems of Burundi must elicit responses by Burundi. In officially opening the work of the national commission to study the question of national unity  the President of the Republic said: ""If there is one way that foreigners can help to resolve Burundi's problems it is by becoming thoroughly familiar with themÂ·  by questioning the people and the facts  observing the phenomena and studying the history. That is the effort that is necessary from all who wish to judge the situation with respect for the truth.""Speaking of the recent tragedy  he went on to say; ""We are capable of fighting  we are capable of transforming our past weaknesses into assets in ensuring solidarity and fraternity  where before there were suspicion and hatred.""We welcome the wise advice of friends  but we deny anyone the right to settle Burundi's affairs except those mainly concerned - that is  the people of Burundi. We do not believe in the effectiveness of solutions imposed from outside  whatever the size of the group of countries and the organizations from which they emanate. It should be clear to all that advocate sanctions or pressure of any kind against the Government of Burundi that their initiatives go against the policy of national reconciliation advocated by our President  Major Pierre Bayoya  and his Government. Such sanctions  if applied  would hit the people of Burundi indiscriminately and seriously compromise peace not only in Burundi but in all the other Great Lakes countries.Despite this troubled short-term situation in my country  Burundi is very alive to and concerned by the many problems that threaten international peace and security. Fear of a nuclear catastrophe  the ravages caused by armed conflict throughout the world  colonial oppression  racial segregation and the deplorable world economic situation  are problems of vital concern that disrupt cur world.The Republic of Burundi follows with keen attention all the efforts made by the international community to preserve peace and security among peoples. In particular  we welcome the increasing tendency of the two super-Powers to place the question of the prevention of a nuclear holocaust at the forefront of their concerns. We greatly appreciate their determination in the last few years to engage in constructive dialogue  which led recently to the ratification in Moscow of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty. This was a political result of vital importance  since it could contribute to giving a fresh impetus to the process of disarmament and co-operation in matters of international security.However  unless all the nations of the world  collectively and individually  are committed to the success of the great and noble task of disarmament in all its dimensions  we shall still tend to doubt the effectiveness and the value of initiatives taken to prevent the frenzied arms race  which could threaten mankind  whether through cynicism  mistake or tragic accident  according to chance.We believe that the highly desirable multilateral process of disarmament offers a number of advantages. Generally speaking  it would certainly allow us to examine objectively the various aspects of the problem. At the same time  it would help us to change the views on disarmament of States that possess nuclear arsenals  as well as the position of this question on the scale of priorities of those States.In this context  we welcomed the convening of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament last June. To its credit  that session  among other things  reaffirmed that international peace and security cannot depend on the relations between only two States  however powerful  but are the concern of all Member States of the United Nations.At the regional level  we appreciate the combined efforts to put an end to armed conflicts that have afflicted many third world countries for many years. Burundi welcomed the signing in Geneva on 14 April 1988 of the Geneva Accords relating to Afghanistan. We pay a tribute to Hr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General for his patient and fruitful efforts in seeking a peaceful solution to the critical situation in that country. This was  of course  made possible thanks to the flexibility shown by the main parties to the conflict.We express profound feelings of solidarity with all front-line States that have spared no effort  at the price of great sacrifices  to provide all necessary support for a people oppressed  exploited and dispossessed by the racist apartheid regime of South Africa.  Still on the subject of southern Africa  we are particularly interested in the negotiations that have been started between Angola  the United States  Cuba and South Africa. These quadripartite negotiations between Angolans  Americans  Cubans and South Africans could lead to a process to establish peace in that part of Africa.For Burundi  the independence of Namibia cannot be subordinated to any condition that runs counter to the aspirations of the peoples concerned for self-determination  as expressed by the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole  authentic representative of the Namibian people. That is why we once again call upon Pretoria's allies to recognize the imperative need to implement without further delay Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  regarding Namibia's accession to independence. It is out of the same sympathy and solidarity with all genuine liberation movements that our delegation expresses the firm hope that the Sahraoui people will in the near future exercise its inalienable right to self-determination. Burundi also warmly welcomes the commitment undertaken by the Islamic Republic of Iran last July officially to accept Security Council resolution 598 (1987) which constitutes a peace plan for the two States that have for years been engaged in the Gulf war. We are happy to see the opening of direct negotiations between Iran and Iraq to put an end to the hostilities between those two fraternal peoples.With regard to South-East Asia  we support all the partiesâ  efforts now being made to bring about a normalization of the situation in Kampuchea in keeping with the profound aspirations of the people concerned. Furthermore  we welcome the common political determination manifested by the leaders of the north and south of Korea to reach peacefully negotiated solutions  which should inevitably lead to the reunification of the Korean nation.On the subject of the Middle East  we are firmly convinced that the conflict in that region can come about only within the context established by Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  so that the Palestinian people can enjoy their right to a homeland.	.Turning to Latin America  we hope that the peoples of that region will finally come to the necessary agreement to establish stability and peace there  in keeping with the political will expressed by the Guatemala Agreement signed by the five Presidents of Central America in August 1987.Many previous speakers have emphasized the dangers of the present economic situation. Since the 1970s  third world countries have constantly been forced to have recourse to foreign loans to meet their increasing budget deficits. It is apparent that loans entered into in international markets and granted by various financial institutions hove placed the recipient countries in a situation of dependence  at first imperceptible and then very marked. The most disturbing aspect of this dependence lies in long-term obligations that are very costly in terms of political economic control.We are fully aware that proposals and initiatives have been put forward to overcome the serious debt problems that paralyse many third world countries. But they all seem very limited to us  including the structural adjustment programmes  the United Nations Programme of Action for Africa  North-South Co-operation and the regional economic integration policies.That is why my delegation once again makes an urgent appeal to the United Nations to consider in depth the question of establishing a new international economic order.	.We sincerely hope that international economic transactions can be carried out in a way that can generate investment capital for the developing countries. That would enable them to train the needed competent manpower and to produce the technology and capital goods these countries need to deal with the extreme poverty of their peoples.Another problem  that of the environment  has been added to the matters preoccupying the international community. I refer to the export of toxic waste to third-world areas in general and to sub-Saharan Africa in particular. Western corporations are proposing that countries of the region receive millions of tons of toxic waste for a pathetic amount of money.The mortal danger to human and animal life and to vegetation involved in such speculations is very clear  as are the unfortunate long-term consequences for future generations in the countries concerned. We urgently draw this matter to the attention of all the specialized agencies of the United Nations  in particular the United Nations educational. Scientific and Cultural Organization  the World Health Organization  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  the United Nations Environment Programme  the World Meteorological Organisation and the International Labour Organisation  which must continue to pi s y their noble . roles in sensitising world public opinion on environmental issues and finding  urgently and concertedly  verifiable measures with regard to the international regulation of the serious problem of exporting industrial waste. Success in meeting this challenge of course requires the unanimous commitment of all nations of the world collectively and individually to fight pollution  we hope that in the cases of other scourges also  such as war  terrorism  hunger  disease  poverty and ignorance  there will be a collective will to promote the building of a world of peace  justice and security."
"10",489,"BEL",43,1988,"ï»¿I wish first to offer you  Sir  the most sincere congratulations of Belgium on your election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I view your election as an international tribute to you personally and  through you  to your country  Argentina  which has resolutely chosen democracy and is in the process of consolidating it. I have the utmost confidence in your ability and your experience  which will enable you  with the constructive collaboration of all delegations  to direct our work to a successful conclusion. My delegation will contribute fully to that end.I take this opportunity to thank your predecessor  Mr. Florin  for guiding with exemplary efficiency the work of the forty-second session of the General Assembly  which was particularly intensive.This year more than ever I wish to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General  to his tireless dedication and to his personal commitment to the common ideal of the constant search for world peace based on human dignity. On numerous occasions  and most recently during our last meeting in Brussels  I have been able to see for myself how deserving of our respect and  above all  our total support in his action.I associate myself fully with the conclusions of his annual report  a document as complete as it is remarkable  in which he invites Governments to adapt themselves better to a changing international situation  thus allowing us to use our Organization with more determination and to better effect. I endorse this concept all the more heartily in that his ideas have served as the guiding principles for the views I have expressed from this rostrum in recent years. I am convinced that better defined international solidarity would make possible the broadening of the sphere of multilateral activities of the United Nations at a time when the universal and interdependent nature of many of the problems and challenges facing the international community is becoming increasingly evident.My Greek colleague  Mr. Papoulias  speaking as President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community  yesterday presented the views of the 12 member States on the whole range of international Questions. His speech testified to the will of the European countries to speak with a single voice on the international scene. As far as Belgium is concerned  it is convinced that increased recourse to the multilateral settlement of problems will contribute to strengthening the authority  prestige and irreplaceable role of the United Nations.As a founding Member of the Organization and a signatory of the San Francisco Charter  my country cannot fail to welcome the recent tangible signs that the Organization is again prepared to live up to its vocation. Indeed  conflicts that threaten the security of entire continents are now on the way to being resolved by peaceful means  whether through direct intervention by the United Nations or through efforts being made under its auspices.This renewed vitality can only be sustained with the active individual and collective co-operation of all Members and  primarily  that of the countries with the greatest influence in international affairs. It is not enough to proclaim loudly and clearly the value of the principles of the Charter. The important thing is that it be faithfully and fully implemented by all  without exception. As certain recent breakthroughs have shown  only the political will of Members - and  in particular  that of the super-Powers - will make it possible for the United Nations to act effectively where such action is needed. The converse is also true. Any strengthening of the United Nations is beneficial to each member of the international community. Such interaction is therefore beneficial to all  but it can be set in motion only through the demonstration of goodwill by all.Strengthening the Organization's capacity for action means enabling it to achieve such essential objectives as the consolidation of international peace and security  economic and social development and the promotion of human rights  and meeting the real challenges of time - helping to resolve the crisis created by the indebtedness of the developing countries  assisting the most disadvantaged peoples and fighting all forms of poverty  illiteracy  hunger  oppression and intolerance  as well as all violations of fundamental human rights.In his 1983 report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General stated that the tendency towards the erosion of multilateralism and internationalism had to be halted and reversed  and he took that opportunity to examine various approaches that might make the Organization more effective as a political institution. He concluded that the first step towards strengthening the United Nations should consist in the sincere renewal of the commitments of all Governments to the principles of the Charter.The fortieth anniversary of the United Nations provided an opportunity for all of us to renew our pledge of faith in the Organization. It also provided an occasion to engage in a sincere examination of conscience and to embark upon a process of United Nations reform to make it more effective and more responsive to the hopes all the peoples of the world have placed in it. Those efforts are now beginning to bear fruit.Positive developments have also been brought about through the willingness of the Security Council to act unanimously through consensus in a certain number of conflicts. The personal efforts of the Secretary-General thus took on broader scope. To that we should add the valuable contribution the peace-keeping operations have made and will make in the future. All of this increases the real impact of the United Nations  in particular on public opinion  whose support is indispensable  and especially on young people  in whom our hopes for a better future are placed. I would also note that at the very moment when the effective intervention of the United Nations is becoming so evident our Organization is  paradoxically  suffering from a financial crisis that could well prevent it from meeting its most essential responsibilities. I therefore welcome the intention of the United States to find a solution to its contribution problem  and I trust that all Member States will fully live up to their financial commitments. It is essential that the reforms adopted two years ago by the General Assembly he promptly implemented so that the Organization can act under the best possible conditions and be in a position to justify the trust vested in it.The international atmosphere to which I have referred has been profoundly affected by the improvement in East-West relations. Belgium welcomes this trend  to which it has actively contributed. For their part  the European Twelve are playing a growing role in the positive evolution of East-West relations. In this connection I would mention the start that has been made on achieving closer relations between the European members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON)  on the one hand  and the European Community  on the other. Belgium hopes that that progress will continue  with beneficial consequences for the economic and social well-being of mankind.The signing of the Soviet-American Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles has been hailed  and rightly so  as an event of prime importance. It is a disarmament agreement in the true sense of the term  one that eliminates - and this is the first time it has been done - an entire category of nuclear weapons  accompanied by on-site verification measures that provide adequate guarantees of compliance to both parties.We do not want it to end there. In a context in which no aspect of East-West relations is being neglected and in which improvements are being sought in all spheres  disarmament efforts are being intensively pursued in various fields. Belgium keenly hopes that the agreement on the 50 per cent reduction in the nuclear arsenals of the Soviet Union and the United States will soon be implemented.Belgium values the continuation of bilateral negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States on nuclear testing. The progressive and pragmatic approach that has been adopted  as propounded by Belgium  opens up real opportunities for achieving the desired results. We support actions that bring us closer to the objective of a comprehensive and verifiable ban on all nuclear testing  on the bilateral level and also on the international level at the Conference on Disarmament.For several years chemical disarmament has been the object of intensive multilateral effort at the Conference on Disarmament. We remain confident of the possibility of reaching an agreement in the foreseeable future  notwithstanding the difficulties - which we do not underestimate - that lie ahead. Fortunately  the participants in those negotiations continue to manifest a desire to complete those negotiations successfully. To be successful  the agreement will have to have universal application. In this connection I should like to share my country's deep concern over the repeated violations of the 1925 Geneva Protocol that have occurred in recent years  and in the last few weeks. Those are dangerous precedents and we would very much hope that the indignation and keen emotion such odious acts have aroused will prevent their repetition. Belgium is also deeply concerned at the erosion of respect for a ban to which it attaches great value. We cannot forget that  historically  Belgium was the first victim of chemical weapons.	.Refusal to consider that barbaric weapon a legitimate means for gaining military advantage is clearly the sine qua non of any success in attaining complete chemical disarmament  which is now being pursued at the Conference on Disarmament.Like many other States  Belgium unequivocally condemned the use of chemical weapons when such use was confirmed by the fact-finding missions of the Secretary-General. Prompted by humanitarian considerations  my country has expressed its concern about the most recent allegations of the use of such weapons. We regret that the experts designated by the United Nations Secretary-General were unable to investigate that matter thoroughly. In that connection  I think it essential that the international community have a clear idea of potential risks inherent in recent events and that each State consider ways to prepare for them and to forestall dangerous developments before it is too late. To be sure  this involves respect for the law  but it also involves political will. We must redouble our efforts to achieve a consistent and effectively verifiable treaty totally banning chemical weapons and the production  stockpiling and use of those weapons  yet at the same time we must not relax our vigilance concerning respect for existing laws. I think President Reagan's initiative may be viewed in that perspective.Belgium hopes that negotiations on conventional forces in Europe will begin soon. Their goal must be to reach the greatest possible stability at the lowest possible level of forces.Especially in Europe  the disarmament effort is part of a wider process covering all aspects of the diplomatic and human relations among the various parties on a continent that has experienced and continues to experience profound divisions which we are striving gradually to reduce. That approach began with the Helsinki Final Act and is continuing in the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe now under way at Vienna.Belgium expects that Conference to yield significant progress in human rights  where important commitments have been made in the past. We have seen encouraging signs of greater attention being given to these problems and of a greater willingness to make progress in this area. We hope that all participants will contribute more fully to this process. Belgium also expects that the Conference will set a timetable for the future in order to sustain the vitality of the process of improving East-West relations. In that context of detente  the tragedy of Afghanistan  which has caused such human suffering and material damage  appears to be on the way to a solution  with the help of the United Nations. Having contributed to the negotiation of the Geneva Accords  the United Nations is participating in their implementation. For its part  Belgium will closely follow the development of the situation  in particular the continued withdrawal of occupation forces and the Afghan people's exercise of self-determination. On that basis it will determine its position in the General Assembly debate on this issue.The persistent personal efforts of the Secretary-General have led to acceptance by Iran and by Iraq of full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  which had been unanimously adopted by the Council with a view to ending a long and bloody war between those two countries. Belgium particularly welcomes the cease-fire that began on 20 August and the beginning of peace negotiations under United Nations auspices. I hope that an honourable  lasting settlement will soon restore peace in the Gulf region.Other regional conflicts continue to plague Asia and the Middle East. They are a source of constant concern  and we express our hope that a peaceful settlement can be reached as quickly as possible.In Asia  this would involve true independence for a democratic  neutral and non-aligned Cambodia. Belgium is especially aware of this issue since it is Vice-Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee of the International Conference on Kampuchea.Still with respect to Asia  Belgium reaffirms its support for simultaneous admission to the United Nations of the two Koreas and hopes that direct negotiations between the two parties will lead to their reunification. In the Middle East  we hope that international dÃ©tente will help end the Israeli-Arab conflict and settle the Palestinian question. I personally tried to reconcile the points of view of the various parties concerned when I served as President of the Council of the European Community during the first half of 1987. Since then  the uprising of the Palestinian population in the occupied territories has shown that the status quo is not viable and that only a negotiated solution to the conflict can bring about a just  comprehensive and lasting settlement. This situation is  sadly  a perfect illustration of what I said a moment ago: that only political will on the part of the parties directly concerned and on the part of the great Powers can enable the United Nations to play the role we all say it should play. Unfortunately  that is not yet the case in the Israeli-Arab conflict  although there are certain signs that the beginnings of wisdom could lead to the trail blazed in other regions.With respect to the situation in Central America  it is important that the hopes raised by the Esquipulas II agreement will not fade  and that new impetus will be given to the peace process in the region. The area's problems show how democratization  peace and economic development go hand in hand and how they influence each other.Cyprus and Western Sahara  where the Secretary-General's role has also been established  are two other issues of interest. With regard to Cyprus  we noted with satisfaction the Geneva meeting between representatives of the island's two communities  under United Nations auspices. In the case of Western Sahara  Belgium welcomes the parties' acceptance of the Secretary-General's proposals concerning a referendum.Turning to sub-Saharan Africa  I wish first of all to recall what my colleague from Greece said when he stressed the Twelve's rejection of apartheid and when he spoke of the pressure being brought to bear upon the South African Government. We are following with keen interest the efforts to bring peace to Angola and grant independence to Namibia. The fact that the parties concerned have agreed to hold talks is another positive element that should be emphasised and encouraged. For the first time in years there is finally hope for a peaceful settlement and wisdom is prevailing among those who only recently seemed adamant.Indeed  we are encouraged by the progress of negotiations among South Africa  Angola and Cuba  with the mediation of the United States and the accord of the Soviet Union. The various agreements the parties have reached thus far and the prospect of finalizing the agreement on the withdrawal of foreign troops enable us to hope that 1988 will be a decisive  if belated  turning-point in the process of Namibia's accession to independence. Clearly  Belgium  as a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  takes a prime interest in the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  by which 10 years ago the Security Council adopted a plan for the independence of Namibia on the basis of -general elections under United Nations supervision.This progress  however  does not make me forget that the resolution of Angola's internal problems too is vital to ensuring stability and peaceful coexistence in the region.Africa holds a special place in the heart of Belgians. Our affinity results from history and from the relations of co-operation maintained in the past and in the present by many of my countrymen throughout that vast continent.Belgium believes that Africa cannot be an arena for rivalries and conflicting interests imported from outside. Its policy is to advocate and respect non-interference in the affairs of African States and to support the emergence of an African Africa  totally free and stable; an Africa able to find its own answers to its own problems and whose States will enjoy sufficient domestic and continental stability to be able to prevent  and peacefully settle  their conflicts and concentrate fully on reaching their economic and social development goals. I particularly hope that this will apply to Burundi  that friend of Belgium that recently has had to cope with such turmoil. The expectations resulting from the efforts of the Burundi Government should not be lost in vain antagonisms. Belgium  for its part  hopes to propose more thorough attempts at broad-based consultations among the principal countries co-operating with Burundi  in order to determine the conditions in which they can help it resolve the fundamental problems that give rise to such tensions and tragedies.Today  we are all aware of the critical problems facing Africa with cumulative and dramatic effect; demographic growth outpaces the growth of food production  and the decline in commodity prices damages export earnings and brings a heavy burden of debt. These fundamental problems bring others  often tragic from the human point of view; widespread malnutrition  high infant mortality  rural exodus  deforestation  desertification. We cannot remain indifferent to the distress of millions of Africans suffering their plight with dignity and courage.Speaking at the special session of the General Assembly on the economic situation in Africa in May 1986  I pointed out that it was not just emergency measures that were needed  but that we had to tackle the very roots of this problem. We have now defined a set of priority measures to promote the rehabilitation and development of Africa.Now that the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the General Assembly has completed its mid-term review and appraisal of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development  it is the proper time for decisive action.Belgium is prepared to make its contribution to the recovery of the African countries in a coherent way and in co-operation with the other bilateral and multilateral donors. As time is pressing  such action must be taken without delay. In this regard  Belgium expresses satisfaction over the new momentum created by the decisions of the Toronto Summit for the search for a solution to the problem of the excessive external debt experienced by the least developed countries  among which there are so many sub-Saharan African nations. Together with the industrialized countries  in the competent forums the Belgian Government is examining technical measures in this regard  for it is our conviction that a stable and permanent framework for security and prosperity cannot be guaranteed as long as this problem lacks an adequate solution.At the same time  however  Belgium maintains the strong conviction that the indebted countries need to pursue the closest possible co-operation with the international financial institutions  whose essential role in the process of the elaboration of economic adjustment strategies cannot be questioned.In Ð° few months we will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the solemn adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.That very influential instrument has more than symbolic value. Today it constitutes the basis of a complex and impressive set of rules designed to sustain the rights of the human person all over the world.This celebration gives us the opportunity for reflection and evaluation. Six years ago  in this very Assembly  I appealed for the establishment of a system to ' monitor human rights based on both universal and regional mechanisms  associating the cultural diversities and differences between peoples.I would note that in 1982  on the eve of the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration  on the initiative of my country  the General Assembly adopted a resolution urging Member States to engage in closer regional co-operation. Simultaneously  an exchange of information was set up between existing regional systems and our Organization in order to evaluate their mutual experience. I am pleased to note that since then regional mechanisms for the protection of human rights have been set up and are doing their job well  while others  with the same impetus  are fully expanding both with regard to the establishment of norms and the monitoring of compliance with those norms.In view of those results  the Belgian delegation will continue to do its utmost to encourage this trend.In one way or another  all the major problems of today derive from disregard for human dignity. That is why it is necessary to find ways to resolve them through a multilateral approach.In conclusion  let me revert to my opening theme by calling for greater political will from each of us to enable the United Nations even better to fulfil the expectations we have always had of it."
"11",534,"BEN",43,1988,"ï»¿The delegation of the People's Republic of Benin welcomes with great satisfaction the election of Mr. Dante Caputo to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. We ask him to convey friendly and brotherly greetings to Argentina from the Government and people of Benin r which is happy to see the representative of a country with which it shares the sane aspirations to peace and social justice preside over the General Assembly of our irreplaceable world Organization. I should like to take this opportunity to convey the heartfelt congratulations of our delegation to Mr. Peter Florin  the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic  who  throughout the work of the forty-second session of the General Assembly  showed such competence wisdom and statesmanship.Our congratulations also go to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General of the United Nations. I should like once again  on this solemn occasion  to say how much the people and the National Executive Council of Benin admire him for the dynamism  patience  tenacity and competence  with which he has served the United Nations  and in particular for the professionalism - each day more decisive - that he has shown in finding solutions to the various crises that our world has been witnessing. On behalf of Benin  we wish to extend to him our full support in the discharge of his onerous and delicate responsibilities.The award this year of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations Peace-keeping Forces is a well-deserved tribute to the work of the Organization and the Secretary-General. This great honour conferred upon our Organization has created a new climate of optimism and confidence in the search for ways and means that might lead to peace.The forty-third session of the General Assembly has opened in an atmosphere of dÃ©tente and hope  indicating that international peace and security  which our Organization has been striving to attain  should be understood as a pre-condition for promoting development in all fields and for ensuring the right of peoples to life  freedom and dignity.When they adopted the principles set forth in the United Nations Charter in San Francisco  in 1945  or when they acceded to them later the States represented here showed their determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  to promote social progress and better standards of life in fuller freedom. We thus proclaimed our faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity of the human person  in the equal .rights of men and women and of nations large or small.Three years ago we commemorated here  and in our country  the fortieth anniversary of the signing of the Charter in a political climate that was marked by many areas of tension and by the mad rivalry between the nuclear Powers.This year we are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in an environment marked by glimmers of hope  thanks to the determination of the two nuclear super-Powers to reduce and gradually eliminate nuclear weapons  which are a real threat to international peace and security. It is therefore ray honour and pleasure to state before the Assembly that may government is preparing to implement  within the context of the celebration of this fortieth anniversary  a diversified programme of events  ranging from a national seminar on human rights  which will follow :p the international seminar on human rights and economic and social progress hosted by my country in May-June of 1988  to a number of cultural and sporting  events in all parts of our country  information meetings about this Declaration  and its publication in French and in most of the national languages of our country.By signing the agreements to dismantle nuclear weapons  both medium-range and shorter-range  the USSR and the United states of America established a basis for a real nuclear disarmament process and detente. On behalf of my country  I salute the initiatives taken by the President of the United States of America and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  and I wish the leaders of those two countries ever greater success in following up their negotiations with a view to the gradual reduction of strategic weapons until they are completely eliminated. The peoples of the whole world want peace. They want all other nuclear Powers to follow the example of the United States and the Soviet Union  to stave off  once and for all  the risk of a nuclear war  which would be the last one.Consensus with regard to the means of achieving nuclear disarmament seems to be emerging. Out the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament showed what a long way we have yet to go to establish the basis of general and complete disarmament. We must therefore reverse intransigence  national selfishness  differences and ideological barriers  in order to promote the primacy of the United Nations in disarmament.We must recognise that there is a logical link between disarmament and development  almost a mathematical ratio between them  as the special session of our Organisation  held from 24 April to 11 September 198?  established so eloquently.So we have grounds for hope. Remarkable progress has been made in settling various regional conflicts  all of which are deadly and run counter to our aspirations for peace and progress. There is no doubt that the path leading to peace is long and difficult  but there is no alternative to peace except peace itself  Accordingly  it is good that  instead of confrontation the enemies of yesterday have today chosen the way of dialogue and negotiation  like in the Persian Gulf  the Middle East  Western Sahara  southern Africa  Central America  Afghanistan or Kampuchea.Zn Africa the apartheid system of the Pretoria regime  which our universal conscience condemns vociferously and which no country or Government could justify or legitimise  is at the very core of the tragedy suffered by the blade peoples of Southern AfricaÂ· The racist regime continues  despite common sense and reason to divide the international community in its quest for peace  security and social progress. The policy of apartheid of the South African regime is still very much a crime against humanity and an affront to the universal conscience. The assassination of September  in Paris on 29 March 1988  shows that the leaders of that country will stop at nothing even at the most heinous crimes.Pretoria is being obstinate  despite the protests of the whole world  in insisting on keeping Nelson Mandela in its gaols  thus seriously damaging his health. It continues to impose a state of emergency on black South Africans in order to further suppress their legitimate aspirations to dignity and well-being.In its solidarity and unswerving support for the struggle of the African National Congress all other democratic anti-apartheid forces  my country appeals to the reason and common sense of all States Members of the United Nations to see to it that at this forty-third session the General Assembly will once again demand the imposition of comprehensive  mandatory sanctions against the racist regime of South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter.It is our collective responsibility - and one we must shoulder - to work to restore all the inalienable rights of the South African people and the independence of Namibia  and to guarantee to the front-line countries the enjoyment of security  stability and territorial integrity. The front-line countries  the South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the ANC  and all other democratic forces defending their inalienable rights in southern Africa can be assured of the solidarity and support of the entire people of Benin until their cause triumphs - the cause of justice and freedom for which they have been shedding their blood.We hope that the dialogue that is now going on and that is developing in the negotiations between Angola  South Africa  Cuba and the United States  will result in a just peace in that part of Africa which has been ravaged by so many years of armed conflicts. In the Western Sahara  the People's Republic of Benin is pleased that the two parties to the conflict r Morocco and the POLIS ARIO Front  have finally chosen the path of dialogue in accepting the peace plan of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Secretary-General of the United Nations  relating to conditions for the organization of a referendum on self-determination for the Sahraoui people. However  on this question  as on so many others  the international community must remain vigilant in order to avoid bitter disappointment.We are pleased that relations between Chad and Libya have been improving. The return to peace between these two fraternal countries will enable the Chadian people to start the work of national reconstruction and economic recovery for the greater well-being of all Chadians.Like other peoples  the Palestinian people is entitled to an independent homeland. Hence a stop must be put to its suffering by way of the restoration of all its national rights in a Middle East that is reconciled and at peace.The Palestinian question is one to which my country hopes the General Assembly will attach special importance this year  especially since we shall be celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Hence Benin looks forward to the convening as soon as possible of the international conference on the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations  and with the participation of all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (Ð LO)  on an equal footing.In the Persian Gulf  reason and dialogue have finally replaced the language of violence in a war that foe eight years has ravaged that part of the third would.  We welcome the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and hope that the Secretary-General's tireless efforts will be successful  so that the people of that region can finally enjoy peace. In Afghanistan  we hope that the normalization process will continue on course  thanks to the full implementation of the Geneva Accords by all parties concerned. This will permit the reconciliation of all the country's people  foe it is high time to end the suffering and the dispersal of men  women and children in refugee camps.The trend in international relations is towards dialogue and the peaceful settlement of disputes  and the talks that have been started by the political forces in Kampuchea must also lead to the establishment of a democratic  political and administrative system in keeping with the interests of a free Kampuchean people on a territory free from any hint of a return to the notorious past  as well as the return of any foreign troops.The withdrawal of foreign troops from the Korean peninsula is a guarantee for the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas. The international community should work to ensure that this divided people can recover its unity and greatness.In Central America  the peoples and the States of that region have the right to live in peace  harmony and mutual respect  free from interference or foreign intervention  and  above all  with each respecting the political  economic and social choices of the others. In this context  the hopes raised by the Arias plan and the Esquipulas agreements should be supported  as well as the efforts of the Contadora Group to establish lasting peace in the region.In contrast to the relief brought about by the positive developments we have seen in various war-torn parts of the world  the rather grim picture of the international economic situation is  to say the least  distressing. Indeed  the international economic climate is now characterized - particularly with regard to the developing countries and mere specifically  the African countries - by increasing protectionism by the industrialized countries  a sharp drop in commodity prices  and the inverse transfer of financial flows. The combined cumulative effects of these trends have seriously affected development prospects for our countries and have made any efforts at economic recovery highly unpredictable.Wars and prolonged tension have disorganized the economic and social life of many countries to such an extent that no security can be guaranteed for any length of time. In many regions of Africa and elsewhere food production has fallen below survival needs  thus bringing about a situation of permanent hunger and  in some cases  famine of catastrophic proportions in the warring countries.Natural disasters of incalculable consequences have often added to these scourges. Following the recent torrential rains experienced in the People's Republic of Benin  entire regions were flooded  causing considerable material damage and seriously disrupting the lives of many people. Out of the six provinces in Benin  four were particularly badly hit and declared emergency areas by the Government. Given the magnitude of the disaster  the major national effort we have made - despite my country  difficult economic situation - will not be enough to put an end to the tragedy of the people concerned. Therefore  the Government of the Peopleâs Republic of Benin made an urgent appeal for international solidarity in providing emergency assistance to the affected peoples and towns.On behalf of my country I should like to seize this opportunity to thank all friendly countries and governmental and nongovernmental organizations which  in a burst of solidarity  have started to provide valuable assistance to the victims of this disaster.In the circumstances to which 1 hove just referred  the determination of the developing countries to implement meaningful and economic social reforms is coming up against exogenous constraints connected with the hostile international and economic climate. In order to deal with this situation  a large number of countries have established special recovery measures through structural adjustment programme which do not often lead to any significant improvement in the lives of their peoples With regard more specifically to the critical economic situation in Africa  it is appropriate to point out that two years after the adoption by our Organisation of a Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 the economic and social situation of all African countries continues to deteriorate. It must be said that the international community has not kept the pledge it made at the special session of the General Assembly devoted to Africa to provide sufficient resources to back up and supplement Africa's development efforts. The aid-terms review of the Programme our Organization has just carried out should prompt Africa's partners to increase their efforts to enable us to achieve our goals.The rich countries must be seriously concerned about the external economic factors that have so obviously compounded Africa's present difficulties. In this connection  genuine auspices to relieve the enormous debt burden of sub-Saharan Africa and to increase the flow of resources to the region should be encouraged.In spite of everything  we still hope that the present dÃ©tente in relations between the two Powers and the rebirth of a climate of trust within the international community - because of the various ongoing peace initiatives on many war-fronts - can be considered as a prelude to a new era of co-operation and dialogue among nations. It is our duty to work forcefully and with faith our total commitment to the values that identify and underpin the ideals of our Organisation as we Â· celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is our duty to enhance these values to defend then whenever they could be violated  because in then lies the survival and grandeur of Mankind. "
"12",580,"BFA",43,1988,"ï»¿It gives me particular pleasure to welcome the election of Mr. Dante Caputo to preside over this forty-third session. I sincerely congratulate him and wish him every success. His Qualities as a seasoned diplomat guarantee that our work will proceed smoothly. I also congratulate the other officers of the General Assembly and assure them  as well as the President  of my delegation's active support.I should also like to express our satisfaction with the excellent work accomplished at the forty-second session under the presidency of Mr. Peter Florin.I wish to pay a special tribute to our Secretary-General  both for his tireless devotion to promoting international co-operation and for his perseverance in the search for peace. We are all familiar with the personal part he played in the resolution of certain conflicts. I wish to express renewed appreciation of his exemplary faith in our Organization and of his courageous efforts to preserve its prestige and credibility  despite financial difficulties.I have been instructed by our Head of State  Comrade Blase CompaorÃ©  to deliver to the Assembly on his behalf a message of friendship and peace from the Popular Front Government and the people of Burkina Faso. It will be recalled that last year  during the forty-second session  the people of Burkina Faso were having to deal with one of the most serious crises in their history. We are a peaceful people; the world was not used to seeing bloodshed in our country  therefore the confusion felt by some people was understandable. What we did not understand  and are not prepared to accept  was that  because of the charisma of a man who knew how to look after his image  the regime that replaced his and the whole people were condemned in certain circles.Burkina Faso has made great strides since during the past year; it has staunched its wounds and embarked resolutely  with the Popular Front  on the road to recovery.On 15 October 1987 an era ended  an era of repeated deviations from our revolution. We had to restore the socio-political and economic balance nationally and re-establish a basis for co-operation at the international level. It was essential that our people  who had made great sacrifices in supporting our revolutionary construction  should be able to achieve their legitimate aspirations without being submitted to the terror of a police regime or the economic reverses that would inevitably result from the autocratic system imposed upon them. It was high time our neighbours were reassured and our partners' fears allayed. To our neighbours above all  we had to give proof of our desire to practise with them the virtues of good neighbourliness and non-interference. Here I should like to say that we succeeded better than we had hoped in restoring confidence and the basis for subregional co-operation so necessary for our fragile and vulnerable economies.Although I have stated this in other international bodies  I should like to restate here the desire of the Burkina Faso Government to live in peace with its neighbours and with all peoples of the world  to seek with them solutions to the innumerable scourges which overwhelm the international community and to build a world of justice and progress.I should like to repeat our devotion to the principles and ideals of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  and the United Nations.Armed with this determination we shall participate in this general debate.The excellent report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization gives a striking picture of our world in flux.It is also a stark reminder of our responsibilities to future generations that we are in the last stretch of the twentieth century  which has been so eventful.At this moment of truth there have been few successes. This is true in particular of the decades proclaimed by this Assembly  whether of disarmament or development.With regard to development the third world countries have paid and continue to pay a steep price for the structural crisis of the world economy. Our countries have impotently witnessed an increasing deterioration year after year in their terms of trade with the rich countries. It is regrettable that speculation has further distorted the normal conditions of international trade which were at the outset certainly not satisfactory for any one. It is indeed difficult otherwise to explain the fact that the developed countries have succeeded in exercising their systematic control over the commodity markets. Neither the old capitalist law of supply and demand nor the accords of guarantee in the case of specific commodities ate any longer reliable mechanisms. The only thing that now counts is the will of the cartel which has been established for a particular commodity or group of producers  and always pressure is exercised to lower prices. One year after the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and despite the entry into force of the Commodities Funds there is little chance that the rules of the game will change so that the countries which produce these raw materials can derive income to finance their development projects. Far from it. They are trapped in machinery that will inevitably lead them to borrow more to make up for lost export earnings  to invest not in efforts at development but in efforts for sheer survival. Therefore the North-South dialogue which was so encouraging has become a well-oiled machine designed to drain economic flows and cause a reverse transfer of resources. Thus debt has become for all developing countries a nightmare  and its solution  the squaring of the circle - doubtless - Ð° monstrous concept which neither the debtors nor their creditors want to tackle head on  still less together. Each side simply sizes up the situation and proposes solutions that are more or less realistic  more or less radical  all under the paternalistic eye of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Africa has an opportunity to speak with a single voice because States composing it have collectively confronted the monster. I refer here to the extraordinary summit conference of the OAU on African debt held last November. Rut it is clear that the debt problem cannot be taken out of context. It should be considered from the standpoint of international economic relations. Together with Africa  we roust tackle the Question whether the developed countries want to have economic partners worthy of the name or simply zones of influence. I leave the question open.In order to resolve the crisis  Africa has  in its Priority Programme  chosen discipline with sacrifice. The international community has responded by adopting the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. This Programme of Action  which is now at mid-point  and whose review has now been going on for a few weeks  is one of our major concerns. I wish to â salute the meritorious efforts of the Secretary-General to ensure implementation of this plan by agencies of the United Nations system.But it is no secret that implementation of the programme has fallen short of expectations and that everywhere Africa has been disappointed in its hopes and in its desire for co-operation.  The debates that took place in this forum a few days ago enabled us to take stock of what has been done and to comprehend what remains to be done. As long as some of our partners  States and international organizations alike  do not admit that the pressure exercised on our economies and societies by structural adjustment efforts may certainly have beneficial effects  but equally disastrous consequences  we will not transcend the bottle-necks and the present lack of understanding.We hope that the international community will take a salutary initiative so that by 199U the Programme of Action and the Priority Programme can be implemented in full. The survival of an entire continent is at stake and at the end of this twentieth century hunger  endemic diseases and despair are the daily lot of its peoples. Africa needs  for its survival  assistance in its efforts to rehabilitate its environment sorely tested by drought and other natural disasters. Right now I refer to locust invasions which could  in particular in the Sahel region  wipe out the efforts of almost 15 years at reforestation and soil rehabilitation.No individual country  nor region acting in isolation can stop desertification or the invasion of locusts. Looking at Burkina Paso  although having a national environment safeguards programme  it has  with its partners in the Permanent Inter-State Committee to Combat Drought in the Sahel and other organizations in the subregion and with the assistance of the international community  been carrying out action on the basis of solidarity of an integrated kind. Here the United Nations Sahel Office has an irreplaceable role to play.Our world may live to see the day when people with an acute awareness of the problems facing mankind and the intellectual and technological means to analyse them can resolve them. Safeguarding the environment is one of these problems. The outstanding work done by the Brundtland Commission two years ago  but whose conclusions are still valid  is one such analysis. Unfortunately  when we talk about mobilizing ourselves and fighting these scourges  even for our survival  our world seems to be impotent. We can only hope that humanity will soon find the collective means to confront adversity and mend its ways.At this stage  I should like to voice the indignation of my country at the scorn shown by industrial societies for the lives of our peoples by transforming Africa into a cheap dumping ground for their refuse  whether radioactive or not  but certainly harmful. We appeal to the conscience of the rich States to consider with us those practices as being crimes bearing the seed of long-term genocide.Already  uncontrolled nuclear tests have disrupted our ecosystems  attacked the ozone layer that protects our earth. Right now terrible and unnecessary numbers of weapons continue to be buried under innocent feet  transported by air and sea  ready to take off into outer space. The children of the twentieth century and the people of the twenty-first are condemned to experience the nightmares of the apocalypse unless the big Powers bring this to the inevitable end for which we have been waiting since Hiroshima.The developments in the negotiations between the two super-Powers and the limited agreements they have reached are promising. Nevertheless  these negotiations must be pursued further and in other directions. At this stage and in this context we cannot but regret that the hopes of the international community were dashed-by the failure of the fifteenth special session of the General Assembly  the third such session devoted to disarmament.Burkina Faso  for its part  will welcome every bilateral or multilateral effort to bring about disarmament. It is high time that our intellectual and material resources were used in a way more in keeping with the aspirations of the people of our time for development  greater well-being and a better quality of life.Just as we welcomed the progress made in detente  so also we welcomed with relief the announcement of the signature of the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan  the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and the promise of a solution to the Kampuchean and southern African problems.I	.We reiterate our appeal to our friends in Afghanistan for national reconciliation  which is a prerequisite for any consistent effort at reconstruction. The welcome development regarding the Iran-Iraq conflict is a tribute to the two belligerents  which have spared the world the holocaust to which the greater involvement of the foreign Powers in the Gulf region would inevitably have led. We hope that the cease-fire clauses will be respected and that negotiations on pending issues will be concluded  so that lasting peace may be established. As an active member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  we exhort the two brother States  Iraq and Iran  to strive without delay at a complete reconciliation.We have been following with great interest negotiations at all levels aimed at putting an end  after more than a decade to the tragedy of Kampuchea. We hope that the Cambodian people will soon be reconciled and will rebuild their beautiful country amid the friendly interest of their neighbours and with the assistance of the international community as a whole.For us  the situation in southern Africa arouses mixed feelings. Of course  we are pleased that quadripartite talks between Angola  Cuba  South Africa and the United States have taken place in the last few months without any major break. Similarly  we welcome the results that the protagonists have reached  because we are aware of the determination of our Angolan brothers to safeguard African interests in the region  in particular those of Namibia.If we have mixed feelings  it is because we are thinking about the road that remains to be travelled to arrive at a final solution to the problem. South Africa  which seems to be responding to pressure by the international community to begin to accept Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  on the independence of Namibia  continues to burn schools in that Territory  persists in its refusal to recognize the South West African People's Organization (SWAPO)  the authentic representative of the Namibian people  and practice the terrorism of apartheid against the people of South Africa.I have been to southern Africa. A few months ago I had an opportunity to visit some of the front-line States. Already there  at the gates of the South African hell  one could not help doubting that the accursed regime of apartheid could ever reform itself - if  indeed  one was not certain that it could not. Only the determination  courage and unselfishness of the front-line States and the faith of the South African people in their future and the inevitable victory of their struggle strengthened my feeling that all was not lost.All is not lost if Pretoria's friends finally make possible the realization of the unanimous aspiration of the peoples that make up this Organization. Only those countries hold the key to the problem  which is to decide to impose on racist South Africa mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter. This would do them honour and allay doubts about violation of the cardinal principles of our Organization by the nations that are responsible for peace and security in the world and that defend human rights.The General Assembly has decided that apartheid is a crime against humanity. It must be dealt with as such. Apart from apartheid  the Palestinian tragedy is the major political question concerning the solution of which our Organization has already disappointed two generations of people.The successive wars in the Middle East since the State of Israel was established  the gradual disintegration of Lebanon  and in particular the plunder of the Palestinian people and its reduction to statelessness  are a black mark against the United Nations.We therefore welcome  as the last chance for the United Nations to play a decisive role in the settlement of this problem  the idea  which is gaining ground  regarding the convening  under United Nations auspices  of an international conference on the Middle East. The success of that Conference can be guaranteed only if the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole representative of the Palestinian people  is admitted as a fully-fledged participant on the same footing as Israel. I cannot conclude without mentioning the concern that my country  as a member of the Non-Aligned movement  feels about the problem of the reconciliation of the two communities in Cyprus  the independent and peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula  and the process of peace and integration in Central America.All the peoples concerned wish to live free of foreign interference and hegemonistic designs; some to forge a national identity  others to forge a regional entity. The fulfilment of these noble aspirations can only benefit our Organization and the international community.I think it is right to say that the international situation  despite the persistence of the economic crisis  seems better this year than it was at the same time last year. There has been a relaxation of the most acute tensions and nations are engaging resolutely in the search for peace and the building of a better future.On the strength of this  I venture to hope that at the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly the last guns will have been silenced on the last battlefields of the world  the Palestinians will be back in their land building a future together with the Israelis  the state of emergency will have been lifted in South Africa  Nelson Mandela will have been released from the apartheid gaol and  finally  Namibia will occupy in this Hall  somewhere between Mozambique and Nepal  the place that has been its by right for so long  and for which it has waited far too long."
"13",623,"BGD",43,1988,"ï»¿Let me first congratulate the President on his election  which was capable and well-deserved  it redounds as much to his own personal credit as to Argentina's contribution and role in the United Nations. I record also our deep appreciation of the resolute and efficient leadership provided to the forty-second session by his predecessor Kr. Peter Florin.Our tributes extend to our Secretary-General for his patient and persistent diplomacy  His single-minded efforts to forge Ð° greater solidarity among nations and a convergence of interests on the vital issues of peace  stability and development deserve our praise.The concrete manifestation of his contribution has been the decision of the Nobel Committee to award its Peace Prise to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. We join in the praise accorded to those courageous men and women  who have contributed so meaningfully to the cause of peace. Bangladesh is proud to be part of this process. I reiterate my Governmentâs determination to continue to contribute to this noble endeavour.The Charter was based on the yearning of mankind for a safer Î½ more equitable and prosperous world bound together by the inherent interdependence and sense of humanity. For Bangladesh that vision remains real. We believe that it is achievable  and we reaffirm our total commitment to it. It is for this reason that we welcome the resurgent public interest in the United Nations. The solid achievement of the recent past - progress in regional security issues  advances towards nuclear-arms control provides hope for human dignity - are but some of the hard-won fruits of the painstaking efforts of the United Nations over the decades. Propelling them was the push to pursue  not individual  but global interests  to emphasize unequivocally that security is indivisible  that military solutions are not viable  that the self-perpetuating arms race is insupportable in cost and Incalculable In danger  and that prosperity cannot be achieved at the expense of others.There is a collective awareness today that we have entered a new phase and pattern of international relations  promoted by dialogue and detente among the big Powers  by the emergence of a new multipolarity on the international economic plane  by a greater tolerance for diversity in socio-economic and political systems.In the face of this convergence of Interests the United Nations must seize the Initiative to forge practical agreements through dialogue and negotiation. It must. Indeed  go beyond and expand its undertakings to bring together the capacities of nations from the good of mankind  for the common benefit of all. As the Prime Minister of Canada emphasized  in this still new age the differences dividing us are less important than the dangers we must face together. Concrete acts which make our world more secure must be matched by tangible commitment to reduce poverty in the developing world and to protect our common environment. This potential for concentrating the combined efforts of the International community in the service of humanity has particular relevance for Bangladesh. The Inextricable link between poverty  environment  human health and the economy is best illustrated in our immediate predicament. The worst flood in living memory overran Bangladesh this year. It has come in the wake of the disaster cyclone of 1985 and the floods of 1987. These calamities have exposed the total vulnerability of our economy and environment to destructive forces of nature beyond our capacity to control or effectively mitigate. Their cause lies as much in the impact of nature as in the nature of poverty. The statistics of disaster in Bangladesh have always been terrifying in their intensity. They have literally anaesthetized belief in the true extent of their enormity. Nevertheless  they are real and compounded by cumulative accretion.The international community's response has been one of heart-warming spontaneity. I express on behalf of the Government and the people of Bangladesh our deepest gratitude to all donor countries  to the heads of international organizations  as well as those of United Nations specialized agencies  to numerous non-governmental organizations and to those thousands of individuals and groups that rushed to our assistance in our hour of maximum need.Our particular thanks go to the Secretary-General  who acted quickly in sending his Special Representative  Mr. Muhamed Essaafi  to serve as co-ordinator of United Nations agencies in the field and to mobilize their activities for purposeful and unified intervention by the United Nations.There was optimism this year that  despite the vicissitudes caused by last year's floods  genuine progress was being made towards the achievement of a 6 per cent growth target  in comparison to the 2.5 per cent flood-depressed growth reached in 1937. Significant recovery had taken place in the agricultural sector. Following the 1988 floods our plans have gone awry. Given the already stringent adjustments made in the Annual Development Plan  the ability to manoeuvre is severely constrained  accompanied by the continuing need to pare our deficit budget  realign our balance Of payments and reduce external debt  which now totals 311 billion. The overall macro-economic picture is one of uncertainty  with the projection of growth for this year dramatically scaled down from 6 per cent to 2 per cent. Several Important lessons emanate from our experience. The first is that such disasters hove long ceased to be viewed in the context of humanitarian relief. They constitute an insurmountable burden on the economy and development plans of a country  causing irrecoverable setbacks in growth and necessitating impossible adjustments. The need for sustained development assistance over the long term is vital. The second lesson is that the link between economic and social development and the need for environmental supportive growth strategies is no longer subject to academic debate. It has become a bounden reality  despite the recognized complexities in balancing priorities.Many of these catastrophes could not have been prevented now or in the immediate future in the absence of in-depth study of the cumulative factors that cause them and of massive investment over time to remedy them. It has now been widely acknowledged that there are too many aspects for any single country or even groups of countries to be able to deal with effectively. They need a global reach and outlook  supplemented by regional cooperative efforts.The President of Bangladesh has appealed to the international community to assist Bangladesh in seeking a permanent solution to the problem. In doing so he has re-elaborated a comprehensive national programme to recuperate from the devastation caused by floods  cyclones and drought that now appear to have become a persistent visitation. The programme includes  inter alia;Broad-based institutional arrangements and standing operational procedures to be activated throughout the country at the immediate onset of a disaster. They include contingency plans for pre-positioning stocks of essential supplies  in particular food grains  medicine  transport and construction materials. Immediate rehabilitation measures to restore flood-stricken people to normal life by concentration on such priority areas as agricultural recovery  supply of key inputs of seeds  fertilizer and irrigation; infrastructural repairs  particularly in communications and housing  and restoration of health and sanitation facilities.- Medium-term measures for rehabilitation and reconstruction of the economy and infrastructure  with special emphasis on disaster preparedness and preventive schemes. A factor requiring major adjustment would be to change the cropping pattern from dependence on the monsoon crop to emphasis on enhancing the winter crop.As we grapple with the gigantic task of recovery we are conscious that remedies extend far beyond our individual capacity. Our location in the delta of a vast flood plan  on a parcel of land barely above sea-level  places us permanently on the receiving end of calamities caused as much by nature as the environmental depredations of man. Recurring floods in India and the devastation of earthquakes and landslides in Nepal compound the impact of these disasters on Bangladesh in the monsoon season as rampaging waters and billions of tons of silt are carried down by the rivers that criss-cross our country. In the dry season  scarce water resources needed by hundreds of millions of people along the Gangetic plain are squeezed to a trickle by the time they reach Bangladesh  exacerbating the consequences of drought and raising the annual spectre of famine.As we look towards approaches for a permanent solution  the primary imperative will be to harness regional co-operation among all our concerned neighbours with a view to arriving at coherent and well co-ordinated policies and plans to our mutual benefit. This needs to be backed by international support and intervention. A vital necessity is the stimulation of expert studies and feasibility reports through collation and synthesis of existing materials and through collective exchange of ideas and forward projection of practical remedies. The President of Bangladesh has already initiated the process through direct contact with the leaders of our regional neighbours and through communications with the heads of international organizations and financial institutions  including those in the United Nations system.Bangladesh has closely co-operated and co-ordinated its activities with Mr. M'haroed Essaafi and the United Nations agencies in the field in the preparation of a report to be submitted to the Secretary--General to elicit international assistance. We extend to him and his colleagues our heartfelt thanks for their dedication and commitment. It is our hope that a special meeting will be convened at this session of the Assembly of Member States  agencies and organs of the United Nations system and international economic and financial institutions to deal comprehensively with this issue.The experience of Bangladesh serves dramatically to highlight a growing crisis affecting developed and developing countries alike. Desertification  soil erosion  deforestation  swollen cities and giant spill-off s of pollutants  acid rain and the dumping of toxic wastes are all symptoms of this crisis. Some are the consequences of poor people seeking to survive  others of the pursuit of economic growth at any cost.Remedial actions have been set in train  but much more needs to be done urgently. Conferences on various aspects have been convened or are under preparation. Formal instruments have been adopted  others are being formulated  including contemplated guidelines for environmental codes of conduct. This momentum has to be maintained. It is only fitting that the United Nations has declared the decade of the 19SOs as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction. Bangladesh believes that the time is indeed ripe for the holding of an environmental summit at the highest level  perhaps as a special session of the General Assembly.It is thus with a sense of acute foreboding that we turn to review the world economy. We share the growing anxiety over what appears to be a diminution of interest in the cause of economic development  a cause fuelled over three decades by the United Nations that embraces the twin objectives of promoting equitable growth and alleviating poverty.We find today that the gap between the rich and the poor has inexorably widened. The critical motors for raising world standards of living ~ economic growth  finance  trade and resource transfers - are all stalling. Their dimensions have been spelled out in numerous reports of the United Nations and pin-pointed in the statements of speakers before me. This much is trueÂ·  that developing countries remain prisoners to a system where external markets  terms of trade and interest rates greatly influence their economic fate and remain outside their control.Developed countries continue to resist negotiation on the critical issues of trade  finance  debt and development in any forum controlled by the developing countries. The resulting stalemate has exacerbated the adverse international climate and is yet to be broken.The impact on the poorest of the poor  the least developed countries  has been devastating. The main goals of the 1981 Substantial New Programme of Action remain a distant ideal with little hope of reaching the main target of increasing official development assistance to 0.15 per cent. Per capita incomes are continuing to fall. External indebtedness has increased dramatically. Agricultural productivity has fallen far below the 4 per cent growth targets envisaged. Given rapid population growth  this has meant a continuing decline in per capita food production  the most serious challenge facing these countries in die coming decade. The African situation is a continuing case in point. Despite efforts to carry out adjustments in their national economic policies  most African countries have found little respite from hard climatic conditions and the adverse international economic environment. Sustained and timely commitment to the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 must be maintained.The hope remains that we will be able to reverse the North-South polarization and reinvigorate the process of constructive dialogue. It arises from the practical reality that for as long as the socio-economic policies of the developed countries remain incompatible with the interests of the developing world  the goal of sustained and durable growth of the world economy will remain illusive. Significant opportunities to turn these hopes into practical reality in the years ahead the 1990 conference in Paris on the least developed countries  the formulation of the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade and the Montreal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Ministers to review the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations are but a few examples. Equally important are follow-up measures for a growth-oriented debt strategy linking debt service to the creation of viable conditions for development  the convening of an international conference on money and finance for development  and efforts to stem the reverse transfers of resources that continue to impoverish the developing countries.While gaping holes continue to riddle the fabric of world peace  a painstaking patchwork process has begun. The rapprochement of the two major Powers has had a beneficial spin-off on a wide variety of problems areas hitherto anchored in attrition.The cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and the initiation of direct political talks under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General provide hope that a common understanding will be readied on the previsions of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  opening the way for a just and lasting solution.Forward  movement is discernible in Kampuchea following Viet Kan's announcement of the phased withdrawal of its troops. Regional efforts initiated by the Jakarta Informal Meeting to end the impasse have contributed to the feasibility of a comprehensive political settlement based on the declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea. Bangladesh looks forward to the time when we can see firmly established again a neutral  independent and non-aligned Afghanistan. We are already witnessing the phased withdrawal of foreign troops  and we support the strict and effective implementation of other aspects of the historic Geneva Accords of 14 April 1988. These constitute an essential prerequisite for a comprehensive settlement that would  inter alia  enable the return of Afghan refugees to their homeland in safety and honour  and allow the Afghan people to exercise their inherent right to determine their own destiny and choose their own Government.There appears to be a more receptive climate in Western Sahara for an end to the conflict  with the acceptance by the parties of the peace plan submitted jointly by the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (0Ð¨) and the Secretary-General. We hope that the essential modalities governing a cease-fire and a referendum will soon be worked out.The leaders of the two Cypriot communities have also agreed to resume dialogue without pre-conditions arid to attempt to achieve by June next year a negotiated settlement of all aspects of the Cyprus problem. We hail these developments  as we do the signs of the renewal of talks between the two Koreas  and progress towards peace in the Horn of Africa. The willingness of the leaders of Chad and Libya to resolve their dispute by peaceful means marks the end of acute tension in yet another area. We are encouraged by recent diplomatic activity in southern Africa and Angola  which has increased the prospects of early independence in Namibia. As a member of the Council for Namibia  Bangladesh has no need to reiterate its consistent stand. We have already indicated our willingness to participate directly in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia  for which contingency plans are already being drawn up  in pursuance of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).Vital breakthroughs towards peace have thus been made. Many problems  however  remain mired in intractability.The situation in the Middle East is intolerable. Continuation of the status quo is illegal and counter-productive with regard to peace. The Palestinian intifadah  in the teeth of brutal repression  is glaring testimony to its outright rejection. Peace in the Middle East can be guaranteed only by a comprehensive  just and lasting solution based on the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. Bangladesh endorses the core conditions laid down in the Fez plan of 1982 and the decision adopted by the extraordinary Arab summit in Algiers in June this year. We fully support the efforts of the Secretary-General to pursue the convening of an international peace conference  with the full and independent participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (Ð LO) as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.The human tragedy in South Africa continues to unfold in the vicious cycle of resistance  retaliation and oppression Imposed by the brutal apartheid regime. Its destructive consequences have spilled across the frontiers of South Africa and have been manifested by repeated acts of aggression  sabotage and destabilization. The front-line States which are the major victims need sustained support to counter the effect of economic strangulation and political disruption. We join in the call for the release of Nelson Mandela; a first step towards the inevitable â the dismantling of apartheid. In the face of South Africa's continued intransigence  we fully support the call for comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the racist regime.We are meeting in the wake of the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. Though its outcome fell short of the adoption of a final document by consensus  it represented a significant advance in increasing awareness of the crucial issues involved and identifying areas for progress towards a negotiated settlement. Surrounding the session was the hope generated by the historic breakthrough in the field of nuclear-arms control by the signing and implementation of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - and the understanding reached between the signatories that they would strive for a 50 per cent reduction of strategic nuclear weapons.Bangladesh's position on these Issues was elaborated at length at the third special session on disarmament  and I wish merely to sum up its main content.The overall goal of general and complete disarmament within a comprehensive framework of negotiations must be pursued simultaneously with efforts to resolve regional conflicts  promote socio-economic development  and build up confidence and trust among regional neighbours.Disarmament Is a joint undertaking of all States  and not the exclusive responsibility of the two biggest Powers. It is for this reason that we have strongly advocated an increase in the membership of the Conference on Disarmament to represent all shades of opinion. Further progress in nuclear disarmament remains an imperative  in recognition of the obvious truth that more weapons do not mean more security. Dependence on the doctrine of deterrence is misleading. Reliance on nuclear leverage can only perpetuate a community of fear.We have rejected the nuclear alternative and have therefore adhered to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We support all measures  partial or otherwise  that could promote disarmament and deter the horizontal spread of the arms race  both quantitatively and qualitatively. Immediate priorities call for the completion of the convention banning the production and use of chemical weapons  the imperative necessity of a comprehensive test-ban treaty  control of conventional-arms transfer  particularly in conflict situations  and the means to strengthen verification  including an integrated multilateral verification system within the United Nations framework.We remain convinced that what is really threatening peace and stability is the dice incidence of poverty  hunger and destitution existing in our world. This has been exacerbated by the channelling of vast resources for the purposes of destruction  not amelioration  of the well-being of peoples. The adverse environmental impact of those unnecessary arsenals  both in terms of materials and resources expended on their production and in terms of the dangerous consequences of their use  cannot be minimized. In the nuclear context it embraces the content of all life on our planet.We have passed through an anxious phase when the very viability of the United Nations has been seriously questioned. The catch-phrase was ""the erosion of multilateralism."" That loss of confidence in the United Nations was attributed to disparate reasons as much political as administrative and financial. Assertions of the so-called  tyranny of the majority  mutual accusations of repetitive and hardened postures  of outdated Illusions and outmoded attitudes and attempts to preserve privileged positions - all these confined to create a picture of multilateralism under concerted attack. Since then  there has been a fundamental re-examination of the United Nations functioning and role. Concentrated reforms have been affected with a view to improving administrative efficiency and to tightening financial stringency. Those steps were accompanied by measures to streamline the capacity of the United Nations to find integrated solutions to the problems of social and economic development. We believe that process must be continued in a spirit of practicability and accommodation. Even as the crucial peace-Making and peace-keeping role of the United Nations is beginning to win back essential credibility for the world body  a host of new and mushrooming problems such as drugs  terrorism  threats to the environment  problems that respect no international boundaries  have further underscored its relevance and importance. They are global problems that call for global solutions. They cannot be dealt with in isolation. The future is fast impacting on the present at a rate of acceleration that has rendered obsolete old values  old perceptions and concepts of space and time. Together  they pose new challenges; they call for new perspectives and for a radical change of outlook on the part of world leaders.The United Nations remains the only viable repository for pooling the world's talent  intelligence  expertise and  most important of all  its concern and compassion. Support for the United Nations is no longer an exercise in idealism. It has become a practical necessity  a hard reality. It is in recognition of that fact that Bangladesh has reposed its total confidence and commitment in the world body."
"14",669,"BGR",43,1988,"ï»¿I should like to congratulate Ambassador Dante Caputo of Argentina on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I am convinced that under his guidance  the Assembly will achieve results that will further enhance the authority of the United Nations.I wish also to acknowledge the outstanding presidency of his predecessor  Comrade Peter Florin. Each session of the General Assembly begins with a review of the international situation. At the forty-third session too we have heard every speaker pose the same questions in different ways  namely; what is happening in the world? Are we capable of staving off the nuclear threat and putting an end to conflict? Are we securely embarked on the course of strengthening peace and security?Although it would be hard to provide a simple answer to those questions  the facts show that there has indeed been progress. The world is changing for the better. We can see the emergence of a qualitatively new situation that does not conform to the usual stereotypes of the balance of power  two camps  the class struggle or other concepts based on strength. What has changed? For the first time in history  we have begun to see that mankind is a single  hole united by its common efforts to survive and continue to develop towards progress and civilization.Some examples of the changes taking place in the world are the move in Soviet-United States relations from confrontation to dialogue  the greater positive contribution made in world affairs by the Non-Aligned Movement  and the active impact of public opinion on international policy.These trends are no mere accident. They result from the general course of world events. The deepening of mankind's self-awareness has coincided with the processes of restructuring and renewal taking place in socialist countries. The technological and scientific revolution  the increasing importance of moral and democratic factors in public life  and an overall improvement in the political education of peoples have helped bring about a reassessment of the problems of human coexistence.The philosophy of a new political thinking has thus arisen. At its core lies the primacy of universal human values over bloc and ideological considerations. That philosophy has inspired a new diplomacy in search of sensible and mutually acceptable solutions to international problems. A broad consensus is developing on the need for a comprehensive approach to security issues  taking into account both the military-political and the economic  humanitarian  ecological and other factors.In his address to the eightieth conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union  which ended three weeks ago in Sofia  the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and President of the State Council of the People's Republic of Bulgaria  Comrade Zhivkov  stated that""The new realities require new political action on the part of the people. The threat of ecological catastrophe  economic underdevelopment  widespread disease  the terrible infant-mortality rate and growing illiteracy are global problems that can be resolved only through the common efforts of mankind  with a thorough restructuring of international relations on the basis of a balance of interests.""The international community's desire to break the vicious circle of military rivalry and confrontation and to guarantee security by political means through consolidating the primacy of international law is increasingly reflected in a new understanding of the international role of the United Nations.Bulgaria has always attached great importance to strengthening the role and effectiveness of the United Nations. Along with other countries  Bulgaria believes the Organization should become a genuine  effective instrument for maintaining international peace and security  developing international co-operation and settling conflicts and crises. We support proposals made here that the working methods and approach of the General Assembly and the Security Council be updated to make better use of the Organization's peace-keeping potential. Bulgaria will continue to contribute to the noble  all-embracing work of the United Nations. I take particular note today of the Organization's contribution to the settlement of a number of international disputes  and in particular of the important role played by the esteemed Secretary-General  Mr  Javier Perez de Cuellar.It is a fact that positive developments can be seen throughout the entire spectrum of world problems  regional disputes and sources of tension. Slowly and somewhat hesitantly foe the present  a situation is emerging which favours the collective search for solutions. It would be wrong to draw general conclusions for the entire world  but there appears to be a clear desire to find national and regional agreement with the assistance of the international community. The Geneva Agreements en Afghanistan were a milestone in the struggle to improve the international climate. Unswerving compliance with them is the only guarantee of restoring peace in that country and the region. We support the efforts of the Government of the Republic of Afghanistan to overcome that crisis by democratic means.We were very pleased to hear of the cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq. As a State that took part in the drafting and adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  we support the peace process and the mediation work done by the United Nations.In the Middle East  the essence of the problem there has not yet been resolved. The struggle of the Palestinian people for its freedom and self-determination continues. A positive factor is the almost complete agreement on the need to convene an international conference on the matter . We believe that it should be held on the basis of existing United Nations resolutions with the participation of all interested parties  including the five permanent members of the Security Council and the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole  authentic representative of the Palestine Arabs.Multilateral dialogue is taking place on questions relating to southern Africa. We hope that the decisions of the Organisation will finally be implemented and that Angola and other States of the region will attain peace  so long awaited  that Namibia will attain its independence and that the apartheid system will be abolished.Bulgaria sees great potential in the policy of national reconciliation proclaimed by Kampuchea. We are glad to see that prospects are being opened up through the efforts of Viet Nam and other peace-loving States. We welcome the policy of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea to bring about the peaceful democratic unification of the country  to demilitarize the peninsula and to turn it into a nuclear-free zone.We support the consistent efforts of Nicaragua and other Latin American countries to provide a peaceful solution to the problems of the region through dialogue and strict compliance with the principles of the Charter. We have been following very closely the development of the Cyprus problem. Certain progress is evident in the island  and we hope that  through political means and with United Nations assistance  the source of tension will finally be defused.Naturally it is impossible to achieve complete harmony between opposing forces and parties  but opponents must re-think contradictions from the standpoint of greater realism. They must agree to sensible compromises  from which all sides stand to gain. Accordingly  we believe that participants in conflicts should more carefully heed the collective wisdom of the world community. It alone has the moral right to judge the norms and rules of international coexistence. In all cases  an abiding condition of the peace process is recognition of every people's right to freedom of choice  without which it is impossible to resolve a conflict or achieve just and lasting peace.Bulgaria is located in the Balkans  a region with a difficult and complex history. That is why we are sincerely delighted at the steps towards detente and co-operation taken by Balkan States. They are in keeping with the spirit of the time and the aspirations of the Balkan peoples.The emergence of new thinking in the Balkans was expressed with increasing clarity at the Belgrade meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Balkan countries  which was held in a constructive and businesslike atmosphere. All of us who participated in that meeting sought to find a common language and stressed common interests  not confrontation or grievances. We commend the holding of that forum and the Balkan process it started.The Balkans are a priority in Bulgaria's foreign policy. In 1981 we started working out and we are now implementing  a set of measures and initiatives to strengthen good-neighbourliness and improve the overall atmosphere in the region. Despite any vicissitudes of fate  the constant goal of our policy has always been  and will continue to co-operation  peace and security in the Balkans.Basing ourselves on that goal  we will continue to work together with all Balkan States on a very broad  equitable footing. Our guiding light will be the legitimate interests of states  historical realities and the peace imperatives of our time. We believe that the key link in the joint efforts to promote peace could be to turn the peninsula into a zone free from weapons of mass destruction  which would certainly help to reduce confrontation  mistrust and hostility in the broader gees strategic context as well.I note with satisfaction that our discussion of urgent issues relating to disarmament today is reflecting the impact of new political thinking. The image of ""the enemy"" preparing for a nuclear strike or an attack using conventional weapons is gradually being replaced by the image of a normal person sincerely concerned about his or her security. Increasingly  there is a desire to understand one's partner  his way of thinking  his concerns. Without a doubt  not all remnants of the past have been removed  and not all stereotypes have been overcome  but ridding dialogue of futile rhetoric and propagandistic clichÃ©s  which has started to happen  is a major prerequisite for the strengthening of mutual understanding. Today  the most important task is the conclusion of an agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States on the reduction by 50 per cent of strategic offensive weapons. This should become a milestone in the achieving of strategic stability as we move towards the twenty-first century  and towards the complete elimination of nuclear arsenals.Progress is being made on the halting of nuclear tests. A complete ban on chemical weapons will become a reality in the near future. I should like to recall that although the Soviet-United States talks provide the main impetus in the disarmament process  the process  should become multilateral. No one can escape responsibility in this regard. We believe that lowering the level of military confrontation between the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) which started with the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles will be continued as a result of negotiations to reduce armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe. The July 1988 statement of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty set the goal of these negotiations as effecting radical reductions in the military potential of the two alliances  achieving a situation on the continent whereby they would have at their disposal the forces and facilities adequate for their defence but insufficient to conduct surprise attacks or to carry out offensive operations. Such reductions should be accompanied by a corresponding reduction in military expenditures. The functions and tasks of these forces should be determined by non-aggressive  defensive military doctrines  the core of which is the principle of reasonable sufficiency.At the same time  it is clear even to the uninitiated that progress in disarmament in certain areas has been accompanied by a specific shifting of resources to other areas. Naval armaments are still immune to disarmament efforts. The situation urgently requires the adoption of political decisions to reduce naval forces  bearing in mind mutual interests. For several years now  Bulgaria has been calling for the adoption of such a decision and working to that end. As a first step  we think it would be a good idea to discuss and adopt confidence-building measures on the seas and oceans and on maritime routes.The problems of verification  openness and predictability in the military sphere are acquiring growing significance. A United Nations comprehensive machinery for verification - as suggested by a number of countries  including Bulgaria - would make it possible to exercise proper control not only over arms reductions but also over regional conflicts so that they could be prevented. Outer space  like Earth  should be free of weapons. Broad international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space rather than space-based weapons would help us in building confidence and eliminating the threat of nuclear catastrophe.A major aspect of the disarmament problem is that it is intrinsically linked with development issues. Reducing military potential would allow the mobilization of the necessary resources to overcome underdevelopment and promote social and economic progress.The growing awareness of global Interdependence  positive trends in various parts of the world and the normalization of East-West relations have given us grounds to hope for positive changes in international economic relations. The time has come to restructure these relations on a just and democratic basis. The economic situation of the developing countries  and in particular their heavy foreign debt burden  is a serious problem for the entire International community. A just solution of that problem will require the concerted efforts of the world community  bearing in mind the interests of and prevailing conditions in the debtor countries and the basic goals of their socio-economic development. The United Nations can and should make a contribution to resolving this issue.The establishment of official relations between the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the European Economic Community was a major positive event. The development of relations between these two organizations on a mutually advantageous basis will significantly promote peaceful coexistence in Europe and throughout the world. Bulgaria will make its contribution towards developing that co-operation for the security and prosperity of all peoples. The common interests of all States and peoples are clearly reflected in the problem of the protection of the environment. Economic activity carried out without due attention being paid to ecological factors is destroying nature  just as the arms race and military conflicts destroy nature. The world is being suffocated by chemicals  the soil is deteriorating  the climate is changing and the flora and fauna are disappearing. A collective effort by all countries and peoples is required. The effective guaranteeing of international ecological security should become a primary goal in the work of the United Nations  which has already done much to protect the environment. A concrete contribution in this respect has been made by the report of the Brundtland Commission. The ideas it contains are of fundamental Importance In protecting nature and man's environment.In keeping with its position of principle  Bulgaria supports the working out of broad measures to conserve nature at both regional and subregional levels. We have proposed the conclusion of a treaty for the ecological protection of the Balkan peninsula. We have also suggested the holding in Sofia of an ecological forum within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Active work is going on in Bulgaria on a broad set of practical measures in this area.The current Issues of peace  security and co-operation are characteristically intertwined in Europe. On the Old Continent  truly non-traditional and Innovative views are struggling against the canons of out-dated thinking. Those who favour the division of Europe into blocs are unrelenting. But at the same time the noble idea of a common European home is emerging  a concept reflecting the historic  cultural  political and economic community of the countries of Europe  the United States and Canada. The dogmas of the past are being slowly overcome. The Vienna meeting of the States of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will soon be concluded. We hope that it will provide new dynamism to the process of equal and mutually advantageous dialogue in Europe.The problems in international affairs and their interrelationship are being discussed at a number of international forums. This is a new and hitherto untried methodology  but it is in keeping with the spirit of our times. These discussions are focusing increasingly on social and humanitarian problems.Forty years ago the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That was the first step towards the establishment of today's solid legal basis for international co-operation on social and humanitarian problems. At present practically no State is outside the world consensus in this area. That is quite natural  since the human person is a universal value  the centre of evolution and the focal point of attention in domestic and foreign policies. The creation of favourable conditions for a free  dignified and creative life for the individual is not State charity but the State's main obligation  so as to ensure that society and civilization in general will flourish. Bulgaria welcomes the expanding role of the United Nations in the social and humanitarian spheres. We will work for the democratization of international relations and the establishment of moral guarantees of peace and security.An eminent public figure and humanist  Aurelio Pecci  said that the current stage of evolution requires that people stop merely looking into the future and start building that future. For the sake of objectivity it must be noted that we are just at the beginning of this great demilitarisation and humanisation of international affairs. We realize that a lot remains to be changed in ourselves  too  in order to move towards an irreversibly non-violent world  to build a new global international order under which every country  every people and every person can feel confident about the future. There is no possible alternative."
"15",714,"BHR",43,1988,"ï»¿Allow me at the outset  on behalf of the delegation of the State of Bahrain to extend to Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina our warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly and our best wishes for success in fulfilling his task. Confident of his able leader ship  we assure him of our readiness to co-operate with him in the successful accomplishment of the work of the session.I should also like to avail myself of this opportunity to extend our thanks and appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic  for his dedicated efforts  wisdom and skill in guiding the proceedings of the last session.Permit me also to express our deepest gratitude to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General  for his persistent endeavours firmly to entrench the objectives and principles of our Organization and enhance its role in achieving peace and co-operation among nations  for the well-being of all peoples of the world. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is perhaps a most eloquent testimony and convincing proof of the importance of the role played by the United Nations and its Secretary-General in the maintenance of peace and security in the world.The year 1988 is reminiscent of a time when the United Nations  through its effective contributions to the resolution of conflicts between States  the maintenance of international peace and security and interaction with the policies of the various Powers that influenced international relations  was able to play a vital role in world events as a principal party in the new world order that emerged as a result of the realities of the period following the Second World War. It seems the international community once again feels the pressing need for the United Nations as a median for finding just solutions to international issues within the framework of the principles enshrined in its Charter and believes it has revitalized the role of collective diplomacy in dealing with outstanding regional conflicts and solving the worsening economic and social problems of the world.Thus the United Nations has proved that international co-operation has become an urgent necessity at this time in the history of our contemporary world. The fact that most parties to regional conflicts are today resorting to negotiations through the United Nations is in itself the best indication of the trust States place in the Organization and the role it can play to achieve harmony and understanding among the peoples of the world. It is from this perspective that we call for concerted efforts to promote the effectiveness of the world Organization and strengthen its capabilities in facing the challenges that threaten peace and security and hinder programmes of economic and social development.Resort to the Security Council and the General Assembly as effective organs capable of finding acceptable formulas to solve international disputes  and create favourable conditions for ending them  is a matter that demands our support and backing. Another cause for optimism in this connection is the budding positive relations between the five permanent members of the Security Council  the effects of which have been noticeably reflected in the collective decision-making process with regard to certain issues affecting world peace. It is to be hoped that this spirit will continue to prevail and that the foundations of understanding and accord among those members of the Security Council will become firmer and encompass all chronic issues. We further trust that this development will mark the dawning of a new era in which the spirit oÂ£ the Charter will guide the rebuilding of bridges of trust and co-operation between all Members of the Organization.The events that have occurred on the international scene since the last session carry the seeds of a new era in international politics  and a growing trend towards finding peaceful solutions to many of the important international and regional issues and problems in various parts of the world  such as the Iran-Iraq war  the questions of Afghanistan  Cyprus  Namibia  Kampuchea and Western Sahara  and the problems of Central America. However  despite such detente  other problems and issues still remain outstanding on our agenda  foremost among them the question of Palestine and the situations in the Middle East and southern Africa  which all call for efforts by the international community to create the right climate for the attainment of just and lasting solutions to those important and decisive issues. The recent Moscow summit meeting of the two super-Powers was a historic event  an event of great importance that added a new dimension to international relations and has had a positive effect on several complex regional issues and crises. Furthermore  the great Powers are now more convinced than ever before of the necessity of finding common ground for peaceful coexistence and co-operation among nations. The frequent meetings between the leaders of the two super-Powers  their agreement to solve the question of Afghanistan and their ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - are a clear indication of the vital change of course so conducive to reconciling conflicting interests  overcoming ideological differences and reducing the possibilities of the confrontation that was the salient feature of relations between the bigger Powers during the previous period. For our part  we welcome with great satisfaction this important change in relations between the two super-Powers. We hope that their rapprochement will be used in the interest of settling fundamental international issues  so as to move from a stage of tension and suspicion to one of tranquillity and openness.Bahrain welcomed the start of direct negotiations between Iraq and Iran under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. It hopes that the two will be able to work out a comprehensive settlement of their armed conflict and establish comprehensive  lasting peace in the region  in strict accordance with the provisions of Security Council resolution 598 /""87 which provides the just and honourable formula for ending that bloody war  which has been haemorrhaging for eight years now.It should be noted  in this connection  that the Co-operation Council of Arab Gulf States adopted from the earliest days following the outbreak of that war a clear policy that was reflected in the decisions of the consecutive summit meetings of its observer States and reaffirmed at their eighth summit meeting  in Riyadh  in December 1987. In this connection  the Council had expanded considerable efforts to contain that destructive war and to restore peace to the region.Iran's decision to accept the Security Council resolution  which our brother Iraq had already accepted upon its adoption by the Council  and Iran's agreement to the cease-fire and the commencement of discussions at Geneva constitute an important step towards peace. It is our hope that Iraq and Iran will be able to overcome their difficulties  overcome the psychological effects of the war and re-establish normal relations  within the framework of the principles of good-neighbourliness  mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs  to be able to devote all their efforts to the reconstruction made necessary by the devastation of the war  provide for the safety and peace of mind of their two peoples and restore security and stability in the Gulf region.The negotiations between Iraq and Iran are now in a delicate phase  which calls for the utmost prudence and self-restraint  and the avoidance of any action that might hinder the peace process. We therefore call upon all nations of the world to shoulder their responsibility to help both countries overcome this difficult phase  and to exert greater efforts aimed at securing the success of these negotiations and the full implementation of the provisions of the Security Council resolution  so that a new era can begin when guns fall silent and peace prevails.In this respect  I cannot but note the strenuous efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  so deserving of all our praise and appreciation  aimed at securing the implementation of Security Council 598 (1987)  whose objective is the end of one of the longest and fiercest wars of our times. The role of the United Nations and the Secretary-General will remain central to the process of restoring peace to this vital region of the world.The question of Palestine  though marked by more than 40 years of the conspicuous failure of right in the face of might  represents a major historic tragedy of an exceptional kind  as the international conflict fraught with the most danger for the peace and security of the world.International interest in this issue  ever since the adoption by the General Assembly in 1947 of resolution 181 (II) on the partition of Palestine  has been ebbing and flowing with the changing tide of international events and developments. It was not until December of last year that the question of Palestine began to experience a major change of course and to acquire a new measure of interest by the world public. This brought it once again to the forefront of the issues on the agenda of the United Nations. This was the result of the all-encompassing public uprising in the occupied territories  the intifada  which has become the major feature of the life-style of the Palestinian people in their steadfast resistance to the Israeli occupation  which has now continued for more than 21 years.The intifada is a historic event replete with examples and lessons. It is the genuine human expression of man's rejection of occupation and oppression. The Zionist entity  falling victim to its own illusions  convinced itself that the Palestinian people had fully absorbed the meaning of Israeli supremacy in terms of physical power  and forgot  or chose to ignore  that sources of moral power have a massive momentum in the lives of peoples. Israel has tried to no avail  to contain the Palestinian uprising by resorting to the most brutal methods  such as burying people alive  breaking bones and limbs  shooting at unarmed women and children  burning crops and plantations  expulsions  and the assassination of Palestinian leaders  a recent victim of which was the well-known freedom-fighter Khalil al-Wazeer.Despite the escalating brutality of the Israeli acts of suppression aimed at quelling the Palestinian uprising  a number of basic facts remain unchanged and un-obscured and Israel can no longer disregard or deny them.First  the Palestinian struggle has acquired a new dimension since the inhabitants of the occupied territories developed their uprising from spontaneity to calculated confrontation and conscious initiative.Secondly  the Palestinian people  through their steadfastness and persistence in their heroic uprising  decided definitively any question of coexistence in the conditions of occupation. It has become impossible  to continue to disregard their inherent right to self-determination.Thirdly  the policies of settlement and annexation  resulting in permanent tensions and flagrant violations of the United Nations resolutions and international law  have met with complete failure.Fourthly  the cause of the Palestinian people is gaining more support and greater solidarity day by day from peace-loving peoples and countries throughout the world  thus increasing Israel's international isolation.In view of these basic and established facts  and in the light of recent events following the decision by our brother Jordan to sever its legal and administrative ties with the West Bank  it is now more than ever before incumbent upon the United Nations  to shoulder its historic responsibility regarding the Palestinian people and make the necessary arrangements to put into action the mechanism for a solution by convening the International Peace Conference on the Middle East  vested with full powers and backed by International guarantees. In that conference the Palestine Liberation Organization will participate on an equal footing with the other parties to the dispute and the five permanent members of the Security Council will also take part  with a view to guaranteeing a just and comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict  securing Israel's complete withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied in 1967  particularly Jerusalem  and enabling the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate and inalienable rights  including their right to return'-and their right to self-determination and to establish their own independent State on their national soil.Not content with carrying out its expansionist designs against the territory of Palestine  Israel has continued its assaults on and acts of aggression against other Arab States. Thus  it declared its annexation of the Syrian Golan in 1981  it attacked the Iraqi nuclear installation that same year  and it bombarded the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Tunis in 1985. Furthermore  the misfortune that had beset fraternal Lebanon and left it with a legacy of disasters from which it continues to suffer would not have worsened had it not been for Israel's continuing aggression. Israel's recurrent attacks and violations of the territorial integrity and political independence of Arab States constitute flagrant breaches of the Charter and United Nations resolutions. That serious situation underlines the need for a just peace and for stability in the Middle East region  both of which can be achieved only if the international community  represented by the United Nations  moves to exert pressure on Israel to force it to comply with international principles and instruments.Bahrain welcomes the responsible position taken by sisterly Morocco reflected in its wise and far-sighted decision regarding settlement of the dispute in Western Sahara by peaceful means  in accordance with Security Council resolution 621 (1988). It is our hope that the endeavours of the Secretary-General in that respect will meet with success.The sorry state of the Afghan people  which has lasted for more than eight years  is now approaching its end as a result of the Geneva Agreements of 14 April 1988 relating to the political settlement of the various aspects of the question of Afghanistan. In our view  that development is a practical translation of the relevant United Nations resolutions calling for restoration of Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity and marks an important step towards enabling the Afghan people to exercise their right to choose their own political and social system without foreign interference and to create conditions favourable to the return of the Afghan refugees to their homeland in dignity and safety.We are hopeful - indeed  we are optimistic ~ that the Geneva Agreements will create a positive precedent for solving other regional conflicts such as those in Kampuchea  Cyprus and elsewhere. With regard to the Korean question  we trust that the consensus reached on inscribing it on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly will be another serious step towards the resumption of negotiations between the two sides  with a view to achieving the reunification of the Korean peninsula and realising the desire of the Korean people for restoration of their national unity.The situation in southern Africa is continuing to deteriorate  and this in turn affects peace and security in that important part of the African continent. That deterioration is reflected in its ugliest forms in the violence  terrorism and oppression of every kind being perpetrated by the Pretoria racist regime against the black majority in contempt of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.The worsening conditions in South Africa confirm our deep conviction that attempting to reform the apartheid regime is futile: it must be dismantled - indeed  eradicated - and replaced by a democratic system based on justice  equality and respect for human rights  as called for by the United Nations in its numerous resolutions. In our view  that can be achieved only through concerted international efforts to Isolate that regime and impose comprehensive mandatory sanctions against it in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.A harbinger of Namibian independence appears on the horizon this year thanks to the talks that have taken place between Angola  Cuba  South Africa and the United States of America. It is cause for optimism that the United Nations plan for the Independence of Namibia  which represents the common aspiration of the international community on this tenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  will be implementedÂ·The crisis that continues to beset the international economic order is still having an adverse effect on the economies of the developing countries. Regrettably  the favourable climate in international relations that has prevailed this year has not been matched by any perceptible progress in economic co-operation at the international level. It is self-evident that the lack of economic stability in most developing countries was due to the imbalances in the world economy that resulted from increased protectionist measures  the lack of equilibrium in the balance of world trade  -the foreign-debt crisis  the fluctuations in the rates of exchange  unfair trade practices  the instability of the prices of commodities and raw materials  the plummeting oil prices  and deteriorating terms of trade.The debt crisis of the developing countries is the major item on the agenda of many international conferences. The question how to resolve that crisis has become the subject of continued study and research in various international organs  agencies and forums. While we welcome the satisfactory results achieved at the Toronto summit meeting of the major industrial States with regard to settling the debts of the least-developed countries  we feel that the time has come for advancing from the phase of partial solutions to the adoption of an integrated global strategy for solving the crisis. In this context we emphasize the importance of financial-assistance flows from multilateral development institutions and developed countries to the developing countries on concessional terms and under reasonable conditions. This would enable them to implement their development plans and to achieve economic recovery and prosperity for their peoples.In today's world of interrelated interests the United Nations has become an indispensable need  since it is the only international machinery capable of solving complex problems and settling international dispute. Despite the crises it has encountered since its inception and the shortcomings that have marred its experience during the past 43 years  the United Nations remains a unique and pioneering experience in international relations; it remains a permanent body for collective diplomacy through which the peace and security of the world can be maintained and solutions can be found for the political  economic and social international problems and issues that States  at various levels  capabilities and capacities  are no longer able to solve unilaterally.Therefore we must work shoulder to shoulder. Governments and peoples together  in order to strengthen and uphold this important international institution as an imperative necessitated by the living conditions of the modern international community in order to enable the United Nations to be more capable of meeting the requirements of the future and of building a better world for coming generations  especially as we stand at the threshold of the twenty-first century  with its promise of immense scientific progress and advanced technologies in all fields.Issues of disarmament and arms control occupy a prominent position on the list of the international community's concerns. One can only hope that concrete achievements at the international level will be an incentive for all to join in the efforts being exerted in that field.Consistent with the principle of the maintenance of international peace and security enshrined in the Charter  and without conviction that it is imperative to create a less-heavily armed and more secure world  I take pleasure in announcing from this rostrum today that the Government of the State of Bahrain has decided to accede to the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the 1925 Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating  Poisonous or Other Gases  and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare and to the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxic Weapons and their Destruction. Ever since it achieved its independence Bahrain has called upon all nations of the world to pursue balanced policies in their relations with one another  to resort to dialogue for settling disputes through the diplomacy of understanding and the renunciation of the use of force in order to promote the principles of peace based on justice.  Peace is the strategic front-line of Bahrain's foreign policy. It is also the true key to realizing national aspirations and objectives in conditions of stability and development. The peace in which Bahrain believes is equitable peace fostering relations of friendship and understanding among the world's States and peoples  based on good-neighbourliness  non-interference in the internal affairs of others  equal sovereignty and rights  and respect for the rules of international law. This has been enunciated clearly by His Highness Sheikh Isa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa  of the State of Bahrain.The State of Bahrain bases its relations with other States in the world on equality and mutual respect. Proceeding from our firm belief that peace and security are the foundations on which mankind builds its progress  we shall always endeavour to strengthen them and respond sincerely to anyone who supports international legality and aims to strengthen the underpinnings of truth  justice and peace in the world.""In conformity with that firm  clear line for Bahrain's foreign policy  the State of Bahrain expresses once again its readiness to co-operate with the other countries of the world to achieve the lofty goals of the United Nations  and it stresses its commitment to the diplomacy of peace in line with the principles enshrined in the Charter of our Organisation."
"16",752,"BHS",43,1988,"ï»¿I warmly congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. I am confident that his vast experience and reputation will ensure that our work at this session is greatly facilitated and enhanced.The Secretary-General has been an untiring champion of peace. I wish to common him highly for the tremendous strides made in the past year in his efforts to resolve the problems of long-standing areas of conflict.Much has transpired since I last addressed the Assembly that gives cause for optimism. It may be that a glorious era of peace is about to bless the generations of our time. The super-Powers have reached accord on the elimination of a whole class of nuclear weapons. The international common is on the verge of negotiated settlements affecting Afghanistan and the Iran-Iraq war. Within the grasp of the United Nations is the potential for the resolution of other intractable problems of the decade  which include those of Kampuchea  Cyprus and Namibia. It is encouraging also to hear that southern Africa may have set its schedule for peace. A new international convention against narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances is near completion. All of this indicates vitality and purpose and makes it imperative that Member States renew their commitment to the United Nations and to multilateralism.Further  the soldiers who are deployed around the world in the United Nations peace-keeping force  ensuring armistice and reinforcing the peace structure  ate to be warmly congratulated on the recognition they have received by winning the Nobel Peace Prize. The Secretary-General is to be thanked and commended for his great efforts  and the United Nations may feel justly proud of this achievement.The question of arms limitation and disarmament is timely today and will be much discussed in the foreseeable future. May I point out three examples that show the process of multilateralism at work. First  at the 1988 session of the Disarmament Commission  last May  the Commission was able to make specific consensus recommendations on two of its eight substantive items: verification and guidelines for confidence-building measures. Secondly  later in May the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  meeting at Havana  Cuba  continued the process by adopting a consensus appeal to the two major Powers to reach agreement on disarmament. Thirdly  although a consensus text could not be produced at the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  last June  a spirit of co-operation governed the deliberations of the working groups. That success in arms limitation and disarmament holds the key to reducing military confrontations and minimizing the danger of nuclear war cannot be denied. This fact has provided the impetus for the role that the Bahamas played in the negotiations at those several meetings and as Chairman of the Disarmament Commission.Today  the confidence of the Bahamas in the United Nations is as strong as it was the day we joined the Organization in 1973  and our commitment to the United Nations has not faltered and will not falter. Indeed  we hope to translate this commitment into specific action by serving on the Economic and Social Council and the Committee for Programme and Co-ordination  for which out candidature is known  and on the Security Council  for which we will be a candidate during the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. This action will be reinforced by the experience of more than 15 sovereign years of stability  moderation and prosperity  a record unmatched by any State of similar size and natural resources.The recent momentum in solving some of the globe's most pressing problems has served to underscore inconsistencies that may challenge the solution of others. The AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) epidemic has escalated to alarming proportions  while unabated drug abuse and addiction defy the powerful and baffle the weak. Internal and regional conflicts have been experienced on every continent  resulting in catastrophic casualties. Natural and created disasters have taken their crippling toll. It could be salutary were the diplomacy and enthusiasm brought to solving problems between the super-Powers in military matters to be applied and paralleled  with similar understanding  to these other problems  which are just as important to the survival of mankind.Over a year ago there was much cause for optimism when the countries of Central America signed the peace accord. The Bahamas is convinced that Esquipulas II remains the most effective mechanism for achieving lasting peace in Central America. We join the international chorus in calling upon all parties to continue to search for peace  and challenge all States to support their efforts  encouraging but not pressuring them as they seek to find their own paths to lasting peace.In our region  Bahamas wishes to encourage the parties to territorial disputes to continue to work towards a negotiated settlement. In welcoming the new initiatives  the Bahamas reiterates its support for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize and Guyana.As the international common confirms its commitment to democracy and human rights. South Africa remains the bastion of racism and apartheid. The racist policy has as its foundations discrimination  denationalisation and the brutal repression of the black majority.The rising tide of black resistance to apartheid is evidence that the black majority is undaunted by the brutal and savage repression of frequent and lengthy states of emergency such as the present one. Democracy  racial desegregation  social justice and the abolition of apartheid are now considered by many to be indispensable life-and-death issues.Economic pressures have forced South Africa to offer the black majority only trivial concessions thus far. What is required is a range of economic sanctions that are sufficiently costly to compel South Africa to initiate the process of dialogue with representatives of the African National Congress and other legitimate organizations of the black population with a view to establishing a non-racial democratic Government. The sovereign States neighbours of South Africa ought to be protected from incursions and bombing by the South African military  which murder innocent civilians and wreak havoc on their societies and economies.The Bahamas continues to encourage the United Nations and all Mender States  especially these with significant economic relations with South Africa  to implement effective economic sanctions in an effort to abolish apartheid  for its part  the Bahamas will continue to lend full support to all efforts leading to the eventual dismantling of apartheid.In the midst of international despair regarding the apartheid regime of South Africa there is a glimmer of hope. Recent developments in Namibia increase our optimism that Namibia may at last achieve its independence. We encourage all concerned to continue to strive for the achievement of that noble objective at the earliest date possible. The cease-fire is most welcome in the war between Iran and Iraq which has for eight years threatened international peace and security. The Bahamas was therefore pleased to note the recent developments which may at last lead to peace in that region. It is our fervent hope that all parties to the dispute will continue to search for a negotiated settlement in accordance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987) which would end the war and the attendant loss of life and destruction of property. The Bahamas wishes to record its appreciation for the mediation efforts of our Secretary-General and hopes that all States will lend him their full co-operation and support.The Bahamas has always supported Israel's right to exist. The Bahamas also strongly supports the right of peoples to self-determination. Self-determination should be guaranteed to the Palestinian people. The Bahamas therefore supports the convening of the international peace conference on the Middle East  with all the parties to the conflict being represented. Although the Palestinian issue is complex  we are satisfied that until it is resolved the chances of peace may be remote.Narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances remain a burning issue for our region and for the entire international community. The threat that drug abuse and drug trafficking pose to the security  stability and socio-economic viability of many States continues to elicit an unprecedented multilateral response. With the necessary political and diplomatic will  a plenipotentiary conference could adopt a new convention against the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances later this year. last year more than 130 States represented at the International Conference against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking  convened on the initiative of the Secretary-General  unanimously declared drug control to be the collective responsibility of all States. The United Nations efforts for drug control are paralleled by standing bodies in virtually all regions of the world. In our own Latin American and Caribbean region  the Inter-American Drug Control Commission has taken up the challenge to co-ordinate a comprehensive hemispheric response to the phenomenal illicit prediction  traffic and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances in the Americas. The activities of the Caribbean Community (CARIOOM) accurately reflect the critical concern of Member States in reducing the vulnerability of the region to the illicit transit traffic in narcotic drugs. CARIOOM's initiatives are substantially focused on protecting the people of the subregion from the scourge.Also of concern to the Bahamas are the increasing interventionist attitudes  pronouncements and measures adopted in the region  which arise from the war on drugs. Although regional Governments agree on a common vigorous course of action against the drug trade  overzealous and unilateral measures are nevertheless taken which threaten the stability of co-operative Governments themselves. The pursuit of such attitudes  pronouncements and measures is a blatant abuse and is not in the interest of peace and security in the region and particularly of small States such as the Bahamas  which ensure vulnerable because of their geographical locations.The antidote for such interventionism is the strengthening of multilateral co-operation. Small States  such as the Bahamas  with a stable economy  low inflation level  balanced budget and one of the highest per capita income in its region  must rely on the multilateral approach which this world Organization alone affords. The progress made toward solving some of the world's most serious problems are indicative of what can be achieved if more support for and less bashing of the United Nations is encouraged. The Bahamas takes positive note of and applauds recent decisions to deal with the troubling question of arrears in contributions. The Bahamas is heartened by the fact that  after months of discussion about Africa  crushing debt burden  the major Western creditor countries have finally agreed to ease the plight of the world's most indebted nations. At their summit conference in Toronto on 19 to 21 June the leaders of the leading Western industrial States - the Group of Seven - agreed in principle to a set of options to alleviate the debt-servicing burden. That breakthrough may be considered the result of pressure which the February report of the Secretary-General's Advisory Group on Financial Flows to Africa brought to bear upon the creditor nations.Equally encouraging is the fact that preparations are in the final stage for an in-depth review of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990  just two years after its adoption by the General Assembly  in June 1986. The review will focus on the economic policy changes undertaken by African Governments and will also spotlight the role of the international common and the United Nations in supporting Africa's recovery and development efforts.Before closing  I should like to join with those of my colleagues who have expressed caring concern over the human suffering  loss of life and serious damage to property caused by natural disasters in our fellow Member States of Bangladesh  Jamaica and Mexico. Bahamas is encouraged by the wide expressions of sympathy by  and commitments of support received from  the  international common. We are hopeful that the support of the international community will assist those Member States in the immense task of their reconstruction.I conclude by referring to a view which I quoted from a leading national journal of a Member State some years ago. It said: ""... the sad  even bitter  truth is that the United Nations is no longer in the mainstream of world politics"". At the time I stated my opposition to that statement. Years later the United Nations has undeniably vindicated itself.We owe it to present and future generations to establish a legacy of peace and security which can be realized only through an effective United Nations."
"17",824,"BLR",43,1988,"ï»¿The Byelorussian delegation congratulates the Foreign Minister of Argentina Mr. Dante Caputo  on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly and wishes him success in his work. We also wish to pay a tribute to the President of the last session  Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic  and the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the work done in the past 12 months.Today's international situation  the global processes under way in the world and their qualitatively new nature  prompt us to consider what the course of action should be today and in the years to come for this universal  world forum  whose primary objective is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. In view of the scope and character of contemporary international problems  it is necessary to consider to what extent the older  traditional methods are applicable in resolving those problems. Clearly  the strain of day-to-day affairs should not force the General Assembly to lose sight of this serious problem  the Assembly being  which in a sense  the collective mind of international politics. Movement without a clear-cut perspective is  at best  like the Brownian movement - chaotic  leading nowhere  and at worst leading directly to complications or even catastrophe  not only in military terms but also in the social  economic  ecological and other spheres.To set the correct course  a navigator must know where his ship is and how and where to steer it. Looking back at the distance covered  and at the role the United Nations has played in the world  we realize the complexity of the Organization's development  which has gone through various stages; it has had its ups and downs and has overcome numerous crises. Yet we are confident that those were the difficulties of growth  rather than a decline  as claimed by those who do not believe in the potential and effectiveness of the United Nations. On the whole  those were the formative years of the United Nations  a period for promulgating its purposes and principles. Today  despite existing problems  the United Nations seems to be reaching the age of maturity  a process fuelled both by the internal logic of its development and  more important  by the urgent challenges of the day.The world has become far too complex  multipolar and interdependent for nations to be in a position individually or in small groups to achieve the goals set by our time. Today  policies of restricted alliances can no longer ensure real security. What is needed is a global alliance and joint  concerted efforts. To achieve that  we require global multilateralism  which alone has the potential to measure up to the goal of a really secure world  a world secure for all  not just for some. The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization states that ""Multilateralism has proved itself far more capable of inspiring confidence and achieving results than any of its alternatives"". (A/43/1  p. 2)In our view  multilateralism is more than a system of international organizations. It is an approach  a concept  a method. In the final analysis  it is a regime of international politics whose pillars are universal priorities and joint endeavours. The current paradigm of international relations inherited from the past and based on the primacy of the narrowly interpreted interests of a given State has come to the end of its usefulness  just as in the past the theory of the sun rotating around the Earth was shown to be inadequate by Newtonian physics. This is clearly demonstrated by numerous threats to the existence of mankind  ranging from the nuclear threat to the ecological menace and acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS)  which mankind cannot overcome through isolated efforts.A new paradigm of international politics is needed; in fact  such a paradigm exists. It is Ð³ policy stemming from the priority of universal interests  the comprehensive nature of security  the primacy of international law and  consequently  an agreed multilateral approach. Taking a multilateral approach is not idealism. On the contrary  it is pragmatism  since it increases many times over the capacity of nations to cope with major international problems and  first and foremost  to ensure security.This is amply proved by recent positive changes with respect to disarmament  the solution of a number of conflict situations and the establishment of co-operation between States. All these changes were made possible by the use of procedures and methods of multilateral diplomacy  including efforts made by and through the United Nations.History and experience unfortunately show that the parties to a conflict often arrive at a reasonable solution only when all other options have been exhausted and their forces depleted. But is it always necessary to let problems reach such extremes and drain the parties' forces before a mutually beneficial solution is reached? Multilateralism can help avoid that.Individually  nations are prone to giving short-term responses to long-term problems. Here too multilateralism has advantages. It provides for a more reasonable  balanced and prudent strategy. International political must be given an important new dimensions insight into the future. While traditional foreign policies are more often geared to reacting to specific emerging situations  multilateralism has the advantage of permitting greater foresight and preparation  which can make it possible to prevent the unfavourable development of a given situation.Finally  multilateralism is far more in keeping with the principles of equality  and it restrains extremists from improper actions. It substitutes mutual influence and the primacy of common interests for unilateral domineering. In the final analysis  this is beneficial for all sides. That has been extensively demonstrated in the general debate that is to close today.An individual human being is too weak and his voice  as the poet put it  is ""thinner than the buzzing of a mosquito"". Had he not learned to pool his efforts with those of others  he would have remained an unprotected  frightened creature in the immense wilderness of nature or might even have disappeared as a species unable to meet the challenges of the elements. But joint creative efforts have made him master of the planet. Today we have to learn anew to pool our efforts and overcome disunity  this time at the level of peoples and States. This might not be easy  but it is necessary.The international community has experience here  and it is positive experience. In this context  I would refer to existing agreements and conventions on curbing the arms race  as well as international co-operation in the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)  relief aid in cases of natural disaster  certain development programmes and recent very important examples concerning procedures for a political settlement of situations around Afghanistan and Kampuchea  the Iran-Iraq war  and certain aspects of the situation in southern Africa  Cyprus and Western Sahara.It has been correctly emphasized during the general debate that the policy of national reconciliation and the achievement of the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan have become a model for the political settlement of other crisis situations. Those agreements were reached through the mediation and with the assistance of the United Nations. It is our common duty to ensure that all contracting parties without exception comply with the balance of commitments contained in the Accords.The peoples of the world have enormous potential good will for peace and co-operation. A major task of the United Nations is to encourage its realization in appropriate forms. It is obvious that in order to ensure the success of multilateral endeavours all nations should give up policies of force  diktat and interference in the internal affairs of other countries and peoples  and should abandon obsolete stereotypes of thinking based on suspicion  enmity and the pursuit of domination.The sphere in which multilateralism is applicable is boundless. The multilateral approach is needed above all to respond to the most urgent global challenges in the military  political  economic  social  humanitarian and ecological areas.What is the effective way to resolve the problem of preventing war  ending the arms race and making a resolute move towards disarmament  first and foremost nuclear disarmament? The fact is that efforts to that end have been made regularly for several decades now. But over the same period the seriousness of the problem has tended to increase rather than decrease. Therefore  being realists  we have to adroit that the challenge cannot be met by traditional  established  conservative ways of thinking and by military and strategic approaches. Indeed  can the international community  facing the exotic and extremely destructive types of weapons of the late twentieth century  afford to follow the nineteenth century way of thinking? Does it have the right to do so? Can the community of States continue to live with the fact that the development of technology is outpacing the development of political and strategic thought? No  it cannot.What is needed is a new  realistic approach based on an understanding of the special realities of the human predicament resulting from the emergence and accumulation of nuclear weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction. The Soviet-United States Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - is the first and  for that reason  all the more significant sprout of that understanding. However  one sprout does not make a good harvest. In order to ensure security and make the process of disarmament irrevocable  it is necessary to move seriously and radically to further goals - namely  a 50 per cent reduction in the strategic offensive weapons of the Soviet Union and the United States  while strictly complying with the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Systems  as signed in 1972  and not withdrawing from it for a specified period of time; a comprehensive nuclear-weapon-test ban; the elimination of chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction on a global scale the prevention of the development of new and ever-more-destructive weapons and  in the long run  complete and general nuclear disarmament} a radical reduction of conventional weapons} and the use of outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes. It is clear that palliative measures will at best produce palliative security. That is not enough for the peoples of the world. However  the development of more far-reaching measures in this area is blocked by the continued commitment of some nuclear States to a speculative paradox which holds that life is guaranteed by nuclear-death stockpiles. Life on this blue planet of the solar system may well be the price we shall have to pay for taking so much time to test that paradox. Experimenting on mankind in that way is inadmissible - all the more because the experiment is being conducted against the will of mankind. As one apt expression has It  one day we will have total and complete nuclear disarmament - with or without people - resulting from the use of nuclear arms in a war. Let us work together to ensure that total and complete nuclear disarmament will be the result of the peaceful dismantling of nuclear arms for the sake of guaranteeing the security of mankind.The Soviet Union has already stated its readiness to renounce the status of nuclear Power in the interest of the whole of mankind. The abandonment of old stereotypes could provide other nuclear Powers with an opportunity to take that worthy position.The new thinking also suggests a fundamental way to ensure security in the field of conventional weapons and armed forces Î¹ to eliminate imbalances and asymmetries and to achieve equal  radically reduced levels and a strictly defensive structure for the armed forces. The question of what a defensive structure and a purely defensive nature of military doctrines are can and should be addressed at a multilateral level - for instance  involving to that end the Security Council and its Military Staff Committee the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic actively supports that approach. There is also a vast potential in the idea of establishing a multilateral military-risk-reduction centre  as proposed by the Secretary-General  as well as in the Soviet Union's initiative for setting up a European centre for reducing the risk of war and preventing surprise attack. One has mixed feelings about the evolution of events over the past 12 months in the area of approaches to disarmament. On the one hand  there have been uncontested achievements  including those in the multilateral area - the INF Treaty  the progress in the work to ban chemical weapons  the movement in the area of confidence-building  openness  verification  the relationship between disarmament and development - and  on the other hand  there is the failure to reach agreement on a final document of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament However  the spirit of that special session  the great wealth of new ideas  proposals and approaches that countries brought to the special session and have brought to the current session  their readiness to establish mutual understanding and to co-operate  are all encouraging signs. We are confident that quantity will inevitably result in new quality - the new quality of multilateralism  when the position of one State would no long block the realization of the will of all other countries.The United Nations is capable of scoring serious successes also in the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts. The United Nations Charter and resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly contain both the conceptual and the structural basis for a multilateral and constructive approach. That is another approach that offers vast possibilities. The recent achievements by the United Nations in this field are encouraging and should stimulate the international community to be creative and bold and to take active  concerted measures in the Middle East  Central America  southern Africa  the Korean peninsula and other conflict areas.As is well known  the United Nations peace-keeping forces have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. However  are the potential and the capacity of the institution of military observers being used to a full extent? In our opinion United Nations observation posts could be set up in potentially explosive areas  military observers could be placed along borders where countries are trying to protect themselves from outside interference} special fact-finding missions could be sent out  on the decision of the Security Council  to investigate situations connected with mutual accusations  to study ways of settling such situations and to monitor the termination of any foreign military presence in foreign territories.Just as a really good doctor not only treats but also prevents disease  the United Nations operations could be used not only for settling conflicts but also for preventive purposes  in order to defuse emerging military confrontations. The future lies with preventive diplomacy. We should also discuss the question of United Nations naval operations  in the first place to ensure safe navigation in international waters  as well as the idea of setting up a United Nations military observer and armed forces reserve.Comprehensive security requires a comprehensive approach. There is a growing awareness that if the peoples of some regions and even entire continents are left  deliberately or unwittingly  to be exploited and to lead a miserable existence  mankind runs the risk of setting off an explosion no less destructive than a military confrontation. Let us view the question of war and peace from another angle; In the wars of recent years  people have died and the resources of developing countries  so badly needed for their economic development and social progress  have been increasingly diverted. Therefore  to make the world a safer place  steps in the military and political spheres alone are not enough: what is also needed is a different - that is  a more just and mutually beneficial - economic order under which co-operation and assistance would serve mutual progress rather than the enslavement of some countries. It is necessary to help combat underdevelopment  manage the external-debt problem and promote the genuine stability of the world economy and co-operation. Implementing the basic principle or disarmament for development should become a major element of this approach. This can and should unite humanity and promote the emergence of universal consciousness. The United Nations must move to take action on these issues.The concept of internationalism permeates the Charter. The significance of the values it sets forth - peace  security  justice  freedom  human rights  equality and co-operation - will grow as the world becomes more interdependent.Ensuring in practice the freedom of the peoples to choose their ways of development  putting an end to continued attempts to destabilize legitimate Governments and to impose a social and political system from outside means meaningfully consolidating the foundation of security in the world. Providing all with truly peaceful conditions of life and just conditions of economic development with jobs for the unemployed  bread for the hungry  shelter for the homeless  knowledge for the illiterate  rights for the deprived  satisfying the basic needs of hundreds of millions of people who still live below the level of human decency  pursuing everywhere the practical and full implementation of international human rights instruments  eliminating international terrorism and drug trafficking all mean enriching the content of security and creating realistic conditions for the world community to be able to focus fully on the lofty spiritual requirements of man and on reversing the dangerous and rapid depletion of the balance  purity and beauty of the environment.Incidentally  ecology is the most vivid example  on the one hand  of the unique role and possibilities of multilateralism and  on the other hand  of the impotence of purely egotistical and narrow national approaches. Let us learn in this area as well how to work jointly on problems that do not lend themselves to unilateral solutions. The symbiosis of States with different interests  of systems with different social and political structures and  finally  the symbiosis of man and nature presupposes  to be successful  compliance with certain principles and rules of behaviour. Acting on this premise we favour serious efforts to assure the real primacy of law in all areas of international relations under the motto  ""Security  confidence and co-operation through law"". Obviously such efforts must include both the necessary rule-making and the mechanism needed to ensure strict implementation of the rules adopted. It is important to seek a common understanding of them so that when agreeing on the rule we do not sow the seeds of future discord because of differences regarding its interpretation.Undoubtedly the development  testing and fine-tuning of a complex multilateral mechanism cannot be done overnight. It is a long-term objective  requiring effort  patience and understanding of the balance of interests. However  we must begin moving in the required direction now  focusing on those measures that are ripe and can produce realistic results.We should try to consolidate in the United Nations a spirit of true multilateralism in the profound sense of the word. In particular it is appropriate to intensify the search for consensus decisions  and what counts here is not formal but effective consensus  what matters is consensus on the substance and not only in procedure. We need to think jointly about how to improve the procedures and the working methods of the General Assembly and its bodies  we need to consider the method of convening special sessions  rational and economic spending of available financial resources. The Security Council stands to gain greatly from the interaction of its permanent members and the elaboration of mutual commitments in the spirit of restraint and respect for the freedom of choice of the peoples  and the exclusion of great-Power involvement in regional conflicts. Its effectiveness would be enhanced by periodic meetings at the level of foreign ministers and by holding sessions in conflict areas away from Headquarters.It would be very useful from every point of view if the permanent members of the Security Council and other States would accept the binding jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice on a mutually agreed basis.A greater role for the Secretary-General in the settlement of conflicts and their prevention would also be in the interest of all. The potential of that role has recently been convincingly demonstrated by Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar and his staff. The Secretary-General could take initiatives in the Security Council  suggest measures he considers appropriate and submit reports to the Council on questions deserving attention. Investing the Secretary-General with functions of monitoring compliance with United Nations decisions  in particular in the disarmament area  could become an important responsibility for the Secretary-General.The Byelorussian SSR shares the position of the socialist community that has been expressed during the general debate on the range of issues under discussion in the General Assembly and today has especially addressed the problem of developing and strengthening a multilateral approach to solutions to international problems  the analysis of its advantages and some concrete proposals in this respect. In so doing  we are profoundly convinced that multilateralism  as a system for dealing with international issues  constitutes a basic instrument for constructing a truly comprehensive approach to the issues of international peace and security. What we need are joint efforts of all States in all areas. There can be no customers or contractors in such construction work; there can only be equal shareholders. The contribution of each is readiness for honest co-operation in the interest of the common cause. The dividend for each is solid security  freedom  equality and prosperity.	Â·Throughout its history the Byelorussian SSR has pursued these noble goals. Seven decades of hard work and struggle - this landmark will be celebrated by the Republic and the Communist Party of Byelorussia on 1 January 1989 - and the fundamental restructuring of our society on a socialist basis have enabled the Byelorussian people not only to ensure continuous economic and social progress  but also to make an acknowledged contribution to efforts to reach those goals at the international level. At the present new stage of the development of international relations the Byelorussian SSR is ready for further fruitful co-operation in building a world free of war or weapons  a world of co-operation and prosperity.

"18",859,"BLZ",43,1988,"ï»¿I bring greetings from the people and Government of Belize. I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina on his election to the high post of President of the General Assembly. I am confident that he brings with him the expertise and energy for which he is well known and I wish him a most successful presidency  of which he and his great State  Argentina  may be proud.It would  however  be remiss of me to fail to recognize the great contribution to the process of the presidency made by my colleague and friend  Dame Nita Barrow of Barbados  and to wish her too  success in her continuing illustrious career.It is my sad duty to inform the Assembly that the Foreign Minister of Belize  Mr. Dean Barrow  is unable to take his place at this rostrum owing to serious illness in his family. Only something of such critical importance could keep him away. He sends his greetings to all his colleagues  with the following message: ""The forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly has opened in an atmosphere of almost unbridled optimism. Since last we met favourable developments in international relations have occurred with a speed that has confounded the naysayers  He have been witness to the de-escalation of several of the consuming conflicts that earlier blighted the global agenda. And we have even seen the possible beginning of the end of the madness that is nuclear stockpiling.""We may be forgiven  then  if our speeches at times depart from the usual sententious rhetoric to strike an occasional high note of celebration. For we are enjoying a victory of sorts  and that victory is nothing less than the triumph of multilateralism  the revalidation of the United Nations system  and the vindication in the contemporary era of the historical vision of our founding fathers.I think it is particularly fitting that the assignment of superintending this exciting excursion into new avenues of international collaboration  should fall on the capable shoulders of one of Latin America's sons - a son of Argentina. I congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to this high office  confident that your authority and capacity are nonpareil. My delegation wishes you well as you embark on a difficult but rewarding task. The burden of your duties will surely be eased appreciably by the fact that another eminent son of Latin America  in the person of our esteemed Secretary-General  Javier Perez de Cuellar  will be at your side.""The Secretary-General has now seen much of what he has striven for become reality. I congratulate him on his patience  his persistence and his success.""Often the sacrifices and hard work of Under-Secretaries-General go unremarked in the bureaucratic profusion that is the United Nations. My delegation seeks the Assembly's indulgence to record our appreciation of the Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and his staff. They efficiently serviced the last General Assembly and its resumed sessions  as well as the third special session on disarmament.""That there has been a significant reduction in regional and international tensions over the past year is undoubted. Greater communication has been established between the super-Powers  the global community is resting a little easier  and the dream of universal peace has taken new wing. Much of the credit for this breakthrough can be claimed by the Organization. Burdened by notions of their national interests and misguided by the concept of bipolarity  the United States and the Soviet Union would not have reached their current degree of rapprochement without the atmosphere created by the United Nations. It is as much to the appeals and pressure of peace-loving Member States as to their own enlightenment that the super-Powers owe the present  unprecedented level of detente.""My Government congratulates the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the positive first step they have taken to reduce the balance of terror. By agreeing to the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - they have signalled some small acknowledgement of the cry of the world community  which rejects being held hostage to the possibility of nuclear annihilation.""At the same time  the point has been fairly made that  if the super-Powers had the capacity to destroy the world 50 times over  the achievement of a Treaty that merely cuts that ability in half  so that they are now able to destroy the world only 25 times over  is more symbolic than real. We therefore encourage the super-Powers to continue their dialogue recognizing their responsibility not to let an illusion of peace replace the reality of peace. Our world will be a better place if the strongest among us find ways to co-operate with each other and accept that their best security lies not in the quantity of their arms but in the quality of their trust.Both their peoples and our peoples would benefit from the reduction of the stupendous military budgets  with some of the savings being designated for the poorest and most infirm among us.""Most countries  and particularly those in our region  Latin America and the Caribbean  have coins to realize that the problems of peace and development are indissoluble linked  since without peace there can be no development and without development peace will always be precarious.""My Government congratulates our neighbouring Central American republics on the path to peace and development they have undertaken with the signing of the Esquipulas II agreement. We note  though  that the road has not been a straight one. There seems to have been a sapping of the political will that led to the regional agreement. Stasis has set in and there may even have been some slippage. â therefore urge Central America to recover the energy that will allow it to find a lasting and indigenous solution to a complex problem. At the same time we call on external interests to refrain from further jeopardizing the prospects of peace by attempting to transform essentially local difficulties into dimensions of East-West rivalry. We urge all Member States of the United Nations to abide by the Charter principles  most particularly the principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of States. A scrupulous regard for these norms of international behaviour will ensure the continuation of the regional process leading to peace  social betterment  economic development and security.""For its part the Government of Belize supports the right of all States including the Republics of Panama and Nicaragua  to choose their own leaders and to fashion their own political  social and economic systems free from threats or pressures. This is one small way in which we think we can contribute to the process of regional respect and reconciliation.""Another contribution to peace in Central America is Belize's often-stated willingness to remove itself from the agenda of conflict in the region. In this effort we reiterate our appreciation to Member States for their continued support for Belize's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. Their interest and active Participation in promoting the rights of the Belizean people continue to be a source of strength to us.""It is a measure of the maturity of that country that the civilian administration of the Republic of Guatemala has agreed to join with us in a search for a solution to the difficulties that have prevented our two States from the full enjoyment of normal relations as independent neighbours.""My Government is pleased to report that some progress has been made during the past few months  permanent Joint Commission comprising representatives of Belize and the Republic of Guatemala  with the additional participation of representatives of the United Kingdom  has been established. This Commission is charged with the preparation of a comprehensive draft of a treaty designed to resolve definitively the situation between Belize and Guatemala. ""All sides have embarked on this exercise in good faith  in an effort to arrive at a just and honourable solution acceptable to all the interested parties. Since people-participation is a fundamental pillar of Belize's democracy  whatever treaty is produced must be endorsed by the Belizean people in a general referendum before it can be considered to have been accepted.""Our country maintains warm and friendly relations with all our neighbours in Central America  and our people would welcome a formula that would enable Belize and Guatemala not only to coexist in geographic contiguity but also to co-operate in human harmony. ""We continue to confront the challenges inherent in our reality as a Caribbean state on the Central American region and we are encouraged by the recognition by the United Nations system that Belize is possessed of a dual heritage that entitles it to maintain both its Caribbean and its Central American identity.	""It was therefore with a sense of special status that Belize took part in the dialogue of Latin America and Caribbean Foreign Ministers initiated by the Latin American Economic System and held in Caracas in September. We fully endorse the conclusions from the dialogue and propose to participate actively in further efforts to strengthen Latin American and Caribbean unity.	""Our region  in common with most of the developing world  continues to face a serious economic crisis that takes its toll of the quality of life of our peoples  creating conditions ripe for the political instability and social tensions that are anathema ix the consolidation of democracy.""The persisting external imbalances that characterize the international economy at present give rise to the inevitability of chronic diminishing returns for primary producing and debtor countries  however valiant their efforts at greater production and timely debt servicing. We note that although real growth in the seven major industrial countries averaged 3 1 per cent in the year just past as against 28 per cent in 1986  the pattern of performance in developing countries was different. The rate of output growth in developing countries as a group was in fact one percentage point below the 1986 level. ""For many developing countries the debt problem remained a critical issue. The need to remain current on debt-service payments and thus retain some level of creditworthiness was reflected in restrictive fiscal and monetary policies that served to limit growth rates. Faced with the need to improve external accounts  indebted countries have had to increase savings relative to investment or reduce investment relative to savings  in both cases impacting adversely on the capacity creation for future growth. Approaches to a solution to the debt problem have continued to focus on the case-by-case option  despite widespread recognition of the multilateral and interdependent nature of the situation. Efforts to relieve the debt burden arising from loans extended by commercial banks have been complicated by the increasingly hard line taken by bank regulators in relation to provision for inadequately performing loans. ""To create the conditions for the era of development that ought to accompany the onset of peace  hard decisions will be required to eliminate the main sources of imbalance between the larger industrialized countries on the one hand and between debtor developing countries and creditor developed countries on the other. Unless the heavily indebted developing countries can be assisted to grow out of their present situation  the likelihood of voluntary or involuntary suspension of debt servicing and consequential social and political instability will only increase  making nonsense of the notion of peace in our time. ""While not itself immune to the vicissitudes of the international economic situation Belize has recorded modest growth in real terms over the past year. We have managed to restructure our debt burden to service it more effectively. Flows of private and public investment have increased to facilitate infrastructural development and growth in the agriculture and tourism sectors. Under certain preferential arrangements there has been a favourable trading environment for our commodity exports  and an emphasis on diversification into other areas of activity has compensated somewhat for the fall in revenue resulting from the depressed prices on the international sugar market. In keeping with my Government's policy of providing the economic and social infrastructure to facilitate private-sector economic development and provide jobs for our people  we have embarked on a number of large development projects. These include rehabilitation and extension of the main runway and construction of a new terminal building at the international airport; expansion of power generation and distribution capacity in the electricity company  together with feasibility assessments for mini-hydro installations around the country; acquisition of international telephone services from a foreign company; construction of a new public hospital for the country; rehabilitation and expansion of the main highway network; provision of credits for private-sector projects; and a number of smaller projects and initiatives to improve the quality of life in general. ""Belize continues to rely on the performance of its people in the management and direction of the economy; but we also work for improvement with the assistance and support of international development and financial organizations as well as the assistance of a number of friendly countries. These include  but are not limited to  the United States  Canada  the United Kingdom and Mexico. ""We hope to expand the roster of our partners in development by demonstrating our capacity and our maturity in ordering our development priorities. At the same time  we consider it necessary to reject the tendency of some donor countries and international agencies to attempt to dictate the development process of recipient States. That practice has led to misplaced priorities in the social and economic programmes of several developing countries  priorities inconsistent with the basic human needs of our peoples. My delegation is of the view that donors need to adopt a degree of sensitivity to this situation. That would allow recipient countries to set their own agenda based on the reality of their individual experiences.""To allay the concerns of those who fear the spectre of misappropriation of aid money  mechanisms for proper co-ordination and accountability surely can be devised. A comprehensive needs assessment of the targeted sectors within the recipient countries ought to be made in consultation with the beneficiary country. To involve local authorities in the planning stage ensures that account is taken of the peculiarities of indigenous bureaucratic and co-ordinating machinery  and so guarantees implementation of projects for the benefit of the greatest number.""It is in that context that Belize welcomes the Initiative of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations Development Programme's plan for economic co-operation for Central America. Belize was originally excluded on the ground that it was not part of Historic Central America. But as the Haitian proverb puts it  'The pencil of God has no eraser. And we are happy about Belize's belated inclusion in the plan  thereby reconciling the notion of Historic Central America with the simple fact of geography.""Belize has considered and submitted some project profiles aimed at assisting us to redress the economic and social problems occurring as a consequence of the influx of refugees from situations of conflict in the region. These projects respond to real needs and are intended to assist in the machinery of relocation as well as to benefit the Individual refugees and the communities in which they have been integrated. ""We stand ready to work with the agencies concerned to make sure that the projects are carried put to the optimum benefit of the target group. At the same time  we join in the appeal to potential donors that have not yet done so to commit the necessary reserves to make this humanitarian initiative an early reality.	My Government joins in the commendation already expressed to the Soviet Union on its decision to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan. We urge the Soviet Union to let nothing deter it from this decision  nor to delay its fulfilment.""The people of Afghanistan have suffered long enough and their development has been significantly retarded by the presence of foreign troops on their soil. Our hope is that the absence of those troops will create the climate for the return to a genuinely independent and non-aligned Afghanistan under a leadership responsive to the will of the people of that troubled land. We welcome the appointment of a co-ordinator for United Nations humanitarian and economic assistance relating to Afghanistan  and support the people of that country as they embark on the process of reconstruction. I should also like to express my appreciation  and that of my Government  to the Government and people of Pakistan for the constructive role they have assumed during this crisis. Pakistan has served as host to more than 2 million refugees from Afghanistan  at great cost to its own people and resources. It is our hope that they too can now begin the rebuilding process in their own country.""In the present global atmosphere of reconciliation and good will  there still remain areas where peace has been elusive. One such area is Kampuchea. The occupation of Kampuchea by Vietnamese troops is a violation of the United Nations Charter and the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement. Ðs well it adds to the economic and personnel burden of Viet Kara itself. This era of conciliation offers Viet Nam a unique opportunity to reflect on its own struggle for independence  which won the support and admiration of the majority of the world's people. To re-establish that spirit of solidarity among the community of nations  Viet Nam is engaged to subscribe to a political settlement based on the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and internationally supervised free elections.""We are encouraged by the decision of the protagonists in the Gulf war to agree on a cease-fire under the auspices of the Security Council. The time has passed for determining which side has won or which should win this senseless confrontation. The havoc and destruction visited on both sides  as well as on innocent non-combatants  have been monumental. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) affords the most viable framework for achieving a just and Lasting settlement. We are confident of the ability of the Secretary-General to act as a reliable interlocutor  and we appeal to those who have carved for themselves a special role in this affair to do all that is possible to ensure success in the negotiations and a return to normalcy and development in both Iran and Iraq.""The situation in the Middle East continues to be volatile. My government was encouraged earlier this year when it appeared that an agreement might be reached on an international peace conference on the Middle East. We would support the early convening of such a conference. Our policy remains committed to the right of Israel to exist within secure borders - but not at the expense of a Palestinian homeland. For these difficult issues to be settled and for peace to return to the Middle East  dialogue between Israel and the Arab States is essential. ""While athletes from the four corners of the globe convened in Seoul to compete in friendly rivalry for the gold  silver and bronze in the games of the XXIV Olympiad  South Korea's leadership made a great leap forward toward fulfilling the dream of a unified Korea. He welcome and are encouraged by the declaration of President Roh Tae Woo that his Government is willing to end the situation of confrontation between the two Koreas and to establish relations with North Koreas based on a spirit of co-operation. This fundamental change of attitude will go a long way towards defusing tensions north and south of the thirty-eighth parallel and towards re-establishing hope for reunification of the two Koreas.""We are heartened by the progress made in the negotiations regarding the 13-year-long conflict in Angola. It is our hope that as the South African and Cuban troops make their way home  the issue of linkage will finally be laid to rest and the way opened for Namibia to proceed at last to its independence.""The intransigence of minority white South Africa in refusing to share power with majority black South Africa makes a bloodbath in that country inevitable. We regret that certain members of the international community are unwilling or unable to join in mandatory sanctions against that terrorist State. And in the name of our suffering brothers and sisters we appeal for an end to this mollycoddling of the Pretoria regime. ""A few months ago we celebrated Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday. Mandela is a statesman as well as a freedom fighter  but in South Africa he has remained imprisoned like a common criminal. The continued incarceration of Nelson Mandela  as well as the proscription of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC)  is testimony to the barbarous lack of foresight on the part of the apartheid regime. It might not be too late to demonstrate some semblance of good sense by a decision now to release  unconditionally Nelson Mandela and the other political prisoners. Such a gesture would facilitate dialogue between the Botha regime and the leaders of the black community  and would perhaps spare the continent of Africa the South African version of Armageddon that will otherwise surely follow.""Members will recall that at previous sessions of the General Assembly my delegation dealt with the matter of the production  trafficking and consumption of dangerous drugs. The significant aggravation of the drug problem and its harmful effects on our societies urge immediate and concerted efforts to deal with it. For our part  Belize has adopted a multi-disciplinary course of action to prevent and reduce the illicit demand for narcotic drugs and Â¡psychotropic substances: to control their use and supply  to suppress illicit trafficking and to provide treatment and rehabilitation for drug abusers and their victims. This is the approach that was agreed upon by the United Nations Conference held in Vienna last year.""It has long been recognized that the drug problem spans borders economic circumstances and ideologies  threatening to create its own orthodoxy and its own peculiar moral and social imperatives. The war against drugs requires the co-operation of all nations  and we cannot lose sight of the fact that the basic motivation for drug production and trafficking stems from the readily available market and the phenomenal rewards offered by that market. Recognition of this by the largest consumer country has therefore been a welcome development.""Small Governments must continuously defend their political and economic independence and their territorial integrity. Of late  assaults on our sovereignty have included attempts to introduce industrial waste into our region. As industrial and toxic waste accumulates in the developed countries  our small States are offered the argument that somehow we can benefit from the dumping of industrial waste on our land and in our sea. This is a remarkable piece of insolence from those who are determined to protect their own environmental balance while offering blandishments to destroy ours. My Government emphatically rejects those overtures  and we call on the industries concerned to make their own arrangements in their own countries to dispose of the effluent of their prosperity.""No amount of economic benefit can compensate for the environmental devastation and human harm that will follow indiscriminate dumping of industrial waste. The quality of life we enjoy cannot be bartered for the quantity of promises we are offered.""We in Belize have more than once undergone the trials associated with killer hurricanes. We are therefore especially able to empathize with our sister country of Jamaica  with the Cayman Islands and with the State of Yucatan in Mexico. We join in the appeal for international assistance to help these areas recover from their savaging by hurricane Gilbert.""If I began this presentation in an upbeat manner  it is just as well to end on a note of caution. Although there have been real successes in the past year  the international agenda nevertheless remains crowded with conflicts. It would be a mistake  then  merely to give ourselves over to self-congratulation. What is needed rather is to press on with a new determination inspired by our recent progress. Â¡Such a determination should above all seek to preserve the gains made by the process of multilateralism and to extend them from the political arena to the sphere of economic relations.In urging on all Member States this renewed commitment to multilateralism  I am reminded of the tale of Oedipus. Members will recall how in ignorance he killed his father and married his mother. Queen Jocasta  and so became ruler of Thebes. In the meantime  the fates visited a plague on his subjects and tortured them with great pestilences. When Oedipus realized that he himself was the cause of the suffering  he put out his own eyes and wandered blind away from Thebes.""The Czech Ã©migrÃ© writer Milan Kundera uses this story to make the point that we cannot escape the consequences of our actions  even though those actions might have been unwitting.""How   one of the recurring themes of international  relations is that there is nothing more injurious to an effective world order than that the law of the jungle should prevail  that the strong should take advantage of the weak  that unilateral egocentricity should defeat collective responsibility.""If we were to reject the case for multilateralism  therefore  we would be deliberately ignoring the lessons of history and could not even lay claim to the dubious excuse that we proceeded in ignorance. And who would gainsay that the consequences of our action could entail the demise of civilization  the extinction of our humanity? ""It is a chilling prospect  but one that we nay avoid by our continuing allegiance to the concept of multilateralism that is  after all the very raison d'Ãªtre of our United Nations system."""
"19",906,"BOL",43,1988,"ï»¿I wish first of all to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo  Minister for External Relations of the Argentine Republic  an illustrious exponent of Latin American diplomacy and intellectual traditions  on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the Assembly.I take pleasure in expressing here my affection and respect for Ambassador Nita Barrow  whose attributes and diplomatic experience are a credit to our region.I wish also to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his tireless and effective quest for peace and harmony among nations  and to assure him of my admiration and support. The Government and the people of Bolivia wish to express  through me  their solidarity and sympathy with the Governments and peoples of Bangladesh  Jamaica and Mexico in connection with the natural disasters of recent weeks  which caused such serious loss of life and material damage.The forty-third session of the General Assembly is beginning its deliberations within an auspicious framework of profound changes in world politics. The East-West agreement on disarmament and understanding has opened up the prospect of lasting and beneficial peace by initiating a broad process of dialogue and negotiation which we hope will help put an end to the insanity of the nuclear arms race. Dialogue has begun to eliminate  we hope for ever  polarization based on the fragile theory of peaceful coexistence - polarization that has put at risk the system of international security. We are living in a new era of reason  of faithful and sincere relations among States  which give a fresh impetus to dialogue and strengthen the political will of States to consolidate peace and effective co-operation to overcome hegemony and irrational pressure and thus create a world order based on the dignity of the individual.The changes that have taken place will be to the common benefit in the context of the objective of beginning a new era in North-South relations on the basis of symmetrical interdependence  so that well-being will no longer be an exotic flower that blooms only in industrialized countries  which are wealthy because they are industrialized  and which monopolize the magic of technology.The understanding between the super-Powers on the establishment of this historic foundation of peace will test our will to co-operate in the service of those on the neglected fringes of the world who are tackling the obstacle course of development in the face of brutal frustration and at the cost of enormous social sacrifices. In recognizing the blessings of nuclear disarmament we must acknowledge the peace efforts of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. These reflect the humanistic idealism of the San Francisco Charter  which advocates a just and harmonious international society  and are based on the philosophical foundations laid at Bandung and Belgrade.The solidarity of the weak countries of the third world has undoubtedly helped to promote the cause of mankind  which has been strengthened by East-West co-operation  thanks to the theory and practice of active neutrality in a world which until recently lived in fear induced by nuclear terror and which still suffers from the devastating scourge of the absolute poverty affecting two thirds of the world's population. This last challenges the very survival of mankind.The future of the developing countries will be at serious risk until stable conditions are established to foster their development and provide a political solution to the problem of external debt- Early in this century force was used to make a Latin American State discharge its public obligations  and it was then that the Drago doctrine emerged  which made recovery of such debts by coercion illegal. Today there are more subtle ways of putting pressure on States  particularly those of Latin America  the Caribbean and Africa. These create intolerable financial strangulation  cause developmental regression and impoverish the peoples concerned. In these times  it is quite incongruous to accept the principles of protectionism in the face of this heavy burden borne by the third world. And  of course  the threat or use of force in any form is unacceptable. This matter is in essence political  and involves the responsibility of both creditors and debtors. Despite its struggle to free itself from the worst hyper inflationary crisis that any country of Latin America and the Caribbean has ever suffered  Bolivia recognizes the existence of this financial obligation.We have been negotiating the buying-back of our commercial debt on terms acceptable both to us and to the creditor banks. We have met our payments to multilateral official financing agencies  and on the bilateral level we have been flexible in our approach to negotiations with the Paris Club. However  these efforts and this true demonstration of our good faith and of our recognition of what we owe should not lead anyone to take unilateral decisions of non-payment. But the sacrifice borne by our people is overwhelming because the servicing of this debt involves more than 25 per cent of the value of our exports  which imposes a stranglehold on my people's right to strive to achieve disarmament and to combat poverty. This situation is repeated mutatis mutandis in almost all the debtor countries. As a result  the entire world community - and particularly the creditor countries - must become aware of this grave matter  and undertake the realistic and practical measures needed to prevent this question of debt from becoming a political and financial disaster of unforeseeable consequences for the whole world. The negative burden of debt on the economy of my country is revealed in tragic terms in a document which I have annexed to my statement and which will be distributed with the official version of my address. I have referred in some detail to the problem of external debt because this is the roost obvious link in the chain which binds the Third World to a cruel and unjust destiny that must be overcome. But  unfortunately for us  it is not the only link. We suffer from acute problems and shortages with respect to external financing for development  and in terms of trade  to mention only two aspects of a very gloomy and multi faceted picture.It is not possible for the flow of capital to run from an impoverished South to a prosperous North. Latin America and the Caribbean alone contribute  through interest payments and other obligations  close to 32 billion per year more to the creditor countries than they receive. We must ask ourselves: Who is contributing to the greater development of whom?Although Bolivia appreciates and is grateful for the technical and financial co-operation which it receives from bilateral and multilateral sources  and which goes towards its development  this is patently insufficient and not consonant with our determined resolve to escape from our current stage of underdevelopment. And in this forum it is appropriate to mention the co-operation of agencies of the United Nations system  such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC) and others. But it is also necessary to state our hope that they will participate at a higher level of resources in my country's development endeavours.There can be no doubt that the heterogeneous and pluralistic make-up of international society does not make it possible for there to be absolute agreement on assessments of world and regional problems. But we must recognize that in many cases this play of interests has a disruptive and decisive effect on the internal policies of States. However  we are borne up by the conviction that it is not on the basis of prejudiced attitudes and preconceptions that we shall be able to improve international relations. For we believe that if we come together each year in this forum  we do so in order to find appropriate solutions to the problems and conflicts facing it  and not to deepen our differences further. There are universal ethical values which are in keeping with the very essence of the dignity of a human being  whatever his or her culture  education  or national identity. These values encompass the will and resolve of all peoples of the planet to achieve peace  individual and social freedom  the right to development  and the full validity of international law.The peace solution in Central America can no longer be deferred. This abode of humanity  this Continent of Hope  with which we have the warmest solidarity  has been suffering the consequences of fratricidal struggle for so many years  and to date it has not been possible to eliminate the violence.Perhaps it might be appropriate for new diplomatic initiatives to be taken  designed to put into effect the very fruitful work carried out by the Contadora and the Support Group to ensure that the negotiating framework among the Central American Governments my really come into proper effect immediately. This is a matter of urgency  and there is a valid solution to a worthy and fair political formula which will bring about a cessation of hostilities and promote understanding on the basis of practical implementation of the principles underlying the thinking of this world Organization and its regional branch  the Organization of American States (OAS). It is not inappropriate to mention  in connection with this matter  the analogy which may be traced to the results achieved in promoting peace in other regions of the world  which are very fresh in our memories. One of the principles of international law - perhaps the most important and fully valid one - rejected at a very early stage the colonialist policy which prevailed at that time  regarding as an execrable practice the extension of sovereignty over Territories and populations that were beginning to form their own socio-historical identity. For this reason  we reject any formula that springs from the colonialist mentality  which still persists and continues to trample underfoot the dignity of certain nations.The General Assembly of the United Nations has on many occasions condemned the continuing imposition of the colonial power of the United Kingdom on the Malvinas Islands  and on this occasion my country renews its support of the historical rights of the Argentine Republic over this southern island Territory occupied by Great Britain  and our support for the resumption of negotiations designed to find a peaceful solution to this conflict.With the same pan-American awareness  Bolivia's support of the Panamanian Republic over the canal continues to be constant  and it is imperative for the international community to guarantee the fulfilment of the 'Ttorrijos-Carter Treaty.There are discrepancies in other latitudes that have been the subject of General Assembly resolutions  and we should be resolved to safeguarding the principle of independence which cannot be trampled underfoot by foreign interference. We are referring to the conflicts in Kampuchea  Cyprus  Lebanon  Namibia said the Western Sahara.In the same spirit  we appeal to the parties concerned to achieve unification in Korea on the basis of dialogue.Fortunately  and thanks to the endeavours of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  the war in the Persian Gulf  which so greatly disturbed world peace  is approaching its end. This is a historic achievement by the United Nations  which has solidly established itself as the highest and most trustworthy world-wide machinery for managing  negotiating  and bringing about the achievement of peace wherever it may be interrupted or disrupted.We should also welcome the beginning of the process of withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan  and the respect shown for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country. That  too  is an achievement of this world Organization.The policy of apartheid of the South African Government is an abominable scar on the face of human society. It is repugnant to the legal and ethical conscience of the world that this racial segregation should continue to be practised with impunity by the Government of this country. And that Government should be the subject of the strongest possible sanctions for its conduct  which runs totally counter to all the codification of international law in the area of the validity and respect for human rights.Recent months have been fruitful  in the sense that the conflicts have been controlled and fresh conflicts prevented. The United Nations' activities have shown it to be a great neutral and trustworthy participant  helping to create conditions that should lead to dialogue and the resolution of conflicts. There is a promising atmosphere for the ""creation of peace""  with love  reconciliation and good faith. A new spirit has emerged  a spirit that will lead to the creation of peace through the broad avenues of negotiation  which will  in turn  provide incentives to the economic and social  political and moral sectors of our society  doing away with the need for and the possibility of violence. These are mechanisms which are based on the principle of the maintenance of peace  and States have begun once again to believe in and trust the bodies of the United Nations system  whose impartiality and neutrality can be relied upon.The item on development and strengthening of good-neighbourliness between States undoubtedly is the one that most strikingly demonstrates the need to foster and further friendly relations between States bound by geography and common borders. This period in man's history is a time of physical and economic integration. A happy example of reconciliation and the establishment of lasting peace for mutual benefit is that of Europe and the Economic Community. In Latin America and the Caribbean we are striving eagerly to achieve that goal of political reintegration and economic integration. That is the path of unity and the quest for a common destiny.This item should be tackled with total intellectual honesty  defining the causes which at times make it impracticable to maintain friendly relations between neighbouring States when unnecessary conflicts await solution - conflicts which need to be overcome precisely because of the people's new objectives of peace and development  within the framework of imaginative diplomatic activities and with the creativity consonant with the changes now taking place in all parts of the world.We must increase the ability of the United Nations to achieve its purposes. All initiatives designed to strengthen the system of international peace and security deserve our warmest support  because we are convinced that we have not yet succeeded in adopting an efficient system that will avert conflicts and provide for the solution of disputes. Solutions can be found if we continue to work faithfully within the framework of the competence of United Nations bodies and the principle that an appropriate solution should be found for any conflict within a reasonable period. It is in the interest of the international community to find machinery and procedures that facilitate the implementation of General Assembly resolutions on the peaceful settlement of disputes.To this end  the intervention of the Secretary-General can be decisive  as has been demonstrated in practice  in promoting dialogue between the parties or in proposing alternative formulas  so that all conflicts are solved satisfactorily.The item relating to the peaceful settlement of disputes among States Members is of particular interest to Bolivia and we have therefore sponsored draft resolutions urging all states to fulfil and comply in good faith with the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes.Once again we reaffirm this juridical position  which is of enormous moral significance in terms of the prestige of the world Organization since the United Nations and the regional organizations  ere established precisely to maintain international peace and security. That objective is being achieved through good faith and frankness  in keeping with honest statesmanlike conduct  by means of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions on the peaceful settlement of disputes.Within the framework of these universal principles and in the light of American regional policy  Bolivia has proposed  since 1979  a solution to the problem of the landlocked status imposed on it as the result of armed aggression in 1879. The world public knows that my country achieved independence in 1825 with a Pacific Ocean coast  the coastal province covering an area of approximately 160 000 square kilometres. The coastal mutilation was never accepted by my country and for more than a century we have been snaking persistent efforts to find a solution to this problem through direct negotiation and  from 1979 onwards  with the participation and diplomatic and political support of the Organization of American States (OAS). Bolivia needs sovereign control over access to the Pacific Ocean that will restore its original status as a coastal country. To this end  we have carried on intense diplomatic activity  which has created a genuine awareness of this problem among the world public. During these multilateral diplomatic activities  and particularly in the regional framework of the OAS  a number of resolutions have been adopted in which the parties involved in the dispute have repeatedly been urged to begin negotiations designed to find a just solution to this problem. It will be understood how much political  economic and moral damage my country has suffered as a result of this despoiling of its marine patrimony at a time  fortunately long past  when might was the supreme law of nations.This outstanding issue has a political and diplomatic basis on which we seek to redress a historic injustice. We are not seeking to deny the legal validity of longstanding bilateral agreements  but today they need to be supplemented and brought up to date in the light of the present realities of international life. It is no answer to offer mere free transit as a substitute for the return of usurped territory. That is why successive Bolivian Governments have sought a just solution based on Latin American brotherhood. This is not an issue that can be clouded by casuistic speechifying and claims based on historical situations that are fossilized and out of date.In keeping with the resolutions of the Organization of American States  in 1987 Bolivia put a proposal for the solution of the conflict to the Government of Chile as the basis for negotiations  which took place in Montevideo in April of that year. Unfortunately  that basis for an understanding to our mutual benefit  which would have opened up the prospect and great possibilities of integration  peace and development  was arrogantly rejected  to the surprise even of the people of that country.Despite the continuing aggressive and arrogant policy of the present Government of Chile  my country will continue its efforts until it exhausts the regional resources available to it in the OAS before transferring the problem to the United Nations.Bolivia cherishes the hope that international solidarity and the practical viability of calm and up-to-date bilateral diplomatic negotiations will make it possible for our country to regain access to the Pacific Ocean by means of this policy of peace  integration and development.We are certain that all Member States are carrying on a whole-hearted struggle against drug trafficking  which in the last two decades has assumed unprecedented proportions owing to the stubborn attitude of the criminals engaging in this very lucrative business  who challenge the capacity of State institutions  for action and control because they are able to draw on considerable economic power. This is a crime against mankind which we must eliminate. Its perverse and insensate nature goes beyond any reasonable considerations and our purpose must be to eliminate all aspects of this inhuman activity. The international community simply cannot live with drug trafficking and its consequences.In the face of this inescapable fact  Latin America and the Caribbean  the Movement of Non-Aligned States and the international community have been the first - and this has been accepted by all States - to put forward the principle of collective  shared responsibility in the struggle to eradicate this scourge once and for all. The new definition of the crime does not separate the developing countries  which have been capriciously called producer or transit countries for narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances  from the developed countries  which  in similes fashion  have been characterized as consuming countries. The problem of the criminal activity of drug trafficking affects everyone equally  with its attendant negative impact on economies and the scourge of drug addiction.We should note the steps taken as a result of genuine international solidarity in the struggle to combat this evil through the activities of the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control and the United Nations Development Programme  as well as the United States of America and the countries of Europe  which have announced  and in many cases put into effect  programmes of economic assistance for those countries that are affected by production  so as to enable them to attack this problem effectively.Despite good intentions  the degree of co-operation is still quite low and does not encompass the minimum needs of existing plans to deal with this problem.Bolivia has just promulgated a strong law which it is applying in this unequal struggle against the power of drug traffickers: ""Law governing coca and controlled substances"". It is one of the most modern laws ever adopted in recent years in the area of positive anti-drug law. Its special characteristics combine harsh penalties with the replacement of coca crops by means of planned alternative development aimed at agricultural substitution and providing the necessary economic incentives to those farmers affected by the elimination of the traditional crops.The positive aspects of that law have clearly achieved encouraging results: while the confiscation of cocaine paste has increased substantially  many of the most powerful drug traffickers have been arrested and hundreds of cocaine factories have been destroyed. In addition  thousands oÂ£ hectares of coca cultivation have been eradicated in compliance with our international commitments But it is clear that these efforts could be undermined if the industrial countries  such as the United States of America    not effectively contribute in a timely manner the financial resources they have pledged. In this connection  my country calls on the international community to make a decisive contribution to the eradication of improper use and illegal trafficking of drugs and to double its efforts  without applying pressure or setting conditions  because our decision to continue the fight to final victory is being demonstrated daily.In conclusion  I wish once again to reaffirm our unswerving commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and our conviction that mankind must  with the support of all  pursue the course that has been so auspiciously begun in recent times towards its glorious destiny of peace and justice.May God bless world peace."
"20",953,"BRA",43,1988,"ï»¿Mr. President  a tradition dating back to the early days of this Organization confers upon me the privilege of being the first speaker  at the opening of our debate  to convey to you  my colleague and friend Dante Caputo  my warm and friendly congratulations on your election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I am certain that you will do honour to that high office with the same qualities that have marked your steady leadership of Argentine diplomacy.I should also like to express my appreciation of and respect for Ambassador Nita Barrow  distinguished representative of Barbados  whose merits enriched our choice for the direction of our work.I once again pay a tribute to the outstanding diplomatic talent of the Secretary-General  Ambassador Javier Perez de Cuellar. His untiring efforts in building peace and strengthening the United Nations make him worthy of the appreciation of the whole international community.When I addressed this Assembly for the first time three years ago there prevailed in international affairs grave forebodings and repeated violations of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. The language of confrontation between the super-Powers was becoming sharper owing to the use of advanced military technologies capable of spreading the risk of nuclear war to outer space. The persistence of localized tension and disputes frustrated the efforts to attain of the ideals of peace and security.As I return here today I find that the world situation has improved somewhat. The practice of East-West detente  which seemed condemned to oblivion  has been reborn. The United States and the Soviet Union have finally reached a concrete agreement on disarmament. Their leaders are to be commended for this historic feat.Some regional conflicts  the protagonists worn out by the tragic toll of death and destruction  now see the dawning of a peaceful solution. In previous speeches I have condemned the recalcitrant attitude of South Africa in blocking the process of independence for Namibia  the violence which seemed to have taken hold for good in the Gulf region and the transgression of the principles of self-determination and non-interference in Afghanistan. Today it is comforting to change my words of warning and criticism to bear witness to the promising outlook for peace efforts aimed at putting an end to those conflicts.In looking at the clearer skies on the world political horizon  I reaffirm my reverence for the United Nations and my belief in the effectiveness of its instruments. If the world is better today than it was yesterday  we must give credit for that to the decisive contribution of the United Nations. We still have before us  however  unfinished and challenging tasks to accomplish in obedience to the provisions of the Charter  Obstructions remain to eradicating apartheid  solving the Middle East crisis  putting an end to the suffering of the people of Lebanon and bringing peace to Central America. It is my hope that at the next session of the General Assembly we may note further progress in our quest for peace and harmony among peoples. As the representative of a nation which has always sought the establishment of a just and democratic world order based on the participation of all  I must stress that the task of transforming the world will be complete only after the strengthening and consolidation of co-operation for economic and social development. In this respect  unlike the remarks I have just made on the world political situation  my words today will not differ in substance or in tone from those of my previous statements. Because of the lack of progress in international economic relations  Brazil once again brings to the Assembly a message of apprehension  of disappointment  and renews to the developed world its proposals and claims.Reaffirming its historical adherence to the highest ideals of international life and faithful to the will and the nature of its people  Brazil has inscribed in its new Constitution  which is about to be promulgated  the fundamental principles of its foreign policy; national independence; priority for human rights; the self-determination of peoples; non-interference; equality among States; the peaceful settlement of disputes; the defence of peace; repudiation of terrorism and racism; and co-operation among peoples for the progress of mankind. The representatives of the Brazilian people  when expressing in the Constitution the central demands and concerns of their own society  were perfectly attuned to the aspirations of the international community. They also embodied in their new charter the greatest aspiration of our continent - the integration of Latin America. The world  unfortunately  has come to realize how absurd is the unilateral ethos underlying the illusion that power - military  political  economic or technological power - could generate a just or even a merely stable international order. Strength cannot give birth to law  much less to peace and justice. This is what the Charter of the United Nations - and in particular its preamble - tells us.Nevertheless there persists a disturbing tendency on the part of certain countries to place their national law above international law  both in political and in economic matters. To plead internal laws  or alleged national interests  in order to avoid compliance with obligations under international law violates the essential principle of pacta sunt servanda  which is a basic rule of civilized coexistence among nations.The adventure of unilateralism cannot be replaced by self-contained bilateralism or selective multilateralism. Negotiations on matters of interest to the whole world community require the participation of all countries  large or small. Talks on peace and economic development  in particular  cannot be made into an empty exercise whereby power pays homage to law.Regrettably  the atmosphere of dialogue which now brings the super-Powers closer together has not resulted in an effective readiness to widen the field of multilateral understanding. The elaboration of power schemes geared to redefining and freezing a vertically structured world order deserves nothing but condemnation.The difficulties encountered during the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament illustrate the concern I have just voiced. The impossibility of obtaining a document based on consensus  only a few months after the first treaty on nuclear disarmament in history was signed  clearly indicates the magnitude of the obstacle hindering the participation of the international community as a whole in deliberations concerning its own survival. The decision made by President JosÃ© Sarney to take part in that session  along with other Heads of State or Government  attests to the firmness of Brazil's stand in favour of the cause of disarmament and of its open and effective discussion in the relevant bodies.So strong is our people's repudiation of weapons of mass destruction and so firm our purpose to develop nuclear technology exclusively for peaceful ends that the following precept is embodied in the new Brazilian Constitution; all nuclear activities in Brazilian territory will be permitted only for peaceful purposes and subject to approval by Congress.This same spirit  already enshrined in the Treaty of Tlatelolco  prevails in the understandings between Argentina and Brazil in this field. The loyal and fruitful co-operation between the two countries belies the myth of a nuclear race in Latin America.The constructive purpose inspiring Brazil's foreign policy led to the convening of the first meeting of States of the Zone of Peace and Co-operation of the South Atlantic  which was held in Rio de Janeiro last July. Part of a region which is assuming its own identity  founded on deeply shared interests and perceptions  the South Atlantic countries were able to explore further the many paths of open dialogue among equals offered by the Declaration of the South Atlantic as a Zone of Peace and Co-operation.Our views coincided on important issues. We support the efforts for peace-building in southern Africa. We are concerned that  in spite of repeated appeals from this Assembly  negotiations have not yet begun on all aspects relating to the future of the Malvinas Islands. We believe it necessary that concrete measures be adopted  in particular by the militarily significant States  in order to ensure the non-introduction of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and the reduction of foreign military presence in the Zone of Peace and Co-operation. Ample possibilities exist for joint action in favour of development. We found significant points of common interest in the preservation of the environment  in the need to avoid the dumping of toxic wastes and in the implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. I have no doubt that the conclusions of the Rio de Janeiro meeting will receive widespread support from States Members of the United Nations.The signing of the Geneva agreements and the beginning of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan have rekindled hopes for a future of peace and development for that country. We commend the Secretary-General and his Special Representative  Mr. Diego Cordovez  for the United Nations participation in this process. We would only have wished that the entering into force of the mechanism for verification and control of the agreements  with the good offices of the United Nations  had been implemented only after due process.The cease-fire between Iran and Iraq  welcomed by Brazil  brought the prospect of peace and economic reconstruction to the Gulf region. May I stress the extraordinary relevance of the United Nations in this initiative  as from the joint action of all members of the Security Council - over which Brazil had the honour to preside at that time - in consultation with the Governments of Iran and Iraq and with the constant  timely and balanced mediation of the Secretary-General.In southern Africa  progress in the negotiations between Angola  South Africa and Cuba  with the mediation of the United States  augurs well for a peaceful and just solution to the question of Namibia under resolution 435 (1978)  adopted 10 years ago by the Security Council. We hope that this will be the first step towards normalizing the situation in the southern part of the African continent through the elimination of all sources of tension and conflict. Brazil has underlined the need for strict respect for the territorial integrity of its South Atlantic neighbour  Angola  and for an immediate end to the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa. We regret that the odious practice of apartheid continues on its absurd course. The people and Government of Brazil long for the day when Namibia joins the community of independent nations. Peace and security can be assured in that region  so close to us  only when the odious institutionalized racism is eradicated.In the Middle East repeated scenes of violence  which have shocked world public opinion  confirm that the self-determination of the Palestinian people in their own territory is an essential condition for solving the crisis. The Brazilian Government reiterates the need for respect for the rights of the Palestinian people  for Israel's complete withdrawal from the territories occupied since 1967 and for all States of the region to be able to exist in peace within internationally recognized borders. With those goals in mind  we continue to support the holding of an international conference on the situation in the Middle East  with the participation of all interested parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.The apparent standstill of peace progress in Central America is viewed with concern by Brazil. It cannot be denied that the Esquipulas Agreement contributed to alleviating tension and that new hopes emerged with the Agreement. But the recurrence of incidents in areas of tension and the paralysis  which we hope is temporary  in the process of dialogue and understanding create a feeling of uncertainty as regards the future of Central America. As a member of the Contadora Support Group  Brazil hopes that a less tense international atmosphere may come to make it easier for the countries of the region to attain their objectives of peace and development.Although there is progress on the political scene and signs of a future world free from war and truly committed to achieving lasting peace  the international economic  situation still troubles our spirits and challenges our minds. In the great majority of developing countries Members of this Organization  the dire facts continue to cry out for creative decisions which might break the stalemate that has been keeping those countries on the verge of collapse. We must no longer delude one another with rhetorical phrases and concepts. It is high time we openly admitted that a strong uneasiness is corroding the foundations of international economic co-operation.Almost half a century has elapsed since we declared ourselves United Nations and  united  undertook to follow a common set of ideals among which was the fight against misery and hunger. One commitment was to halt the degradation of the most cherished values of our civilizations  irrespective of origins or beliefs. What has happened to us? Have we become less united than we were then?We have only to look at this Assembly  as we meet for the forty-third consecutive year  to see that we are nations sharing universal principles and ideals. Whereas the hostilities of the Second World War had plunged us into the most hidden depths of terror and desolation  the seeds sown in San Francisco bore fruit in the Americas  in Asia  in Africa and in the Middle East - throughout the world. They are here  united  the nations which 50 years ago found themselves on opposing sides of the battlefield. They are here in this very place  united  the nations which in the following years achieved their independence  which was to a great extent the fruit of the same seeds of democracy sown in San Francisco.Are we less united than before? No. We are more united then before  but not as united as we wish to be in the future.It is therefore sad to note that we American  Asian  African brothers still suffer from the same horrors and the same desolation that so badly afflicted our forbears. While we have done away with wars  we have not yet been able to banish hunger  which is spreading endemically in pockets throughout the continents. We are all the more ashamed to see that hunger is present in and close to the most plentiful societies man has ever known.Something is terribly wrong. The real growth of production in developing countries fell from an annual average rate of 5.5 per cent in the 1970s to an average of less than 3 per cent in the 1980s. The share of developing countries in the developed market economies shrank from 28 per cent in 1980 to 19 per cent in 1987  whereas that of the developed countries grew from 63 per cent to 71 per cent in the same period. In real terms the participation of developing countries in world exports suffered a decrease of approximately 25 per cent between 1963 and 1986. And something is terribly wrong when one notes that  due to the burden of external debt  the developing countries have to transfer abroad a great amount of the resources they so badly need for their economic development.Brazil has  in the past few months  managed to reach with its private and government creditors a global agreement on the rescheduling of its external debt. We ate therefore keenly aware of the burdens weighing down on our economy. That is why we are convinced that only if and when the developed countries adopt appropriate policies shall we be able to reduce interest rates and improve the outlook for trade in debtor nations. Unfortunately  the erratic policy on international interest rates in recent years has thwarted the economic development of a whole generation. This policy has turned international trade into a complementary source of the reserves needed simply to service the external debt  with obvious adverse effects on expanding or even maintaining our economies' capacity to import.This sad state of affairs has been made all the worse by a battery of constraints imposed vertically - from top to bottom. Proposals clothed in euphemistic language  such as ""voluntary export restraints""  cannot disguise the old formulas of protectionism and the spoliation or trade partners  formulas which are always at the root of the most serious recessions to shake the international economy this century.It is our hope that the present multilateral negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will make it possible for international trade to enter into a new cycle of expansion  on a more just and balanced basis. We cannot accept that the concept of trade without frontiers should be invoked to deny third-world countries the special  differentiated treatment they should receive. Nor can we accept that the developed countries should ignore the commitments they solemnly made when the Uruguay Round was launched and demand concessions from developing countries in exchange for revoking protectionist measures.Moreover  it must also be acknowledged that legislative initiatives in some of the main trading countries are in essence clearly hostile  not only to international trade  but even to the scientific and technological capacity of the developing countries. My country  for example  is now under the threat of trade retaliation  simply because we - in accordance with international law and with the letter and spirit of agreements to which we are parties - have encouraged  in our own territory  research into and development of pharmaceutical products. We were taken aback to see the most Â¿Â¡table and predictable rules of international trade and international law being violated unilaterally.Therefore  conditions seem ripe for the General Assembly  responding to the appeal the President made in his inaugural statement  to relaunch on an effective  realistic and constructive basis  without resorting to rhetoric or recrimination  the North-South dialogue  without forgetting the great frustrations this endeavour has entailed so far.The General Assembly is meeting at a good moment to change the course of history; to steer it in safer directions; to intensify the progress made in the fields of peace  the settlement of disputes and disarmament; and to reappraise and reinvigorate the already weakened international economic co-operation.This year we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is tragic that we are still unable to settle together the problems affecting  in vast areas of the world  the most elementary rights of mankind: the rights to life  health  shelter  food and work; in sum  those rights which assure the development and well-being of peoples.Whereas in the task of building peace the day of hope is dawning upon the world  the struggle for development remains in frustrating darkness. It has been said that development is the new name for peace. If that is true  the Assembly cannot fail to measure up to the challenges of our times and to heed the urgent calls for justice and dignity. "
"21",997,"BRB",43,1988,"ï»¿My first remarks must be an expression of congratulations to you  Mr. President  on your election to the high office you now hold. The delegation of Barbados finds pride and comfort in the fact that the deliberations of the forty-third session should have been placed in the hands of so able a representative of the Latin American and Caribbean region. We salute and support you. I have been asked by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Government of Barbados to convey to you his very special greetings and his regrets that he cannot be with us today. However  we know that you have his very good wishes.We also pay a tribute to the President of the Assembly at its forty-second session  Mr. Peter Florin  whose unfailing patience and careful chairmanship of the General Assembly at its regular session and various resumed sessions was an example to us all.The deliberations at the forty-third session are shadowed by grim reminders of the vulnerability we share and the interdependence by which we are inseparably bound. The recent misfortunes of Sudan  Bangladesh  the Dominican Republic  Jamaica and Mexico serve to underscore this interdependence and the pivotal role that the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization and other specialized agencies play in the day-to-day lives of the people of the world  to the Governments and representatives of the countries affected we offer our heartfelt condolences. Disaster  whether man-made or natural  bears two faces: one of despair  the other of hope. The forty-third session finds us looking into a world suspended midway between the politics of hope and the politics of despair. Perhaps never at any time in its four decades of existence have the United Nations and its Charter faced a more poignant challenge. While there is much to suggest that the task of narrowing the gap between despair and hope may be impossible  there is still much to encourage us.At present the international community draws renewed hope from the spirit of responsible co-operation demonstrated by the two major Powers in their formal commitment to reducing the menace of nuclear conflagration. While we acknowledge and commend this development  we cannot  we must not  surrender our collective responsibility to make our world c safer place for humanity. The history of this century and of the United Nations cautions against this. We must never forget that the carnage from which this Organization arose might have been contained  or even averted  had it not been for the untenable notion that world peace could be the brokered product of bilateral interests  perception and prejudice. Disarmament is meaningless unless and until the wish for peace is shared by all people and their interests reflected at all levels of negotiation. No organization is better placed or equipped to advance this cause than the United Nations  despite perceptions to the contrary  the General Assembly and the Security Council have managed to reduce the incidence of armed conflict and avert the onset of a world war.Through its specialized agencies  this Organization has done much to bring new hope to many areas of the world where life has been impoverished by illiteracy  disease  hopelessness and fear. Too often we are apt to overlook the contribution of non-governmental organizations. These groups of dedicated women and men work tirelessly among their communities to fulfil the lofty principles of this Organization. In various ways these groups render invaluable service to their governments and people.Much of the mood of optimism present in the world must be attributed to the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General in pursuing the elusive goal of peace. Against the background of encroaching monetary crisis  his commitment to purpose and his dedication to ideals have inspired us all and may in fact have rescued this Organization from an unthinkable fate. The recent agreements on Afghanistan provide yet another example of the capability of the peace-making median isms of the United Nations and demonstrate the importance of the multilateral process in an increasingly complex world  a process which too often is underestimated and even undermined. The recent award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the peace-keeping forces  so richly deserved  gives recognition to the efforts of this Organization. This session will deal with many of the critical issues facing the great continent of Africa. The first days of this session found the Secretary-General  not on this podium  but in southern Africa employing his considerable diplomatic skill in diplomacy in an attempt to secure implementation of the Namibia plan and the provisions of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Resolution of the Namibian problem therefore now seems to lie within our grasp. It is my fervent hope that such a solution will lead to the inevitable freedom of our oppressed brothers and sisters in southern Africa.We often state in these halls that apartheid must be eliminated. We have heard it in every speech. But have we really matched our deeds to our words? Have we done all that we could to ensure the unconditional release of that outstanding patriot Nelson Mandela? Have we used to full effect the application of comprehensive sanctions? We need to be ever vigilant to extend the freedom we enjoy to all people. I repeat the words so often used: ""We ate not free until we are all free.""Significant progress has been made in bringing peace to several areas of conflict. These have been enumerated in detail by many others. However  I will just mention them again for reinforcement and to ensure that it is known that my Government supports them.The strains which have separated Algeria and Morocco are happily showing signs of easing. We owe it to succeeding generations to ensure that the United Nations plays its role in finding a just solution to the conflict in Western Sahara.The conflict in Kampuchea has divided households and families and created millions of refugees. We hope that the Jakarta Informal Meeting held in July will encourage all concerned to redouble their efforts to achieve a speedy solution to the problem based on the right of the Kampuchean people to determine their own destiny  free from external interference. Let us at this forty-third session make every effort to assist in finding lasting solutions to their problems and achieving the reuniting of separated families  upon which the well being of nations rest.We are happy that the French authorities and the people of New Caledonia have initiated a dialogue on the status of the Territory and that positive measures are being taken to promote political  economic and social development in New Caledonia  which would provide a framework for the peaceful progress of the Territory to self-determination  taking into account the rights and aspirations of the indigenous peoples.The Charter recognizes the desirability of regional solutions to regional conflicts. For this reason  the efforts of Central American leaders to bring peace to that troubled region ate to be encouraged and supported by the international community.Never before has the international climate been more favourable for a concerted effort towards a permanent solution to the conflict in the Middle East. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that all legitimate interests are adequately accommodated  in the interest of a just and humane peace.We must all be heartened by the progress towards peaceful settlement of long-standing conflicts now emerging in the many areas mentioned. However  we must not be lulled into a false sense of security until the promises now made are fulfilled through the requisite action. Much has been accomplished  but much more remains to be done.It was my privilege to participate yesterday in the ceremony so ably organized as a tribute to the African diaspora. For roe  a daughter of the diaspora  it was a moving experience. The States of Africa and those of the Caribbean have much in common. They have faced and will continue to face intimidating obstacles in the course of their development. Few issues are of more immediate concern than the protection and beneficial management of the environment. Drought and desertification menace much of Africa's population. Hurricanes and floods cause frequent havoc in Asia and the Caribbean  that not all our threats come from nature  and not all are beyond our control. Irresponsible and criminal pollution of the land  sea and air now places in jeopardy the health and livelihood of citizens in many developing States. This matter is of special concern to us in the Caribbean  dependent as our economies are upon the ocean.Scientific research continues to reveal pernicious threats to the environment  which threaten the very existence of the human race. I need mention  as has been done by others  only the so-called greenhouse effect of atmospheric pollutants and the depletion of the ox on e layer  which demand the urgent attention of the world community.The causes of these problems are as diverse as the problems themselves. However  they all to some degree reflect our insensitivity to the fragile nature of the environment in which we must all exist. They challenge the ingenuity of the international community to devise new means of co-operation  what is needed more than ever before is universal acceptance of the principle of sustainable development. What is essential is a comprehensive reassessment and readjustment of our relationship to the environment; a concept of progress free of the wanton exploitation which has to date characterized our industrial efforts. This will not be an easy route and no doubt it will be necessary to provide developing countries with the resources to reflect such an approach in their development strategies  that we must keep uppermost in our minds is that the environment belongs to us all. For only with this realization can the necessary steps be taken to preserve the environment for the future of our children. Reassessment and a readjustment of similar proportions is required in the way our societies relate to each other. I refer specifically to the relations between developed and developing States  between the industrialised and the non-industrialized.The burden of external debt has reached the level of crisis. We have heard that again and again. It constitutes what must be considered the gravest threat to sovereignty ever encountered by States on their road to development. It undermines the vital capability of political leaders to satisfy the basic social and economic aspirations of their people. Inevitably  therefore  it engenders those social forces which work against civic calm and stability.The problem of external debt cannot be isolated from the other enemies of social justice. While the burden falls disproportionately upon poorer nations  the eventual effect should offer little comfort to the more prosperous among us. There is no doubt that the upheaval in the economic and social life of these countries will generate repercussions throughout the international community  for such is the nature of our international economic system. The fates of creditor and debtor are inseparably bound.If this Organization is to take seriously its mission to safeguard the welfare of future generations it must be given a greater say in the way in which this global problem of debt is addressed. We must be cautioned that unless meaningful co-operative efforts are made to assist developing States in the management of their debts the prospects for global economic recovery will be dim. However  developing countries must be more fully integrated  not only in the efforts to find solutions to the debt problem  but also in the search for a new order in the global economy. A situation in which appeals for the transfer of wealth and appropriate technology are met with antipathy while the transfer of wastes is being actively pursued suggests that ours is rapidly becoming a community of contempt. This is clearly in defiance of the United Nations Charter.The scourge of the illicit trafficking in drugs now leaves no region of the world untouched by its destructive proficiency. The immediate target of this nefarious market is the youth of our societies.The island States of the Caribbean with their open borders are uniquely vulnerable to the threat  located midway between the centres of production and the centres of consumption  these States have become unwilling units in the deadly interplay.The Government of Barbados has always demonstrated a passionate dedication to the preservation of all those fundamental rights and freedoms necessary for the full development of the human spirit. It is a dedication nurtured by the experiences of slavery and colonization. It has resulted in the peaceful attainment and exercise of national sovereignty. In a few months time  Barbados will celebrate the three hundredth and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of its parliament  which  except for periodic elections  has met continually since 1639.It is this tradition and this experience which fortify our faith in and commitment to this Organization  our faith in its effectiveness in protecting and promoting the welfare of humankind. We believe therefore that human rights  the rights of women  the preservation of our societies from the devastating effects of war  famine  drug addiction and disease are all priorities to which our collective attention must continue to be devoted.Mr. President  you have assumed the presidency of this session at an historic moment in the life of the United Nations: at a time when the Organization faces a most challenging future; at a time when the demands on multilateral diplomacy are even more evident; at a time when there is ever more need for a rededication to the values of multilateralism. We are aware that yours will not be an easy task for the myriad problems that confront the Members of this Organization all deserve our attention  and we must demonstrate that as a family of nations we are concerned about the fate of all its members.The United Nations is of course many things to many people. It is above all a forum for negotiating at all levels  from the bilateral to the multilateral. In this regard  the United Nations facilitates the viability of small States whose diplomatic outreach is constrained by their lack of resources. As Dag HammarskjÃ¶ld noted so very perceptively in this Assembly on 3 October 1960  it is the small States that need the United Nations for their protection.""In this sense "" he continued  ""the Organization is first of all their Organization and I deeply believe in the wisdom with which they will be able to use it and guide it."" (Official Records of the General Assembly  Fifteenth Session  883rd plenary meeting  para. 11)We pledge ourselves to that vision for we fully understand it.We would do well to remind ourselves that this is an organization founded as a result of conflict and the context of its operations remains one of conflict. As such it presents an honest reflection of the human condition. We  all of us  exist in a state of perpetual tension. As individuals we are torn between our need for order and tranquillity and our innate abhorrence of fetters and restraint. As political societies we are torn between the demands of sovereignty and the realities of interdependence.Surrounded by this swirl of contending forces  the United Nations becomes something of a moral epicentre. We who gather here year after year must  in my view  seek not to remove such conflicts from our midst - our history suggests that that would be impossible - but  more realistically  to redirect these natural forces from the avenues of destruction to those of development. This is the fundamental task of the United Nations to convert the human condition from despair into hope.As we reflect on the events of the past year we must see signs that reason and good will  when allowed to function promote progress and peace. What this Organization has done for four decades has been to provide an oasis of civility from which our several conflicts may be viewed with reason and good will.It seems to me that we are justified in drawing from these developments renewed devotion to that cause which inspired the creation of the United Nations Charter. I suggest that our deliberations will be neither effective nor complete without constant regard for the ideals that motivate them. We may consider the words of Seneca  the Roman statesman and philosopher ""Not to know what was transacted in former times is to remain always a child.""In full awareness of our past and in conscientious commitment to the future  the delegation of Barbados dedicates itself to the success of this session. "
"22",1029,"BRN",43,1988,"ï»¿I should like to congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that we will all benefit from his experience and wisdom and that he will give our deliberations positive guidance.I also wish to express my appreciation to the outgoing President  His Excellency Mr. Peter Florin  for his able presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly and the fifteenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.Over the past few months we have seen peace initiatives in many parts of the world which have brought hope that there is a growing awareness that armed conflicts being ""bout only human suffering. It is generally thought that peace moves now stand a greater chance of success. This can be attributed to a large extent to the improved relations between the United States and the Soviet Union  The signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles by the United States and the Soviet Union signalled the beginning of the peace initiatives. I should like to congratulate the leaders of both the United States and the Soviet Union on the positive lead they have given and on showing that problems and conflicts can be solved through negotiation.The improvement in Soviet-American relations fostered the Accords on Afghanistan  which are a great step forward. We hope the Accords will enable the Afghan people to return from the refugee camps to Afghanistan to live in peace.There has also been noticeable progress in other regions such as Cyprus  Western Sahara and New Caledonia. In southern Africa  progress towards ensuring the viable independence of Namibia must include the withdrawal of foreign troops.My delegation was happy to hear the announcement by the Secretary-General of the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq. We hope the difficulties in the peace negotiations can be overcome and the cease-fire will lead to a durable peace between the two countries ending the terrible bloodshed and destruction of the war  and will also ease international tension. We wish to congratulate the Secretary-General on his dedicated perseverance in the face of great difficulties in bringing about the cease-fire. We are happy that both Iran and Iraq realize the futility of continuing this senseless and tragic war.The appearance of peace initiatives in many parts of the world has brought the United Nations once again to the centre of the stage where it rightly belongs. Through the personal dedication and untiring hard work of the Secretary-General  and the continued support of Members of this Organization  the United Nations flag is once again seen as a symbol of our hope for a future in which we can all enjoy peace and security. This development pleases my delegation. The effectiveness of the United Nations depends on its Members  ""today we see the growing willingness of Member countries to turn to the United Nations to resolve their conflicts rather than to continue with armed hostility. We believe the United Nations can carry out its tasks as required by the Charter. It is of particular Importance to us  as a small country  that this pattern of resolving conflicts be followed peacefully through the United Nations rather than by military force. However  many long-standing problems still remain. The Palestinian people continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination and independence  which prevents them from returning to their homeland. Israel's policy of aggression and expansion in the occupied territories has further worsened the conflict. The ongoing uprising in the occupied territories should convince Israel that its occupation of the Palestinian lands can only bring insecurity and instability  both in the region and in Israel itself.Israel cannot for ever deny the Palestinians their inalienable right to a homeland or remain hopeful that the Palestinians will one day just accept its ~ rule. For this reason  my delegation supports the convening of the International Conference on the Middle East with the participation of the PÅO as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The Conference will  we hope  find a just  lasting and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.In South Africa  the apartheid system of the racist regime in Pretoria has yet to be dismantled  despite the many international condemnations of the inhuman racist policies involving terror and suffering for the black population of South Africa and the neighbouring countries  we therefore call upon the international community to continue to apply pressure - political and economic - on South Africa so that its apartheid policies can be dismantled and that justice may prevail.In our region  there have been hopeful signs that the Kampuchean problem can be resolved. For the first time  the four Kampuchean factions and representatives of concerned countries in the region met face to face in Bogor  Indonesia. The Jakarta Informal Meeting was a breakthrough and we hope it will lead to further meetings in order that the question of the foreign occupation of Kampuchea may be resolved. My delegation has always maintained that a comprehensive political Settlement cannot be achieved as long as foreign forces still remain in Kampuchea. I therefore call for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea so that the process of national reconciliation among all Kampucheans under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk can be promoted.For 40 years the Korean Peninsula has remained tense owing to the conflict between the two Koreas. Brunei Darussalam is hopeful that the recent dialogue and initiatives by the two countries will bring about peace and stability leading eventually to national reunification. We also wish to renew our support for the admission of the Republic of Korea as a Member of the United Nations  if it so desires  in conformity with the principle of universal of membership of the United Nations.It is tragic that this Organization should face severe financial problems at a time when it can make such a valuable contribution to peace. The financial crisis that threatens the United Nations is now having a crippling effect on its ability to perform.None of us would like to see the United Nations reduced to bankruptcy and oblivion. On the contrary  we wish to see the United Nations strong and capable of meeting the challenges of today. A clear demonstration by all Members of their political support for the United Nations through the paying of their assessed contributions remains the only way of avoiding a position of weakness. In my delegation's view  we owe it to this and coming generations to sustain this Organization in order to ensure the survival of mankind in peace.Today the world situation is more hopeful than it was a year ago and one message is clear  namely  that all signatories to the United Nations Charter must adhere to its basic principles. Furthermore  at a time when there are greater chances for peace  it is important that we should let the voice of the United Nations be heard. Ms must ensure a peaceful world for all of us to live in."
"23",1072,"BTN",43,1988,"ï»¿I have the honour to convey the warm greetings and good wishes of His Majesty Jigiae Singye Wangchuck Â· King of Bhutan  to you  Mr. President  and through you to all the representatives for the success of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.May I also extend the hearty felicitations of my delegation to you  Sir  on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. Given your outstanding credentials  I am confident that you will lead this session to fruitful conduction.I also wish to put on record our deep appreciation for the skill with which Mr. Peter Florin guided the forty-second session. His fine stewardship of the General Assembly has earned for him and for his country  the German Democratic Republic  the respect of the international community.We express our thanks to our Secretary-General  Mr. Peres de Cuellar  for his incisive report. The exciting possibilities outlined in it stem in large part from his inspired leadership and hi  work as an apostle of peace. During this past year especially  he was omnipresent  and his labours and those of his colleagues have borne abundant fruit. His tenure is a milestone in the history of the United Nations.We are entering the dawn of a new era. The United Nations has generated the momentum of peace on a number of fronts  bringing long-standing conflicts to an end and creating new opportunities. In this past year alone we have been witnesses to the success of the peace-making process. Never have the prestige of the world Organisation and pride in the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter stood higher  undeniably  the efficacy of multilateralism has been borne out. The awarding of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping farces is Ð° just albeit belated recognition of the effective role that the United Nations has played in maintaining peace in the world's trouble-spots during the past 40 years.The easing of East-West tensions has created a more favourable international political climate and has contributed to the resolution of several regional conflicts. We applaud the two great leaders who signed the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - in Moscow last spring  and express the hope that this will lead to further agreements on the reduction and eventual elimination of strategic nuclear arms.	Â·My delegation also applauds the agreement on Afghanistan sponsored by the United Nations. This breakthrough will  it is hoped  lead to a lasting peace for that war-torn land  ending nine years of bitter fighting. The withdrawal of foreign troops is now taking place  but much work remains to be done in terms of reconciliation  repatriation of refugees and the building of a national consensus. We welcome the efforts of the United Nations for Afghanistan's economic reconstruction. We are  however  deeply concerned by the continued internal struggle and foreign intervention that could jeopardize the very fragile basis on which the current initiatives have been taken. We urge all parties concerned to honour and abide by the Geneva accords.The cease-fire between Iran and Iraq  mediated and arranged by the United Nations  is another cause for the rejoicing of the world community. Eight years of this fratricidal war have taken an appalling toll - some 1 million dead  1.7 million wounded and 1.5 million refugees. All in all  it has been one of the century's most brutal wars. Therefore  we commend the United Nations Secretary-General for his efforts to achieve an honourable agreement between the two parties within the framework of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We observe with satisfaction the development of encouraging signs concerning the future of Kampuchea. We welcome the initiative taken by Indonesia to bring all the leaders of the opposing sides together for the first time  we support the commitment and effort of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to facilitate a durable political settlement  and are heartened by the indications of an early withdrawal of foreign troops. In southern Africa the recent cease-fire between the belligerent parties involved in the war in Angola is yet another development of great significance. Bhutan hopes that Ð° firm schedule for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Angola will soon be established. Of related and equal significance is the outcome of the talks between the parties concerned on the independence of Namibia  which is illegally occupied by South Africa  in flagrant violation of United Nations resolutions. In this context we express our full support for the Secretary-General in his efforts to ensure that implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) begins next month.In spite of South Africa's apparent willingness to negotiate the independence of Namibia and the beginning of its troop withdrawal from Angola  the situation in southern Africa remains highly volatile. This is because South Africa continues to wage two wars - the war on its own people and the frequent incursions against its neighbours. The racist regime continues to hold the majority of its people in subjection under apartheid. This brutal system  colonialism at its worst  is an affront to the whole civilized world. Atrocities are committed daily in its name: arrests  torture and intimidation of thousands  mass deportations  and press censorship amounting to a strangulation of the news. The regime remains utterly intransigent in refusing to negotiate with black leaders or accept United Nations mandates. Unless steps are taken to alleviate the situation  a bloodbath will inevitably follow.We call upon South Africa to release Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners and to dismantle the institutionalized inhumanity known as apartheid. We state categorically that we are not deceived by the cosmetic so-called reforms. Until such time as real and constructive changes are brought about  we call for comprehensive economic sanctions and an arms embargo against South Africa  for It is the responsibility of the world community to put pressure on the regime and to work for the establishment of a non-racial society in a united South Africa.There are certain areas of tension that have sadly withstood the pacifying winds of change. The recent uprising in the occupied territories has only added greater bitterness to the Arab-Israeli conflict. On the other hand  while absolute solidarity with the Palestinian people in their struggle to regain their inalienable rights is essential  the discord among themselves continues to be a source of concern to their well-wishers. We nevertheless express the hope that the recent separation of the West Bank from the Kingdom of Jordan will enhance the cause of the Palestinian people and their rightful claim to a sovereign homeland.That said  we wish to make it clear that we support the security and right to exist in safety of all States in the area  including Israel. The territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon continue to be violated by foreign forces. At the same time its people remain torn by religious bigotry. Saddened by the increasingly apathetic attitude of the world to the plight of this nation  we urge that renewed efforts be launched to resolve the question of Lebanon in a manner that will enable the Lebanese people to determine their own future  free from any foreign interference.During the recent XXIV Olympiad in Seoul  the best and most universal summer Olympic Games in history  the world witnessed the extraordinary economic accomplishments of South Korea. The Korean people  however  continue to remain tragically divided. In our view the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula can best be brought about through the building up of mutual confidence between South and North Korea. In this connection we welcome the special declaration of President Roh Tae woo made in the interest of national self-esteem.   .Beyond these regional discords end conflict problems that know no boundaries have been forced on our attention with increasing urgency. I refer to the degradation of our physical environment. 'Will earth survive?â asks a recent article with pointed relevance. Mass deforestation  depletion of the planetÂ· ozone layer  the poisoning of rivers  skies and sections of the oceans  the destruction of whole ecosystems which have reached insurmountable proportions. Have we turned our planet into a vast dumping ground? Furthermore  those who experienced this past summer in New York know about the greenhouse effect first hand. However  such reports as that of the world Commission on Environment and Development  entitled ""Our Common Future"" - the Brundtland report - outline constructive steps to address  and even reverse  present trends.Our gravest threat by far  however  remains that of nuclear holocaust. While the historic signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - and the recent destruction of weapons are cause for hope  we cannot afford to be complacent. The current supply of nuclear weapons could destroy the planet many times over. We are still not free of the spectre of disaster of the testing and stockpiling of new nuclear weapons. It is our collective responsibility to work for general and complete disarmament. The first three special sessions on disarmament pointed us in positive directions and were initial steps on the road to our ultimate goal of comprehensive disarmament. However  we must look forward to a fourth special session to build on our progress. Let us add here that Bhutan welcomes the establishment of the third Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament  to be located in Kathmandu  Nepal. Beyond this  my delegation once more calls for a complete halt to the testing of new nuclear-weapon systems and for a freeze on the production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons. We call for a halt to the production and proliferation of conventional weapons and  in particular  for a total ban on chemical weapons.World expenditures for military purposes are now in excess of S900 billion a year and could  if present trends continue unchecked  reach the astronomical figure of 31 trillion a year - this while fully two thirds of the world's people live below the poverty line. What a distorted sense of priorities  what a twisted perspective! So many of the world's scarce resources are poured into the technology of destruction  with no return in terms of either real security or an enhanced quality of life.This problem is part of the larger picture of the fundamental injustice of current economic relations  of the growing disparity between rich and poor nations. In almost no sense could the global economic outlook be called healthy. The problem for our region and international trade system  are the increasing protectionist trade policies  reduction in the flow of financial assistance to the developing countries  volatile exchange rates  mounting interest rates  and the collapse of the prices of primary commodities  which are at their lowest level in 50 years. All these factors feed into the overwhelming debt problem that has crippled the development levels of so many of the poorer countries. Overall  it has been said that the 1980s have been a lost decade of development. The results have been appalling. In 1986  850 million people lived in countries that experienced no increase in per capita output. What this means in real terms is that not only has economic development suffered an enormous setback in these countries  but that progress in the social sphere has been severely hampered as well for these things are intertwined. We must add that the least developed countries have suffered these shocks the most.How can we reverse the downward spiral? The solution must be found in the resumption of the North-South dialogue and the implementation of the New International Economic Order. As a first step  we renew our call for the early convening of an international conference on money and finance for development. Clearly  there is an ever greater need for a more equitable world economic infrastructure - for a comprehensive approach to the interrelated problems of money  finance  debt  trade  and development. The developed nations cannot continue to flourish at the expense of the developing countries in the end  this proves counter-productive for everyone. In our increasingly interdependent world  there is no alternative to effective co-operation. The kind of creative partnerships we envision would impart a new dynamism to the global economy and promote self-reliance through co-operation  thereby creating opportunity for all. The South Asian Association for regional Co-operation (SAHRC) is an attempt at South-South co-operation. This is an association of which Bhutan has been a proud member from the beginning. Increasingly the seven member nations  with a total of 1 billion people among them  have expanded their areas of co-operation  in spite of our widely differing cultures and historical experienceÂ·  we work together in a fraternal spirit to promote the objectiveÂ· of individual and collective self-reliance and to further the cause of peace  progress and stability in South Asia.The goal of self-reliance has been the cornerstone of Bhutan's development policy. Bhutan has been a number of the world Organisation only since 1971. However  in that short span of time the various specialized agencies and affiliated bodies of the United Nations  working closely with our government  have rendered invaluable assistance. They have played a pivotal role in all aspects of our development - in such diverse areas as road and communication infrastructure  health and educational services and  above all  human resources development. In particular I should like to express our drop gratitude to the united Nations development Programme (UNDP)   the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)   the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAO)  the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF)  the World Health Organisation (WHÐ)  the World Food Programme (WFP)  the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FM) the United Nations Volunteers (UNV}  the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA)  the United Nations Department of Technical Co-operation for Development ((JNDTCD)   and the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).The United Nations has proved its efficacy  both in the day-to-day operations of the specialised agencies and affiliated bodies  and in its role as peacemaker  negotiator  and mediator. Its dramatic success in resolving a number of long-standing conflictÂ· this year have put the world Organization in its limelight. Yet at the very moment when its prestige is at its zenith  and the principled of the Charter have at least gained truly universal acceptance  the United Nations faces an unprecedented threat. Unless the fiscal crisis is relieved in the immediate future  the United Nations will be forced to shut its doers forever. Even if it were merely a forum for the communication of ideas and for blowing off steam  the United Nations would be invaluable  for nothing comparable exists. But the world Organization is so much more than this. It is our last best hope. How tragic it would be if this were realized after its disappearance.This world cannot do without the United NationÂ· At this critical juncture - most especially when peace-keeping forces are about to be dispatched to far-flung parts of the globe - we cannot sit idly by and watch the United Nations collapse  we therefore call upon all nations to fulfil their financial responsibilities at the earliest possible date.The present system of assessments  made on the capacity of nations to pay  is equitable. It is the result of the wisdom that prevailed at the time of the founding of the United Nations.But times have changed. The present financial crisis has opened our eyes to the vulnerability of the world body to the pressures of a few nations that currently bear the brunt of the payments. Therein lays the inherent weakness of the United Nations. Indeed  we can easily foresee the possibility of the United Nations being similarly held to ransom again unless the assessment of dues can be established through a new formula. The financial burden must be shared in a different manner. The United Nations provides equal political opportunities to all nations  thus earning it its distinction as the parliament of nations but it is the poorer and less developed countries that enjoy greater benefits in terms of expertise and financial assistance. Therefore  the developing nations nay have to pay a larger share of the United Nations operating costs. This may sound like a radical proposal  but the benefits we reap from the world Organization should enable us to accept this idea with a greater sense of responsibility and willingness. Above all  we must ensure the survival of the United Nations.Yet today we are presented with opportunities as never before. The United Nations is in the ascendant and is brilliantly carrying out its appointed work  healing wounds and making a constructive difference in the lives of people everywhere. In times past  men sought the Golden Fleece or El Dorado. We seek something nobler and more realistic: a renewed commitment to the vision of the Charter to bring to birth a prosperous and equitable world order  a new and better life for all mankind."
"24",1112,"BWA",43,1988,"ï»¿Let me join the speakers who have preceded me and extend Botswana's heartfelt congratulations to you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. Your country and my own enjoy the happiest of relations  and it is with great pleasure that I assure you of my delegation's unstinting support and good wishes as you pilot the deliberations of this session.Your predecessor  the eminently respected Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic  Mr. Peter Florin  deserves the fullest measure of our gratitude for the very able manner in which he guided the work of the forty-second session. We will miss his unshakeable composure in the face of even the most trying circumstances.Before I turn to the issues before us  let me reiterate on behalf of my country and my delegation our sincere condolences to the peoples of Jamaica and Bangladesh  who have recently fallen victim to natural disasters due to cyclones and monsoons. Precious human and animal lives have been lost  and untold damage to property has been registered. We hope the international community will be generous in its response to those two Member States' appeal for assistance.  This year  1988  has been a watershed year for the United Nations despite the intractable financial and other problems the Organization has continued to face. With patience  perseverance and a complete understanding of the workings of world politics and diplomacy  our Secretary-General has demonstrated to us all that the United Nations is alive and well and capable of responding decisively to the crises of our troubled world  given the active support of its Members. Never before have we witnessed such prevalent and pervasive rumblings of peace occurring  as they have  in such a torrent  thanks to our Secretary-General's unyielding tenacity of purpose. We salute him and his team of men and women here at Headquarters and abroad  who have given the best of themselves and even risked their very lives in the service of world peace.In this regard  I wish to congratulate the Secretary-General and the United Nations peace-keeping forces on the forces having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1988.Yet we cannot pretend that all is well in our Organization. We are all aware of the serious financial crisis the Organization is facing even as it is called upon to undertake a multiplicity of missions all over the world. How ironical: Even as the United Nations is daily demonstrating its capacity to fulfil its mission as the instrument of peace in the world  given the necessary wherewithal  we are told it must reform itself in order to earn the right to have  or to receive  the financial resources which are due to it in accordance with its Charter. The result is that the Organization has no resources to perform the most central and sacred of its duties: the maintenance of international peace and security.The efficient deployment of resources by the United Nations is not the unilateral concern and preoccupation of one Member or a few Members; it is the common concern and preoccupation of all of us. That is why we all supported the work of the Group of 18 and its report  and continue to do so. The report of the Group of 18 vas  in our view  never intended to transform the United Nations into a plaything of the big contributors. Its purpose was to improve the functioning of the administrative and budgetary management of the United Nations  and not to  introduce weighted voting by stealth. It is in the interest of all of us to live up to our obligations under the Charter by the payment of our financial contributions to the Organization.There has been a marked improvement in the international situation since the last session. There is a flowering spirit and atmosphere of rapprochement between the super-Powers  so happily evidenced by the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - the first of its kind in this cold-war era  and by the current negotiations on the reduction of strategic nuclear arsenals by 50 per cent  h welcome sense of realism about the dangerous folly of the philosophy of peace through nuclear terror seems to have taken root in both the East and the West. We have not seen the end - or the beginnings of the end - of the cold war not yet. But there are encouraging signs that at least the Powers that hold the destiny of our world in their hands are prepared to coexist peacefully across the chasm of their mutual suspicions and animosities.The recent rapprochement of the super-Powers should augur well for international peace and co-operation. Co-operation of the super-Powers in the adoption and implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  on the Iran-Iraq war  for instance  would have been wishful thinking only a year ago  not to mention the pleasant novelty that is Moscow's and Washington's apparent convergence of purpose and interest in the ending of violence and strife in south-western Africa. This is a development we must welcome with genuine enthusiasm  because the efficacy of the United Nations in general and of the Security Council in particular rests on the willingness and readiness of the super-Powers  in the first instance  to co-operate in carrying out the vital decisions of this world body. Their urge to wage their ideological war through reckless resort to their veto power in the Security Council will recede as they begin to reap the benefits of co-operation and as they realize that the United Nations is in fact the best vehicle for the promotion of their own interests.Though the stability of our world remains precarious  we have every reason to breathe a sigh of relief that some of the roost painful regional conflicts that have often threatened ignition of a global conflagration seem to be ready for resolution. As we meet here  the withdrawal of foreign forces is in progress in Afghanistan  a non-aligned South-West Asian nation that has endured a painful war since the turn of the 1980s. Thanks to the mediation of the United Nations and the unswerving determination of so many of us in this Assembly to stand by the people of Afghanistan in their time of trial and tribulation  a new era has begun in that war-weary country  an era which we pray and hope will be crowned with peace and stability. Even painfully hapless Kampuchea has become the subject of a growing series of consultative encounters among the countries of the region. The Jakarta consultations of 25 to 28 July 1988 are among those encounters  which we hope represent the beginning  however tentative  of the end of the terrible carnage that has been the lot of that tormented country for so long. For our pact  here at the United Nations  and at this session  the message must remain clear  unequivocal and uncompromising. Kampuchea belongs to its own people and in no circumstances should the United Nations  by silence or indifference  give comfort to the presence of foreign troops in that country of South-Eastern Asia. The people of Kampuchea  like those of Afghanistan  must be left alone to regain their inalienable right to self-determination after many decades of suffering.We are somewhat encouraged by the visible signs of contact between the two Koreas  Our great hope is for this development to assume a more meaningful dimension leading to the peaceful reunification of Korea and this  to our understanding  can be fostered only through dialogue among the Korean people themselves; without external interference.The Middle East remains a hotbed of strife and conflict. Although Iran and Iraq are currently seized of the arduous task of laying the foundations for a durable peace  the rest of that part of the world continues to endure turmoil. The tragedy of Lebanon remains unmitigated. Its territorial integrity continues to be flouted and violated with reckless abandon. We insist that Lebanon be left alone to seek its own path to Its own salvation. Keeping that tortured country in a permanent state of internecine strife does no service to the cause of peace in the Middle East. The heartrending scenes that flash almost daily on television screens  depicting what passes for life in the West Bank and Gaza  are horrid indeed. For us from Southern Africa such scenes are a painful reminder of the horrors of apartheid. No day passes without an innocent and defenceless Palestinian demonstrator being maimed or shot dead for wanting to be free in the land of his or her ancestors. And we honestly wonder by what logic the senseless carnage on the West Bank and in Gaza and other occupied Arab lands is supposed to enhance the security and survival of the State of Israel  or of any other nation in the area.We remain convinced that for Israel  as for the rest of the Arab world  including Palestine  there is only one sensible and realistic path to salvation and survival - the path of mutual accommodation and acceptance. We commend to all countries of the region the resolving of their differences through negotiation rather than by the use of force or confrontation.In the South Pacific the people of New Caledonia continue to invest their hopes in the traditional anÐ mandatory responsiveness of this our United Nations as a vital and crucial complement to their own efforts to achieve self-determination. We take the view that New Caledonia is a legitimate candidate for self-determination under General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960 and Chapter XI  Article 73  of the Charter.In Central America peace and stability still remain a distant dream. The peace agreement signed by the five Presidents of Central America in Guatemala on 7 August 1987 has not served the lofty purpose for which it was intended. The agreement has not been found to be in any way so flawed as to be un-implementable rather it has become a bone of contention in the debate on how peace and democracy can be achieved in Central America. There are those in the region who hold the view that more aid to keep the flame of the contra revolution in Nicaragua will do the trick  that anything else can only prolong the agony of the people of Central America  and Nicaraguans in particular. We beg to differ. We continue to support the Central American peace agreement and urge that it be implemented without delay.In South America  the Falklands/Malvinas Islands dispute remains a source of concern and anxiety to us all. There does not seem to be any meaningful effort on the part of the parties concerned to work towards the resolution of the dispute. The bitterness of the 1982 conflict over the islands has lingered on and is clearly serving as an impediment to the resumption of the pre-1982 negotiations on the future of the Islands. Our view is that neither Argentina nor the United Kingdom can escape the fact that the only way for the Falklands/Malvinas dispute to end is for them to negotiate. We therefore appeal to the two countries to proceed to the conference table without delay.Allow me now to focus attention on my own region of southern Africa. No changes of major consequence have come about in the political fortunes of the region since the last session  even though there has been a lot of talk going on since May this year. This Assembly has already been fully briefed on the talks  the quadripartite meetings involving Angola  Cuba  South Africa and the United States  with a view to finding peace for what is called south-western Africa  namely  Angola and Namibia.To the extent that the talks have so far produced some results that we can live with  inasmuch as they have not prejudiced any principles we hold dear in southern Africa  we certainly welcome them. For us the bottom line  the irreducible minimum demand  is independence for Namibia through the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and respect for the inviolability of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the People's Republic of Angola. Nothing less is acceptable. In South Africa itself nothing less than the total abolition of apartheid is acceptable. Even if the quadripartite talks succeed in bringing about peace in Angola and the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) in Namibia  the root cause of the problems of southern Africa as a whole will still remain unresolved. Apartheid in South Africa will continue to pose a threat to all the people of the region as it seethes with fury  waiting to erupt like a volcano  unless it is eradicated without further delay.Botswana would like to believe that the South African authorities have realized that the use of military force  such as the invasion and occupation of parts of southern Angola  was a dangerous venture which served no useful purpose as regards South Africa itself or the region as a whole. For our part  we would like to reaffirm our faith in the principle of peaceful resolution of disputes  which we commend to the authorities in Pretoria. But we are concerned that time is fast running out.In order to create a climate productive to negotiations  the state of emergency must be lifted and all political prisoners and detainees released. Nelson Mandela and Zephania Mathopeng must be released  not only because of their age or illness but also because their continued incarceration deprives South Africa of what may be its only hope for salvation. Nelson Mandela  in particular  is the embodiment of the aspirations of the oppressed majority people in South Africa and there can be no meaningful negotiations while he remains incarcerated.The violence of apartheid is the issue in South Africa  not the reaction of the African National Congress to it. That is what is to be negotiated; the end of the violence of apartheid and the democratization of South Africa  so that all its people  black and white  may at long last live in peace in a just society. Apartheid is the source of destabilisation and destruction in southern Africa. The front-line and other neighbouring States  some more than others  have all suffered as a direct consequence of apartheid. My own country has had continuously to run the gauntlet of South Africa's State terrorism  bomb explosions and murder and maiming of its citizens and South African refugees under its care  all for no other reason than the simple fact that we have become one of Pretoria's most readily available scapegoats as the anti-apartheid strife intensifies inside South Africa itself.Look at the destabilization the destruction  that has been wreaked upon Angela and Mozambique over the years by South Africa and its proxy armies of bandits  all in an attempt by Pretoria to preserve apartheid  For thE People's Republic of Mozambique  in particular  the United States State Department report issued earlier this year says it all. Nothing could be more horrifying  more heart-rending  than the revelations of that report  which we hope will awaken the conscience of those who support the objectives of the RENAMO bandits.Of late South Africa has launched a diplomatic offensive to conduct dialogue with African countries and thus break out of the prevailing state of diplomatic isolation it has brought upon Itself. This offensive will not help solve South Africa's internal problem. The solution roust be found inside South Africa by conducting meaningful dialogue with genuine leaders of the whole spectrum in that country.Elsewhere in our continent we continue to be troubled by lack of progress in the search for a lasting solution to the question of Western Sahara. We continue to uphold the principle that the people of Western Sahara  like all other colonial peoples  are entitled to exercise their right to self-determination. In this regard  we commend the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) for their tireless efforts to find a lasting solution to the question.  The question of the Camorian island of Mayotte will never cease to exercise our minds so long as it remains unresolved. We therefore urge the French Republic and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros to negotiate a peaceful settlement of the dispute.Cyprus remains a nagging issue here at the United Nations and in the Non-Aligned Movement and the Commonwealth. We are adamant in our conviction that the solution to the problems of this divided island lies in the cultivation of mutual confidence between the Greek and Turkish communities. The current bi-communal talks must therefore be encouraged so that they may succeed. We continue to call for the withdrawal of foreign troops  as that would contribute towards a peaceful resolution of the dispute. We urge all concerned to co-operate with the Secretary-General in his untiring efforts to reach some accommodation.The international economic system continues to be a cause of concern. Economic growth decelerated in the Western industrialized countries from 2.9 per cent in 1986 to 2.3 per cent in 1987. Because of their fear of high rates of inflation such as were experienced in the early 1980s  those countries refrained from providing the stimulus to their economies that would have maintained  or even accelerated  their rates of economic growth.The impact of this economic sluggishness in the Western industrialized nations was felt in the developing countries  where the rate of economic growth slowed from 4 per cent in 1986 to 3.3 per cent in 1987 with the rate of population growth in many of the developing countries still in excess of 3 per cent per annum  this implies stagnation in the standards of living of the people. And even here it should be noted that most of the growth in the developing countries was recorded in the newly industrializing countries of Asia. Growth in African countries as a group either stagnated or was negative. For the developing countries the prices of primary exports rose slightly  for others the prices of exports remained depressed. The rapid increases in the prices of manufactured imports led to a serious deterioration in the terms of trade for the developing countries and aggravated inflationary pressures within their economies. They experienced considerable strain on their foreign exchange reserves because of the inadequate purchasing power of their export earnings. The debt-service burden  in conjunction with the inadequate levels of export earnings greatly constrained the resources available for development and resulted in less than satisfactory economic performance.The issue of indebtedness has attracted considerable attention recently  both at the international level and within the African region. Some donor countries and financial institutions have undertaken to convert some loans to grants  extend some grace periods and maturities on outstanding debt and reschedule debt payments. These concessions are expected to provide much-needed relief. The programme co-ordinated by the World Bank is designed to provide concessional assistance  on terms of the International Development Association (IDA) type  to heavily indebted IDA-eligible countries in Africa which are implementing structural adjustment programmes. It is hoped that the benefits accruing from these developments will not be offset by a further deterioration in the terms of trade or a reduction in current levels of resource transfers.As 1988 draws to a close  despite the many favourable outcomes that have been recorded on the African and world economic fronts  there are various disturbing signs of accelerating inflation  rising interest rates  weakening commodity market prices and growing protectionism in the industrialized world that threaten to disrupt the modest gains that have been achieved. Last  but not least  my delegation welcomed at the outset the historic signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - and the ongoing negotiations on the reduction of strategic arsenals. That is concrete progress at the bilateral level. We hope that the momentum will be maintained so as to yield fruitful results in the general question of disarmament.ht the multilateral level  real progress towards disarmament remains elusive. This past May and June a special session of our Assembly  which had been expected to push a little further along the road to disarmament  ended without achieving the desired results. The failure of the special session to produce the desired results was discouraging  but it cannot and must not In any way signal the end of the disarmament effort. We must continuous to encourage the spirit of multilateralism.The scourge of terrorism is still with us - terrorism perpetrated against innocents by individuals  groups of individuals and some States. It is a scourge that no explanation can justify  and it must be condemned unequivocally  regardless of its author. The typical imprint of what terrorism perpetrated by a State can do is there for all to see in the front-line States of southern Africa  the Middle East  Latin America and elsewhere where whole villages have been reduced to rubble and hundreds upon hundreds of graves of innocent victims of midnight commando raids and aerial bombardments dot the ravaged landscape like bales of hay. This is terrorism in every conceivable sense  and it must be condemned without equivocation.I end my statement as I started it  by paying homage once more to this  our United Nations  for what it stands for to our Secretary-General for his inspiring and productive leadershipÂ·  and to his staff for their selfless devotion to their international duty. Our faith in this vital world institution remains strong and unstilted. It is our determination to preserve it  to strengthen it  to infuse it with a new sense of purpose and mission. "
"25",1157,"CAF",43,1988,"ï»¿The hope placed in the United Nations  which for a time had given way to indifference and mistrust  if not scorn  is being reborn. There is a new course in international relations that bodes well fear the co-operation envisaged in the Charter. As the forty-third session of the General Assembly begins  ray country  the Central African Republic  cannot but welcome these developments.Our task is to consolidate and develop this new approach  and the international community has great need of the vast experience and personal qualities of the President of the General Assembly  Mr. Dante Caputo  who can count on the co-operation and support of the delegation of the Central African Republic. In addition to conveying to him the warm congratulations of His Excellency General Andre Kolingba  President of the Republic  Head of State and founding Chairman of the Central African Democratic Assembly  I wish to pay a tribute to his country  Argentina  with which the Central African Republic maintains excellent relations of co-operation.I wish also to express to his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  my delegation's satisfaction at the way in which he fulfilled his responsibilities.The rebirth of trust and of the prestige of our Organization is the result  of course  of the will of Member States  but also of the faith and the patient  persevering action of the Secretary-General. The developments with regard to certain conflicts confirm this. The Central African Republic reiterates its expression of encouragement to Mr. Perez de Cuellar. Similarly my delegation welcomes the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations. That is eloquent proof of our Organization's decisive action for peace and of its regained credibility.The present international situation and the work of the Organization are being evaluated now in the context of a certain element of detente and a new dynamic of dialogue and search for compromise. These developments  historic in themselves  should not be interpreted as being fortuitous - and here we agree with the Secretary-General  who makes this point in his report on the work of the Organization for this year. They are the result of an awakening on the part of Member States to their interdependence and community of interests  which commit them to exploiting to the utmost the Charter and what it contains in order to seek  together  solutions to their problems. They stem from the instinct of preservation - a salutary reflex which in times of danger requires that the common values essential to the cohesion and survival of the group be defended.Indeed  it is as if suddenly States  and particularly the great Powers  have finally realized that we were on the verge of catastropheÂ·  that we could not go on arming ourselves indefinitely without grave danger to mankind that freedom and the right of peoples to self-determination and development are common values and causes that are essential to all peoples  all States  and that cannot be constantly flouted or neglected.These developments stem also from the failure of the way& and means to which States have hitherto resorted to find - in a fragmented or even selfish or unilateral way - overall solutions to problems that are  however  of common interest. A brief review of recent events on the international scene suffices to demonstrate that this new approach  which consists in real participation by Member States in the search for solutions to the problem confronting the international community can bring about  if not a settlement  at least an easing of certain conflicts the persistence of which was rendering the balance of peace ever more precarious.It is to this that we owe the felicitous outcome of the situation in the Gulf region between Iran and Iraq  and the Central African Republic welcomes this outcome. The negotiations now going on under the auspices of the Secretary-General with a view to guaranteeing the consolidation of this achievement  in accordance with the spirit and the letter of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  could not have any other outcome. My delegation hopes for the rapid success of these negotiations and the restoration of a climate of trust between the two brother countries: Iran and Iraq.With regard to southern Africa  while no final agreement has yet been reached  we place a great deal of hope in the negotiations under way - in Brazzaville among other places - and in all the individual or concerned action being taken at the moment. Indeed  for the first time  there is now a momentum that could bring about peace in that region. The determination of the parties to find a compromise that honours justice and peace is welcomed by the Central African Republic  which very much hopes that this momentum will accelerate  through the implementation of Security Council resolution 43S (1978)  the process of Namibia's accession to independence  will prevail upon South Africa to undertake the true democratization of South African society through the elimination of apartheid and the recognition of the political rights of the blade majority) and will make possible a climate of confidence among the States of the regime.Furthermore  we are pleased with the turn of events in the Western Saharan situation. That has been made possible by the concrete action of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity  which has led to the adoption of a peace plan by the interested parties. My delegation very much hopes that the application of that plan will finally bring harmony to that part of Africa.Similarly  the normalization of relations between Chad and Libya which has just led - to the satisfaction of the Government of the Central African Republic - to the restoration of diplomatic relations between them should be viewed as a milestone in the efforts undertaken in all quarters to establish the conditions for the return  at last  of genuine peace in that region. It is important  nevertheless  to continue to work for a broadening of this climate of restored confidence.The same co-operation among Member States which was indispensable for the settlement of certain conflicts should also be shown with a view to putting an end to the situations prevailing in the Middle East  where it is now urgent to hold this international conference which  with the participation of all the interested parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  will deal with the situation in the region - in particular the question of Palestine  which is its core in Afghanistan  where  it is true  the withdrawal of foreign forces has begun and where  by the effective application in good faith of the Geneva agreements  the right of the Afghan people to decide their destiny in a neutral and non-aligned State must be recognized; in Kampuchea  where the principles of the United Nations on this question should lay the groundwork for any solution  including the unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from that territory in Central America  where the Guatemala agreement  which could establish genuine conditions for peace in the region  should produce its full effects  in the Korean peninsula  where the renewed dialogue between the parties should continue and be encouraged  not only to promote the enjoyment by the Korean people of their legitimate aspirations to independent end peaceful reunification  but also to make it possible to consider the question of the accession of Korea to the United Nations.From what I have said so far it is dear that we must increasingly engage in efforts to encourage States to find genuine political will by co-operating within the framework of the machinery they have created  not only to ensure the maintenance of peace but also to promote the socio-economic development of all parts of the world - another condition for the balance of peace.This new approach - in the economic field this time - can be reflected only in the support of States that Is indispensable to the work of the United Nations  which can thus contribute to the establishment of conditions for the co-operation that is essential to the economic recovery of the least-developed parts of the world Now  the condition of those parts of the world and Africa in particular  are regularly placed on the agenda of the General Assembly  efforts have been made  it is true  under the auspices of the United Nations  to engage in reflection on this question. A Programme of Action was even adopted  on the basis of mutual responsibility. We have just had a mid-term review of that Programme. At this stage  the conclusions so laboriously reached by the Ad Hoc Committee that made the review - apart from any other comments on them - gives us an exact assessment of the situation two years after the adoption of the Programme.They show that the African counties  whose responsibility for the application of the Programme of Action remains paramount  have kept their commitments they have accepted enormous sacrifices and have made genuine efforts for development - efforts that  by the way  have been recognised and supported  unequally it is true  by the International community. As the Ad Hoc Committee recognises  real obstacles have been impeding the development efforts that have been undertaken. These obstacles - which relate essentially to the impact of difficult climatic conditions the collapse of the prices of commodities on which the economy of the African countries largely depends  the increase in their external debt and also in the servicing of that debt  and the inadequacy of financial firms in their direction - must be removed otherwise  these countries cannot make any progress towards development.However  the fact that the Ad Hoc Committee  at this interim stage  was able to reach agreement on the measures to be taken for the full application of the Programme of Action demonstrates the will of the African countries as well as of the international community to achieve the objectives laid down in the Programme of Action. The prospects thus opened up can lead to results only if the developed countries change their attitude and help to create a new climate of confidence in co-operation among States  particularly by trying to remove the obstacles to the development sought by their African partners. In that regard  earnings from the export of commodities should be sufficiently guaranteed so that countries would not be constantly subjected to the deleterious effects of the fluctuation in the prices of those commodities.Priority should be given to the adoption of sound and flexible measures to alleviate the debt burden  because debt-servicing - which in some cases  such as in the Central African Republic  has attained one third of budgetary income - is a real impediment to the process of economic development  since no resources are available for investment. Calling for rescheduling debts  because of its limited scope  does not make it possible to solve the structural problems which affect most African economies. That is why the international community should demonstrate a spirit of greater co-operation and solidarity  so that the measures that emerge from the forthcoming international conference on Africa's external debt will take account of the reciprocal interests of States. The action taken by Member States to contribute  jointly with the United Nations  to creating conditions for better organized co-operation in various fields will be effective only if the human dimension is taken into account as its ultimate goal. A larger measure of security and a minimum of development must  above all  mean greater security and at least a minimum standard of living foe all.In the Central African Republic  under the leadership of President Andre Kolingba  the democratic institutional process begun a short time ago is now being crowned by the restoration of democracy. My country has signed various international instruments which  within the framework of the Chi toed Nations or the Organisation of African Unity  organize  govern and guarantee human rights. The protection of human rights has now become an imperative duty for the State and an obligation for the nation  because we cannot appeal for development efforts  for harmony or for peace if we do not promise man a better life. It is for man that these values must be cultivated  fostered and extended  particularly at a time when we are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the universal Declaration of Human Sights.Yes  a new hope is emerging at the end of our century  a century of profound change  of phenomenal and prodigious advances in science and technology of universal recognition that every man has a unique identity and character with regard to the values of emancipation  freedom and equality) but also a century which does not yet fully promote the achievement of these values for the benefit of mankind as a whole  as was the dream of the founding fathers of our Organization.Can the renaissance of hope and the new trend towards dialogue and the search for com promise be the prelude to the attainment of a world of justice  tolerance and solidarity  a world in which together we can solve the problems affecting the human condition and together provide a solution?It can if we continue to show the political will to safeguard the United Nations  the indispensable framework for working together  for co-operation  for a new era of trust among States  nations and peoples.It is time for all men of goodwill to unite their genius and their efforts  to speak the same language  the language of peace. Let them say no to war and no to poverty. Let their faith in the Charter of the United Nations and in a better mankind become ever more manifest."
"26",1201,"CAN",43,1988,"ï»¿Let me first congratulate Mr. Caputo on his election as President of the General Assembly. His wisdom and experience will  I believe  make this a particularly productive session.It is an honour to be here today speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations  the crucible of human hope for peace in a troubled world. I believe we are on the brink of a new age  one in which the differences that have divided us are becoming less important than the dangers we must face together. It is a new age in which concrete acts that make our world more secure must and can be matched by tangible commitments to reduce poverty in the developing world and protect our common environment.For two generations the world has lived in the shadow of nuclear war  but today we meet at a time of significant achievement in arms control.The Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles is a historic first step in arms reduction for which  I believe  we owe a great debt of gratitude to the courage and leadership of President Reagan of the United States of America and of General Secretary Gorbachev of the Soviet Union. They have laid a foundation  and we can now build upon it.We must cut strategic weapons. We can limit the spread of nuclear weapons. We can limit nuclear testing  and every step in this direction takes us closer to a comprehensive test ban. We must redouble our efforts to reach a treaty banning chemical weapons.In this respect  I welcome President Reagan's proposal for an early meeting of the signatories of the Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of chemical weapons. We must also control conventional weapons. Let us not forget that it is in conventional wars that people are still dying today. I encourage this Assembly to provoke and provide even more achievements in the field of disarmament. We have also seen progress on regional security issues this past year  progress of which Member nations could only have dreamed in the past.In Afghanistan  the attempt to impose solutions by invasion and occupation has failed  and the Soviet Union is withdrawing its forces. The United Nations remains heavily involved in the search for solutions. In the Gulf  no country has been able to impose its will by force. Representatives of the United Nations  including 500 Canadians  now patrol in peace where hundreds of thousands recently died in combat.Canada's role in these events is consistent with our long tradition - more than four decades - of peace-keeping  a role we have always willingly assumed. Canada has participated in every United Nations peace-keeping force since its foundation  and we are proud of this contribution  costly and difficult though it has often been  because we believe it has assisted in bringing stability to explosive regions of the world.Today a significant portion of our armed forces is either involved in peace-keeping around the world or training for further duty in the service of peace. The award today of the Nobel Peace Prize for peace-keeping is a splendid tribute both to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to those courageous men and women from all countries who patrol the world's danger spots in the pursuit of a durable peace. May I  on behalf of everyone  offer the Secretary-General our very sincere congratulations.But not everywhere do we see the progress we would wish. The vicious cycle of repression and violence is unbroken in South Africa. We all know the cause: the massive and institutionalized violation of human rights called apartheid. Internationally  pressure is increasing and is having an impact. The entire world finds apartheid repugnant: the whole world must now join forces to bring it to an end. Canada has taken strong measures on its own to rid our civilization of this unique evil known as apartheid.We are under no illusions about the effectiveness of our efforts alone  and so we have actively pursued objectives in co-operation with other Governments  especially in the Commonwealth and in Francophonie. From the outset we have applied all the sanctions agreed to within the Commonwealth we will continue to do so and we will seek to broaden their application  increase their effectiveness and encourage others to join in adopting and applying them.Consistent with our policy of moving systematically and deliberately to increase pressure on South Africa  our Government announced earlier this week specific new measures to tighten the ban on government contracts with South African companies and a further ban on high technology  together with initiatives designed to add practical support to peaceful efforts to work against apartheid. Because of threats to major development projects in the front-line States we intend to provide assistance  in concert with others  to preserve these development initiatives.The movement in favour of human dignity is now irreversible. There can be no doubt that fundamental change will come to South Africa. The only questions are when and how and at what cost in human life. We must make sure the answers come soon  and peacefully - and that a framework is preserved that will give rise to a non-racial democratic South Africa. Only then will the children of Mandela know the gifts that freedom brings.The problems of the Middle East have preoccupied this Assembly since the creation of the United Nations. Peaceful solutions have proved elusive  and in their absence violence and extremism have increased. But that is an argument for redoubled effort  not for despair. There is today growing support for a properly structured international conference based on Israel's right to exist and recognition of the rights of Palestinians. Canada believes that such a conference can provide a path towards dialogue and away from a situation that appears to promise little but further suffering.Some regional conflicts continue to challenge our courage and imagination; but  in just a short period of time  progress towards a more peaceful world has been dramatic and deeply encouraging. Who would have predicted a year ago that today Soviet forces would be withdrawing from Afghanistan; that Vietnamese forces would begin withdrawing from Cambodia; that United Nations peace-keepers would be patrolling the Iran-Iraq border; that negotiations on Angola and on Western Sahara would be starting to beat fruit; that the Secretary-General would be discussing the independence of Namibia with the South African Government? Those who have doubted both the value of multilateralism and the United Nations surely must be reassessing their views today. The Secretary-General's recent report on the work of this Organization is a document which should inspire the deliberations of this Assembly.In this dawning hope for peace  the path we ought to take is clear. It is towards conciliation and not confrontation between East and West. It is towards co-operation and generosity  not recrimination and rigidity  in North-South relations. It is towards negotiation  not warfare  in regional disputes. It is towards implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  adopted 40 years ago.We must give hope to those who today find their rights to free expression silenced by gunfire. We must provide sustenance to the flame of liberty in all regions where fundamental rights are being abused. He roust reinforce the role of the Security Council in the pursuit of peacemaking and peace-keeping around the world. It can be done  but only with the help of everyone in this Assembly.For many generations the arms race  regional disputes and the threat of nuclear annihilation have been a central preoccupation of the United Nations  and so they will remain. But I believe that we are at a point in history when we must devote significantly more political energy to problems other than security  problems perhaps just as important but until now accorded a somewhat lower priority.I want to speak specifically about the twin challenges of severe poverty and our endangered environment. I believe we shall not have true security until these problems have been successfully resolved. These issues were high on the agendas of the summit meetings chaired last year by Canada - from the Commonwealth and la Francophonie to the Economic Summit Meeting in Toronto  at these meetings I found a growing conviction among national leaders that these problems can and must be tackled  and must be dealt with before  the end of this century. These problems command the same priority here in the United Nations.Poverty undermines security. It compromises equality. It denies hope. Today it is estimated that at least one billion people live in absolute poverty. They are hungry. They ate often sick. They are uneducated. They die young.Alleviating poverty must be given a new priority on national and international agendas. We must work to achieve social justice for the poorer t of our world and economic growth which does not destroy our magnificent environment.At Toronto the leaders of the major industrialized countries renewed their commitment to work towards continued growth for the benefit of both the industrialized and  particularly  the developing countries. We are also working towards a trading system which is more open and more beneficial to all nations. I believe it will be strengthened bilaterally  as In the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement  the largest commercial agreement in the history of two-way trade. It can also be strengthened regionally  as in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and in Europe as 1992 approaches.It must be strengthened  too  through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and multilateral talks such as the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. Progress in those talks is essential at the GATT mid-term review to be held in Montreal this December.Increased development assistance  especially to the poorest countries  is another imperative. Canada has just completed a review of its official development assistance policy. We have reset our bearings to improve the quality and increase the quantity of the help we give  to recognize the special role of women in development and to concentrate on the poorest people in the poorest countries.That is why Canada has completely written off the official development assistance debts of a large number of countries. It is surely reasonable that loans given for development purposes should not be allowed to become hindrances to that same development. None of this is altruism. All countries North and South  rich and poor  have an equal stake in a world in which wealth must be more equitably shared. That is why out assistance programme is now composed entirely of grants. We have affirmed that Canadian assistance will continue to increase to reach the target of 0.6 per cent of gross national product by 1995 and the desired 0.7 per cent target by the year 2000 - now less than 12 years away.I can best illustrate the importance that we attach to the United Nations by pointing out that Canada is the fourth largest contributor to the United Nations system. Most of its contributions are directed towards development assistance. But Canadians generally feel that more could and should be done. Africa is a very special case. Canada has taken seriously its responsibilities under the United Nations Programme for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. In 1986-1987  Canada disbursed a total of almost 31 billion in Africa  through all channels  multilateral  bilateral and non-governmental. Nearly half of our bilateral assistance will be directed to Africa over the next five years. But poverty in Africa and elsewhere cannot be ended solely through trade and help from developed countries  although these are vital parts of any effective international programme. It will require as well sound national economic and development strategies  and the Governments of the developing countries have a very direct responsibility to their own people to achieve substantial progress.I have said that we must devote the energies freed by greater security to two equally pressing problems. One is poverty; the other is environmental protection. The world is facing an environmental crisis of unparalleled magnitude. Nature is sending us an urgent message that we ignore at our peril. The signs of this crisis are all around us; shortages of timber  exhausted soil  desertification  depleted fish stocks  seals dying in the North Sea  beluga whales washing ashore in the St. Lawrence River in Canada itself. Some even maintain that we have reached the point where the survival of mankind is at risk.The Chairman of the World Commission on Environment and Development  Prime Minister Brundtland  has said that the threat to our environmental security is ""second only to nuclear war"". Now that we have lessened the likelihood of global nuclear war  we face invasion by rising seas  polluted air and encroaching deserts. There is a growing awareness that the environment  the economy and human health are inextricably linked. At the same time as we in the North suffer the effects of our industrial society's lack of regard for the environment  the South suffers from the environmental degradation engendered by poverty  by population growth and by pressure for immediate economic development.Destruction of the rain forest in Brazil  deforestation in sub-Saharan Africa and the pollution of drinking water in the sprawling cities of the developing world are the consequences  the simple  direct and inevitable consequences  of people in poverty seeking the simple means to survive. Without improved development opportunities they cannot be expected to do other than search for fuel  shelter and livelihood as best they can. We must help them  with their co-operation and friendship  to protect these precious resources. We require a new era of economic growth  but we need growth that sustains and expands the resource capital of all the countries of this planet  not growth that poisons the air we breathe and the water we drink.An aboriginal elder in Canada  speaking to a Canadian Government commission  said it best:""We did not inherit the Earth - we only hold it in trust for our children.""In a world in which rivers and winds cannot be contained by laws or borders it is clear that domestic initiatives by themselves are inadequate. Canadians know all about this. Our economy  as well as our environment  is being damaged daily by acid rain. We have taken important internal measures to address the problem. We have urgently pressed our neighbour to follow suit and to conclude a treaty with us that would reduce the environmental damage from this blight by stated amounts within specific time-frames. But acid rain is not limited to one nation or one continent: it is an international problem and it demands  I believe  a viable international solution. The greenhouse effect  the deterioration of the ozone layer and the disposal of toxic wastes are causes for legitimate concern both here and around the world.I am encouraged by the strong emphasis given to the environment by others in this year's debate. Problems of environmental protection require strengthened international co-operation  and the United Nations has a key role to play.As with security issues  important action has been initiated. The signature a year ago in Montreal of the Protocol on the protection of the ozone layer is a landmark example of what nations working together can accomplish. Ã urge all States which have not yet done so to sign and ratify the Protocol without delay. The increasingly urgent question of global warming and climate change received serious attention at the International Conference on the Changing Atmosphere in Toronto last June. Our goal should be an international framework convention for the protection of the atmosphere by 1992.We applaud the work of the United Nations Environment Programme in developing a global convention on the trans-frontier movements of hazardous wastes. We hope that it will be ready for signature by Member States next year. This powerful momentum must be maintained and even strengthened. Other steps are needed.Canada is supporting a feasibility study on a world conservation bank to work in concert with the World Bank. Canada is asking the World Bank at its annual meeting in West Berlin to strengthen the integration of environmental concerns into the design and implementation of its own projects. Canada fully supports the holding of an environmental summit at the Heads of Government level. Canada urges all corporations and international industrial and trade associations to develop  strengthen and vigorously apply environmental codes of conduct.Obviously  wealthier nations have to offer more assistance and greater support to help developing countries achieve growth which does not destroy their environment. And for that reason  the Canadian International Development Agency makes environmental protection one of its criteria for development projects. I want to announce today that Canada will establish a centre which will promote internationally the concept of environmentally sustainable development.This centre will be located in Winnipeg  Manitoba  and will work closely with the United Nations Environment Programme and other like-minded international institutions and organizations.Canada strongly supports the call for a United Nations conference on sustainable development in 1992.The global challenges we face are great  but we are proving that they can be met and that they can be resolved.Mankind is not destined to destroy itself. War is not inevitable. Poverty can be alleviated. The environment can be preserved. Injustices can be redressed.The United Nations is not and never will be - ever - a perfect institution. But in the last few years the United Nations has proved that it can make needed reforms and emerge as a stronger and more effective body. We must continue to improve this irreplaceable Organization. Our citizens will judge the United Nations not by the rhetoric of which we are capable  but by the actions that we have achieved in the past and of which are capable again in the future  by our practical successes in working together. An immunization programme that saves children's lives in a developing nation is  in itself  an enduring monument to the profound value of this institution. And surely  there are enough such monuments around to persuade any objective observer of the profound and ongoing value of an institution that treats its Members on a basis of equality and mutual respect. Because now  as the international political climate improves  the United Nations can play the role intended in the Charter.Lester Pearson  a great Canadian statesman who was present at the creation of this Organization  once observed that the United Nations is the ""living symbol of out interdependence  and embodies that emerging sense of international community  going beyond nation and region  which alone can save us in this nuclear age"".The United Nations  in my judgement and in the judgement of my Government  reflects the vision of our predecessors and the hope for our children.The agenda before the United Nations is compelling  and the choices are clears to manage the irresistible forces of change that swirl about us> to acknowledge the intimate interdependence of our world and of the issues before us; to ensure a more peaceful  more prosperous  more humane world  a world in which the strong nations are just  in which the rich nations are generous  a world in which all nations - all nations without exception - have the legitimate hope for greater economic and social justice  understanding as we all must that there is but one Earth for us to preserve for all of our children."
"27",1262,"CHL",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of the Government and people of Chile  I have pleasure in offering sincere congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. We are confident that in discharging his duties he will not only do honour to Latin America but also make a significant contribution to the progress and success of the work of this Assembly. It is particularly gratifying to Chile to see the Foreign Minister of the Argentine Republic presiding over our work  representing as he does a nation with which we are linked by geography  history  culture and an identical shared peace-loving tradition.Our congratulations go also to the Secretary-General and his team of collaborators whose active endeavours have been a positive factor in making it possible for this year's General Assembly to see promising signs of the closer approach of wider international peace.In this address I shall first express my country's opinion on some of the subjects that currently merit international consideration  and then I shall refer in particular to Chile  in view of certain important facts regarding our present situation.We note with satisfaction that the cause of order and peace has been strengthened. Just a year ago  in this same Hall  the hope was expressed that the new relationship being perceived between the United States and the Soviet Union really would establish a world a climate that would benefit the international community. The strategic agreements that materialized this year offer encouraging prospects and we  together with the other nations of the world  await the new advances which these Powers may succeed in achieving. Similarly  we hope that their concept oÂ£ peace and constructive international coexistence based on respect will not only induce them to safeguard their own interests but with an awareness of their influence on the world scene  also impel them to encourage just and balanced international development.We also hope that this newly declared spirit of peace may signify the end of hegemonist intentions or intervention  and will be translated into the effective ending of any such encouragement or assistance to violence as that given from well-known and condemned sources given to extremists groups in my country.Further  we note with satisfaction the announced withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan  the quadripartite negotiations between Cuba  South Africa  the United States and Angola on the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola; the beginning of the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  designed to lead to the independence of Namibia; the cease-fire agreed upon by Iraq and Iran; and recent reports regarding an agreement between the parties in the region of Western Sahara.These hopeful advances are part of a process that should continue without faltering until real and completely satisfactory results are attained. We hope that thus we hope  prolonged tribulations will come to an end. In this process  the Secretariat has made great efforts  which deserve our praise  and it should serve as a basis for new achievements in keeping with the paramount principles of the United Nations Charter.We should like to see these results augmented by new progress on the problems of ecology  denuclearization  outer space  free trade  underdevelopment  terrorism and drug trafficking  and on all the other challenges which mankind must confront in order to achieve the international common good. However  we continue to be concerned about situations affecting other nations and peoples which have not yet found definitive solutions.We note with sorrow the continued violence in the Middle East and its repeated effect on the life of the peoples there. This anguish is profound because many descendants of the Arab and Israeli peoples form part of the Chilean society and are dynamic elements in our nation.We reiterate the importance of the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  and the need to act realistically to bring about fair agreements that recognize the right of the Palestinian people to establish a sovereign State  and guarantee the peace and security of all the peoples of the region  including Israel  so that they may live within safe and internationally recognized boundaries.We also observe with great sorrow the continuance of the tragedy affecting the Lebanese people. We trust that the new circumstances that prevail internationally will contribute to the ending of this tragedy by a satisfactory solution for all the parties involved.We deplore the prolonged tragedy of Kampuchea whose people have been grievously attacked and subjected to sustained violence by a satellite of Soviet imperialism. I reiterate my country's recognition of the valour of those people in resisting the invader. We associate ourselves with the call by the Foreign Ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) last July for a prompt solution of the Kampuchean problem to end the threat to the stability of that region.We salute the Republic of South Korea on the completion of 40 years of its independence and applaud its efforts to unite its people. We value the call by the President of South Korea for dialogue between the two Koreas  and his Government's desire that both be incorporated into this Organization. On our continent  we share in the situation involving the peoples of Central America  a region that during the last decade has been harassed by the activities of foreign ideologists. We recognize the efforts of the Central American nations to achieve peace. We are confident that the renewed proposals for peace which have been reported to the international community  and to which I referred earlier  will be extended to this area  the countries of which are so closely tied to the Chilean people by principles of freedom  historical origin and traditional friendship. At the same time  we reaffirm our consistent rejection of any political or social policy that implies any kind of discrimination on racial or religious grounds. For this reason we reject apartheid and any other practice that disregards the equality of rights of man.We also maintain our traditional policy of supporting true decolonization. As members of the Special Committee on decolonization  we have supported its action in the case of New Caledonia. We observe with interest positive signs emerging in the actions of the administering power  that should lead to legitimate self-determination for the people of that territory.Similarly  as members of the Council for Namibia we shall continue to support compliance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Our action in the Council has taken on a special connotation this year because of the visit of a delegation from the Council to Chile. This permitted us to set forth our position clearly and pinpoint our offer of technical co-operation for the vocational training of Namibian experts in various fields.We add out condemnation and repudiation to the civilized world's rejection of terrorism. It is a scourge that besets society as a whole  an outrage against the normal life of citizens  their families and their property. Terrorist acts â and I say this in the light of experience in my own country - destroy the human individual or render him an invalid  demolishing in minutes what has taken our national heritage years to create. Furthermore  these acts are often orchestrated for imperialistic purposes or ideological expansionism  in order to undermine the integrity of nations and jeopardize their sovereignty. The world knows that there is a trans-national terrorism that still receives the overt or covert support of certain States. Moreover  the odious and repugnant links which at times become evident between terrorism and the drug traffic  bind together these two elements which destroy health and social coexistence. The most vigorous  definite and co-ordinated reaction on the part of the international community  without delay  is needed to eradicate these devastating perversions. One of the tests of the objectives of peace which certain Powers proclaim would be the degree of effective contribution they are able to offer to make such eradication a reality.We resolutely support the cause of human rights and reaffirm the co-operation which we have offered in support of the responsibility which this Organization should bear in this regard. We do so on this  the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  despite the ostensible discrimination to which we have been subjected.We want human rights to be protected effectively. To achieve this and it is necessary to introduce in-depth modifications into the instruments and the conduct with which States approach the treatment of the subject.Experience affirms the need to create juridical and procedural instrument that are universally binding  free of political and ideological content  that will guarantee non-discrimination  ensure impartial objectivity and preserve the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States The politicisation of the subject of human rights has served to distort its high and noble objectives. Use of the subject for political purposes  or to exert  unjustifiable pressure has led to manifestly erroneous actions and downright omissions and silences.This involves the risk of deterioration of the bases of peaceful and correct understanding between peoples and countries the very human rights and true values they represent.We fully share the uneasiness caused by the world economic situation  and especially that which affects developing countries. In recent years these nations have suffered from the combined effects of the deterioration in terms of trade  the high level of real interest rates  and the absence of any effective or realistic treatment of the problems arising from the recession of the beginning of the decade  and external debt.The destiny of the developing countries is closely linked to the possibilities for them to expand their international trade. For that reason  we view with concern the protectionist measures and disregard of multilateral commitments to liberalize trade which are emerging in the more developed countries.Protectionism restricts international relations in the modern world  intensifies the differences in the world community  and reduces the debtor's ability to meet its financial obligations.We are hopeful about the results of the Uruguayan Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  but we must point out that we cannot wait for the dismantling of protectionist barriers  or even accept the invoking of a dilatory excuse  such as the conclusion of a new round of negotiations.The foreign debt problem  in its multiple dimensions - political  social and economic - requires that the debtor countries  as well as the developed nations  assume their respective shares of responsibility - the former by pursuing internal adjustment and reforms that will lead to the strengthening of their economies  and the latter by curbing protectionist tendencies and increasing effective co-operation with the debtor countries.For those of us who  as in the case of my own country  have liberalized their economy and carried out an internal adjustment of profound ramifications  complying fully with all our commitments  the repercussions of international trade  protectionism and indebtedness have unquestionably a significance about which we cannot remain silent.We share a common destiny with the developing and industrialized nations alike. We seek an economic order in which all of us can grow. The future of humanity demands that this growth be balanced. To fail to contribute to it and to attempt simply to accept only the short-term advantages is to close one's eyes to tomorrow.In concluding this first section  I wish to voice the desire that world society should take to heart the profound appeal of His Holiness Pope John Paul II  who  in his last encyclical  said that in the natural interdependence of nations it was necessary to superimpose solidarity among them if an international order of peace and justice was to be achieved. We are encouraged by the hope that this Assembly is leading us on to that noble goal.I shall now refer to Chile. It seems an opportune moment to do so.Efforts have been made on the international scene to misrepresent the political realities of Chile. There has been no desire to believe the affirmations of my country and opinions  unjust and without foundation  have been expressed regarding the institutional process which it has been implementing. Time and again we have denounced and rejected the repeated attempts to interfere in our internal affairs. We do not accept attempts from outside to direct or influence the Chilean political process. As history confirms  grave crises suffered by some peoples have very often had their origin in colonialist designs or foreign intervention ism. The fundamental principles of international coexistence and the rights and powers of national sovereignties will be gravely impaired by any external abuse that interferes with a nation's own private political life.Within a few days the people of Chile will take a political decision of profound significance in its institutionalized transition to democracy. In response to the will of the Government and our citizens  the culmination of our current political process is beginning. A system of government  fully in accord with the constant norms of the political Constitution approved by the people in 1980  calling for a democratic system in keeping with Christian-Western values and principles  will be inaugurated. My participation in this Assembly coincides with this historic national moment. Objective appreciation of this event is certainly necessary for a better understanding of our reciprocal links and for the fusing of our common goal of progress.It is useful and appropriate to recall that in 1973 the Government of Chile took over a nation on the brink of material disintegration and of the loss of its national identity  with the imminent risk of being deprived of its sovereignty. It was a country in a shattered political  juridical  economic  social and moral condition. The institutions of the Republic had been seriously eroded or derided. The nation's economy was destroyed  its production sources paralysed  its international reserves exhausted. Chilean society was in crisis. The loftiest and permanent values of the nation were threatened. Since then the Government of President Pinochet has assumed the arduous and complex task of reclaiming Chile's democratic institutionality and opening the way to sustained progress  in harmony with the national common good.To make headway on this great task the labour and effort of all Chileans has been required. We have faced adverse conditions resulting from international crises and recessions  as well as from the lack of understanding and the difficulties that we have encountered even from those that shared our principles and were aware of the nature of our problem.This difficult task had the object of giving shape in Chile to an authentically free society  based on three fundamental pillars which mutually complement one another. These are  simultaneously  improvement of the Chilean's quality of life through social development  a social economy of the marketplace through economic development  and a solid participative democracy through political development. If an impartial  unbiased visitor were to check on what has been achieved in Chile  he would appreciate the substantial progress which the country has made at these three levels.As for quality of life and social development  the respective indexes are eloquent and the forecasts are promising. The marked increase in life expectancy  the virtual disappearance of illiteracy and serious infant malnutrition  the increase in school enrolment  the decline in extreme poverty  the noteworthy urban improvement  housing construction  the increase in the number of home owners and the decline in the rates of unemployment to figures even lower than those in more developed nations are some samples of our social achievements  and these will continue to increase in the interest of the welfare of all Chileans As far as the economy is concerned  the results obtained have been the object of praise and recognition in specialized technical circles. To mention only a few aspects in this area  it is worth noting that the fiscal budget has been balanced; inflation has been controlled  having been reduced from percentages greater than 6Ã¼Ã¼ per cent annually to 5.9 per cent in the first eight months of this year; an increase in the gross national product has been maintained for the fifth consecutive year; diversification of exports has substantially changed our position from that of being predominantly an exporter of a single product  with the result that  overall  exports have increased by more than 5 per cent  with the decisive participation of the private sector; and there has been negotiation of the servicing and reduction of the external debt.In the political sphere  we have always affirmed that Chile would restore its democratic regime  proceeding with a process of transition outlined in a detailed plan.The Political Constitution approved in 1980  which governs the country today  provided that in 1988 the people would be called upon to make a sovereign  free  secret and well-informed decision to elect a leader to assume the presidency of the Republic for the next term. It also provided that in 1989 the senators and deputies who would form the two branches of the National Congress would be elected by popular vote. To that end and to ensure the development of full democracy  the necessary legal regulations were prepared and put into effect.As a result Chile today has a sophisticated system of public electoral registration of its citizens which has enabled almost 7.5 million Chileans to participate now in the electoral process. That is 92 per cent of the possible total in the country - a percentage that not even the more developed nations have attained and that has certainly never before been reached in Chile. Similarly  the legislation that regulates the voting and scrutiny process guarantees the correctness of the voting system and its results. The secrecy of voting is guaranteed  as is public scrutiny  and the representatives of all the political parties can verify results in the voting precincts and associated areas. Any complaints that the electoral processes may produce are dealt with by the Election Qualifying Board  a politically independent organism  in accordance with the respective statutes.In compliance with the legislation on political parties  these are functioning in significant numbers  participating daily and constantly in the political debate in support of their respective options and argumentsIn addition to the ample freedom that exists for electoral publicity through the media - radio  newspapers and other written material - free time has been legally granted on all television channels  with equal periods for all the electoral options presented to the citizenry. Anyone who does not keep his eyes closed in Chile today can see all the publications representing the most diverse political points of view  and if he does not plug his ears he can also hear innumerable radio stations broadcasting programmes about the different party options.In addition  all the exceptional measures in effect in the country have been lifted  despite the persistence of extremist activity  so that total legal normality now exists. The last of the prohibitions on entry into the country established by virtue of the state of emergency  now revoked  has also been terminated.In sum  all these actions confirm the absolute resolve of the government and people of Chile to restore full democracy.Within this framework  Chile is now nearing the plebiscite to be held on 5 October  that is to say  a week from today. This plebiscite constitutes a form of election permitted once only under the Political Constitution as an extraordinary and exceptional measure. Its purpose is to allow Chileans an opportunity to give their majority support to the person proposed for the next presidential term and thus to ensure the best possible conditions for beginning the restored democratic institutional process. If this support is granted it will mean that the elected candidate has gained in a direct vote more than 50 per cent of the votes cast  a proportion which no one can contend does not represent the democratic will of a people. If that does not happen  a President of the Republic will be elected at the end of one year  in accordance with the general and permanent provisions of the Constitution.This is the culmination of Chile's institutional and political development. However  we are not unmindful of the obstacles still to overcome.We know that there are elements that seek a breakdown or failure of the institutional process  to the point that they have called for the electoral results to be disregarded or their constitutional effects modified. We also know that they will continue to try to distort the realities in Chile  through disinformation  creation of false images and falsification of results  and will even go so far as to charge fraud. Unfortunately  some of these disruptive elements seem to be able to rely on foreign complicity  or seek to obtain it. The Chilean Government will not hesitate to maintain order to guarantee free electoral expression by its citizens. Let the international community not be confused with regard to the situation in Chile. The facts I have just set forth confirm that the process that is now going on is in keeping with the deeply felt interests of the Republic  and enables it to face the future with stability  seeking the well-being of all Chileans.The democracy that is being restored in Chile today constitutes a system in which political and economic freedoms are solidly linked with social development. It is based on our conviction that it is this unity that will give it stability since socio-economic development gives the individual freedom in his personal and social life  and political development involves him in participation in the common good of the nation.We have full respect for the will of each nation and for the way in which each State manages its internal affairs. We have the right to ask that this respect be reciprocal.Let me say in closing that it is the desire and the confidence of Chile that this Organization which unites us will succeed in finding proper and timely answers to the desire for peace  justice and development so deeply felt in the world today and that it will also know how to inspire us to make a real contribution to the international common good  a responsibility we all must share."
"28",1308,"CHN",43,1988,"ï»¿May I begin by congratulating you warmly  Sir  on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. I am sure that  with your remarkable ability and rich experience and the concerted efforts of representatives from various countries  this session will be a success. I also wish to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  for his outstanding contribution in fulfilling the high mission of President of the last session.When the forty-second session of the General Assembly opened here a year ago people already saw signs of relaxation in the prolonged international tension. Now  a year later  when we look at the world situation again  the trend towards relaxation is definitely gaining greater momentum. Some problems that have long been a cause of concern are heading towards solution. The Soviet-United States Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - signed last December after many years of negotiations  is being implemented. Agreement was finally reached in April tills year on the Afghan question  which has been a cause of grave concern to the international community for more than eight years  and the Soviet troop withdrawal is now under way.Another issue of grave international concern is the eight-year-long war between Iran and Iraq  but the situation has at last taken a Favourable turn thanks to acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) by the two sides. The two countries have agreed to a cease-fire and are on the way to a negotiated peace. In south-west Africa  after long years of war and upheaval  the parties concerned have reached agreement in principle on the withdrawal of foreign troops from Angola and on the initial steps to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978) regarding the independence of Namibia. There have also been positive developments in the Horn of Africa  Western Sahara and the eastern Mediterranean. Efforts towards a settlement of the Middle East and Central American questions are also being made.Dialogue is playing an increasingly prominent role in improving the international situation. There has been frequent dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union  and also fairly active dialogue between the parties concerned on questions of regional conflicts. In various regional organizations and conferences in Asia  Africa and Latin America  in the Non-Aligned Movement and in many bilateral contacts  countries are seeking settlement of international  regional or bilateral issues through dialogue. This year saw the first meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Balkan region  which was aimed at boosting co-operation among the Balkan countries. In order to ease the situation on the Korean peninsula and promote the peaceful reunification of Korea  the north and the south of Korea are making contacts. Facts show fully that in today's world dialogue is taking the place of confrontation  and the tendency to seek the peaceful settlement of international disputes is growing. This is a striking feature of the present international situation. Obviously  it is the outcome of the common efforts of all countries and is deeply rooted in the events of the time.In the past 40 years or more since the Second World War history has made giant strides forward. The colonial system is now a thing of the past. Former colonies and  dependencies have become sovereign States one after another and stand on their own feet in the family of nations. Respect for each other's independence and sovereignty and opposition to foreign aggression and oppression has become a most important feature in the international politics of the day. The power politics that prevailed in former days are becoming less and less operative. Facts have shown time and time again that even the super-Powers  which possess strength unmatched anywhere in the world  cannot conquer weaker and smaller nations by force and impose their will on others. All their attempts have inevitably failed because of the resolute resistance of the peoples subjected to aggression and the widespread condemnation by the international community. This is thought-provoking.While the danger of war still exists  the forces of peace are steadily growing. People all over the world have voiced an increasingly strong demand for peace and against war. None of the third-world. East European or West European countries or other developed countries want to go through the holocaust of another world war. Even the super-Powers  which possess sufficient nuclear armaments to destroy the Earth several times over  do not believe that they could win a nuclear war. All these factors have helped to check the outbreak of another world war.Problems among developing countries ought to be settled through negotiation. Unfortunately  some differences have given rise to armed conflicts. There is a growing trend in developing countries towards seeking the peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue. This indicates that they are becoming more and more aware that their major historical task is to develop their national economies and improve the quality of people's lives  and that armed conflicts among themselves can only deplete their national strength  to the detriment of their fundamental interests. War means mutual disaster  while peace brings mutual benefit. If the third-world countries handle their relations in this spirit  it will greatly hasten their development and enable them to play a more effective role in the cause of maintaining regional and global peace. Rapidly developing science and technology  which is being translated into unprecedented great productive forces  spurs the development of the economy and is changing the face of human society. This is a salient feature of the present era. The aggregate strength of a country depends more and more on its economic  scientific and technological level. A review of post-war history clearly indicates that countries which practise hegemonism and engage in the arms race  foreign expansion and military conflicts have found their national strength seriously weakened  while those countries which devote themselves to the development of science  technology  the economy and education have rapidly grown strong. Some have even risen in the world as great economic Powers with advanced science and technology. Meanwhile  the third world is very active in the international arena as a growing political force. Many regional political and economic organizations are also playing an ever more important part in international affairs. With the combination of these elements  the world is moving from bipolarization to multipolarization  which  in our view  is conducive to peace.It is against such a backdrop that there emerges the trend of dialogue replacing confrontation and of the peaceful settlement of international disputes. These developments are a source of encouragement to the people of all countries.However  is the present world free from troubles? Obviously it is not. The root cause of turbulence in the world has not yet been removed. The peoples of all countries must make unremitting efforts to safeguard world peace.The world's peoples are faced with the common task of halting the arms race and striving for disarmament in order to preserve peace. The recently concluded third special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament represented a major effort by the international community to push forward the process of disarmament. Although the special session failed to achieve specific results because of the rigid positions taken by one or two countries  in disregard  of the reasonable demand of the vast majority of countries  the statements made by representatives of many countries and non-governmental organizations and the suggestions and propositions that they put forward mirrored the universal desire of the international community for peace and disarmament. The powerful public opinion arising there from has a positive impact on the promotion of the disarmament process. The special session enabled people to have a clearer picture of the present state of the arms race and the correct orientation of and approach to disarmament. On the question of disarmament  the Chinese delegation deems it necessary to expound the following three points at this session of the General Assembly.First  it is a welcome development that the United States and the Soviet Union have taken a step forward on the road to disarmament. However  we cannot but note that the huge nuclear arsenals they possess still pose a threat to world peace. The arms race between them is still going on. They are trying greatly to improve and upgrade the quality and function of their respective nuclear weapons  vying with each other to develop high-tech weaponry and extending the arms race to outer space. Hence  the disarmament task remains arduous and formidable.Secondly  countries across the world have repeatedly reaffirmed the important principle that the super-Powers  which possess the largest and most sophisticated arsenals  bear a special responsibility for disarmament and should take the lead in drastically cutting their arms. This is a correct direction and an effective approach for the realization of disarmament. We hope that the super-Powers will  in conformity with the trend of the times  quicken their pace on the road to disarmament and reach agreement on a drastic reduction of nuclear weapons at an early date  starting with a 50 per cent cut in strategic nuclear weapons. Their talks on conventional disarmament should also be speeded up and the arms race in outer space  in all its forms  should be halted. Thirdly  the question of disarmament concerns the security interests of all countries. Countries  big or small  strong or weak  all have the right to participate in the discussion and settlement of the disarmament question on an equal footing  and can each play a positive role. The super-Powers should respect and take seriously into consideration the reasonable demands and propositions set forth by the small and medium-sized countries. The United Nations and other multilateral disarmament agencies are important venues for the discussion and solution of this question by all parties on an equal basis. Their role should be strengthened. Multilateral and bilateral disarmament negotiations should complement and promote each other.The third special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament showed that most countries have identical or similar views on the aforementioned questions. We hope that the current session of the General Assembly will give full expression to the strong desire of these countries  and make significant progress towards disarmament. While there is greater effort to seek the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts through dialogue  the Flames of war in quite a Few conflict-ridden areas are yet to be extinguished. Dialogue on a number of issues has failed to make substantive progress. On some other issues  although agreements have been reached  the successful implementation of those agreements requires continued efforts by the parties concerned. In international relations the Chinese Government has all along advocated the observance of the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  mutual non-aggression  non-interference in each other's internal affairs  equality and mutual benefit  and peaceful coexistence. As regards regional conflicts  it has always stood for a fair and reasonable political settlement; therefore aggression must be stopped  foreign troops withdrawn and the sovereignty of all countries respected. Differences among developing countries should all the more be settled appropriately through peaceful negotiations on mutually acceptable terms.The Chinese Government has consistently opposed Israel's policy of aggression and expansion and supported the just struggle of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples and the efforts of the Arab countries and the Palestine Liberation Organization (Ð LO) to seek a solution to the Middle East question. We hope to see an early  fair and comprehensive solution to the question and an end to the turmoil caused by four decades of war  so that the people of the Middle East may enjoy peace again.We are concerned about peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. China supports the reasonable proposition of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country through consultation and dialogue and opposes any action that adds to tension on the peninsula.Following the decision of the Soviet Union to pull out lt4 troops from Afghanistan  the international community has voiced an even stronger demand for Vietnamese troop withdrawal from Kampuchea and for an end to the war of aggression. Regrettably  however  what the Vietnamese authorities have been doing runs counter to the desire and demand of the international community. While professing their readiness to withdraw their troops  they have put forward unreasonable demands in an attempt to delay their troop withdrawal and legalize the results of their aggression  so as to get what they have failed to achieve in their 10-year war of aggression. It should be stressed that on the Kampuchean question Viet Nam is the aggressor and the Vietnamese troops are the only foreign troops on Kampuchean territory. It is explicitly and solemnly stated in the very first Article of the United Nations Charter that to maintain international peace and security it is essential to take effective measures for the suppression of acts of aggression. Since the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea  the General Assembly has for nine successive years adopted resolutions calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea so as to facilitate the settlement of the Kampuchean problem by the Kampuchean people themselves  free from outside interference. All this shows that the international community brooks no legalization of the results of aggression. The Chinese Government considers it necessary for the current session of the General Assembly to reiterate those just demands and to uphold the sanctity of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.The Chinese Government has for the past decade worked hard towards a fair and reasonable settlement of the Kampuchean question. Recently it has further elaborated its position on the question  which can be summed up in the following five points.First  a complete withdrawal by Viet Nam of its troops from Kampuchea is the key to a settlement of the Kampuchean question. The Vietnamese side should produce  as soon as possible  a timetable for its troop withdrawal from Kampuchea within a short period of time. Secondly  we favour the establishment  with Prince Norodom Sihanouk in charge  of a provisional quadripartite coalition government in Kampuchea as Viet Nam withdraws its troops from the country. Each faction's candidates for the provisional government should be proposed by the faction itself but should be acceptable to the other parties concerned. We stand for a quadripartite coalition in Kampuchea. We are against the exclusion of any of the four factions from it or the exercise of power by any one faction alone.Thirdly  upon the establishment of the provisional quadripartite coalition government of Kampuchea  a freeze should be imposed on the activities of the Kampuchean armed forces of all factions. They should refrain from becoming involved in politics and interfering in the general election  so that the Kampuchean people may conduct a free election in the absence of outside interference and the threat of force. To prevent a civil war in Kampuchea the existing armed forces of all factions might be disbanded  to facilitate the creation of a unified national defence force composed of an equal number of officers and men from each of the four factions  under a unified command.Fourthly  practical and effective international supervision should be instituted over Viet Nam's troop withdrawal  the maintenance of peace in Kampuchea and the conduct of a free election there. To that end the Chinese Government supports the proposition for the sending to Kampuchea of an international peace-keeping force and an international control committee.Fifthly  when the parties concerned have reached agreement on a political settlement of the Kampuchean question  China will be ready to join other countries in an international guarantee for an independent  neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea.It must be clear to all that China seeks no self-interest in Kampuchea as in any other region of the world. The Chinese Government's position is based entirely on the principle of opposing aggression  upholding justice and safeguarding the United Nations Charter and the norms governing international relations. It is our hope that the international community will continue to work under this principle for a fair and just settlement of the Kampuchean question.We should attach adequate importance to world economic problems while paying attention to the international political situation. The current world economic development is extremely uneven  despite the presence of a few positive factors. Worrisome problems still exist and some have even gone from bad to worse. While developed countries have enjoyed economic growth for six successive years  developing countries have suffered severe economic setbacks. Many of them have witnessed increasing signs of stagnation in the process of development. The economic difficulties of African countries have aroused wide concern. The heavy debt burden  reduced inflow of funds  worsening trade terms and growing protectionism have all seriously hampered the economic growth of developing countries. All this demonstrates that present international economic relations are becoming increasingly out of accord with the needs of economic growth in the world and of developing countries in particular.In the present-day world there is even greater economic interdependence among countries. Developed countries will find it difficult to sustain their economic growth if developing countries long remain in difficulties and their economies cannot move ahead. It is an urgent task in the international economic sphere to improve  by effective measures  the external environment of developing countries in such fields as commodities  trade  debt  capital  currency and finance. That would contribute not only to resumed growth and development of developing countries but also to the stability and growth of the world economy. Recently the Group of 77 has proposed the convening of a special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to economic matters. The United Nations Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  has also proposed a summit meeting similar to the Cancun Meeting. The Chinese Government seconds those proposals and hopes to see increased North-South co-operation through dialogue and the invigoration of the world economy.Over the past few years  regional economic co-operation has increased markedly  which is an important trend in international economic relations. We believe that regional co-operation based on equality and mutual benefit is of positive significance  for it helps the development of different regions. At the same time I should like to emphasize that in the present world economic conditions neither a country nor a region can achieve development and prosperity behind closed doors. It has to open itself to the outside world. Trade protectionism  while harming others  is in the final analysis detrimental to the initiator as well. It is our hope that countries and regions across the world will open up to and complement one another  to the benefit of their common development and prosperity.As there is growing regional co-operation in the world  co-operation and development in the Asia-Pacific region have attracted more and more attention in recent years. This region is indeed making rapid economic progress and has tremendous potential. However  the development level varies with different countries in the region  where many countries remain underdeveloped or even impoverished. As a large country in the region  China supports regional economic co-operation. China's development is closely linked with that of the Asia-Pacific region. We hope to see closer co-operation and the common prosperity of all countries in the region. China will implement unswervingly the policy of deepening reform and wider opening to the outside world. It is opening itself to the whole world  including the developed and developing countries  countries whose social systems are similar to or different from the system of China. Recently  we have adopted new measures in an effort to restructure our foreign trade and improve our investment environment. Most important  we have mapped out an economic development strategy for China's coastal regions. Those regions  which cover an area of about 320 000 square kilometres with a population of 160 million  boast a better infrastructure  greater economic and technological strength and higher quality of labour force. Accelerating their opening-up and strengthening their multi faceted  multi channel and multiform economic and technological co-operation with the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world will not only speed up China's economic development but also make positive contributions to the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and that of the world as a whole.This year marks the fortieth anniversary of the adoption by the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Forty years ago the people and Governments of various countries that had suffered from the catastrophe of the two world wars worked out and adopted that Declaration through their joint efforts. It is the first international instrument that systematically and specifically sets forth respect for and protection of fundamental human rights. Despite its historical limitations  the Declaration has exerted a Far-reaching influence on the development of post-war international human rights activities and has played a positive role in that regard. In the past four decades the concept of human rights has continuously developed  and its content has been enriched and its theory improved. A series of subsequent declarations and conventions concerning human rights has further developed and stipulated in detail the specific content of each human right. In this connection particular mention should be made of such important items as the right to national self-determination  the right to racial equality  the permanent sovereign right over natural wealth and resources and the right to development. All those are of great significance to the fight for equality  freedom and liberation waged by the nations and peoples under the apartheid system of foreign aggression and oppression  to the efforts made by countries newly independent in the post-war period to preserve their sovereignty and territorial integrity and to the demands of the developing countries for restructuring the irrational international economic situation. The Chinese Government has always appreciated and supported the United Nations efforts to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms  in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.Three years ago  from this solemn rostrum  the Chinese leader Zhao Ziyang pointed out that the world needs the United Nations  while the United Nations needs the support of the world. Events have repeatedly testified to that important thesis. With the passage of time the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter  which are increasingly recognized as norms governing international relations and as an embodiment of the lofty ideals of mankind  are playing an ever greater role in the international community.Despite its inadequacies the United Nations is irreplaceable in its role as the most broadly representative and most influential international organization in the world. Gone are the days when a few big Powers could manipulate world affairs. The United Nations is the proper forum in which countries meet to discuss world affairs. It has proved itself capable of doing important work  and it has great potential for solving questions facing mankind  questions such as those of the environment  population  public health and scientific and technological development. Above all  it should be pointed out that in recent years the Security Council and the Secretary-General  with the support oÂ£ Member States  must be credited with achievements in promoting the settlement of major international disputes. Here  I want to present my compliments to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  and to wish him continued successes in his peace mission. The importance of the United Nations role is on the rise  in keeping with the expectations of our time. The people of the world expect the United Nations to play a greater role in maintaining world peace  in spurring development and in strengthening international co-operation. As a permanent member of the Security Council  China is ready to continue to work with other Member States for the realization of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter."
"29",1388,"CMR",43,1988,"ï»¿I thank you for the kind words you have just said as you bade me welcome to the Assembly.Allow me to congratulate you on your well-deserved election to the presidency of this session and to express the hope that  under your guidance  its work will be successful.It gives me great pleasure also to extend my warm greetings to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whom we had the pleasure of welcoming to Cameroon at the beginning of this year. As you are well aware  Cameroon owes its existence to the United Nations. It is therefore deeply attached to this Organization  which played a decisive role in its accession to independence.I would like to express our sincere appreciation to the Secretary-General for his devotion to the service of our Organization. I take this opportunity also to reiterate our support for the considerable efforts he is making to promote peace and co-operation in the world in spite of the prevailing economic difficulties.I also wish to extend my congratulations to the United Nations peace-keeping forces  which have just been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. We are on the eve of the year 2000  a turning point in the history of mankind. We will also be responsible for the smooth or faulty take-off of this new millennium.The duty of each and every one of us is to ensure the future of generations to come in the best possible circumstances. If we take a quick look at the world today the words that keep coming up are: crisis; conflicts; poverty; ignorance; disease; disasters; and injustice. Yet never before have science and technology offered the opportunities they offer today for us to overcome poverty and disease and never before have the various means of communication offered such tremendous possibilities for abolishing distances; but never before has a political and economic crisis reached the extent of today's crisis.The United Nations  it must be recognized  is doing what it can to improve international relations from both the political and the economic points of view. All these efforts notwithstanding  much still remains to be done. Every conflict stands in the way of progress. Progress depends inevitably on entente  consultation and mutual respect.Because of their unavoidable interdependence  States should regard the United Nations as a neutral forum wherein they harmonize their positions and settle their disputes in a peaceful and mutually beneficial manner - and this is possible. Politically  the new climate between the Soviet Union and the United States is an example. The commitment of those two great nations to report to the international community  in particular to the Conference on Disarmament  on the progress and results of their negotiations is a decisive step towards peace.The determination of the major Powers to work more closely together leads us to expect other encouraging results. In Afghanistan  the partial withdrawal of Soviet troops holds out hope for new developments. In the Western Sahara  the peace plan proposed by Mr. Perez de Cuellar has been accepted. The Chad-Libya border conflict appears to be moving towards a negotiated settlement. Many leading African Presidents have made ceaseless efforts to achieve a peaceful settle it. Such a settlement would certainly constitute a great victory for them and for the whole of Africa. The situation in the Horn of Africa also allows us to be hopeful. Efforts to normalize relations between Ethiopia and Somalia should be encouraged and supported. In Angola the peace talks between the parties concerned are continuing in Brazzaville. Following the cease-fire agreement in August  the talks between Iran and Iraq begun in Geneva are to be resumed.However  the odious system of apartheid is still thriving in South Africa and  to date  in spite of United Nations Security Council resolutions 435 (1978) and 601 (1987) Namibia continues to be deprived of its independence  A solution to this conflict would also enable the independent States of the subregion to continue  in an atmosphere of peace and security  the work of nation-building which has been undermined by the attacks and acts of economic sabotage perpetrated by the rebels armed by racist South Africa. We will continue to support a people fighting for a just cause  namely human dignity.Out present economic difficulties should not prevent us from honouring our commitments to the Special Fund of the Co-ordinating Committee for the Liberation of Africa and to the Action for Resisting Invasion  Colonialism and Apartheid (AFRICA) Fund. We should also continue to help the freedom-fighters of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) and the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC)  as well as the front-line States.Once more I call on all forces of peace  on all nations  to exert pressure and to adopt comprehensive and mandatory economic sanctions against the racist regime of Pretoria.The situation in the Middle East remains disturbing. Cameroon  which maintains relations of friendship and co-operation with all States of the region  condemns the escalation of violence. I sincerely hope that dialogue will replace such violence and enable all parties concerned to seek a just and lasting peace. It is high time for the international community to find an appropriate solution.Numerous hotbeds of tension still persist also in Latin America and Asia  and we must commit ourselves to restoring calm. The encouraging results achieved in the Sahara  in Afghanistan  in Angola and in Chad are proof that it is always possible to find an appropriate solution: what is needed is to demonstrate seriousness and good faith.Unwavering determination must be applied to resolving the severe economic crisis afflicting the third world. Consultation designed to find solutions to the poverty in which three fourths of mankind is living is as necessary and as important as the quest for solutions to  inflicts. The economic picture of the past few years has been appalling. Imbalances are worsening. Rich countries are enjoying growing prosperity. Whereas the natural resources of developing countries no longer suffice even to meet the basic needs of their peoples. The African countries have now come to realise that they must first count on themselves and on their own efforts.Confronted with this very serious situation we have taken measures aimed at stabilizing our economy and  in the long term  bringing about its recovery. We no longer want to be dependants. We have either abandoned or reconsidered certain development projects and we have cut down on State expenditure. Certain companies have been obliged either to close down or to lay off staff. We are all aware of the gravity of the situation.The special session of the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the Plan of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. However  within the context of the world crisis it is not enough to constitute subregional bodies or to define short-term priorities to stimulate our growth and reduce the vulnerability of our economies.The prices of our basic products have reached the lowest level in the past 50 years. Our export earnings have dropped alarmingly  while the prices of the capital goods and finished products we import are continually rising. As if that were not enough  our manufactured goods meet with the protectionist policies of the industrialized North.The result is that our balance of payments is registering a serious deficit. That deficit is further aggravated by the burden of our external debt and by monetary disorders. It is true that we want to settle our debt  but we do not have the means to do so. It is therefore logical and imperative that we examine with our creditors those solutions that will allow us to replay our debts and still save our economies from total collapse.Everything that has been done to contain this situation has come up against a hostile International environment. We are working more  we are managing better  we are producing more  yet the sharp drop In the prices of raw materials  the reduction of financial aid for development  the enormous debt burden  inflation and fluctuating exchange rates  the lack of dialogue  which is crucial to bringing about a more just economic order - all those elements constitute impediments to the progress of the African continent and threaten the future of the world.As we are well aware  world stability concerns both developed and developing countries. We are waiting for the international community to make greater efforts and to adopt concrete measures. Decisions taken by a certain number of developed countries  such as Canada and France  and those taken at the summit meeting of the Seven in Toronto  constitute the beginning of positive action.We ate not asking for charity  we are seeking help in order to resolve the serious problems that concern us all. Every one of us has a stake in this - it is not a one-way street. Assisting developing countries out of the crisis means opening up new markets to industrialized countries  new markets for their products. The solutions exist  and all we need is to seek them whole-heartedly.Politically  the major Powers have demonstrated that when they want something it can be achieved. That applies to the economic crisis as well. We need only have the Will.For us  the United Nations represents a forum for consultation and for seeking solutions. The United Nations reflects the common determination of nations to work together. The United Nations is an assembly. It is a force to reckon with  a powerful tool for development. Let us learn to use it together."
"30",1430,"COD",43,1988,"ï»¿The forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly has elected Mr. Dante Caputo to preside over its work as President. Accordingly  on behalf of my delegation  I should like to extend to him  in these happy circumstances  our most sincere and warmest congratulations.Zaire  which co-operated very closely with Mr. Peter Florin  President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly and also of the third special session devoted to disarmament  would like  as outgoing Chairman of the First Committee  to express our great esteem for him and our appreciation for the outstanding success achieved throughout his term of office  which has just recently ended. To the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar - a tireless pilgrim in the service of international peace and security - my delegation extends all its gratitude for having found time  despite his many international obligations  to make an official visit to Zaire from 16 to 18 February 1988  in order to become personally acquainted with the facts about my country and its people. The people of Zaire as a whole were able to appreciate the significance of this official visit  which followed logically on those made earlier by the late Dag HammarskjÃ¶ld and the late U Than t during the crucial period of our history.Thus today Zaire is able  more than any other country  to appreciate the cost of the peace  so dearly won thanks to the determination of the United Nations to strengthen our independence and ensure our unity.The many successes that have been achieved so brilliantly by our Secretary-General in the peaceful settlement of some international conflicts of the present time demonstrate the effectiveness and the relevance of his action and also enable us fully to appreciate his great talents as a superb diplomatic and a skilled negotiator. The Nobel Peace Prize awarded today to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is indeed moving and eloquent proof of the contribution our international Organization is making to the cause of international peace and security.May I say how happy the delegation of my country  Zaire  is to find itself once again here at this international gathering  the greatest forum of all times  which we all regard as the conscience of the world. We  the representatives of peoples  Governments  States and various communities  are given another opportunity to think aloud  together  about the situation of the human race.A feature of the present international situation is the resolve of the majority of States to settle their disputes by peaceful means  as provided for in Article 33 of the United Nations Charter. Thus  the Organization is continuing to play its primary role in the maintenance of international peace and security. It now has increased importance as the universally recognized body seeking  through negotiation  inquiry  mediation  conciliation or any other peaceful means  solutions to the conflicts pitting Member States one against the other. The relaxation of tension in  inter alia  Afghanistan  Democratic Kampuchea  the Persian Gulf and Western Sahara  thanks to action taken by the United Nations - symbolized by its Secretary-General - and with the valuable support of the two super-Powers  whose interests seem to be converging  is a tangible example of that.These far-reaching changes that are progressively taking place hold the promise that relations of trust will develop between East and West  and we hope that this will help to strengthen North-South relations as well.Recently the international community has been witnessing a more or less positive development in regard to conflicts in the world. Indeed  the efforts made by the Security Council that led to the adoption of resolution 598 (1987) enabled the Secretary-General to continue his consultations and negotiations with the Foreign Ministers of Iraq and Iran  following the Iranian Government's acceptance of that resolution  and those consultations finally led to the cease-fire in the war that had lasted since 1979 between Iraq and Iran - two brother countries and  moreover  members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. The dimensions that the so-called oil war in the Persian Gulf were assuming had become a matter of increasing concern to the international community  with so many human lives being lost on both sides  so many ships being sunk and so many aircraft being shot down. My country  Zaire  sincerely hopes that the commitments entered into by the two parties will be scrupulously respected so that peace and security may be restored to that sensitive region of the world. The international community is glad to see that the Afghan people is now about to exercise fully its sovereignty and control over all its national territory  pursuant to the Geneva agreements of 14 April 1988  which entered into force on 15 May 1988 and which are based on the total withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. That is fully in keeping with the aspirations of that people  whose country is also a member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.My delegation believes that this example being set by the Soviet troops should be followed by the Vietnamese troops in Democratic Kampuchea so that the people of that country may be able to regain its dignity  freedom and unity.The talks which were held at Bogor from 25 to 28 July 1988 between the Foreign Ministers of the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Viet Nam and the representatives of the four political factions in Kampuchea led to the establishment of a working group of high officials of all those countries  which the mandate of studying in depth all aspects of a political solution to the Kampuchean problem.It can be hoped that the wind favourable to dialogue that is blowing through Asia will reach the two Koreas. In that connection  my delegation feels that the admission of those countries to membership of the United Nations could only strengthen the role they are already playing on the international scene.While the spirit of harmonization and concertation prevails in the Far East  the same cannot  alas  be said of the Middle East  where there is still fierce antagonism and hostility which constantly fans hatred. Despite the efforts made by some States directly involved in the conflict  and despite the efforts of the United Nations  no progress seems to have been made on the road to a comprehensive  peaceful settlement of that issue. So far as my country  Zaire  is concerned  the State of Israel exists and is a Member of the United Nations  just as the Palestinian people is a living reality that should also have a State and become a Member of our universal Organization.That is why my country appeals urgently to all the parties involved not to listen to the sirens of discord but  rather  to adopt a more conciliatory attitude that would be more favourable to dialogue. For it is by recognizing everyone's inalienable right to existence within a nation that all the Member States of our Organization can demonstrate their devotion to the purposes and principles of the Charter.The United Nations has adopted many resolutions calling on the white minority regime to put an end to the political system of apartheid in South Africa  which has been almost unanimously regarded as a crime against humanity. The Republic of Zaire  linked by geography  history and culture to southern Africa  is following with particular interest the developments in that part of the continent. The quadripartite negotiations currently under way between those mainly concerned should be encouraged by the international community  because the process augurs well for the independence of Namibia and because the resulting withdrawal of foreign troops from Angola and Namibia would set that region on the right road  so that an atmosphere of peace and trust could develop between the protagonists.My delegation also takes a positive view of developments in Western Sahara and Chad  where the consultations that have now begun between the parties offer the prospect of a lasting  peaceful solution.It is also encouraging that in Central America substantial progress has been made in the peace process since the signing of the Esquipulas II and Sapoa agreements.Turning to the economic situation  I should like to begin by presenting some food for thought from a recent publication called ""Pour l'Afrique""  which says among other things:""The subsoil of Africa has a very high mineral content. We already know that it contains 97 per cent of the world's reserves of platinum  64 per cent of manganese  25 per cent of uranium. Copper in Zambia and Zaire  lead in Namibia  cobalt in Zaire and Zambia  nickel in Botswana and Zimbabwe  phosphates in Morocco  Senegal and Togo  gold  silver and diamonds throughout southern Africa ... Iron is perhaps the most promisingÂ·  while world reserves are being exhausted  there are enormous deposits in Gabon  Senegal  Guinea and Mauritania. For a world industry that is hungry for raw materials  Africa is the continent of the future."" Completing the picture  the author adds:""Commodity prices today in real terms represent only 20 per cent of what they were in I960. In 1985 international trade in manufactured goods increased by 6 per cent while trade in agricultural and mineral products dropped by 2.5 per cent. Increased competition  protectionism  monetary disorder  the high cost of energy ... Africa has been hit by them all.""In a nutshell  that is the gloomy  negative and sharply contrasted picture of the international economic situation  particularly as regards relations between the industrialized countries of the northern hemisphere and the developing countries of the southern part of our planet.In this connection  it should be emphasized that the depth of the crisis disrupting the world economy requires concerted action rather than timid sectoral  superficial and inconsistent patching up. Against that background  re-launching a true and sincere dialogue between North and South with a view to establishing a new international economic order  in the interests of all peoples  would be very timely  for such a dialogue could bring about the dawning of a new economic order based on justice and collective responsibility towards mankind. It could provide solutions to the major economic problems of today  one of which  clearly  is the external debt of the developing countries. That burden  now amounting to several billion dollars  jeopardizes all prospects of developing our countries and undermines all possibility of growth.Our countries' export earnings are diverted to the payment of external debts  instead of being used to finance development; our countries have become net exporters of capital and reservoirs of financial resources for countries that are already developed. Therefore  an agreed approach based on the principle of shared responsibility between debtors and creditors is necessary  for the imperatives of economic development and growth must be given precedence and be among the top priorities.We should highlight the dichotomy between the speedy enrichment of some and the equally speedy pauperization of others  although they ate linked by relations of interdependence. My delegation believes that it is worth expressing the hope that the world will finally become aware of the situation and provide the necessary remedy before it is too late. My country  Zaire  attaches great importance to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  whose fortieth anniversary the United Nations will celebrate on 10 December this year. We are also happy to note that today  29 September 1988  is the tenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  containing the plan for Namibia's independence  and is also the date chosen by the two super-Powers at their recent Moscow summit to draw up a schedule for the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola.In accordance with resolution 41/129  which encourages all Member States to take appropriate steps for the establishment of national institutions for the protection and promotion of human rights  a Department of the Rights and Freedoms of Citizens was set up in Zaire in 1986. Its mandate includes in particular gathering and considering the complaints and grievances of any citizen whose rights and freedoms have been unjustly violated by the public authorities  by any decision of the courts or in any other way  when all other legally authorized remedies have been exhausted or found ineffective  and when the injustice has been declared to be flagrant. Apart from Africa's physical and moral suffering  some parts of the continent also suffer from drought  desertification and the invasion of locusts  while the resulting famine strikes millions of human beings.The difficult issue of toxic and radioactive waste is a matter of major concern to third-world countries  and particularly to Africa  at the present time. It was therefore with good reason that on 4 October 1973 Marshal Mobuto Sese Seko  President of the Republic of Zaire  said from this very rostrum? ""In Zaire we are flattered when we are considered as the champions of the protection of nature. But what is the use of this national effort if our efforts are cancelled out by people thousands of kilometres away from us?"" (A/PV.2140  p. 76) The true import of those words can indeed be felt today. From 31 May to 26 June 1988 the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament was held here in New York. At that time the international community hoped that the new atmosphere of understanding that had developed between the two major nuclear Powers would extend to other Member States following the signing in Washington on 8 December 1987 and the ratification in Moscow on 1 June 1988  of the Treaty on the Elimination of Medium-Range and Shorter-Range Nuclear Missiles. The General Assembly at that time hoped that that joint action by the nuclear Powers would have a positive impact on other nuclear Powers. However disappointing the resolutions of the third special session devoted to disarmament may be  this cannot in any way weaken the resolve of the international community to follow the new path that has been traced out by the super-Powers with a view to general and complete disarmament under effective international control. A British philosopher said: ""Those who do not act together cannot act fruitfully. Those who do not act in trust cannot act together. Those who are not bound by shared views  shared feelings and shared interests cannot act in trust.""Since the international community has shared interests it must act in trust so as to act fruitfully to ensure the survival of the human race.As an African thinker said:""It is at this price  and this price only  that we can avoid despairing of ourselves  for in this way we will have acted as men - men of peace  men of dialogue  men of magnanimity  men of a generation that has not lived for nothing and that  after exploring the Moon  having passed by the planets Mars and Saturn  touched on Venus  admired Orion  has come back to Earth  its head ' held high  to take charge of its own fate - the fate of mankind.""

"31",1476,"COG",43,1988,"ï»¿The Government of the Congo is at present involved in a process  of negotiations whose goal is to resolve the question of Namibia and to establish peace in southern Africa. This is a historic moment. The whole world expects it to lead to a new era for the peoples concerned and for the whole international community.In coming to this rostrum I am deeply conscious of the great honour that  the highest authorities of my country have done me in appointing me to speak on their behalf at the forty-third session of the General Assembly.It is in the nature of nations to conceive of great designs; this memorable law  of course  did not take shape at the founding of the United Nations  but found in it satisfactory expression  and today its most exalting hour has come. Rising above threats and insults  after the cataclysm of a total world war  the United Nations has succeeded in pursuing what is clearly its goal of goalsÂ·  the search for and the maintenance of International peace.We are glad to see that for 43 years this goal has been achieved  and that mankind as a whole has been preserved from a total o annihilation. But this year  1988  our Organization bears within it a magnificent hope  and all nations of the world  in trust and in confidence; are looking towards it. That hope offers our Organisation new opportunities for constructive action.My delegation wishes to express its gratitude and pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his readiness and perseverance in the area of peace and international security. When we read what he has written we see that the principal organs of the United Nations have been working more and more in the way the Charter intended. As he notes  the working relationship of the Security Council and the Secretary-General has rarely  if ever  been closer. The events of recent months - in regard to which we feel we must express the Congo's appreciation and indicate what our country wants for the future - have highlighted the potential of our Organization and the legitimacy of the hopes that the peoples of the world have pinned on it and on multilateralism.Before I begin  however  I wish to extend to the President the very warmest congratulations of the delegation of my country to the forty-third session. Argentina  which  thanks to Mr. Caputo's remarkable qualities and high diplomatic office  has recently acceded to the eminent place it now occupies in Latin America  belongs  like my country  the Congo  to the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. I note  for example  that our two countries have recently taken an active part in ensuring the success of the first meeting of States of the Zone of Peace and Co-operation of the South Atlantic  which was held in Rio de Janeiro. My delegation cannot but be delighted to see Mr. Caputo presiding over the forty-third session of the General Assembly  which will be considering  among other things  the conclusions readied at that meeting. I should like also to express our sincere gratitude to his predecessor. Comrade Peter Florin  President of the forty-second session  for the competent manner in which he conducted the work of the Assembly.The people of the People's Republic of the Congo  like all the peoples of the world that cherish peace  felt a sense of justified pride when it learnt that the Nobel Committee had decided must month to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces.I should like here to recall with satisfaction that a few months ago the People's Republic of the Congo held a non-permanent seat on the Security Council  and directly contributed  in that position of privilege  to the performance of the tasks of that most prestigious organ of the United Nations  which has very special responsibilities in the maintenance of international peace and security.The Congo is  then  well aware that the tribute thus paid by the Nobel Committee to those men and women  those guardians of peace  and to their bravery and courage as they work for peace in many  often dangerous  theatres of operations throughout the world  was well deserved.This Prize  this most distinguished award  encourages the Secretary-General in his constant attitude of tireless patience and in the efforts he makes with a persistence rarely equalled today  particularly in the Persian Gulf  Afghanistan  Western Sahara and Namibia. How could my delegation not once again pay a tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar for those achievements which strengthen our Organization and its role in the cause of peace? It is encouraging to see our Organization's name now closely linked to the settlement of complex conflicts that have been up to now stalemated. Most of the significant negotiations on them have been begun either within the United Nations or through its intervention. There is no doubt that there are still many hotbeds of tension in the world. A heavy toll in death  destruction and atrocities of all kinds continues to be taken  in particular in the occupied Arab territories  in Lebanon  in South Africa and in Latin America  where  despite the activities of the Contadora Group and the Lima group  the Esquipulas II Agreements  are being put to the severest tests  even though it is essential that they be respected and implemented.In the case of South Africa  a country still governed by absurdity and still under the rod of a minority upholding the hateful regime of apartheid and its iniquitous laws  the black majority of the population continues  in the midst of the fiercest repression exacerbated by the state of emergency  courageously to seek its path and to struggle.The illegal military occupation of Namibia by South African troops has not come to an end. It has for ten years been hindering the urgent and unconditional implementation of the United Nations peace plan contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) which is to lead Namibia to independence.So we see how in many areas of the world the exercise of democracy and the enjoyment of fundamental human rights are still seriously hindered by dictatorial powers and practices. What is more  policies of confrontation have not disappeared. Tempered by political realities  we have learned that one cannot change the nature of things by simply recalling principles but only by translatingthose principles into practical reality. And yet today the international situation does reflect several important changes and signs of detente.The dialogue begun between the Soviet Union and the United States of America and the agreements reached by the two super-Powers have  with the help of the determined will of the peoples of the whole world for peace  generated this indispensable climate of detente.The United Nations  taking the best advantage of this improvement in relations  has opened up new avenues for its own activity. Thus  thanks to this flowering of diplomacy  the process for settling various local or regional conflicts has been strengthened.By way of example  the guns have really fallen silent between Iran and Iraq. The Congo is pleased that those two countries  which are among the eminent members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  should have agreed to begin direct talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General.This exercise  certainly a difficult one  on which the parties embarked no later than last week in New York  shows that the chances for the establishment of a lasting peace are real and that the prospect of reconstruction is drawing closer.This success is of considerable importance for the region. It does honour to the parties concerned  and my country invites them to persevere in this course and to continue to co-operate closely with the Secretary-General. Like the cease-fire established on 20 August last  the progress being made equally rewards the sustained efforts of the United Nations. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) - which the Congolese delegation knows well since as a member of the Security Council  it assisted at the time in its adoption - provided the basis for the current negotiations. Once again I would like to stress the role of wise mediator played by the Secretary-General in this process of settling the Iran-Iraq conflict. The course of events with regard to the situation in Afghanistan is also promising. The allied troops have indeed withdrawn from that country in conformity with the Geneva Agreements of last April. My country welcomed those Agreements as a contribution to peace and a decisive step towards a solution that will enable all Afghans to exercise their right to self-determination. In regard to the Geneva Agreements  the Secretary-General stresses that this is the first time that the two most powerful States of our world have become guarantors of an agreement negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General.What is more  the genera  feeling with regard to situations of armed conflict is that the intensity of those conflicts has declined. The possibility of finding peaceful solutions to the situations in those troubled regions has thus been considerably strengthened.The prospects for a settlement in South-East Asia  in particular in Kampuchea  in recent months have benefited from many initiatives  among them the recent talks in Indonesia. Diplomatic efforts should lead to the establishment of institutions with the broadest possible national representation.We have noted many diplomatic efforts with a view to finding points of agreement on the question of Cyprus. The good offices of the Secretary-General  employed under a mandate from the Security Council  are beginning to give rise to favourable reactions. My country encourages the parties concerned in this course.< Â· "" Â·The number and variety of so many positive and important talks show how it is possible to build peace among nations that agree to enter into dialogue  and there are no conflicts or situations threatening international peace and security  however complex or acute they may be  that are irremediably stalemated.In Africa  N'Djamena and Tripoli are irrefutable proof  if proof we need  of this. The two capitals have announced that they will begin to restore diplomatic relations between their two countries. Congo encourages the authorities of Chad and Libya to pursue their efforts and  in the interests of their two peoples and the neighbouring countries  to find a peaceful and lasting solution to the border conflict between them.The Congo welcomes these prospects for peace and reasonableness  which observers unanimously agree they were unimaginable to some a few months ago. These prospects for peace consequently contribute to a particular strengthening of the peace ideals of our Organization  which so many nations support  and also the general role of the United Nations  which is becoming more and more active. The improvement in the general climate of international relations and the areas of agreement now voluntarily acknowledged - for example  one on which we concur and which has been mentioned at this rostrum  the subject of chemical weapons - cannot hide the fact that there are conflicts yet unresolved and situations of tragic actuality that continue to affect developing countries. In this regard my delegation would like to dwell first on the unbearable situation in southern Africa. Everything leads us to believe that Pretoria intends to uphold the system of apartheid and thus to continue its repression of the people and  what is more  its aggression against the front-line countries. The international community cannot forget that apartheid is a crime against humanity. Hence it must maintain and step up its pressure on South Africa and adopt comprehensive  binding sanctions against that country  particularly now that we are preparing to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. If South Africa wants peace it must recognize the most elementary rights of the majority of the people in the country. The banning by the ruling white minority in Pretoria of the activities of non-violent organizations and the arrest of all kinds of pacifists  including clergymen  betray the inherent incapacity of the apartheid regime for reform. In fact  that regime must be totally dismantled and it must give way to a democratic and multiracial system of Government Furthermore  the international community must continue to exert all forms of pressure on the South African Government to ensure that the emergency measures now in force are lifted and to obtain the release of all political prisoners  including Nelson Mandela.Angola  a country that is a friend and brother of the People's Republic of the Congo  has been deeply afflicted  but recently it obtained encouraging results in Geneva towards a cessation of hostilities in the war of aggression being waged against it by the apartheid regime of South Africa. The new prospects for peace now emerging must  however  be consolidated. My country  on the initiative of its President  Colonel Denis Sassou-Nguesso  actively supports the efforts being made in this regard. Thus Brazzaville  our wonderful capital  long known for its hospitality  is host to the latest series of quadripartite talks between Angola  Cuba and South Africa  with the mediation of the United States. After three rounds of negotiations  which produced some progress  ray country has high hopes of seeing the parties concluding their talks in Brazzaville very soon. No one will be surprised to see the People's Republic of the Congo playing such an active role in such an important process. This only reflects the customary policy of peace and international co-operation advocated and carried out by President Denis Sassou-Nguesao. It gives me great pleasure to recall here that in April last year  in Brazzaville  the dialogue between the United States of America and the People's Republic of Angola was resumed. It was also in Brazzaville on 13 May that a bilateral meeting between Angola and South Africa was held.Our tradition of struggling against domination  colonialism and all forms of injustice  and our readiness for solidarity  as well as the commitment of the Congolese people to everything that concerns peace  progress and security in southern Africa  have combined with the efforts being made by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to create this climate which has led to our country's becoming the meeting point and place of dialogue the international community was seeking. Over and above the immense benefits expected from this event that we see in the quadripartite talks in Brazzaville  I can confirm that the spirit of Brazzaville will always remain a source of peace and security in our region.The prospects for independence for the international Territory of Namibia  which is still under illegal military occupation by South Africa  are clearly improving in the light of current diplomatic contacts  and 1 November 1988 is a date we eagerly look forward to for the implementation of the United Nations peace plan for Namibia. It should open an exhilarating period in the lives of the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAÐÐ). Namibia would thus achieve independence.I turn now to the conflict in the Middle East  a conflict whose complexity has often been stressed. My country shares with others the conviction and the hope that only an international peace conference with the PLO taking part could create in the region chances for the establishment of a comprehensive  just and lasting solution. We are pleased that certain countries  which previously were openly hostile to such an international conference  now accept the principle. It is high time to make this conference more than merely the subject of talk.In the Korean peninsula  the direct contacts that have been established between the two Koreas  despite the modesty of the results  contribute to the creation of favourable conditions for the establishment of a new climate free of tension and conducive to the unification of the Korean homeland.In the Western Sahara  Morocco and the POLISARIO Front have accepted the peace plan of the CAO and the United Nations  which advocates a referendum on self-determination for the Sahraoui people. The Congo supports the joint efforts of the Acting Chairman of the OAU and the Secretary-General of the United Nations  which flow from the decisive action taken by President Denis Sassou-Nguesso when he was Chairman of the OAU.The new era that is opening in Soviet-American relations and for peace in the world confers particular importance on the question of disarmament. Moscow and Washington have shown clearly their determination to call a halt to the arms race. The conclusion by the two Powers of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate- Range and shorter-Range Missiles  and the verification measures it contains open up interesting prospects for stability in the world. The developing countries  however  are aware of what was  after all  the minor Impact those prospects had at the time of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. It is unfortunate that the results of its work were so meagre. The insupportable cost of the arms race not only threatens international peace and security  but also continues to swallow up colossal sums of money that could serve the goals of economic and social development  particularly the economic development of developing countries. Only a change in perceptions and attitudes  which we have heard described in contradiction one with mother during the course of the debate - which must  of course  continue - can lead to an eventual evolution in the situation. If the economic situation of the developing countries is to improve  such contributions are necessary. Immediate solutions are called for  of course  but they must be appropriate solutions that take into account the long-term development goals of our countries.The major industrialized countries meeting in Toronto advocated various initiatives  among them the setting up of a multilateral fund to guarantee debt servicing. There was also discussion of measures to cancel a portion of public indebtedness. According to one eminent participant in the Toronto meeting  ""the international community must show greater realism and imagination"". We can agree with that  for the problem of foreign debt has served only to intensify the considerable pressure on the young and fragile economies of our countries  as well as to increase the uncertainty prevalent in the international financial system.The mid-term review of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 by the M Hoc Committee of the whole of the General Assembly concluded that the economic and social situation in Africa had deteriorated  notwithstanding the considerable sacrifices made by the African States in implementing the Programme. Lack of resources  indebtedness and the unfavourable external economic environment have been identified as the principal obstacles to recovery efforts.At a time when the General Assembly is planning to declare the 1990s the fourth United Nations development decade and to prepare an international development strategy for that purpose  ray delegation cannot refrain from noting that the preceding decades so solemnly proclaimed from this rostrum have to a large extent remained a dead letter. The experience of the 1980s  the Third - or lost - Development Decade  which will soon draw to an end  corroborates that bitter acknowledgement  given the discouraging predictions for the world economy in 1989. The crisis is serious and deep-rooted. It calls for bold and lasting solutions  not mere cosmetic tinkering that leaves untouched the very foundations of relations based on gross injustice.The 1990s are the doorway to the third millennium. If present adverse trends continue  the scope of the economic and social crisis in the developing countries is likely to mean the exclusion of the majority of mankind from the inexorable march towards the year 2000  which relies upon economic and technological capability  and to preclude their entering into that third millennium.New efforts must therefore be made in our deliberations on international co-operation for development. For many reasons the thorny problem of nuclear and toxic waste being surreptitiously dumped in various parts of the world will be one of its aspects. Africa condemns the dumping of such wastes on the territories of its States. As a result  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has called for and obtained the inclusion of this item on the agenda of the present session.Not too long ago the convinced partisans of strengthening the United Nations role in world affairs were fearful - and quite  rightly - that the Organization might go down with all hands under the blows to its work and to its very principles by the advocates of a return to the values of individualism and triumphant bilateralism. Faced with that threat  but determined to survive r the United Nations embarked on a process of careful re-examination and healthy streamlining of its own bodies and their modus operandi. The Secretary-General spared no effort to awaken States Members to the seriousness of the situation and to obtain from them an active commitment to preserving the achievements of more than 40 years of efforts and experience   and renewed determination to ensure future success Today we feel that we can see the dawn of better days for the Organization. That is what the delegation of the Congo has  in part  been saying in its present statement. Such cautious optimism can be justified by various events  in particular by the payment of part of the arrears owed by States Members who had fallen behind in their contributions to the regular working budget. Nothing  however  will have been truly accomplished if those optimistic signs do not survive beyond the present situation.Thus  as the general debate at the forty-third session draws to a close  we are proud to note the strengthening of a fortunate overall trend of hope that the United Nations can continue to forge ahead in the service of mankind  for whom it is an indispensable tool."
"32",1523,"COL",43,1988,"ï»¿Allow me first of all  on behalf of the people and the Government of Colombia  to congratulate you most warmly  Sir  on your election to the presidency of this Assembly. We are all confident that your well-known ability and your devotion to democratic values will contribute to the success of our work.The forty-third session of the General Assembly is taking place in an atmosphere of optimism generated by the climate of detente that has emerged from the agreements between the great Powers. That climate and the intelligent endeavours of the Secretary-General are restoring faith in and credibility to the United Nations system.We believe that this is an auspicious time for making of this forum a real centre of world understanding  not merely one that will continue to strive to avert confrontation and foster the settlement of disputes but one that will be a genuine setting for conciliation where we can find effective instruments to guarantee true  stable and lasting peace for all States. Although the Organization has shown signs of having the energy and capability to undertake substantial changes and convincingly to propose measures to establish higher standards of living and better patterns of development suited to the various regions of the world  the great Powers must be prepared to make use of this effective machinery to attain those objectives. Let us hope that we are witnessing a strengthening of the United Nations that will give it the kind of role it has never had before in safeguarding peace and achieving more rapid development for the poor nations of the Earth.As they strive to consolidate their fragile process of development  third-world countries confront phenomena that pose agonizing threats to them in such vital areas as the food crisis  violence  underdevelopment  economic problems and  at times  political instability.No less significant is the situation caused by destabilizing factors such as drug trafficking and terrorism. One of our major concerns in this regard is the way in which representatives of groups involved in these practices obtain the resources with which to strike at the legal order and democratic institutions. The wrong  senseless traffic in weapons which goes on unchecked all over the world bears with it disruptive elements that involve grave consequences for the countries that must endure these factors and that destabilize democratic  popularly elected Governments through interference in their internal affairs. When we look into this matter  universal hypocrisy becomes evident  foe at timesthose very countries that profess to defend peace and security ate the ones that are supplying arms to those fighting to destroy them in other parts of the world. Often certain arms manufacturers encourage the commercial aspects of this traffic  and the whole world  without exception  is the victim of a travesty nurtured primarily by economic interests and private greed. For that reason  therefore  we believe that this issue must be tackled squarely and courageously  for we cannot continue to ignore the seriousness of the matter nor to turn a blind eye to its injurious consequences while at the same time  on the international scene  the great Powers are destroying a portion of their nuclear arsenals.We wish likewise to condemn the use of chemical weapons. There is no argument that can possibly justify their use. We call on this Assembly to denounce and condemn not only those who employ such weapons but also those nations which supply the raw materials and technical assistance for their manufacture  for in this case the responsibility is shared equally by those who use such weapons and those who facilitate their use for motives of profit  or for whatever other reason.We reaffirm our unconditional adherence to the resolution of disputes by means of the peaceful settlement procedures set forth in the United Nations Charter  We reiterate our continued hope that it will be possible to reach an understanding in the Central American conflict on the basis of the immutable principles of non-intervention and the self-determination of peoples.We accordingly reaffirm our shared commitment  along with a group of other democratic Latin American countries  to the establishment of a permanent political consultation and co-ordination mechanism to safeguard our countries' autonomy and respected position and to guarantee a future of peace  democracy and social and economic progress for generations to come. We today express the hope that the negotiations aimed at resolving the Malvinas Islands sovereignty issue may be resumed as early as possible. You  Mr. President  are well aware that my country is in solidarity with your own in these endeavours.We also place on record our satisfaction at the heartening signs of dialogue emerging in the Korean peninsula  and we shall be happy at this session of the Assembly to hear the views of representatives of both parties concerned.We share in the whole world's feelings of satisfaction and optimism about the solutions now developing to such sensitive conflicts as those in Afghanistan  southern Africa and the Western Sahara and  of course the cessation of hostilities in the war between Iran and Iraq. Let us hope that next year we will be able to welcome among us in this forum representatives of a free Namibia.We are hopeful that in the case of any other conflict the Security Council will act  in conformity with the terms of the Charter  in the same conciliatory spirit to promote peace for all mankind. The Security Council's potential should be used to the full.It is with this conviction that Colombia has put forward its candidacy for one of the Security Council places allocated to Latin America. Colombia feels that in that position it would be able to make a constructive contribution in the next biennium to resolving the problems besetting international peace and security. We have the honour to be endorsed unanimously by the Latin American and Caribbean Group and we hope likewise to be worthy of this Assembly's vote of confidence.The issue of South Africa and apartheid is once again on the agenda of this Assembly  and rightly so  for although we take the view that South Africa is not the only place in the world where there is racial discrimination  the racial discrimination in South Africa takes a uniquely repugnant form and is consequently morally indefensible and inhuman. We therefore reaffirm our solidarity with the South African people  which is suffering the consequences of the present perverted system  and with the countries of southern Africa that are directly involved in the struggle.We have a cast-iron commitment to finding formulas to strengthen peace that actually work. In particular we are committed to identifying in terns regarding co-operation measures that will bring about speedy and balanced development in all the countries of the third world. For this reason we are pleased to be able to inform this Assembly that the request made by our President  Mr. Virgilio Barco  in his address to this forum two years ago  when he called for a meeting of""... the responsible officials of all the relevant agencies of the United Nations system to establish the bases of a programme for immediate action against abject poverty  with the particular aim of submitting it to the Governments of Latin America and the Caribbean"" (A/41/PV.18  p. 16) has borne fruit with the holding last month in Cartagena de Indias of the first Latin American and Caribbean Conference on Absolute Poverty  whose conclusions  at the request of the participants  I shall be placing before this Assembly for consideration.In this context  we believe that the external debt issue  a daily growing source of disquiet and complexity  must be addressed without delay. It is disillusionment and nothing else that has led to this issue's being left in the hands of those who have no option but to declare themselves impotent in the face of unbreakable undertakings. Indifference and ambivalence are of no assistance in freeing us from this abyss in which we have been trapped by an economic blunder that must be tackled with by debtors and creditors simultaneously. A similar point needs to be made with respect to drug trafficking. It is not possible for the burden of this struggle to be laid  as has been done with unparalleled hypocrisy  solely on the shoulders of a small group of countries whose societies are not the ones which  dissatisfied in the midst of abundance  have resorted to drug use. The war against drug trafficking must be the shared responsibility of all and should go hand in hand with effective controls on the interdiction of consumption. We are gratified to see that this position is now shared by the whole of Latin America and the Caribbean and that voices have been heard that prompt us to hope that in future the consuming nations will unequivocally accept their responsibility in this regard. Colombia  one of the oldest and most robust democracies in Latin America  is committed  in the midst of the threats of terrorism and drug trafficking  to the protection and promotion of human rights. We actively and unconditionally support the activities of governmental and non-governmental human rights bodies alike  but we would issue a warning that the attempt by some to politicise these efforts in the service of certain interests must be checked if the actual advancement of human rights is to be achieved.The prevailing climate of optimism prompts us to propose the convening in 1990 of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to development. We believe that a setting of that kind would enable us to arrive at an objective assessment of the world economic situation and the measures needed to speed up development in the poorest countries. As long as human beings continue to go hungry  to be homeless and to suffer disease  those who have the resources cannot remain unmoved.Solidarity must be a prerequisite for the continued survival of peoples and nations."
"33",1564,"COM",43,1988,"ï»¿Allow me first to offer to the President of the General Assembly  Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina  on behalf of the delegation of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  our cordial congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.There can be no doubt that Mr. Caputoâs sound diplomatic judgement and long experience in international affairs will be exceedingly helpful to us. We regard them as a strong pledge of a successful outcome of our work.Let me take this opportunity also to pay a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic  for the dedication and competence with which he conducted the work of the last session of the General Assembly.It should be emphasized that the last session of the General Assembly  and in particular the third special session devoted to disarmament  opened up welcome prospects for a strengthening of multilateralism.This state of affairs is  without any doubt  due to a heightened awareness of the dangers that threaten our planet. But in particular we must acknowledge that we are indebted  above all  to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier PÃ©rez de Cuellar  to preserve peace in the world. Let me offer to him our most emphatic appreciation and profound support.As I have just emphasized  each of us will have noticed that confrontation is gradually yielding to a better understanding  which thus gives us hope for the gradual elimination of the tension and conflict which had characterized international relations. We must work hard to encourage and consolidate these gains so as to meet the challenge of our age and respond to the calls for peace and justice which resound throughout the world.We welcome particularly the fact that after eight years of war  Iran and Iraq have agreed to a cease-fire and are meeting at the negotiating table under the auspices of the Secretary-General. We encourage them to press ahead with their dialogue and to show patience and tolerance so that they may arrive  in the near future  at a felicitous outcome in keeping with our hopes.The situation in Afghanistan has developed in a positive manner  as was shown by the Geneva Accords completed last April.In our opinion  this is a decisive element in the quest for a peaceful settlement  which we earnestly hope for and which we trust will enable the brotherly people of Afghanistan freely to enjoy its sovereignty.It is crucially important in this regard that the process of the withdrawal of foreign troops should continue in order to eliminate any interference in the internal affairs of that country.As we refer to this problem we have in mind the thousands of Afghan refugees who have had to seek refuge in neighbouring countries  particularly in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan  whose late and much lamented President  Zia Al Haa  paid with his life for his commitment to peace. We pay a tribute here to his courage and beg Allah  the all-powerful  to grant blessing and eternal peace to his soul. In the same vein  the problem oÂ£ Namibia is also moving towards a solution. We emphatically support the diplomatic activities being carried out in that part of the world to find a peaceful solution of the problem. It is our firm belief that settlement of the Namibian question must necessarily Involve the implementation of Security Council 435 (1978).Notwithstanding such tangible progress  we still deplore the persistence in southern Africa of the odious system of apartheid  giving rise to an explosive situation that threatens the political stability of the countries of the region. My country condemns without reservation the inhuman system of apartheid and calls for its abolition  as this is the only way to restore civil peace in South Africa and political stability in that part of the continent.We are gratified to note that we are moving towards a just and lasting solution of the problem of Western Sahara. In this regard  we welcome the fact that the peace plan proposed jointly by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity has been accepted by the parties to the conflict. We encourage them to persevere in their efforts to achieve a lasting solution of the problem.As regards Kampuchea  it is most distressing to us that that country continues to be subject to military occupation  in spite of the General Assembly resolutions calling for the unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops. It is our belief that the people of Kampuchea is entitled to a free choice of the system of government it deems most suitable  without any external constraints. Thus we have been following with great interest and encouraging the process of dialogue that was recently started among a)I the parties concerned.While in some parts of the world there is hope for the restoration of peace  the Middle East region  on the other hand  does not enjoy the same relaxation of tension. The deterioration of the situation in the occupied Arab territories serves to emphasize the gravity of the danger to international peace and security. We cannot remain indifferent to the atrocious acts of terrorism perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinian Arab population  which have taken the form of barbarous crimes  the despoliation of their property and the expulsion of Palestinian Arabs from their territory. It is the duty of the international community to use every means available to it to put an end to such actions.My country continues to believe that there can be no lasting peace in the Middle East without the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  particularly Security Council resolutions 252 (1968) and 338 (1973)  duly taking into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  in particular its right to self-determination. My delegation supports the idea of an international peace conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties concerned  obviously including the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole and authentic representative of the Palestinian people.Another problem of equal importance is deserving of our consideration  that is  the situation prevailing in the Korean peninsula. We are pleased that the parties to the conflict have taken a constructive stand  with a view to finding a solution of the problem through dialogue and mutual agreement. We encourage them to press ahead along that path and we assure them of our support in their quest for a peaceful settlement. We believe that the admission of both Koreas to this Organisation would do mud to promote a rapid solution of the problem.My country  like others of the same region  continues to be concerned by the military build-up in the Indian Ocean. For that reason we support the convening of a conference with the object of making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace is demilitarised  and denuclearised  in accordance with the Declaration contained in General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI). Before concluding these political remarks  let me refer again to a problem of the highest concern to the international community as a whole in the sense that it emanates from an injustice and a breach of the territorial integrity of my country  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  I refer  of course  to the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte. The problem is on the agenda of the Assembly for this session  because no solution has yet been found to it. Therefore we shall have an opportunity to come back to it in greater detail. However let me now point out to the Assembly that the Comorian people remain concerned by the persistence of this problem notwithstanding the open-mindedness it has always manifested and its willingness to adopt the path of dialogue and mutual agreement  in accordance with the principles of the Charter and the United Nations resolutions on the subject.Without wishing to anticipate the debate that is shortly to take place  let me take this opportunity to reaffirm once more from this rostrum that the Comorian Government and people  strengthened by the justness of their cause  will spare no effort to restore the territorial integrity of their country. The international community  for its part  faithful to the sacred principles of the Charter  is in duty bound to support them until their just cause has triumphed.While we can welcome the new hope prevailing in international political relations  it is nevertheless deplorable that the economic situation is more disturbing than ever. Our session is taking place at a time when the economic crisis is having an increasing impact and is greatly detrimental to the majority of the developing countries  particularly the weakest among them  commonly known as the ""least developed countries"". My country  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  which is one of those countries  is stricken particularly hard by the damaging effects of that crisis. These include dislocation of the international economic system characterized by a decline in the amount of capital available on favourable terms  which gives rise to inordinate growth of the debt burden in relation to the repayment capacities of the developing countries  and also an abrupt lowering of in commodity prices.My country  being an island with a small area and quite lacking in mineral resources  is confronted with major obstacles in implementing the development process in which it engaged after acquiring its independence  under the enlightened guidance of Mr  Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane  President of the Republic. The obstacles to which I have just referred include in particular lack of sales of the products that account for 90 per cent of our export earnings and lower prices for those products. They also include the three-fold increase in the volume of our debt service in less than three years; the intransigence of our creditors on the clearly unfavourable terms of their loans the reduction in absolute values of our export earnings; the failure of certain of our partners to meet commitments entered into at the Round Table of Donors  held in Moroni  our capital  in July 1984.Notwithstanding these numerous constraints  my Government continues to work hard to sustain growth and improve the living conditions of its people. Accordingly  it has embarked upon a programme of restructuring  particularly in the productive sectors. This has been accompanied  inter alia  by a series of measures designed to restore the health of public finances and of the para-public sector.In particular  this has made it possible to better rationalize the functioning of the State and to sustain growth by favouring private initiative and highly productive activities.The policy of economic recovery thus begun has given rise to some noteworthy performances until 1983.As a result of the multiplier effect of the programme our country had  during that period  attained an appreciable economic growth rate and tangible improvement in teal per capita income.However  the worsening of the international environment of my country  characterized by the sharp drop in our commodity prices and the rapid expansion of debt service payments caused by the exorbitant rise in interest rates and the exchange rates of the principal currencies used on the credit market  has  since then  wiped out our own domestic efforts. But we are not disheartened.The Comorian Government remains firmly committed to the spirit of enterprise and is determined to press on with its fight against under-development. None the less  without increased and sustained assistance from the international community  my country will be unable to meet its objectives. Therefore this year again I urgently appeal for good will on the part of all to demonstrate practical solidarity with my country by providing valuable support as called for in the relevant resolutions of the Organization.In conclusion  I wish to reaffirm the unswerving commitment of the Comorian Government and people to the United Nations system and the ideals of peace and justice it embodies. "
"34",1603,"CPV",43,1988,"ï»¿It is with great satisfaction that we welcomed the election of Mr  Caputo to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. We are convinced that his professional experience and sound political and diplomatic sense will bring success to our work. Through his august person  it is to today's Argentina that we now convey the sentiments of brotherhood and friendship of our people which  from the other side of the Atlantic  has followed with renewed sympathy and confidence the democratic progress of the peoples of Latin America.To Mr. Caputo's predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  we wish to offer our gratitude and appreciation for the excellent work he did as President during his term of office at the forty-second session. I also wish to congratulate Secretary-General Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar for his praiseworthy efforts to find peaceful solutions to the many problems which affect the functioning of this Organization  and in particular his fruitful diplomacy in the quest for peaceful solutions to regional conflicts.Year after year the Republic of Cape Verde has intervened in the general debate of this Assembly to state its position on the major problems of concern to mankind.Prom disarmament to decolonization  from international peace and security to the fight against desertification  my country has always joined its voice to those of the majority of the members of this Assembly  sharing their concerns and their ideas  and making suggestions and proposals to solve these problems.Today  we should like to concentrate on some questions which in our opinion merit special attention from the United Nations at this historic phase in international affairs  a time when profound changes are occurring in the world  in the life of the Organization  in the international economic situation and the peace process in southern Africa.The world is witnessing changes of fundamental importance in various fields of international affairs. At the threshold of the year 2000  the major challenge facing mankind is its ability to steer these changes in such a way as to ensure the perpetuation of life  peace  development  justice and progress for all.In the economic sphere  the changes in recent decades which are characterized by the emergence of new poles of development have taken the form of a dynamics capable of leading to a recasting of the economic international system and the withdrawal of the most pronounced aspects of the bipolarization of the world that has characterized post-war international relations. Such a change in international economic affairs causes profound alterations in the orientation of political regimes in many parts of the world  both domestically and internationally.The mounting interdependence of international economic relations is another important aspect of current changes that derive basically from economic needs which  in combination with the development of new technology  also make it essential for there to be mutual understanding of the interests of all countries and systems at the economic as well as political and social levels.Current developments requite that the results of negotiations in the various international multilateral forums take account of the new realities  for these cannot be steered towards a positive evolution except through the real democratization of those relations and the advent of a new international economic order. The tendencies which can now be observed towards a multipolarization of the world in the economic field and the parallel aggravation of the crisis in the international economic system have had a direct impact on the conduct of the various economic partners. If  on the one hand  such a situation leads to protectionism and other similar phenomena  on the other it stimulates new experiments in North-South and South-South co-operation.  In the political sphere  we are also witnessing important changes. The resumption of dialogue and the intensification of co-operation between the two greatest Powers constitute an important axis for those changes.The summit meetings between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States of America  and the conclusion of the Treaty on the Elimination of their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (the INF Treaty)  are decisive contributions to the establishment of an atmosphere of detente in international relations  introducing as they do an element of rationalization  which is contrary to interventionism and could lead to the strengthening of the principle of the non-use of force in the settlement of disputes. The INF Treaty is a major step in disarmament and we believe that other important steps in the nuclear field should also be taken in order to eliminate from the face of the Earth the danger of a holocaust. We are convinced that both the United States of America and the Soviet Union are determined to bring about the full realization of this grand ideal and that they will be able to refrain from placing in space what they have decided to eliminate on Earth.Aware that this Agreement concerns only a tiny part of existing nuclear arsenals  but with confidence in the dynamic that has been set in motion and the political will underlying it  we believe that the international community should not be excluded from this dynamic. On the contrary  it should encourage the two great Powers to redouble their efforts towards the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.On the regional level  we have been following with much interest the changes which have occurred in regard to the peaceful settlement of disputes. From Afghanistan to Kampuchea  from southern Africa to the Gulf  the message of peace and of negotiated solutions has been predominant in the last few months. The international community cannot but welcome this atmosphere which opens up new prospects for progress.Cape Verde wishes to express its great satisfaction with these developments  remembering that as a member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  Gape Verde has ? .ways Å located the course of dialogue  of relations based on mutual respect and sovereign equality of States  and of co-operation based on solidarity. In today's world everyone stands to lose when negotiated solutions are discarded and force is relied on instead. We firmly hope that this trend will spread to all the conflicts which for so many years have taken so many lives and spread desolation  stifling the hopes of man. We encourage the parties to the peace negotiations to press on with their efforts to achieve peaceful and lasting solutions.The encouraging developments to which I have referred notwithstanding  the international political situation is still precarious. The changes which are now taking shape in the quest for solutions to regional conflicts need to be consolidated. We hope that today's political detente will help consolidate peace and that peace will not be jeopardized by tactical and short-term concerns which might compromise the gains made in international security.At the same time  it is with satisfaction and renewed hope that we see  particularly in Central America and southern Africa  the carrying out of a process  which is increasingly well organized and institutionalized  whereby neighbouring countries and others have helped eliminate the hot beds of tension that still existÂ·The participation of countries of the same region or on the same continent in this venture reflects the existence of new forms of solidarity with the peoples of countries threatened with destabilisation or countries which have been victims of prolonged conflicts. It also indicates a new global awareness of regional security and a renewed collective political will  which are most conducive to peace and give evidence of the renewed determination of the international community to resolve conflicts.Members of the international community  particularly those with major responsibilities in the maintenance of peace  must continue to press ahead towards the negotiated solution of conflicts and do their utmost to refrain from any interference which might be damaging to the ongoing peace process or which might jeopardize the initiatives taken by the Secretary-General to bring about negotiated solutions to conflicts.In today's international scene  we believe that all countries  all Governments and all leaders must do their part in consolidating peace and promoting development  thus opening up new prospects for progress and the emancipation of peoples with justice and social well-being.Multilateralism is thus of great importance in the quest for solutions to global problems. It is a crucial instrument within the framework of the changes taking place today  leading to a better appreciation and definition of the contours of the world over the next few decades.In recent years Cape Verde has been one of the countries which have sought to emphasize the importance of the United Nations as an institution that is indispensable in a world such as the one in which we now live  a world in which global problems affecting the whole can be discussed and resolved by the collective effort and action of all Member States.We remain firmly convinced that the United Nations provides a reliable and suitable framework for debate on the major problems facing mankind. We are also convinced that if we want to live in peace and resolve our common problems by peaceful means  there is practically no alternative to the United Nations.As we see it  the work done by the United Nations has been meritorious  ranging from decolonization to the protection of human rights  from peace-keeping forces to economic development assistance. The major contribution made by the United Nations  or through it  to the building of a more peaceful and more humane world  is beyond the shadow of a doubt.The tasks which still face the United Nations in the future are colossal. Its success in the completion of those tasks requires  at each phase  a re-thinking of its methods and the adapting of its methods to the evolution of the prevailing trends in international relations  of which it is and must be a reflection  and at the same time a privileged instrument.We believe that the success of the United Nations in the statement of the ideals and noble objectives in its Charter will depend on its ability to mobilize mankind for peace and to make the peoples of the world aware of the need to arrive  by overcoming the obstacles  at solutions to the problems of hunger  development  illiteracy  the emancipation of peoples  and also the defence of human rights in its many dimensions.The prospects of peace now taking shape in southern Africa are expressed mainly in the solid will for peace which inspires the peoples and countries that have been victims of the destabilizing strategy of the South African regime  which is yet another result of a mature  determined diplomatic effort put forth over many years and which is distinguished particularly by the Lusaka Compromise and the Nkomati Agreement.The desire for peace manifested at all times by Angola and Mozambique  to which my country can rightly bear witness  has been an important and decisive factor in making it possible - despite the logic of the confrontation imposed from outside - to persist in the negotiated search for a solution to this conflict  in accordance with the resolutions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  the United Nations and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. We thus welcome today the withdrawal of South African military personnel from Angolan territory  the solemn reaffirmation by the South African President of the validity and current significance of the Nkomati agreement  and Pretoria's commitment to initiate on 1 November this year the implementation of United Nations resolution 435 (1978) with a view to bringing about Namibia's independence.The caution which the negotiating process in southern Africa has always aroused in us  the fact that the relevant United Nations resolutions have repeatedly proved to be dead letters and the lack of respect for the rule of law and international public opinion should not lead us to minimize the importance and the dimensions of the current diplomatic success in the region.These are important victories of international law  of which the United Nations is the global guarantor. These diplomatic successes are the outcome of the combined efforts of the members of the international community  which have repeatedly brought pressure to bear on the South African regime in order to lead it to heed the voice of reason and realize that international coexistence in today's world is subject to certain rules which cannot be breached. Also  we cannot disregard the beneficial influence of the general climate of detente in international relations  which has been made possible by the closer understanding between the great Powers and the mounting awareness of interdependence as a predominant factor in today's world.South Africa is thus in a situation in which it can either live up to the commitments it has entered into  thereby restoring its credibility in negotiations  or decide to violate them yet again  thereby entrenching itself in an isolation that will be a grave burden on a society whose contradictions have already assumed serious proportions. The Pretoria regime must realize that by persisting in its racist practice of denying the elementary civil and political rights of the majority of the population and by drawing up and implementing a policy that is hostile to the neighbouring African countries  it has excluded South Africa from the community of African nations to which it belongs.By rehabilitating itself as an African nation  through democratic racial coexistence  good-neighbourly relations and non-interference  diplomatically or militarily  in the domestic affairs of the neighbouring countries  South Africa would be able to participate fully and with the weight of its economic and technological potential in the exalting task of the development e f Africa.Apartheid continues to be a challenge to mankind  and primarily to Africans. This system is an aberration and must be eliminated. The persistence of this regime  which denies to Africans their rights and their ability to govern themselves  makes any agreement with South Africa precarious and brings to bear on the neighbouring countries a constant threat of interference and aggression.In the light of the recent results achieved in the process of negotiations in southern Africa  the international community must redouble its efforts to ensure ever-greater solidarity with the struggle of the South African people and the intensification of international pressure to compel Pretoria to free Nelson Mandela and other black leaders  to recognize the African National Congress and the other democratic forces and to start talks with credible representatives of the black majority. That peaceful path is the path of reason  for it is the only one capable of saving that country from the cycle of violence and self-destruction.By agreeing to implement the plan contained in United Nations resolution 435 (1978)  relating to the independence of Namibia  South Africa has a unique opportunity to make a start on its rehabilitation within the United Nations system. Co-operation with the Organization in the impartial supervision of this process  and abstention from any act that might impede the transfer of power to the legitimate representatives of the Namibian people - which the entire international community hopes will be peaceful and democratic - would constitute an earnest of the good faith of the Pretoria regime and could have a beneficial influence on the inevitable future internal talks with the representatives of the black South African majority. The process of Namibian independence thus can be seen as a decisive test which will influence the future attitude of the international community  and above all the African community  towards South Africa.The Government of Cape Verde is convinced that we are approaching the end of a long and painful period for the South African people and the neighbouring countries. We hope that the international community will support the peoples of southern Africa in the difficult re-conversion of a regional system based on confrontation and discrimination to a system of co-operation and healthy racial integration.Decolonization has gone down in the annals of contemporary history as a noble undertaking  successfully accomplished under the aegis of the United Nations. As a matter of fact  even if the United Nations had no other merits  its establishment would be fully justified by the tremendous legitimate contribution it has made to the liberation of peoples from the colonial yoke  to their emancipation and to the elevation of the universal idea of justice and freedom.This historic phase of its international activity having now passed  the United Nations faces a major undertaking that is no less noble and worthy: the struggle for human rights. At a time when we are commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights  the United Nations must make the protection of human rights one of the fundamental and priority items on its standing agenda.Over the past 40 years many legal instruments for the protection of human rights have been adopted. Among them  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is without any doubt an important landmark in the modern movement to protect  enhance the dignity of and ensure respect for human beings  for their fundamental rights and freedoms. Putting its stipulations into effect  articulating its principles with national policies and implementing its provisions are historical necessities which all countries must keep in mind.Much has been done towards raising the universal consciousness  particularly with respect to the need to protect and respect fundamental rights and freedoms. The results achieved in the context of the struggle against racial discrimination and for equal rights for women are among the specific pieces of evidence of that progress. But much remains to be done in various fields of the protection of human rights. Indeed  the first fundamental right  the right to life  is still insufficiently protected in many parts of the world. Universal and unwavering respect for that right must be a constant concern of this Organization.In this connection  the Republic of Cape Verde is proud of the position it has taken never to introduce the death penalty into its penal legislation. We have done that fully by choice  aware that it is society that produces the individual; we are placing our bets on human beings and their ability to overcome.In my country we also assess the international situation in terms of its specific and tangible impact on domestic life  on the climate of peace and harmony and on the colossal tasks of development and the combating of the scourges that beset mankind. Last year we identified the problems affecting the developing countries adversely  and we put forward ideas and suggestions that could  we believed  help to find a collective solution. One year later we note that nothing  or very little  has been done in the direction of solving those problems. Indeed  since then the obstacles to development have only increased  and hunger continues to devastate the peoples of a number of countries. The persistence of this situation in various corners of the world runs counter to the positive developments observed in the international political climate since the last session of the General Assembly and continues to be a challenge to this organizationâs capacity and the determination of the international community to find real and lasting means of satisfying the aspirations of peoples. We take the view that the solution of the problem posed by questions of peace and international security necessarily involves the solution of problems posed by underdevelopment  hunger and poverty. The resolution of regional conflicts does not in itself necessarily imply the existence of a climate of international peace and security. The principal causes of instability and the threats to regional and universal peace lie in unjust international relations and poverty affecting the security and in the unequal distribution of the earth's resources. It is in the interests of the whole international community to work and co-operate with a view to assisting the countries of the third world to find solutions to their problems which we all share.Developments in the world economic situation are of concern to us because  on the one hand  the industrialized countries are registering heartening rates of economic growth  we ate once again forced to acknowledge that in the developing countries   and in Africa in particular  it has scarcely been possible to curb the negative tendencies which continue to keep millions of human beings in an intolerable state of poverty. Millions of men  women and children annually pay with their lives the price of the world imbalance  an imbalance for which they are not to blameÐThe world's conscience is challenged by the contrast between the prosperity of some on the one hand and the abject poverty that we see in other areas. While the present situation is favourable to certain countries and to the detriment of the developing countries  it is certainly not to be encouraged in the near future  even in the case of those who are at present drawing some advantages from it. In order for the world economy to improve - and this is something we all wish to see - there is a vital need for evidence of a shared and powerful political will  a will based on the sacrificing of short-term gains  which stifle the healthy development of international economic relations. It is the African continent which continues to present the most desolate economic and social picture and which offers the most uncertain prospects. The special session of the General Assembly in 1986 devoted to consideration of the critical economic situation in Africa provided a framework and an opportunity for a contract of solidarity  which might have renewed the hopes for economic recovery in the African continent. However  two years later an assessment of the measures taken in that direction obliges us to acknowledge that  despite the efforts made by a great number of African countries and the important initiatives carried out at the international level  the results continue to be insufficient and far from encouraging.The conclusions of the raid-term review of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 demonstrate that a great deal remains to be done. Many African countries have undertaken structural adjustment programmes in accordance with the requirements of the International Monetary Fund  thus exposing themselves to serious risks of social and political disruption. At the same time  the insufficiency of financial flows  the continued worsening in the terms of trade and '-.he unbearable burden of debt continue to act as powerful elements  the effects of which are cumulative and interrelated  neutralizing the tremendous sacrifices being made by the African peoples in the quest for valid and lasting solutions. Cape Verde has not been spared the problems affecting the least developed countries of the African continent. Despite the difficulties it is facing  the Government has directed its activities towards a policy of austerity  seeking to limit the volume of external debt  which for a poor country constitutes a heavy burden. We regret that at the international level the volume of debt has not been considered sufficiently significant to be included in the framework of the special-treatment programmes. This means  paradoxically  that a country is penalized for having taken the course of a prudent and austere economic policy. We wish to remind this Assembly that in its second national development plan  covering the period 1986 to 1989 the development priorities of Cape Verde are set our and their implementation will be jeopardized without substantial support from the international community. It is essential and vital that the fresh winds which are bringing hopes of peace to the world should also bring changes in the world economic order  changes which would lead to the design of new machinery and the mobilization of fresh resources to reduce the gap between prosperity and poverty  establish international relations on a moral basis and help effectively to build universal peace. We cannot conceive of a world of peace and concord while imbalances persist which place a great part of mankind on the fringe of progress and outside the general well-being.We sincerely hope that the detente in relations between the two great Powers and the positive climate currently prevailing  which favours the peaceful solution of conflicts  may herald a new era of co-operation and dialogue in international relations. The life of peoples on this planet is a tribute to their capacity for collective survival. Their history  marked by violence  destruction and war  has taught us from the very beginning that the course we are now following in the international community is the only possible course if we are to continue to carry out the marvellous work of creation. Conditions exist for us to make the twenty-first century the century of development for all. That is our obligation towards future generations  to begin now to take the concrete steps necessary to bring about this new era. Our collective survival requires it and our highest spiritual values justify it."
"35",1648,"CRI",43,1988,"ï»¿Mr. President  my dear friend and colleague  I take especial pleasure in telling you how gratified we Costa Ricans feel to see you presiding over the General Assembly. Your gifts as a statesman  your breadth of diplomatic experience and your profound faith in democracy  all of which have been proven by your record in brotherly Argentina  are a guarantee of success in the conduct of our debates.I should like also to express appreciation of the part played in the recent election by Dams Nita Barrow  the Ambassador of Barbados  who enhanced the great traditions of this Organization.Through the dedication of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and that of his distinguished associates to the cause of peace  the effectiveness of the United Nations in promoting understanding among peoples has been demonstrated. But let it be said that without his tact  experience  wisdom and culture  these accomplishments would not have been possible. Such successes renew the confidence placed in our Organization and help to strengthen it  as the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces shows. Costa Rica  which has no army  was deeply moved at this well deserved award of the Prize and the recognition that it represents of the forces and arms that silence war  save lives and protect peoples. We congratulate them sincerely.The very essence of the work of this Organization is to apply a body of international law that was conceived while humanity was suffering the ravages of the most bloody conflict in history. The Charter signed at San Francisco outlawed the use of force in international relations and formulated the hope that the history of the world would not be the history of the wars of mankind. To make this hope a reality  peoples must live and act in accordance with the principles of the Charter. Double standards of ethics in our Organization  whereby acts are forgiven or condemned according to the sympathies or interests of the moment  erode faith in the Organization. Today's renewed confidence in the Organization resulting from its successful efforts in bringing about a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq  in finding solutions to the conflicts in Afghanistan  Kampuchea and Western Sahara  in seeking reconciliation in Cyprus and promoting the independence of Namibia should put an end to any temptation to return to those practices which negate the very essence of this Organization.This opens up a new phase of well-founded hopes - hopes that were more than confirmed by the positive talks between the President of the United States  Mr. Ronald Reagan  and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev  the outcome of which proves the effectiveness of dialogue in achieving the most noble goals. The step taken towards disarmament is a small one by comparison with the long path that lies aheadÂ·  but let us hope that it signals the dawn of a world free from hatred and fear.As Costa Rica has outlawed the army as a permanent institution  it has supported with special emphasis and moral authority the efforts made by the United Nations to halt the arms race. Costa Rica calls for full awareness of the need for world-wide disarmament  for definite action to ban nuclear tests and reduce nuclear arsenals  to initiate conventional disarmament and to stop the transfer of weapons to underdeveloped nations.The countries of the third world have often had the misfortune to suffer the tragic fate of being the setting for confrontation between the great Powers. Strategic  political and economic conflicts which escalate into war take place in peaceful regions and take their deadly toll among the sons of those peoples. It is alarming to know that world military spending amounts to a trillion dollars a year - an amount 20 times more than the total amount of the co-operation extended to the developing world. It is a source of shame to know that  in the first 12 hours of today  more than 14 000 children have died somewhere in the world for lack of food and medical attention  while in those same 12 hours more than $136 billion has been spent on armaments  an amount which any intelligent person will realize far exceeds the sum needed to avoid that tragedy.If the agreements between the Soviet Union and the United States were to lead to complete disarmament  we  along with all the peoples of the world  would joyfully trust that  having averted the threat of a new holocaust  the resources previously allocated to weapons would now be used for education and health  economic development and culture throughout the world. In other words  we would live in accordance with the principle which upholds nature itself  destruction would end and creation would begin. That is why the small developing countries urgently need to convince all the military Powers that peace is in the best interests of all.The community of nations has witnessed with deep concern the continuing crisis in Central America. The desolation of vast areas of land  the devastation of some economies  the appalling misery and imprisonment  the persecution or death of those who disagree with their rulers are serious ills which Esquipulas II sought to resolve within a given time frame  but which persist because Governments lack the political will to carry out the process of democratization to which they agreed. For Esquipulas II is  above all  the final stage of the plan presented by President Arias which  in turn  embodied all the efforts of the Contadora Group and its Contact Group. It is an unswerving commitment to democracy. Î thorough consideration of the obligations entered into in the Guatemala procedures would lead to the conclusion that  to a greater or lesser degree  none of the States that signed the procedure has complied fully with the terms of the agreement. This applies also to Costa Rica  because our Legislative Assembly has delayed ratification of the treaty establishing the Centred American parliament. None the less  when the Esquipulas II agreement was signed  our country had already for some decades been doing far more than carrying out the fundaments  objectives of the plan. For more than 40 years there have not been any military hostilities in Costa Rica and within the uninterrupted existence of its pluralistic democracy there has been permanent and intensive national dialogue. Since 1948 we have outlawed the army and there are no forces threatening the stability of our institutions. No Costa Rican has ever been imprisoned or exiled for political reasons  human rights are respected and we enjoy our freedom in peace.Returning now to Central America  the reality is that the progression of that peace process has been halted and the international community  though encouraged by the trend towards dialogue and detente evident in other hemispheres  anxiously wonders why that crisis has not been resolved  since it is much smaller than certain others in which a solution is beginning to be found. There is a lack of genuine political will among some of the principal parties concerned. Although we can record progress in some areas  the fundamental commitments leading to democracy  national reconciliation  the sacrosanct protection of human rights and the non-use of territories as military sanctuaries have not been fulfilled. In the midst of all this  unfortunately  we must note that as the months have gone by we have seen the Nicaraguan Government step up its repression  fail to fulfil its commitments and attempt to reduce the crisis to a problem of security  showing obvious contempt for democratic values. Perhaps in no other country of the region is the situation so chaotic; and perhaps no other Government has shown less will to solve it. But  what is worse  that situation has serious repercussions on neighbouring countries  which have to take in the thousands of persons who are fleeing in an attempt to find freedom  food and shelter. I appeal to the States Members of the United Nations to provide relief to the countries of refuge for the tremendous burden now weighing on us. Our greatest concern  however  is that the international community should renew its interest in peace and democracy in Central America.I recognize that many States have stood by Central America in this long night of self-destruction. Similarly  the Secretaries-General of this Organization and the Organization of American States have shown a special interest in helping us solve our problems. Nevertheless  I have come here to ask that the democracies that share this concern should join together in a movement to support democracy in Central America  thereby renovating  strengthening and carrying out the Esquipulas II agreements  which aroused such well-founded optimism in the international community.This effort to ensure democracy in Central America would be incomplete if we did not take into account the challenges involved in actually building and improving that democracy. Now more than ever before the industrialized countries must increase their co-operation in support of development  which of necessity has to respect the freedom and dignity of citizens  and they must help to give concrete shape to the special plan of economic assistance for Central America adopted by the General Assembly at its last session.That is all the more urgent when we bear in mind the critical situation which the foreign-debt problem has created for the Central American nations. We are the victims of poverty and of a crushing financial commitment which has only rarely produced an improvement in our economic and social conditions. We recognize our commitment and  like most debtor countries  are staking tremendous sacrifices to honour it. We believe  however  that our creditors must fully understand the extent of these sacrifices. So far the international community does not appear to have clearly realized that the present situation cannot go on much longer. We see that debt servicing is swallowing up the foreign exchange we need for the health  education and development of our peoples and  incredibly  our creditors' strategy disregards the very high social and political costs involved in the debt servicing.We are not  of course  asking that our entire debt be cancelled but  rather  that our creditors agree to share the responsibility and to negotiate realistic formulas to alleviate our debt burden. We recognize our responsibilities  but we ask our creditors to recognize theirs. The consequences of the present situation will be fatal in the short- or medium-term  and our creditors will be among the victims. That is why we ask that international financial policy should take into account the threat which this situation poses to the future of democracy in the world. In Latin America  where the building of democracy has gained strength  slowly and arduously  the conditions for the repayment of the debt and the social costs involved have started to undermine our democratic institutions.We cannot disregard the fact that the sacrifices which the debt is demanding of the Latin American democracies might become a new pretext for succumbing to the temptation of totalitarianism. The danger which this situation poses to Central America strengthens our hope that the international financial community will realize that  because the countries of our region are very small and have barely begun their development and because some of them have suffered the ravages of nature and of violence  the region needs to be rebuilt and to grow in order to overcome subhuman conditions  Therefore we hope that the creditors will take an especially broad view of the situation  and we trust that that hope will not be in  vain.In the past four decades most members of the international community have made a joint effort to establish a new international economic order that would narrow the gap between the developed and the developing States. The results  however  have been discouraging. We still have an economic system in which a handful of powerful beneficiaries are surrounded by the two thirds of the population of the world that live in poverty. That system is without any ethical basis it disavows manâs solidarity with his fellow men and prevents all countries and all individuals from exacting their right to development  to the progress brought about by science and technology  to culture and well-being.The third millennium of our era is about to begin  and the countries of the world - whether in the North or in the South  in the Eastern or in the Western Hemisphere  in the Caribbean basin or in the Pacific basin - should be able to provide all their citizens with a life of prosperity and freedom. What other meaning can one attach to roan's time on earth if it is not to turn the world into a place befitting the advanced status of the human species?I believe that the United Nations must make an extraordinary effort to discuss ideas and promote initiatives and  above all  to awaken in the statesman of the world a spirit of creative solidarity which will gradually shape for the twenty-first century the universe of peace and prosperity we all desire.The Government of Costa Rica proposed the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly of the item on science and peace; we want science to be applied more fully in the quest for peace and development. We want to encourage the scientific community to work towards the attainment of constructive social and economic goals. The link between science and technology must have an impact on the interdependence of technology and development  and not of technology and domination. It is a source of great concern to the Government of Costa Rica that the well being derived from scientific and technological discoveries is narrowly focused on a small group of inhabitants of the earth and  at the same time  a considerable share of science and technology is devoted to promoting  not man's well being  but his extermination and the destruction of his property. Above all  however  we are concerned and indignant that it is technological progress in the military sphere which is made available to the developing world on the most favourable terms and that countries which do not have what they need to feed their peoples incur military expenditures out of all proportion to the size of their impoverished economies and incomparably larger than the tiny sums they spend on education or health - to mention only the essentials.Science  which records and synthesizes thousands of human experiences  which draws its sustenance from the knowledge of many  which is the result essentially of the most noble exercise of the human mind  should become the common heritage of mankind in order to enlighten and ennoble rather than to produce wealth and well being for a few at the cost of the hunger  the destruction and the death of the rest.On 10 December we shall be commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. With the sitting of that charter of freedoms  human rights became a universal concern  and all States entered into a solemn commitment to observe them strictly. But genuine respect for those rights is still far from being A universal reality. Although it is recognized that frontiers must not be obstacles to respect for and full exercise of human rights  the safeguards which ensure their effectiveness are difficult to apply and are of questionable usefulness.When Costa Rica signed the Universal Declaration of Hunan Rights  it already had a long tradition of respect for those rights. As early as 1908 my country had been the headquarters of the Central American Court of Justice  the first international court to recognize the individual as a subject of international law. That was the principle we reiterated in 1948 in signing the Declaration. That is why this must not be just another anniversary. The proximity of this fortieth anniversary of the Declaration should make us  ore aware that the framework of international backing designed to ensure the genuine and effective exercise of all the rights set forth in the Declaration remains ineffective. Costa Rica therefore reiterates its proposal for the appointment of a high commissioner for human rights who by his efforts would help to improve the discouraging situation of human rights in this world. We have here an excellent opportunity to reconsider this idea and put it into practice  otherwise obnoxious departures from the basic minimum norms establishing those rights will continue to be appalling challenges and to shock international public opinion. Because of its selectiveness  the present system of appointing special rapporteurs ignores the violations that occur in States which are not subject to United Nations vigilance and are thus not subject to the beneficial scrutiny of special rapporteurs.Eighty-six States have ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 38 are parties to its Optional Protocol  while 99 States are parties to the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights. Costa Rica was the first country to ratify both Covenants and strongly urges those countries which have not yet done so to adhere to them as the roost effective and genuine way of celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.1 cannot end my discussion of this topic without expressing the profound indignation of the people and Government of Costa Rica at the continued daily violation of human rights by the Government of South Africa. Costa Rica  in order to place on record its repudiation of such conduct in deeds rather than words  broke off relations with the South African regime in 1986 and  like the vast majority of member s of this Assembly  demands an end to that abominable system of segregation  which is contrary to all the basic natural rules of human coexistence. A few days ago a call was made here for the release of all political prisoners held by that regime. We take this opportunity to join in the appeal and to demand support for the efforts of President Mobutu of Zaire to help bring about the immediate release of Nelson Mandela and all those who have been imprisoned in South Africa simply for having asserted their own humanity. This situation shocks the conscience of all free men.I must also express our concern at the difficulties currently being experienced by Lebanon. As the President of France  Mr. FranÃ§ois Mitterrand  so eloquently put it  a peaceful and reconciled Lebanon is a threat to no one. A Lebanon torn apart by violence will continue to be an aura of insecurity for everyone. Let us hope that peace will return to that country.My Government is concerned  too  by the scourge of illicit drug trafficking  which corrupts with its millions people from all economic and social backgrounds and regions. It threatens the stability of Governments and undermines the ethical and moral values on which our societies are based. Costa Rica has recently adopted new  stringent legislation against illicit trafficking and the abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances  and it proposes that more effective international machinery be established for both the prevention and the punishment of drug trafficking and to help producer countries replace such crops by new and lucrative ones in order effectively to dissuade farmers from taking part in the initial processes of the production of narcotic drugs.The feelings of satisfaction which the United Nations is at present enjoying should make us reflect on the Organization's role as a forum for the universality of States. We hope therefore that progress towards the goal of universality will be made in the not too distant future so that we may welcome the admission of Namibia to the United Nations. We also hope soon to receive representatives from Korea  whether delegations from the two Republics that now exist or one delegation representing a unified Korea with a democratically elected Government. The fortieth anniversary of the Republic of Korea and the holding of the summer Olympic Games at Seoul - a world gathering of harmony and brotherhood - provide an auspicious opportunity for us to work for the admission of that country to our Organization. The new policy of co-operation and dialogue pursued by the Republic of Korea strengthens our hope that progress will be made in the reunification process.It is our hope that the principle of universality will be fully realized and that the other States of the world which  of their own volition or because of other circumstances  remain outside the United Nations will soon join in the efforts being made for the progress of the human race.Let us do our utmost to ensure that this Organization and all its Member States strive whole-heartedly to achieve the goals set forth in 1945. Let us not be deterred by disappointments or difficulties. Let there be no force capable of making us stray from the truth  from honest and objective compliance with the principles and mandates set forth in the San Francisco Charter  which embodied a dream that we must all make a reality.At a difficult moment  when he had doubts as to what course to follow  Abu Talib asked Mohammed whether he should support a cause even if it departed from the course that his conscience told him was right. The Prophet answered him:""Though they might give me the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left  even then I would not let myself stray from the truth.""Let those be our words too. Let us live according to the principles that we have sworn to uphold. "
"36",1694,"CSK",43,1988,"ï»¿I should like to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the high office of President of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. I wish him great success. I am convinced that under his experienced leadership the work of the present session will lead to a growth of confidence in our Organization. I assure him of the readiness of Czechoslovakia to continue to develop its friendly ties with his country which  through its active policy  is playing such an important role in today 's world. I should also like to express our deep gratitude for the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier PÃ©rez de Cuellar  to diminish tensions throughout the world and to resolve regional conflicts through negotiation. We especially appreciate the fact that thanks to his initiatives and efforts our Organization has achieved new and significant successes and is thus living up to the noble role it has been given  for  as the Latin adage states: Pacia donum est omnibus bonum - the gift of peace is a blessing for all. In international relations we are witnessing events of truly unique significance. They demonstrate new political thinking. Militancy is being rejected; there is greater openness; we observe a growing readiness to engage in negotiations in a civilized and businesslike manner. These very promising events are leading to the building of relations among States on the basis of a balance of interests  a strengthening of the role of international law  and a humanizing of international relations - thus leading to a more comprehensive solution to problems of the survival of civilization as a universal human challenge. However  this cannot be done though destructive confrontation. The way to a solution lies in active co-operation. This is the philosophy of the end of the present and the beginning of the next century. It must open the way to the emergence of qualitatively new relations both on the global and regional scale. Of course  this requires that new phenomena must be analysed from new points of view. Problems that seemed irresolvable must now be resolved. The unthinkable must become the thinkable. What was impossible yesterday must be made possible. The viability of this approach has been demonstrated by the four Soviet-United States summit meetings which have made the world safety prospects for peace stronger and the future more hopeful. A landmark of fundamental importance was the ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  the first step of an era of real disarmament. We were one of the eight States involved in the process of its realization  we have done everything that was required of us. We agreed with the conducting of verification measures on our territory. Soviet operational-tactical missiles with increased radius  which had been stationed in my country since the end of 1983  were removed even before the Treaty's entry into force.""Today we must all jointly ask ourselves a questions how do we proceed further? How can we develop now what sober-minded politicians have agreed upon? The answer is unequivocal s let us compete in humanism. Let us make the cornerstone that unites us the survival and continuation of mankind. Let us hold a competition which  despite all of our differences in policy  ideology  world view  and other spheres  assures both nations and individuals of their future existence  let us demilitarize international relations and prevent both social and ecological disasters  thus arriving at new horizons of mutually beneficial co-operation.It is precisely in this spirit that our Organization today must have a decisive say in the fundamental strengthening of multilateralism  which has proved to be better able to create confidence and achieve results than any other options. As pointed out by the Secretary-General in his annual report  when global problems requite global solutions the value of the United Nations for its Members is obvious to all. If its influence is not strengthened  we shall be constantly confronted with ever-growing instability throughout the world.This is also the basis of the concept for comprehensive security which encompasses all aspects of international relations. It meets the need to make universal human interests a major element of international policy. It serves as an impulse for broad constructive dialogue on  hat can be done to enhance substantially the role of the United Nations in the present world.Positive developments in the world are creating favourable conditions for implementing the goals of restructuring all spheres of life in our country. By following that path we are endeavouring to build on the significant results achieved in our social and economic development and to strengthen the progressive and democratic traditions of our people.This year we are commemorating some important anniversaries both glorious and tragic: the seventieth anniversary of an independent Czechoslovakia  but also the fiftieth anniversary of the ""Munich Agreement"" which was concluded behind our backs. This remains an abiding lesson. Security was and continues to be shared and indivisible. We recall the historical experience of two world wars and four decades of socialist development. This obliges us to pursue an active and constructive policy of peaceful co-operation.We see as a manifestation of this policy the proposal for the creation of a zone of confidence co-operation and good-neighbourly relations along the line of contact between the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty and the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization put forward by the General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Milos Jakes. We believe that it is precisely the States adjacent to that line which bear a special responsibility. In fact this is where the concentration of military power is greatest and therefore misunderstandings are fraught with the most dangerous consequences and confrontation is most hazardous.Hence  we are proposing a plan for the peaceful strengthening of security guarantees in this zone without confrontation  through both military and non-military measures. We intend to act in this area on the basis of the all-European process  and in so doing to create in that zone stimulus for its further intensification. To do this  of course  we must jointly throw off the burden of the past. We must abandon outdated models of bloc-derived thinking  reject the concept of enemies  measure the boldness of human deeds not by their degree of militancy but by their ability to overcome one-sided and deceptive military ambitions. Our proposal subordinates military relations to the principle of reasonable sufficiency. We want to enhance confidence-building measures and fulfil and further develop the conclusions of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe with respect to military exercises  including notification of such exercises limiting the number of participating troops  inviting observers and the tight of inspection. We favour a joint comparison of military doctrines with a view to giving them a purely defensive character. Together with our allies  in the context of an all-European reduction of armed forces and conventional weapons on the basis of joint elimination of imbalances and asymmetries in the various types of weaponry  we propose the removal of the most dangerous offensive weapons from the zone along the line of contact between the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). We listened with special interest to the valuable proposals along those same lines made by President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand. These strengthen our conviction that intense dialogue will continue.At the same time we must seek the development of the non-military factors of security. Therefore our proposal also encompasses the political  economic  ecological and humanitarian spheres. In the zone of confidence  measures in those spheres could even go beyond the parameters agreed upon in the all-European framework.The possible opportunities for peaceful co-operation are practically inexhaustible. We ate thinking of joint ventures  the creation of free-trade zones  an improvement of the transport and energy infrastructure  a simplification of customs and visa practices  environmental protection  relief assistance in cases of natural disaster  a broadening of relations between twin cities and provinces  the establishment of direct contacts between schools  scientific institutions cultural establishments and youth organizations  reciprocal medical assistance in border areas  and so forth.In that way we aim at the establishment of a machinery for regular political dialogue among the States of both parts of Europe  a dialogue built on a broad  solid basis. This follows upon other proposals made by socialist countries and on the constructive approaches and views of our Western partners. We are open to any constructive comments and considerations.We are in favour of the speediest possible radical mutual reductions in armed forces and conventional weapons on our continent. Without this the danger of military confrontation will continue. The July session of the Political Consultative Committee of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty  held at Warsaw  put forward new and far-reaching proposals; to eliminate asymmetry in weapons and armed forces and subsequently to reduce them by approximately 25 per cent  or by 500 000 servicemen on either side  then to continue this process until the military potential of both sides takes on an exclusively defensive character  This would take place in three carefully balanced stages. In that way our countries have taken a constructive step in an effort to  meet the position of the NATO countries  proposing a realistic scheme for reductions.We are working towards a speedy and successful conclusion of the Vienna meeting  which should adopt a substantive and well-balanced document and agree on the mandate for negotiations on conventional disarmament. We agree with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany Mr. Hans-Dietrich Genscher  that this should take place as soon as during this month. It is true that a great deal of responsible work has already been done at that meeting. Foundations have been laid for the adoption oÂ£ good documents making possible broad development of all-European co-operation  constructive approach now requires political determination to complete the agreements now being prepared and political will with respect to all questions under discussion.We propose that one of the subsequent events be the holding of an economic forum. It could discuss the entire question of co-operation in that sphere. We are ready to act as host to that forum.In short  we wish jointly to raise the all-European propose to a qualitatively higher level commensurate with the realities of our times in order to reaffirm the viability of the concept of a common European home based on the various social choices made by the peoples. We must base it on solid ground  build it boldly and ensure that Europe speaks to the world in a single language of peace.We face no greater challenge today than that of making the disarmament process irreversible. That was our basic approach to the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. Unfortunately  that session ended without a final document. Yet it was a useful experience and a lesson for the future. The proposals made at the session remain a rich source of inspiration. For our part  we set out our proposals in a joint memorandum from the Warsaw Treaty States on security through disarmament  and in a number of other documents. I would mention  first of all  the joint proposal of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  the Peopleâs Republic of Bulgaria and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to establish international machinery for verification of compliance with agreements aimed at reducing tension and limiting weapons  and to monitor the military situation in regions of conflict. This machinery would function under United Nations auspices. We are pleased that this has attracted numerous interesting proposals from other countries. Let us do all in our power to prevent our ever having to say that the settlement of a given issue is no longer verifiable. Let the humanistic triad of confidence  security and co-operation light the way towards qualitatively new international relations. Freeing the world from the nuclear-arms race remains the pivotal global task. To continue that race amounts to running consciously towards an abyss. A basic step in the right direction would be the early conclusion of work on a Soviet-United States treaty on a 50 per cent reduction in strategic offensive weapons  to be accompanied by strict compliance with the anti-ballistic missile Treaty  since the link between these matters is a deep and organic one. We favour the immediate cessation of nuclear-weapon testing. That would give us time for political solutions and for formulating a treaty on the complete  universal prohibition of such testing. We also support the development of international co-operation in the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes exclusively. We desire the strengthening of the authority of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  with consistent application of the safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). An important addition to the efforts to avert the nuclear threat has been the concrete proposal put forward by the Governments of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the German Democratic Republic to establish a nuclear-weapon-free corridor in Central Europe. We support the setting up of similar zone in other parts of the world as well particularly in the Balkans and in Scandinavia.It is high time that all obstacles to the completion of the convention on the complete prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons be set aside. We are prepared to be among its first signatories. We neither produce nor possess such weapons. Further delays in the preparation of the convention serve only to prone to the spread of such weapons and increase the risk of their use. In that connection we have noted a change in the attitude of France that we hope  will facilitate agreement. Like other countries  we are concerned about the start of production of binary warfare agents and about their possible deployment in Europe. Together with the German Democratic Republic  we propose the establishment of a chemical-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. As a Contracting Party to the 1921 Geneva Protocol  we favour the proposal to convene a conference of the signatory States.We share the view that it is necessary to enhance the Organization's role in limiting conventional armaments. We believe that the proposal to create within the United Nations a register of trade in weapons will contribute to that end.We are in favour of an expansion of international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space  which the United Nations has proclaimed to be the common heritage of mankind. It would be unforgivable were we to display indifference to the threat of the misuse of space for military purposes.We are in favour of an enhanced effectiveness of the disarmament median ism  primarily of the Conference on Disarmament at Geneva. In this spirit  it should gradually become a permanent universal body for disarmament negotiations  as we proposed last February. That is in keeping with the logic of current global changes and integration processes.An essential condition for the attainment of over-all security is the peaceful settlement of international disputed regional conflicts. Here  the fruitful dialogue between the Soviet Union and the United States has had a beneficial effect. An improvement in East-West relations provides that calm that is necessary to the process of seeking and finding equitable solutions to long-standing and dangerous hotbeds of tension. We must take full advantage of it  thus an active role for the United Nations is now indispensable. What body other than the United Nations can make such a significant contribution to the protection of legitimate rights and co-ordinate the interests of the parties involved? What other body can better implement the machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes  stimulate the adoption of international guarantees to prevent the recurrence of a conflict? Only the United Nations can do so.We therefore welcome the growing importance of the role of the ""blue berets"" in various world trouble-spots. They are a symbol of one of the most important area of United Nations activities  namely  peace-keeping. They can be even more effective in helping to stabilize the situation in troubled areas  ensure conditions for negotiated settlements and prevent the outbreak of new conflicts.Together with world public opinion  we have reacted with hope to the signing of the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan worked out with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General and jointly guaranteed by the two greatest Powers. The well-known steps taken by the Soviet Union and Afghanistan represent a responsible and scrupulous honouring of the obligations undertaken. In this connection we would emphasize the fundamental significance of unswerving compliance on the part of all signatories. Only in that way will it be possible to ensure peace for the Afghan people and for the region as a whole. ""We have also welcomed the positive turn of events in the Persian Gulf as a result of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We note with satisfaction that with the assistance of the United Nations the senseless bloodshed has been halted. The presence of the United Nations Military Observer Group has been a stabilizing influence. We fully support the continuation of talks under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General. Realistic prerequisites have emerged for a peaceful settlement of the problems in southern Africa. We hope that the ongoing trilateral negotiations between Angola  Cuba and South Africa; with the participation of the United States  will bring independence to Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  That would also defuse the situation in the region as a whole. The efforts of the United Nations and of the entire world community must be even more consistently directed towards achieving a full and immediate end to the shameless practice of the policy of apartheid by the Government of South Africa. We welcome the evolution of the situation in Central America as a result of the Esquipulas II Agreement. However  we deplore the complication of the situation in the region and of the development of the peace process that is now  as in the past  being caused by foreign support for the counterrevolutionary forces in Nicaragua. We view the convening of an international conference on the Middle East conflict under the auspices of the United Nations as a way of exerting joint efforts to find a definitive solution. The uprising in the occupied territories has once again demonstrated that the question of Palestine is at the core of any solution. This cause could only gain from the start of work by a preparatory committee for such a conference.We are in favour of a peaceful settlement of the problem of Cyprus  one that would ensure the independence  sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus while preserving its non-aligned status. We fully support the constructive efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at easing the international tension in the Korean peninsula and at a peaceful reunification of the country. Thanks to those efforts  the prerequisites for entering into an orderly dialogue have improved.We are also pleased by the positive developments in the Horn of Africa  in particular with the significant peace agreement signed by Ethiopia and Somalia. We also support the joint efforts of Ethiopia and the Sudan to strengthen relations of peace and mutual co-operation. A contribution to improving the international climate has also been made by developments with regard to a settlement of the situation in Western Sahara. We note with satisfaction  and we support  the efforts to find a political solution to the question of Kampuchea and to bring peace and stability to South-East Asia. We favour further development of the results of the informal meeting in Djakarta. The basis for positive developments in this field is created by the 50 per cent reduction in the number of Vietnamese volunteers in Kampuchea  now under way.	'In our view the seven-point programme of the USSR designed to strengthen peace in the Asian-Pacific region will give momentum to the process.We welcome the positive trend to enhance the role of the Security Council in the resolution of international disputes and conflicts. In this regard it would be desirable periodically to convene meetings of the Council at the level of ministers of foreign affairs and  where the need exists  to do so in regions of tension  as proposed here by Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. Improved co-operation among the permanent members of the Security Council would doubtless yield fruitful results. We appreciate the deepening c ordination between the Security Council and the Secretary-General. We favour the adoption of the draft declaration on the prevention and removal of threats to peace and situations that might threaten international peace and security. Today the United Nations can truly do more for the cause of peace than ever before.Czechoslovakia currently favours the democratic restructuring of international economic relations. We cannot allow encouraging developments in other areas to lag behind. We cannot ignore the growth of forces and that have already created uncertainty and mistrust in the world economy and are likely to bring about an unprecedented international economic crisis. The future of us all will rest on quicksand if we fail to bridge the gap between the developed and the developing countries.  Therefore it is indispensable to create a new international economic order and justly to resolve the problems of underdevelopment and foreign debt and eliminate their appalling consequences: hunger  the inequality of millions  disease  illiteracy and poverty. We wish actively to promote resolution of these crucial problems.We believe it necessary to continue the international dialogue on the implementation of the principle ""permanent for development"" and step by step to translate the conclusions of last year's United Nations conference into concrete measures. As we made clear in the document of the Political Consultative Committee issued at its July session in Warsaw  special attention must also be paid to the dangerous environmental consequences of the arms race.We can no longer stand by idly in the face of the ecological threat  a problem which we have jointly and short-sightedly created. The conclusions of the World Commission on Environment and development and the document titled ""Environment Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond"" must be implemented without further delay.This year in our country we have adopted a new long-term concept of environmental protection till the end of the century. To prevent ecological factors from undermining stability and peaceful relations  we have put forward a proposal on the creation of international ecological security  which should be based on mutually acceptable principles of co-operation and conduct of States in this regard. We support the idea of co-ordinating efforts on these issues and the holding of a series of international meetings on the way to the convening of a United Nations conference on the environment in 1992.We intend to continue to promote the strengthening of international co-operation in the humanitarian sphere as well as in the field of human rights. The continuing  flagrant and massive violation of human rights in many parts of the world is indeed one of the most condensable phenomena of our time. There is no way to be complacent with it. We recall this with even greater urgency now  on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We welcome the profound ideas voiced here regarding a new category of human rights for the protection of mankind.In particular the role of international law must be strengthened so that it governs relations among States. Its effectiveness must be continually increased through codification  progressive development and consequent implementation. We welcome the stimulating idea of the Soviet Union regarding working out a long-term programme of development of international law dealing with issues of security  confidence and co-operation. We agree as to the primary importance of legal guarantees of comprehensive security. We are considering ways to make our contribution towards the strengthening of the role of the International Court of Justice.Given the urgency of the tasks facing the international community at this session  it is essential to strengthen our joint action and co-ordination. The United Nations has a truly indispensable role to play in this regard. Let us therefore concentrate our efforts on comprehensively stepping up the Organization's beneficial work. Let us strengthen the authority of its main bodies and make broad use of the established mechanism for co-operation and the strengthening of peace. Let us bear in mind the decisive importance of the factor of time - that inexorable arbiter of history. Through constructive efforts let us find new avenues leading to the solutions of the problems of our times. Let us cultivate morality and ethics worthy of the international relations of the future.The Czechoslovak delegation has received a mandate from its Government to act precisely in this way  and it shall honour that mandate."
"37",1717,"CUB",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of the people and the Government of the Republic of Cuba  and on my own behalf  I should like at the outset to express our warmest congratulations to you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.I am all the more pleased by your election   first  because you represent a sister Latin American nation that has repeatedly demonstrated its devotion to sovereignty and independence  a nation to which we are united by historical bonds of understanding and fraternity and secondly  because of our close  long-standing friendship  which will be further strengthened by this session of our world Organization.We are certain that on this occasion you will once again demonstrate your high qualities as a statesman  and for its part the Cuban delegation commits itself to making every effort for the success of this forty-third session and the attainment of world peace and the development of all peoples of the world.Last year  in this very forum  we said that  the great prevailing difficulties notwithstanding  we were living in a time of encouraging expectations  because the triumphalism ascendancy of the Reagan Administration had been checked and was on the wane. The activity of major international organizations had been strengthened  and a climate favourable to negotiations prevailed in Europe  Central America  southern Africa  Afghanistan and South-East Asia.The facts of history and the efforts of the forces that cherish peace and progress have driven the obscurantist tendencies in international relations into total bankruptcy. Such tendencies seemed to be driving us to the brink of insanity and holocaust at the beginning of this decade. Such ideas  which had argued that a nuclear war was winnable and which advocated the theory of military superiority as a means of ensuring equilibrium and peace  are already losing ground. There is a growing rejection of measures - such as the so-called strategic defence initiative - that could lead to an arms race and enhance the possibilities of the total destruction of our planet. A new and effective form of international relations is evolving  one based on dialogue  understanding and the negotiated settlement of conflicts that for years have hung over the world and been bringing our nations ever neater to the brink of a cataclysm of incalculable proportions.The adoption of significant disarmament agreements between the two main nuclear Powers is not only a contribution to the attainment of world peace and international security for present and future generations; it enables us to envisage the release  within a reasonable time  of significant resources for the development of all nations and to help overcome the effects of the world economic crisis now threatening.The efforts of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving progressive forces are beginning to bear fruit. Thus  we warmly welcome the Moscow meeting between General Secretary Gorbachev and President Reagan; we welcome the agreements reached there and the way in which they are being implemented. We believe this represents a major step towards disarmament  but it must be developed and supplemented. At Reykjavik  Comrade Mikhail Gorbachev proposed working on a draft agreement to reduce strategic weapons by no less than 50 per cent and to eliminate them completely before the end of this century; that proposal is still pending.Although it is clear that we are moving towards a process of change  much remains to be done and positions that should be abandoned are still being taken. An example of this was the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  which took place this year. Renewed efforts by non-aligned  socialist and neutral nations to achieve agreements compatible with the new times that seem to be emerging in the field of disarmament tan into the international stance of those who stubbornly refuse to countenance the Assembly taking anything beyond general decisions. Such an irresponsible attitude must be condemned. However  if the changes we are trying to bring about in international relations in our quest for full justice and equity do not go beyond disarmament measures  if they are not aimed at promoting the urgent solution of the problems afflicting the economies of the third world and the establishment of a new international economic order  then those changes - despite the glimmers of hope we discern - will be incomplete. Tb understand my country's position  it suffices to remember the words spoken recently at Quito  Ecuador  by President Fidel Castro: ""But the world's problems are not only problems of nuclear weapons and the threats of nuclear war that have unfortunately existed; there still remain other terrible problems for millions of people in the world  such as underdevelopment  poverty  hunger  and lack of education and health"".While the prospect of nuclear war and the resulting destruction and death is dreadful  the lives lived by billions of people on Earth are no less dreadful. The preservation of human life has been our incentive to strive for nuclear disarmament and for general and complete disarmament  and the preservation of human life must also be a driving force in the quest not only for disarmament measures but also for effective solutions to the problems caused by underdevelopment and poverty. For while nuclear war could potentially claim millions of innocent victims  it is no less certain that underdevelopment and poverty claim thousands of innocent victims every day. Suffice it to recall that every three days the number of children who die in the third world is greater than that of all those who died in the genocidal nuclear bombing of Hiroshima at the end of the Second World War.Under the present circumstances  according to data from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  one in four children is suffering from malnutrition; four in five children in rural areas do not have access to running water or adequate sanitary facilities two in five children between the ages of six and 11 do not go to school; and four in five children have no access to modern medical care. These facts must cry out to our conscience.On Monday  26 September  President Reagan said farewell to us. But before he addressed us we had already said farewell to his policy of confrontation and war; more than saying farewell  we had defeated it. The international community said no to attempts to drive the world towards nuclear holocaust and stated its determination to move towards peace  disarmament  independence and development.President Reagan devoted several paragraphs of his statement to Cuba  in which he confirmed his well-known ignorance of the facts of today's world  of their historical background and even of the most basic geographical facts. For that reason we shall not reply to his statement so much as correct it  setting out the facts as they truly are and calling for respect for the truth.President Reagan tried to distort the results of the meeting of the Commission on Human Rights held last March at Geneva to fit his own desires  though at that meeting he was defeated thanks to member countries' respect for the purposes of the Commission.Cuba is proud of its record in the field of human rights  and after defeating those Yankee manoeuvres we invited a delegation from the Commission on Human Rights to visit out country and observe the human rights situation there.The situation today is very different from that of 30 years ago  when we were under United States neo-colonial domination and when the Yankee ambassador served as a pro-Consul who handed down orders to the sitting Presidents. Now  illiteracy has disappeared; life expectancy has risen from 55 to 74 years; infant mortality has declined from 60 to 13 deaths per thousand live births; the epidemic diseases that once claimed the largest number of victims have been eradicated; poliomyelitis  tuberculosis  and other such diseases have been wiped out. Where we had 20 000 university students we now have more than 300 000. Where we had 30 per cent unemployment  all Cubans of working age exercise their right to work.There remain counter-revolutionaries imprisoned in Cuba. That is only natural  because the 30 years since the triumph of our revolution have been years of our people's victorious struggle against the constant aggression of successive United States Governments  especially that of the Reagan Administration. Fortunately  those in the employ of Cuba's enemies - agents of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other services - have failed in their attempts and have been sent to prison. In prison they receive humane treatment and their human rights are respected. There has never been an instance of torture or mistreatment; not a single prisoner has disappeared.President Reagan also ignored the facts when he spoke of the situation in southern Africa. He persisted in his failed policy of support for the hateful apartheid regime; he tried to equate the South African invader troops with the Cuban internationalist combatants who went to Angola 13 years ago at the behest of the Angolan people to drive back the racist invader troops. But President Reagan does not even seem to read the newspapers. How else are we to understand his insistence that the agreement on the full withdrawal of foreign troops from Angola should apply first of all to Cuban troops? South African troops have already withdrawn from Angola  after suffering defeat at Cuito Cuanavale. The withdrawal of South African troops from Namibia is an obligation deriving from resolution 4 35 (1978) and is being called for by the international community. The Cuban internationalist combatants will withdraw  as has been stated  pursuant to a decision taken by Angola and Cuba.Constructive engagement has been useful in prolonging the existence of the hateful apartheid regime  extending by 10 years South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia. However  it was unable to prevent the failure of the invasion launched by the South African racists against the People's Republic of Angola. In southern Africa in 1988 we have witnessed significant developments which give rise to hope that we shall see achieved some of the objectives pursued by the countries in the region will be achieved - namely  the independence of Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  adopted by the Council exactly 10 years ago  and the provision of safeguards for the borders of the People's Republic of Angola.Within the framework of the quadripartite talks  which involve the joint delegation of the People's Republic of Angola and the Republic of Cuba  the delegation of the Republic of South Africa and the delegation of the United States  acting as mediator  several meetings have been held in which the problems in the region have been dealt with in extensive discussions and principles have been established for the political settlement of the problems affecting the region.In this context  in Brazzaville  following the seventh round of quadripartite talks a communiquÃ© was issued informing the Secretary-General of the United Nations that  beginning on 1 November  effect would be given to Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  on the independence of Namibia. It is a fortunate coincidence that this is occurring exactly 10 years after the adoption of resolution 435 (1978). We trust that very shortly Namibia will become independent and take its seat as. the 160th Member State of the United Nations. In this context we reaffirm once again the existence o4 indestructible links between Cuba and the People's Republic of Angola  its Government and its people. They have been strengthened by the bloodshed by Cubans and Angolans in the struggle for the freedom and sovereignty of that sister nation. Cuba is not seeking a military victory. Cuba has no intention or desire to humiliate anyone. It is inspired simply by the desire to make its modest contribution to the preservation of Angola's independence  to the progress of the negotiations on Namibia and to the attainment of peace and security in that part of Africa. Consequently  Cuba is prepared to continue these consultations and looks forward to a successful conclusion  although it is aware of the obstacles and difficulties that still have to be overcome and the time and effort that this will entail.We reaffirm our unwavering solidarity with the Namibian patriots  led by the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  and the South African patriots  represented by the African National Congress (ANC). We support their resolute struggle against oppression. The security of the other front-line States should similarly be guaranteed  thus checking the aggressive behaviour of the South African regime.Particular attention should be paid to the position of Mr. Nelson Mandela  whose release from a prison in South Africa has become a matter of universal concern. Prom this rostrum we congratulate him on his seventieth birthday and reaffirm the steadfast support of the Government and people of Cuba for him and his cause  which  with the whole of mankind  we share.The negotiating process which began recently with a view to ending the Iran-Iraq war is also showing encouraging signs  notwithstanding the difficulties involved That war  which should never have broken out  must come to an end  not merely because of the benefits to both peoples that would result from peace and national reconstruction  both peoples  but also because this would be in the interests of non-aligned unity and world peace. Furthermore  stopping the war between the two nations would put an end to the imperialist presence in the Gulf  which must also be uprooted. Those naval forces are not acting as guarantors of peace; rather they are a source of tension and a threat to the independence of the States in the region.In Central America there were hopes that peace would be reached under the Esquipulas agreements and the Sapoa talks. Such prospects  however  have run into the stubbornness and arrogance of the imperialists. The renewed efforts of the Government of Nicaragua  the Contadora Group and its Support Group in the search for a just and honourable peace in the region deserve recognition.More than a year has passed since these peace initiatives were launched by the five Central American Presidents. They have not yet borne fruit  however  owing to the manoeuvres of those forces interested in impeding their implementation and pursuing a policy of aggression  destabilisation and blockade against the Government of Nicaragua. The situation in Central America calls for prudence  wisdom and firm support from the international community in order to prevent a further escalation of the dirty war directed against Nicaragua  to achieve a negotiated political solution to that regional conflict and to ensure the economic reconstruction of the region. We should also support the peace efforts being made by the Contadora Group and its Support Group. We must reject every attempt to exclude them from the negotiating process. Furthermore  a process of negotiating should be ensured for El Salvador and Guatemala  with the indispensable participation of those who were compelled to resort to armed struggle to achieve what they were denied by law and democracy. Cuba reaffirms its full solidarity with the Government and people of Nicaragua and reaffirms Nicaragua  sovereign right to decide its own destiny free from any form of interference.We welcome with healthy Latin American and Caribbean pride the honourable example set by the Panamanian people  which has rejected and defeated all the imperialist acts of aggression  blockades and threats directed against it  thereby demonstrating the enormous strength of a people united in defence of its sovereignty and independence.We cannot fail to welcome also the significant agreements reached in Geneva with regard to Afghanistan  which are a source of satisfaction to us. The new situation which that Asian nation currently faces calls for renewed and continuing endeavours by all the parties and by the international community as a whole to bring about the speedy implementation of agreements  to ensure respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan and to enable all obstacles to the attainment of peace in that region to be overcome. Cuba fully supports the Republic of Afghanistan in the difficult process of national reconciliation.We welcome the negotiating efforts being made by the States of Indo-China in order to achieve the long-desired peace in South-East Asia  the constructive and flexible dialogue among the countries of the region and the initiative taken by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement in his efforts to contribute to a negotiated solution. In this context  we reiterate our full support for the policy of national reconciliation formulated by the People's Republic of Kampuchea. These developments represent a source of hope in a climate fraught with dramatic potential.The ministerial Conference of non-aligned countries met in Nicosia  the beautiful  warm capital of Cyprus  just a few days ago. The successful discussions at that Conference  the fraternal  constructive atmosphere during the talks and the presence of almost all member States of the Movement  with delegations mostly led by their Foreign Ministers  was unequivocal proof of the progress made by our Movement and evidence of its growing unity and capacity for action. In Cyprus we reiterated our call for struggle for peace and development. We welcomed the progress made in the negotiations on disarmament and at the same time warned that acts of aggression were still persisted and that solidarity and encouragement should be given to the peoples of the world in their struggles.We agreed to meet next year in Belgrade - where the first non-aligned summit was held in 1961 - for the ninth summit conference of Heads of State or Government in order to strengthen further the decisive role we should play in the defence of peace and the furtherance of development.Last year we reaffirmed that the United Nations should contribute with all its influence to the attainment of peace and the political resolution of conflicts and disputes among nations. Today we are witnessing a resurgence of the United Nations contribution  and very particularly that of its Secretary-General  Mr. Javier PÃ©rez de Cuellar. He has been responsible for much in the way of resolving many of these regional conflicts. We have noted with satisfaction that the achievements of the United Nations this year have helped put an end to the theories proclaiming the death of multilateralism and the ineffectiveness of the United Nations. The United Nations has done this by meeting its obligations under the Charter.The situation in Latin America and the Caribbean is both promising and potentially dangerous. It is promising because of the sustained progress made in the political and social realms in our continent  because of the growing awareness of shared problems and because of the growing unity in a spirit of pluralism that has not been impeded by the natural differences of ideology  wealth or territorial extension among the countries in our region. The future of this continent will be bright if Latin America and the Caribbean succeed in exercising unity and cohesion  if we are able to take advantage of the legacy left us by our predecessors  that is. Bolivar  San Martin  0'Higgins  Sucre  Juarez and Marti; if we succeed in identifying our common problems and in finding shared solutions; in short  if we are able to undertake a real endeavour at integration  in diversity  taking advantage of all those features that bring us closer together rather than resorting to those that divide us.The informal dialogue of foreign ministers of Latin American and Caribbean countries held recently in Caracas represented encouraging evidence of a growing and necessary unity and of the urgent need for integration and co-operation. It showed that our united voice is strong and to be heard wherever integrationist tendencies are on the rise.Cuba will do everything in its power to contribute to this process of Latin American and Caribbean unity  co-operation and integration.Democracy has progressed in Latin America and the Caribbean. Dictatorial regimes are more isolated than ever  rejected by both their own peoples and the Latin American and Caribbean community. We are confident that 7e shall be able to manage our future collectively for the benefit of our peoples.However  we also said that Latin America is faced with a potentially dangerous situation  as hazardous as that facing the other countries of the third world. The international economic crisis has produced intolerable repercussions. It has stirred up an unbridled and spiralling decline in the living standards of our peoples with the progressive erosion of our economies  the worsening of injustice and unequal relations with the industrialized countries of the West. Furthermore  in recent years the arms race and its almost geometric growth have made the prospects of development even more uncertain and an ever greater amount of resources has been used that could otherwise have been employed to alleviate the effects of the crisis.The difficult path we have had to trace in the 14 years since the adoption of the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order by the General Assembly at its sixth special session has become increasingly uncertain. This has shown the serious nature of the problems we face and the need for urgent solutions.The phenomena which have traditionally affected international economic relations  in particular those involving the developed capitalist countries  on the one hand  and the third world  on the other  continue to worsen and to make the plight of billions of human beings unprecedentedly hopeless. Protectionism  the difficulties encountered by third world countries in the export of commodities and in getting access to markets  together with the unequal terms of trade  the dumping and the external debt constitute scourges which have plunged a large number of countries into an economic crisis  a ""crisis for existence""  the solution of which requires a major restructuring of the world economy and of its operating procedures. This is one of the great paradoxes of our time. While we are witnessing encouraging signs of progress in international political relations  progress in terms of disarmament and a tendency to resolve many local conflicts  at the same time the economic plight of the underdeveloped countries is becoming increasingly worse. While the major capitalist countries Powers agree to hold negotiations on matters pertaining to war and peace  they still refuse to hold comprehensive negotiations to resolve the roost pressing economic problems of the contemporary world.Do they not realize that  no matter how much they pursue security  security will be incomplete as long as an economic gap continues to exist between one group of nations and another  and indeed continues to widen? A new international economic order continues to be our goal. In recent years we have repeatedly heard views questioning its validity in present circumstances. We do not agree with such views. How could one seriously and responsibly argue that an instrument that has never been implemented has ceased to be valid? Is it that the conditions that have brought it about have already disappeared? Of all the phenomena to which we have referred  the spiralling external debt of our countries has had the most serious impact and may potentially be the most dangerous for the political  economic and social stability of vast sectors of the world.We have recognized over and over again that the external debt of third world countries is a political issue and should be approached as such and that all the parties involved - debtors  creditors  banks and financial institutions - should pool their efforts.We need to find a speedy solution to this problem. We have recognized a number of factors which link such a solution to the search for answers to other problems affecting third world economies. However  a debt that exceeds 31 trillion is not something to be simply recognized or dealt with in terms of theoretical assumptions. Our countries have been concerned for far too long with poverty  hunger  illiteracy  inadequate health services and the desire for equality and justice.The recent fourteenth Latin American Council of the Latin American Economic System decided to convene a regional conference on external debt. Everyone agrees on the fact that it is unpayable and uncollectable. We need to develop a comprehensive strategy for tackling the debt problem; we need to take a new approach. Several years ago President Fidel Castro proposed a formula with which this General Assembly is very familiar. We strongly believe in the accuracy and force of his argument and  indeed  it has been borne out by events of recent years.We are entering a new decade. We should work for a new millennium of peace and coexistence in the 1990s  with a new and positive form of international relations as opposed to the attitudes and policies that prevailed in the 1980s. Aggression must give way to good-neighbourliness among nations. The use of force should be replaced by consultations and dialogue. Policies of coercion should yield to negotiations for the protection of mutual interests. Unequal terms of trade should give way to a just and equitable international commerce. The obsolete mechanism based on Bretton Woods should yield to a new international monetary system which would eliminate overt or covert exploitation. The process which is now beginning for the United Nations Fourth Development Decade could offer a suitable framework for these objectives. Those who illegally possess the world's wealth currently ""have the floor"". They are the ones that have to demonstrate wisdom and genuine concern for the fate of the world; otherwise  it will fall into a state of collapse fraught with unforeseeable consequences.In this connection  we welcome the endeavours of the South Commission and  particularly  the results of its meeting in Mexico. We believe that such institutions may be very useful in raising world consciousness about the need for development and providing new ideas for solving the most pressing problems of the third world. We are particularly pleased to see that this Commission is presided over by Mr. Julius Nyerere  an outstanding contemporary political figure and one of the eminent leaders of African independence.We note with satisfaction that the Conference on the Indian Ocean will be convened in 1995. We should build our collective determination so that by the time the Conference starts that region will have been freed from military pressures and will have become a zone of peace. We believe that the new course we are beginning to see developing in international relations may represent a decisive contribution to the attainment of a climate conducive to the demilitarization of the region.We reaffirm our support for the sister republics of Korea and express our solidarity with their aspirations for reunification and for the total withdrawal of United States occupation forces from the southern peninsula. We trust that we shall shortly have the delegation of a united Korea in the United Nations.We also express our support for the legitimate desires of Cyprus  a non-aligned country to which we are linked by ties of close friendship. We call for preservation of its independence  sovereignty  national unity  territorial integrity and non-aligned status. We also welcome the talks between representatives of the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities. We support the convening of an international conference on Cyprus under the auspices of the United Nations.In the present international circumstances  we should increase our efforts to put an end to the wandering life of the Palestinian people  who are subjected to unparalleled outrages on their native land. The response of the Palestinian people to Zionist abuse has been a national popular uprising which since its beginning last December has marked the start of a new phase in the long struggle waged by the Palestinian people against foreign colonization and domination.We reaffirm our support for the holding of an international peace conference on the Middle East with equal participation by all parties to the conflict  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We reaffirm our conviction that there can be no solution to the conflict in the Middle East without a solution to the Palestinian question and without recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the establishment of their own State.We support the just cause of the people of Lebanon in their just struggle for national unity  respect for their territorial integrity and for preservation of their non-aligned status. We support the call for the withdrawal of Moroccan troops and administration from the territory of Western Sahara and for the establishment of an independent and sovereign Sahraoui state.We continue to support Bolivia's just claim for direct and practical access to the sea  a right supported by the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. We support Argentina's claim of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. We reiterate our solidarity with Madagascar and its claims over the Malagasy islands of Glorieuses  Juan de Nova  Europa and Bassas da India. We also support the aspirations of Comoros to regain sovereignty over Mayotte.Other vestiges of colonialism also remain in Guam  Bermuda  the Cayman Islands  East Timor  Gibraltar  New Caledonia  Anguilla  Pitcairn  Montserrat  the British Virgin Islands  the United States Virgin Islands  the Turks and Caicos Islands and elsewhere. We cannot disregard the attempts to prevent the independence and sovereignty of so-called Micronesia.Cuba is still suffering from illegal occupation of its territory by the United States naval base in Guantanamo  which remains there against the wishes of our people and Government  in violation of the most basic norms of international law. However  the day will come when we shall exercise sovereignty throughout our territory. Since the end of the last century  Puerto Rico has remained under the yoke of the most powerful colonial system of our century. It is the steadfast duty of the Cuban revolution  which liberated its own people from shackles  to contribute to the independence of Puerto Rico  as Jose Marti stated when he founded the Cuban Revolutionary Party almost 100 years ago  and prevent Puerto Rican soil from being used for the launching of continued aggression against other States of the region.The General Assembly is duty-bound to continue to endeavour to promote the exercise of the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination; to independence; to sovereignty over their natural resources; to free economic and social development to defence of their traditions  languages and cultural identities; and to demand the removal of military bases from their sea and their soil.The world is now facing the dilemma of peace or war. We have no tight to disregard the appeals of our peoples. We must be prepared to live in peace. We must create the machinery that will enhance and strengthen confidence and security among nations  as well as peaceful coexistence and productivity.We must lay the foundations for the relationships of the future so that the generations of the next millennium will feel proud of the heritage left to them by their predecessors. That is our goal."
"38",1763,"CYP",43,1988,"ï»¿Mr. President  I should like to join the previous speakers in congratulating you on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. The confidence shown in you by this body is a tribute of the international community to your vast experience  as well as to Argentina  a friendly fellow non-aligned country.I also wish to congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic  for the impeccable manner in which he discharged his tasks.I should also like to express our esteem for and admiration of the Secretary-General for the way he has been conducting the affairs of the United Nations. We have read his latest report with great interest. It is a masterly exposition of present predicaments and the ways to resolve them. It highlights all the international moral imperatives of our time and it provides all the main signposts for our future course.The United Nations is steadily becoming the universal conscience of mankind and is serving as the framework and  at times  the referee for settling international disputes. On the solid basis of the principles enshrined in its Charter the United Nations provides the foundation and the direction for solving or forestalling international crises.Small States are particularly gratified by the growing achievements of the United Nations as they regard their participation in the collective security system envisaged under the Charter to be of vital importance to them.The list of problems addressed by the United Nations and its specialized agencies is long and impressive and extends beyond the realm of peace-keeping and peace-making. Its contributions in the fields of decolonization  human rights  respect for international law  the protection of the environment  the rights of women and children  the care of refugees  the fight against disease  hunger or drug abuse  economic and technical assistance  the preservation of cultural heritage  and so on  constitute important steps forward in the history of our times.Speaking for Cyprus  I should like to make special mention of the continuing contribution of the Organization  and of the Secretary-General in particular  to the search for a solution to the Cyprus problem. I also gratefully acknowledge the valour and sacrifice of the united Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus for over 20 years. We are delighted at the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. We consider it a well deserved tribute to their contribution to world peace.The rise in the prestige and effectiveness of the United Nations is not fortuitous. ' It has been built on the work and dedication of a great number of people. It has also been the natural and inevitable consequence of the growing interdependence and globalisation of problems  the inability of individual countries to solve them and the relative contraction of the world as a result of the technological and information revolutions. The existence of a strong  generally respected and more effective United Nations is an imperative of our time. This is dictated not only by idealism but also by the enlightened self-interest of each State. The choice before us is simple. Either we support and strengthen the United Nations and its Institutions and extend the domain of international law or we opt for international anarchy.In view of the improved international political climate the current session of the General Assembly acquires added significance. We hope that the spirit of compromise and flexibility observed in the last session will prevail during our current deliberations.Historic changes have indeed taken place since the last session of the General Assembly. In the first place  the rapprochement between the United States and the Soviet Union  the Treaty on the Elimination of intermediate-range and Shorter-range Missiles - the INF Treaty - and their continuing dialogue have greatly improved the international political climate.The Geneva Accords on Afghanistan would have been unthinkable without this new climate of co-operation and flexibility. We earnestly hope that they will be fully implemented. We welcome with relief the cease-fire agreement of 20 August 1988 between Iran and Iraq  secured in the context of the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We are confident that the direct negotiations initiated under the auspices of the Secretary-General will lead to a comprehensive  just  honourable and durable resolution of this tragic conflict  whatever the temporary setbacks.The wind of change blows throughout the world from South-East Asia to southern Africa  Western Sahara and Chad  bringing with it promises of hope for peace and security. We look forward to the moment when we can embrace within our member ship an independent Namibia. We are painfully aware that antagonism and threats to peace still persist. The world is replete with conventional and nuclear weapons. Nuclear tests are still being conducted  the prohibition of chemical and biological weapons still eludes us whilst the demilitarization of outer space is still hotly contested.In South Africa  the repugnant structures of apartheid have not yet been dismantled and the front-line States live under the constant fear of destabilization. Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners have not yet been .freed. The Palestinian people are denied their inalienable national rights and are still subjected to unceasing oppression in the occupied areas. In Central America the hopes generated by the Guatemala agreements have not materialized and the situation remains unstable. A united response is most urgently needed for a just and durable resolution of all these problems.The non-aligned countries  at their Ministerial Conference held last month in Nicosia  expressed their determination to work together with the United Nations in order to meet these challenges. The Conference which was  by general agreement  a remarkable success  helped cement the unit/ and cohesion of the non-aligned countries. The steps taken for increasing the effectiveness and relevance of the Non-Aligned may errant in today's world will be of great benefit to the international community as a whole  since there is a close relationship between the concerns and the challenges facing the non-aligned countries and the United Nations. I should like  in this connection  to highlight the adoption of the Nicosia Declaration and the decision to establish a Ministerial Committee in order to examine the structural  organizational and procedural aspects of the Movement.In this  the fortieth anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; I should like to re-emphasize the dedication of the Government and people of Cyprus to the principles of the Declaration and our determination to see them applied to the whole of our country and to the benefit of all its inhabitants.In their long struggle for independence and unity the people of Cyprus have been looking to the United Nations for support and vindication. Ti-s Â¡resumed dialogue initiated by the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  between myself and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community  Mr. Rauf Denktash  creates new opportunities for our country. The target is to achieve a just and lasting solution of the"" Cyprus problem by June 1989. Doubts have been expressed as to whether it is possible to achieve a solution by that date. I am convinced that all the Pain elements of the Cyprus problem could easily be solved by that date provided that the necessary political will and good faith were exhibited on all sides. WE  for our part  are determined to work hard and with constructive goodwill towards this objective despite any obstacles or disappointments on the way.To facilitate the earliest possible solution  I have repeated in the past  and 1 reiterate now  our proposal for the demilitarization of the Republic of Cyprus. We propose to dismantle the military forces of the Republic if all Turkish troops and settlers withdraw and if the armed elements they have fostered are disbanded. The proposal includes the establishment of an international peace force under the auspices of the United Nations  the composition and terms of reference of which would be agreed upon and endorsed by the Security Council. Demilitarization would create the conditions for resolving the Cyprus problem and would provide the answer to any security concern on the pact of the Turkish Cypriots. There would be additional benefits to them in another way. We undertake to use the funds which will be saved through demilitarization for the development of areas of Cyprus which have fallen behind economically and primarily for projects which will benefit mainly the Turkish Cypriots. Part of the savings could also be used for financing the international peace force to be established.A just and lasting solution of the Cyprus problem is not only in the interest of the whole population of Cyprus  it would also contribute to the strengthening of peace in the Mediterranean  Progress on a just solution of the problem of Cyprus is a key to the continuation of the dialogue between Greece and Turkey.The solution of the Cyprus problem is clearly outlined in the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. Such a solution implies that all foreign troops and settlers are withdrawn from the island  that basic human rights are respected  that no country has a unilateral right of intervention in our affairs and that the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-alignment of Cyprus ace safeguarded. We believe that  in the future federal Republic of Cyprus that we envision  all Cypriots  whether Greek or Turkish  should enjoy equality of opportunity and fundamental freedoms  including the right to develop their distinctive cultural heritages.In this new and delicate phase of the Cyprus problem the Increased Interest and support of the international community will greatly enhance the prospects for its early solution.Though the international political climate has been improving  the global economic outlook remains uncertain. Moet developing countries still suffer from the burden of underdevelopment  while in the leant developed countries basic needs The development prospects for most developing countries are aggravated by minimal  and in some cases negative  rates of economic growth  trade imbalances  low commodity prices  the external debt problem and the associate net flow of resources to the developed countries. The situation is made worse by the deterioration of the level of international economic co-operation  the stagnation of official development aid  the obstacles to access to the markets of developed countries and a series of natural disasters.In the overall efforts for a fairer development of the international economy the comprehensive package of economic measures incorporated in the Nicosia Document of the Non-Aligned Foreign Ministers Conference should be the object of serious negotiations with the developed countries within the spirit of understanding and co-operation that has become more evident in recent months.I should like to draw attention to the enormity and the disruptive effects of the problem of the external debt owed by developing countries. The burden of external debt servicing and the reluctance of commercial banks to provide new credit are factors severely retarding the development efforts of low-income countries. It is imperative that the external debt problem become a focal point of an international development strategy.Within this context  we welcome the greater understanding of the debt problem shown recently by developed countries. Notable progress has been achieved through the case-by-case approach  the greater use of debt conversion and the increasing use of secondary debt markets.One of the interesting aspects of the adjustment process in international financial markets has been the acceptance by bankers of secondary market prices as low as 50 cents per dollar of debt. This suggests that the time is ripe for agreement on substantial debt write-offs. There have also been some positive developments within the United Nations system and through intergovernmental agreements. I refer in particular to the results of the Toronto Western Economic Summit Meeting and the decisions of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to proceed with the general capital increase and the enhanced structural adjustment facility respectively. The emphasis given to the need to solve the international debt problem at the recent Berlin meetings of the World Bank and IMF is another welcome development. The French Government's decision for a 30 per cent debt write-off is a move in the right direction. The same can to said about the recent willingness on the part of Japan to recycle its payment surpluses in favour of developing countries. A few months ago  from this very rostrum  I presented a proposal to the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  with the objective of ameliorating the external debt problem of developing countries. My proposal envisaged that a considerable part of the savings arising from reduction in military expenditure by developed creditor countries should be used to establish a national fund to buy at the present discounted market rates the outstanding loans owed to the commercial banks. The idea of utilizing the savings from disarmament measures to reduce the debt burden of developing countries is still valid. The debt problem  however  is urgent. It threatens every day the welfare and the future prospects of the world's poor  and its solution cannot wait for progress on disarmament.I therefore propose that a practical and realistic approach for tackling the debt problem  would be to take a cue from the international financial markets and to devise solutions which utilize the present mote favourable trends. In line with my previous proposal  I would suggest that the debt problem could be tackled by the urgent establishment by each developed creditor nation of a national fund for the purpose of buying back the debts owed to commercial banks and other lending agencies at discounted market rates. The cost of these national debt relief programmes would be minimal if they were coupled with an imaginative use of tax credits. It is implied that the fund would buy the debt with tax credits offered to the creditor banks over a number of years.Another major and related challenge facing the world is the eradication of hunger and malnutrition  which affects 500 million people around the world. The annual death toll from hunger is estimated at 50 million. Tragically  more than 15 million of these deaths are of Innocent children. Hunger in the world of plenty and a time of unprecedented technological progress is an unacceptable state of affairs. We are gratified that the name of Cyprus has been associated with efforts to alleviate this problem. The Cyprus Initiative Against Hunger in the World  which was adopted at the ministerial meeting of the World Food Council held in Nicosia in May this year  provides for an urgent review of the efforts made to date and for effective new measures. The underlying motive of the Initiative is the idea that the fight against hunger cannot be waged by means of food relief aid alone. It can be waged more effectively by helping the countries concerned to develop their agriculture and produce more food in order to feed their populations. The World Food Council is presently consulting Governments and international agencies with a view to presenting an action-oriented report on the Cyprus initiative to its next ministerial meeting in Cairo next year. We hope that this important initiative will receive the support it deserves from all nations.Few of the problems of our time are entirely local. The universal interconnection of problems demands concerted world-wide action if global catastrophes are to be averted. The problem of the protection of the environment is a good case in point. The threats posed by selfish  short-sighted or simply ignorant environmental policies are legion. The catalogue is daunting. Pollution of the seas  rivers and soil  deforestation  desertification  the widening gap in the ozone layer  the greenhouse effect  climatic changes  depletion of irreplaceable natural resources  dumping of toxic wastes  and acid rain are some of the modern scourges that have to be addressed before they become unmanageable and before their destructive consequences become irreversible.Particular mention should be made of the fact that some underdeveloped countries are being used as dumping grounds for the toxic wastes of industrialized countries. This unacceptable practice should not be allowed to continue. The unsightly spectacle of ships trying to discharge their deleterious cargo on the high seas or by the shores of unsuspecting countries should galvanise us all into action for the permanent prohibition of such obscene practices.What  can we do in the face of such dangers? Echoing the Secretary-General's warnings  we would suggest putting the ecological problem high on the agenda of the United Nations. The idea of convening an international conference on environment needs to be given priority. Such a conference  apart free raising public awareness on ecological dangers  could help devise new and practical measures for addressing all related issues. It could also point to the need for elaborating the necessary laws that could form the basis for more responsible international attitudes in this field and the possible creation of a world ecological council.The preservation and upgrading of the environment is in the interest of the whole world and it should therefore involve an equitable sharing of the attendant costs. For this reason we suggest that the international community make much more substantial contributions to the existing Environmental Fund  so that it may be able to achieve the compelling aims that prompted its establishment. It should be noted that contributing to this Blind should not be taken as another form of aid to the developing countries.The world community is beset with problems old and new. Our most fundamental task is  of course  the extension of the frontiers of peace  security and justice in the world. Universal peace and justice may be unattainable ideals  but a world without blatant injustices should be within our reach. What is most needed for this to materialise is a clearer perception of the dangers inherent in division and strife  a better understanding of the global nature of many of our problems  an extension of and greater respect for international law and a determined move from local to global morality. The best vehicle for such a vital move is the United Nations. The future of mankind  the very possibility of life on earth  depend on such a determined move on the part of us all."
"39",1831,"DDR",43,1988,"ï»¿It is with satisfaction  relief and also  justifiably  great expectations  that people are becoming aware of encouraging changes in the course of international events. Tensions and confrontation have diminished  and an auspicious trend has set in.For the first time in history a start has been made with real disarmament in one area. With a sense of relief the world is experiencing the destruction of highly sophisticated nuclear weapons as a result of the Treaty concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States of America.ItÂ· does indeed enhance confidence to see that political reason and a sense of political responsibility  as well as an awareness of the fact that the existence of nuclear weapons of mass destruction has changed the world  can overcome outmoded ways of thinking and acting dictated by deterrence  with all its attendant risks.Political dialogue has been revived  and is yielding encouraging results. There has been a noticeable upswing in efforts to settle peacefully the complex  protracted and costly regional conflicts and for the first time solutions are in sight. Even though they are only the beginning of a torn for the better  these processes open up greater opportunities for action by the United Nations.All this indicates that efforts with a view to dÃ©tente and disarmament are worthwhile  that a turn for the better is feasible. In this context  the highest representative of the German Democratic Republic  Erich Honaker  noted during his recent visit to the Soviet Union that through its predictable and constructive policies  and with much initiative  the German Democratic Republic had a share in the most recent encouraging developments. We went on to say that natters of particular concern to the German Democratic Republic  as regards the future  were a secure peace and a turning away from confrontation in international relations and towards co-operation. To be realistic though  it should be noted that the situation in the world is still complex and contradictory. Mountains of weapons  both nuclear and conventional  keep on growing: nuclear-weapon tests are continuing  new types of arms are being tested and put into production. Plans for the weaponization of outer space have not been abandoned. Current military spending around the world amounts to a sum equivalent to the material damage caused by the two world wars put together.Many scourges  hunger  disease  illiteracy  pollution of the environment  and underdevelopment  to mention only a few  are increasingly assuming proportions that make them a threat to mankind. Global catastrophes  whether of a military  economic  ecological or other nature  continue to be conceivable as long as the means for their prevention fall victim to arms policies for the sake of profit. We subscribe to the view that  not only must no hiatus be allowed to occur now in the disarmament negotiations  but there is a real need for further results  for only in this way is it possible for immense resources to be released to help resolve  or at least mitigate  mankind's global problems.More than 30 years ago  when the cold war was pushing the world to the brink of a ""hot"" war  Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein demanded  on the eve of the founding of the Pugwash MovementÂ·.""We must learn to think in a new way. We have to learn to ask ourselves  not what steps can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer  for there no longer are such stepsÂ·  the question we have to ask ourselves is: What step can be taken to prevent a military contest of which the issue must be disaster for all parties?""Since then  these perceptions have been shared worldwide. It is true that  in the nuclear age  violence  war and confrontation have become unsuitable means of politics. Security can no longer be based on mountains of weapons  or mutual deterrence. Deterrence means - otherwise it would not be credible - perpetuation of the arms race. Deterrence counts on fear  engenders distrust and it can fail - not only in the event of irrational action but also because it is becoming more and more difficult for man to manage the highly sophisticated weapons systems.The alternative is a security that counts on political  economic  ecological  cultural and humanitarian co-operation  along with the systematic diminution of the military factor. This concept can transform the shared risk in which - like it or not - the international community finds itself at present  into a fabric of security shared by all nations.It is encouraging that the debate of this vital question has begun in East and West  and North and South. Let me call to mind the proposal of socialist States for a comprehensive system of international peace and security  and the proposals and ideas presented here by the Foreign Minister of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Let me recall the Six-Nation Initiative to build a new concept of global security without nuclear weapons  India's initiative to create a system of comprehensive global security  and the ideas of many Western European politicians to establish co-operative security structures and co-operative solutions.  Â·Â·' -AÃÃ these endeavours to introduce a new concept of international relations meet with the support of the socialist German State. The conditions have now become/mature enough to make it possible to push for results in the dialogue on -security policies in the United Nations.Admittedly  Ä world without weapons is still a distant hope. But measures for arms limitation and disarmament are the only means towards this end. The Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - has proved that this road is practicable. Relevant proposals to this end were submitted by the Warsaw Treaty States at the session of the Political Consultative Committee of the Alliance last July. They envisage the following priorities: conclusion of a treaty on a 50 per cent reduction in Soviet and American strategic offensive arsenals together with strict adherence to the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty  to be followed by further steps to reduce the arsenals of nuclear weapons to the point of their eliminationÂ·  a complete and general ban on nuclear-weapon tests and  as a step towards this goal  agreements between the USSR and the United States on decreasing the yield and number of their nuclear explosions; prevention of an arms race in outer space - to this end  a ban on anti-satellite weapons  the establishment of an inspectorate to observe all space launches  and the creation of an organization for the protection of outer space; a ban on chemical weaponsÂ·  radical reductions in armed forces and in conventional armaments in Europe; the inclusion of naval forces in the disarmament negotiations; prevention of the military abuse of the latest scientific and technological achievements; establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace - wherever possible - as important steps on the road to general and complete disarmament; mutual observation of the implementation of commitments or of arms postures - which means real control through effective verification.That will reduce mistrust  help gradually to overcome the image of the ""enemy""  and finally generate confidence and therewith a readiness for co-operation. The positive experiences resulting from the Stockholm Declaration are an encouragement in this regard.The German Democratic Republic shares the view of the Six-Nation Initiative that it would be helpful to set up a multilateral verification system within the framework of the United Nations. Regrettably  peace cannot be taken for granted  least of all in Europe  a continent which has lived through more years of war than of peace. For that reason more than 40 years of peace - the longest period of peace in Europe to date - should not make us forget that this peace is fragile because it is built on arms. In Europe there is a concentration of destructive military capabilities unparalleled anywhere else in the world. For this continent  where two devastating world wars have begun in this century  disarmament is a vital question  indeed a question of survival. On the other hand  Europe is the continent where the Helsinki Final Act and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) process show that peaceful coexistence among States with different social systems is feasible and of undisputed benefit to all the parties involved. As for the remaining tactical nuclear weapons  their inclusion in the disarmament process in Europe should be called for most emphatically. The Berlin Conference on Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones  where the broadest spectrum of peace activists met for an all-embracing  equal and open dialogue  has strengthened our resolve to pursue the proposal  which we submitted jointly with the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  for denuclearization in Central Europe.As for chemical weapons  a global ban should be instituted as soon as possible. Any methods - no matter who proposes them - will receive our support if they take us all closer to that goal with no further loss of time. In this respect  we welcome the new proposals put forward by President Francois Mitterrand. A chemical-weapon-free zone in Europe should be helpful in this context.I wish to recall here the offer made to the Federal Republic of Germany by the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia to make an immediate start on negotiations to free the territories of these States  or keep their territories free  from chemical weapons. The parts of the Convention on a comprehensive prohibition of chemical weapons that have already been agreed in Geneva - notably  those on verification - could be tested in a practical way in such a zone. Other steps conducive to a final agreement would be an exchange of data on chemicals to be banned under the Convention  as well as model inspections at production sites of the chemical industry. The German Democratic Republic has made relevant data available  and other States remain called upon to do the same.The States parties to the Warsaw Treaty strongly support substantial reductions of armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe - that is  from the Atlantic to the Urals. The relevant three-stage proposal that they submitted in Warsaw takes account of the other side's ideas and could well provide a basis for negotiations  which could be opened as early as this year.The Warsaw Treaty States desire a situation in which any surprise attack or operation would be impossible  only the forces and equipment required for defence would be retained. That presupposes that this is the very objective of the military doctrines of both alliances.The plan to establish a zone of confidence and security in Central Europe  put forward by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party  Milos Jakes  like Vojciech Jaruzelski's memorandum on arms cuts in Central Europe  is an immediately practicable step  provided that there is a readiness in principle for confidence-building and arms limitation. The creation of a European centre to reduce the risk of war in Europe  or of a median ism for peaceful crisis management in Central Europe - the installation of a ""hot line"" between Berlin  Bonn and Prague - or of mixed observation posts at strategically important points  would promote confidence-building and disarmament.This and other material is what we could use  beginning at once  to build  brick by brick  the house of Europe in the spirit of the Helsinki Final Act.It is with this very goal in mind that we strive to conclude the Vienna follow-up meeting at the level of Foreign Ministers as soon as possible with a substantive document that is balanced in all parts. This would make it possible to start  as early as this year  the generally desired negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe and to agree on further confidence-building measures.The existence of two sovereign German States  independent of each other and with different social systems  is a constituent element of a peaceful European order. As far as relations between them are concerned  there is something I wish to underline it is crucial that they be not a source of tensions and threats affecting the relationship between States in Europe  but rather a constructive factor in East-West relations. It is in the hands of the two German States to make their mutual relationship a desirable model of peaceful coexistence between States with different social systems. This should be possible if both sides take account of the existing realities and display political will  reason and realism. Such is the way to fulfil the obligation  undertaken by the two States  that never again must war  but only peace  start from German soil - an obligation reaffirmed by General Secretary Erich Honecker and Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the joint communiquÃ© published when the German Democratic Republic's highest representative paid an official visit to the Federal Republic about a year ago. The German Democratic Republic is ready to pursue this policy at any time.Thanks to a calmer international situation  thanks to initial successes in arms limitation and disarmament  and  not least  thanks to the improved relations between the Soviet Union and the United States  conditions have become more favourable for the settlement of international conflicts as well. Progress on such problems  crucial as it is for world peace  is evident indeed. It confirms that dialogue  willingness to compromise  a sense of reality and perceptiveness are the only way towards just  comprehensive and lasting solutions. If positive results are to be achieved  all States should be committed to this aim  for all States  whether or not involved directly  are in any case directly affected. For these reasons it is both their right and their obligation to act rather than to remain aloof.At the same time it has become obvious that the United Nations can assist in the peaceful settlement of international conflicts if and when all States  but chiefly the sides to the conflicts themselves  support the Organization in this effort. Our particular acknowledgement and gratitude go to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  for the numerous initiatives he has taken. We extend to him our sincere congratulations on the high distinction of the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the United Nations peace-keeping forces  and encourage him to persist in his efforts. The Geneva agreements have been an important step towards bringing calm to the situation in and around Afghanistan. The Afghan people needs peace and national reconciliation to engage in reconstruction. For that  all sides must strictly fulfil the obligations they have undertaken. Externally supported terror and all kinds of foreign intervention must be discontinued.Security Council resolution 598 (1987) has proved to be a sound basis for settling the tragic and costly fighting between Iran and Iraq. The negotiations that have been started must now convert the truce into a lasting peace. Maximum restraint by the parties directly involved in the conflict and the withdrawal of foreign naval forces could have a favourable bearing on the peace process.As far as the situation on the Korean peninsula is concerned  the German Democratic Republic supports the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for safeguarding peace and detente in that region.The negotiations between Angola  Cuba and South Africa and the agreements reached so far in regard to attaining Independence for Namibia should be viewed as an important step towards a political solution to the conflict in southern Africa. Implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) continues to rank high on the agenda. But so long as apartheid persists in South Africa  destabilization and aggression will threaten the States of the region. Therefore  comprehensive and binding sanctions against the racist regime are a matter of necessity. Apartheid cannot be reformed: it must be abolished. Let me repeat on this Day of Solidarity with South African Political Prisoners: Nelson Mandela and all other patriots must be free at last.	.We welcome the positive developments on the Horn of Africa  above all the peace agreement between Ethiopia and Somalia and the understanding between Ethiopia and Sudan. There is quasi-unanimity that an international Middle East conference would be the best way to find a comprehensive  just and hence lasting settlement to the protracted and extremely complex conflict in that region. It therefore would seem to be fitting for the Security Council to prepare a negotiating r ach an ism  at the level of foreign ministers if necessary. All interested parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (FLO) and Israel  must of course participate in such a conference  to be held under the auspices of the United Nations. The Arabic ""salaam* should be answered with a ""shalom"" from Tel Aviv.The German Democratic Republic emphatically supports the Guatemala plan for peace in Central America. The Nicaraguan Government has been doing all it can to implement that plan fully. It is for the contras and the Power that supports them to go their part of the way towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict. Outside interference in Nicaragua must come to an end. The same applies to Panama.The Jakarta Informal Meeting should be viewed as an expression of the endeavours of the Indochinese States to settle the Kampuchean conflict by political means. May the agreed consultations and the forthcoming talks between Chairman Hun Sen of the Council of Ministers and Prince Norodom Sihanouk be successful.A source of hope is the resumption of negotiations between the leaders of the two communities towards resolving the Cyprus question. The efforts being made to achieve a peaceful settlement of the problems concerning Western Sahara also meet with our support.For the improvement of international relations to be enduring  united efforts are repaired  mainly for the observance of the supreme human right - the right to a life of peace. The German Democratic Republic advocates stepped-up co-operation to eliminate mass violations of human rights and to ensure implementation of all human rights - economic  social  cultural  civil and political. The lessons of the past and the responsibility for the future should be perceived as a common obligation to act against fascism and neo-fascism in all its manifestations.Today more than 5 billion people live on earth  and by the turn of this century their number may well exceed 6 billion. They all need employment and food; they all have a right to shelter  health care and education. The solution of these formidable problems is becoming more and more an elementary condition for the maintenance of peace and security. The growth and prosperity enjoyed by some must no longer be attained at the expense and to the detriment of other States and peoples. There is an imperative need for co-operative solutions in overcoming underdevelopment  in the democratic restructuring of international economic relations  in international trade  monetary and financial relations  the environmental sector and many other fields of human activity. The United Nations constitutes the universal framework for efforts to achieve those ends.It is necessary to draft expeditiously an international development strategy for the 1990s  the special session of the General Assembly on international economic issues  to be held in the year 1990  could be useful in that regard.The external-debt problems of developing countries have to be solved globally and equitably - that is  in a manner that would guarantee a future of sustained growth and social progress for those countries.No doubt  a system that would warn of risk factors in the world economy could strengthen economic security. A report on this subject should be submitted to the United Nations not later than 1989 - that is  next year.The Warsaw Treaty States have put forward proposals in their declaration on ""The impact of the arms race on the natural environment and other aspects of ecological security"". The United Nations certainly has a special part to play in co-ordinating the efforts in the field of ecological security. Relevant proposals which have been submitted for holding meetings in this respect under United Nations auspices have our approval.For the Garman Democratic Republic 1988 means 15 years of co-operation within the United Nations. I reiterate today what the then Foreign Minister  Otto Winzer  said I5 years ago - that the socialist German State respected without any reservations the purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and desired that they guide the actions of States world-wide. This State remains committed to promoting the work of the United Nations. The possibilities and mechanisms available to Member States and to the Organization are not yet fully utilized. It is also crucial for the effectiveness of the United Nations that co-operation among all States on an equal basis should not be hampered by discriminatory and unjustifiable restrictions Imposed on a certain number of permanent missions and reflected in the debates in the Committee on Relations with the Host Country.The prestige and authority of the United Nations have been visibly enhanced through its latest peace-making efforts. That is an encouragement to redouble our efforts for the attainment of the lofty objectives of this world Organization. The German Democratic Republic  for its part  is ready to do that."
"40",1849,"DEU",43,1988,"ï»¿Please convey  Sir  my warm congratulations to the President on his election to preside over the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I wish him luck and success in his high office.As in previous years  my delegation will do everything possible to help the General Assembly achieve positive results.I wish to thank the President of the forty-second session  Ambassador Peter Florin  for his successful contribution. He guided the Assembly's proceedings circumspectly and pragmatically and with a view to getting results.This session begins in encouraging circumstances. When we met here 12 months ago the war between Iraq and Iran was claiming countless victims day after day. In Afghanistan an end to the human suffering was not foreseeable. In southern Africa  too  there was no cause for hope.Today the weapons in the Gulf are silent. Negotiations have been begun between the warring parties. A year after its unanimous adoption by the Security Council  resolution 598 (1987) has been accepted by both parties to the conflict as a basis for a cease-fire. In Afghanistan the Geneva agreements  likewise achieved with the decisive assistance of the United Nations  created the conditions for the withdrawal of the Soviet troops. Fifty per cent of those troops have already left the country in accordance with the terms of the agreements.Following his talks in southern Africa the Secretary-General has expressed his confidence with regard to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).None of this progress has simply fallen into the world Organization's lap. These achievements are the outcome of a favourable change in the international climate and are the product of the manifold efforts of the principal organs of the United Nations  above all its Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar.The Secretary-General has said that serving the cause of peace is worth the maximum personal endeavour. He is making that endeavour and we all  the Members of the United Nations  are grateful to him for it. He has proved wrong those who had doubts about the United Nations. He encourages all who seek to strengthen its peace-promoting role.	.The Federal Republic of Germany has actively supported the United Nations and its Secretary-General.As a non-permanent member of the Security Council  we have worked constructively for the implementation of Security Council resolutions 435 (1978) and 598 (1987). After the adoption of resolution 598 (1987) we kept in touch with both parties to the conflict  calling upon them to accept and implement it. I appeal to Iraq and Iran to conduct the negotiations with a will to make compromises and to achieve a comprehensive  just and honourable peace settlement. In Afghanistan the withdrawal of the Soviet troops opens up the possibility of a new political beginning in that country. This opportunity should be seized by all concerned  like the European Community  the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany is ready to provide substantial humanitarian assistance in the process of repatriating and reintegrating the millions of refugees and  given the right domestic conditions  to contribute to Afghanistan's reconstruction.Major progress has also been achieved towards a settlement of the conflicts in southern Africa. Important forward steps have been taken. The South African troops have left Angola. Negotiations are under way for the withdrawal of the Cuban troops. We have come a good deal closer to Namibia's independence. Security Council resolution 43S (1978) has always been and remains the only viable route to this goal. As a member of the Contact Group  my Government offers its good offices in seeking the implementation of that resolution.Developments have also been favourable in other parts of the world.In Cambodia the contours of a peace settlement are beginning to appear.Talk between the Governments of South Korea and North Korea now seem to be within the realm of the possible.In Central America the continuing cease-fire can facilitate dialogue between the conflicting parties so that democracy may be firmly established.A peaceful settlement of the conflicts in Western Sahara and between Libya and Chad is moving nearer.Representatives of the two ethnic groups in Cyprus are negotiating on the island's future. Â· The Middle East is still a source of concern. Negotiations are still not in sight  although the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories shows that the status quo is untenable. An international conference on the Middle East is and remains the appropriate framework for the necessary negotiations on a peace settlement that will enable the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination and guarantee the right of all States in the region  including Israel  to exist within secured borders.We wish sorely-tried Lebanon a peaceful solution to its problems based on sovereignty  unity and national reconciliation.If we want to secure peace world-wide once and for all we must strengthen the forces of peace. This means  first of all  that we must strengthen the United Nations. To achieve this we must continue the successful endeavours to bring about internal reforms. What we need above all is full implementation of the Charter. We are prepared to consider seriously proposals aimed at enhancing the peace-promoting powers op our Organization. This is also the objective of our initiative for preventing conflicts which has been put before this session of the General Assembly for final approval. We deem it essential that the United Nations be in a position to act before a conflict actually breaks out.The kind of peace we pursue can be based solely on the rule of law. It must derive from the right of self-determination of nations and from the civil  economic and social human rights enshrined in the International Covenants on Human Rights adopted by the United Nations. There is a growing awareness that all public power comes up against its absolute limit in human rights. Respect for human rights is not only an internal affair  within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe ÃCSCR) process those rights have become a central issue.One of the most blatant mockeries of human rights and manifestations of disregard for those rights is the system of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa. We demand the abolition of this un-reformable system. We demand the release of Nelson Mandela  Eric Molohi and all other political prisoners in South Africa. We demand the lifting of the ban on the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and all other organizations of the blackmajority so as to open the way for a peaceful national dialogue. Let there be no doubt about it; we will not be prohibited from helping anti-apartheid organizations.The chairman of the largest single trade union in the world  the Metal Workers' Union in the Federal Republic of Germany  has drawn up a catalogue of minimum standards for labour relations to be respected by the South African subsidiaries of German companies. They afford South African unions and workers  irrespective of their colour  the same claim to social justice as their colleagues in the Federal Republic of Germany. Large German companies have promised to apply these minimum standards in South Africa. From this rostrum I appeal to all trade unions and all firms to follow this example.The rule of law implies absolute respect for international law. That respect is the foundation of policies that are geared to negotiation and agreements rather than to the threat or use of force. The rule of law implies protection of and respect for minorities  be they religious  national or ethnic minorities. All such minorities have a right to develop their identity  to cultivate their language and to live according to their cultural traditions and to exercise their religion  while enjoying equal political and legal rights.The rule of law is menaced by international terrorism. The international community must oppose terrorism  which is hostile to human dignity and any human order  with still greater determination.The rule of law implies joint efforts to combat drug trafficking. This is an increasingly urgent international problem which can only be solved through the joint efforts of all governments. My Government hopes that the deliberations of the forthcoming diplomatic conference in Vienna will lead to a United Nations convention to combat illegal drug trafficking. This could mean considerable progress. We can look to the future with confidence. The community of nations is showing greater respect for the rule of law. There is a growing willingness to resolve even the most serious differences by negotiation. This indicates a fundamental change in international relations. The core of these changes is in the attempts by West and East to place their relations on a new foundation. One of the reasons why the world Organization has been able to achieve progress in the peaceful settlement of conflicts is that West and East have increasingly been co-operating to this end. It has become obvious that West-East confrontation must not be carried over into the third world but must  where it arises  be defused step by step and  as far as possible  be resolved through dialogue and co-operation.The progress of the European Community is one of the promising world trends. By creating a community of 12 European democracies we have won a victory over national egoism  power politics and prejudice. It is the greatest and finest victory in the history of Europe. It has not cost a single human life  yet it is winning us the future.Franco-German friendship and co-operation are at the core of this future-oriented development. The European Community is the most advanced association of sovereign States to date. The dynamism and attractiveness of our Community are growing constantly. The European Community has committed itself to free world trade and world economic co-operation. It is becoming a driving force of growth not only for ourselves but for the world economy as a whole. This makes us resolute opponents of protectionism.The growth potential of the single market and of the common social and monetary area will make the European Community even more capable of developing a world economic partnership with the North American democracies and Japan. By increasing our economic strength we can also increasingly promote the development of the third world. The larger European market will be able to absorb even more products from the third world.As the LomÃ© Conventions  our agreements with the Mediterranean area and our co-operation agreements with the Association of South-East Asian Nations  the States of Central America and the Gulf Co-operation Council show  the European Community is already a major partner of the countries of the third world. This co-operation takes place on the basis of equal rights.The powerful growth of the European Community creates a considerable opportunity for the development of West-East relations. The task now is to plan the architecture of the whole of Europe  from the Atlantic to the Urals. The more the Soviet Union pursues the process of opening itself internally and externally  the more capable it will become of co-operation with the West and the East. We want this reform policy to prove successful. Europe's future lies not in hoping for  let alone seeking  the destabilization of the other side  but rather in co-operation and productive competition.The manifold forms of co-operation will determine the architecture of the peaceful order in Europe or  as it also can be termed  the common European house.The ensuing interdependence will enhance mutual confidence and make for greater stability. This new order must not be characterized by fences  but by open doors  by freedom of movement for people  for ideas and goods  as well as respect for human rights.One of the pillars of the European structure is and will remain the European Community oriented towards openness and co-operation. We know that Europe is more than the European Community. President Mitterrand put this most impressively in his historic speech in Aachen in 1987. As a result of increasing co-operation  of genuine dÃ©tente and of disarmament  the military elements will lose significance in the West-East relationship  whereas political  economic  ecological and cultural co-operation will gain in importance.  Thanks to this development. West and Fast will derive a fresh potential which can he used not for disarmament but for the advancement their own societies and for co-operation with the developing countries.The change for the better in the whole of Europe derives energy from the revival of our continent's identity. That identity emanates from our common European history  Europe's glories and aberrations  its common culture - to which all European nations have made major contributions  and from the awareness of our mutual responsibility for the future of our continent and for peace and development in the world. Decades of separation have not made two Europes out of one Europe; decades of separation have not made two German nations out of one German nation. The German people in the heart of Europe  having often been in conflict with its neighbours  has learned its lessons from history. Both German States are meeting their responsibility for peace in Europe  including through mutual co-operation. 4hat benefits all Europeans.Through our membership of the European Community and the Atlantic alliance  we Germans in the Federal Republic of Germany have responsibly used the freedom we regained after the Second World War. We have established the strongest imaginable bond States can have: the bond of common values. Our commitment to peace in Europe also led us to conclude treaties with the Soviet Union  the Polish People's Republic and Czechoslovakia  and to conclude the Basic Treaty with the German Democratic Republic  united  too  to our active participation in bringing about the Final Act of Helsinki and in the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). We regard the development of our relations with the Soviet Union  which are of crucial importance to us  as playing a key role in improving the overall West-Fast relationship. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's forthcoming visit to the Soviet Union will serve that purpose. We have been nailing for a peaceful order in Europe ever since the Atlantic alliance presented its Harmel report in 1967. For a long time we received no answer to this proposed grand design for a better Europe. The policy initiated by General-Secretary Gorbachev in the Soviet Union can turn the design contained in the Harmel report into reality. This new policy in the Soviet Union meets not merely with a favourable but with a constructive response from us. We all have a responsibility to use every opportunity to bring about a change for the better. The distinct improvement in United States-Soviet relations indicates the opportunities arising there from.The Final Act of Helsinki marks the course towards a peaceful order in Europe in which states with different political and social systems can live together in peaceful competition without fear of one another. By seeking to establish such a peaceful order in Europe  the Federal Republic of Germany is complying with the mandate of its Constitution  the Basic Law  which is to serve the cause of peace in Europe and to overcome the separation of our indivisible nation. Our efforts to achieve the early conclusion of the Vienna follow-up meeting with the adoption of a substantive and we11-balanced final document should bring us another step forward towards a European peaceful order.We are today confronted with the task of protecting mankind from the dangers which man himself has created. Technological development leaves in our hands the decision whether we create a better and more humane world or we perish. The responsibility not only for ourselves but for all future generations must determine our policies  our thinking and our actions. In view of the danger of nuclear annihilation  the disarmament process had to begin with nuclear disarmament. In this connection the Treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces represents a breakthrough of fundamental importance since till now arms have only been limited. Now  for the first time  a whole class of weapons is being eliminated. The global elimination of Soviet and United States intermediate-range nuclear weapons must be followed by radical measures with regard to nuclear  chemical and conventional weapons. Reducing the strategic nuclear forces of both super-Powers by half must become a reality.The shocking pictures of the consequences of the use of chemical weapons prompt me to appeal to all participants in the Geneva Conference on Disarmament to bring the now-far-advanced negotiations on a global ban on such weapons to the earliest possible conclusion. Only a world-wide convention ensuring the verifiable prevention of the manufacture  storage  transfer and use of chemical weapons can free mankind from the scourge of these cruel weapons for all time. My Government is playing an active part also in efforts to strengthen all instruments which can be utilized to prevent the use and proliferation of chemical weapons even before a global ban is in force. We welcome President Reagan's initiative calling for a conference of the signatories of the 1925 Geneva Protocol. While pursuing all these efforts  we must devote our entire energy to the task of achieving a global ban as the priority objective.In the field of conventional arms our aim is to remove superiority and imbalances by means of asymmetrical disarmament. We want to create conditions in Europe in which neither side will still be capable of launching an attack on foreign territory. Large-scale offensive options do not feature in our Western concept. True conventional stability and further confidence-building require also consensus on the question of the defence philosophy underlying the policies. We seek Ð° consensus on the functions to be given to both sides' forces. This must cover their size  equipment and command principles. I appeal to all concerned  to all the participants in the CSCE  to adopt before the end of October 1988  together with this final document of the Vienna CSCE follow-up meeting  a mandate for the commencement of negotiations on conventional stability. The time is ripe; all must now live up to their responsibility. Unlimited armaments do not create unlimited security  but balanced and mutual disarmament can help create more security. That is why disarmament and arms control are just as much an integral part of the security policy of the Atlantic Alliance as our defence efforts.In the nuclear age war must be made un-wageable once and for all. New thinking requires that over the net of deterrence - the safety net of the ultimate ratio - an additional net of new  co-operative structures of military security be created which will reduce the enormous risks of exclusive reliance on deterrence.Being realists  we know that we cannot base today's security on hopes for tomorrow. But  being men of action  meeting our responsibility for the future  we must today already create the foundations for our future security  foundations which must be broader  more solid and stronger than the ones on which peace has been based up to now.Mankind's future is not threatened by war alone. There is a growing danger of man's destroying his own sources of life on this planet. We are faced with the task of preserving our natural sources of life and pressing ahead with the development of the third world. The two are closely intertwined. At present the world's population is more than 5 billion; soon it will be 6 billion. According to the World Bank statistics  about one billion people live in absolute poverty.The industrial countries - all industrial countries; not only those in the West but also the socialist States - have a duty to act together. We must use our economic  scientific and technological potentials in order to render development possible and to preserve the world's natural sources of life. This presupposes the development of new forms of transport  new sources of energy  new materials and new production methods. It is on this and not on the development of new and ever more terrible weapons of mass destruction that the energy and the technology of industrial countries must he concentrated. What the nations of the third world need from industrial countries is not weapons but help for their development. I repeat my proposal that the United Nations record exports of weapons in a register. I welcome the Soviet Union's support for this proposal as expressed yesterday.The purpose is also to satisfy the basic needs of hundreds of millions of people in the developing countries. Time and again  at ever shorter intervals  catastrophic food shortages occur which pose a challenge to mankind's solidarity and willingness to help. But humanitarian assistance alone cannot solve the problem. In spite of some favourable trends this year - the world economic situation having improved more than expected - we must admit that poverty in the third world is growing and the debt burden is growing. True  the gross domestic product increased in the developing countries as well last year  bat in many instances this improvement is being negated by population growth. Investments for the future are impeded by debt-servicing commitments.In 1987 the debt-servicing payments of developing countries exceeded incoming funds by $15 billion. In such circumstances it is impossible for these countries to increase their economic potential.The situation is particularly serious in the sub-Saharan countries. My Government supports the programme of action adopted at the special session of the General Assembly on Africa. 11 had previously cancelled about 2.9 billion marks of the debt owed by 20 of these countries. It has also announced its readiness to write off debts worth about 2.3 billion marks for six more African countries that are not among the least developed countries and are prepared to implement adjustment and reform programmes in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. All donors should include in their official aid to the poorest countries a large grant element. We intend to increase the grant element of our financial co-operation with the developing countries overall. Our development assistance to the least developed countries is already being provided in grant formMy Government also proposes that initial  tangible debt-servicing relief should be afforded within the scope of the Paris Club rescheduling operations. It has also decided to broaden and considerably ease the terms of our bilateral financial co-operation with our partners in the third world.  We expect the commercial banks too to increase their commitment in the developing countries. Many of the newly industrializing economies as well are suffering from the consequences of their heavy foreign debts. Here  too  the commercial banks in particular are urgently called upon to provide the funds necessary to ensure the economic development of these countries. Such funds will not bring any long-term benefits  however  unless the recipients carry out effective adjustment programmes which create suitable conditions. We hope that the new Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency will also be conducive to this process.It remains indispensable to secure free access for developing countries to the markets of industrial countries. The main problem here lies in non-tariff trade barriers. These must be removed in the course of the ongoing Uruguay Round if the concept of free world trade is not to lose its credibility. In the first six months of this year our imports from developing countries increased by over 5 per cent  while corresponding exports are down by more than 8 per cent.In their joint efforts to promote development the industrial and developing countries must make sure that those very efforts do not themselves become one of the factors causing the destruction of the environment. The principle still to be observed is that the industrial countries  when investing in developing countries  should submit to the standards that apply at home.The idea of introducing an international criminal law for crimes against the environment  which is being considered by the Committee on Crime Prevention and Control  is right. We must prevent large parts of the third world being turned into poison-garbage depots of the northern over-consumption societies as a result of criminal transport practices  but also as a result of exploitation of the financial distress of some developing countries. The political and economic colonialism of the past must not now be followed by poison-garbage colonialism.There is more to the relationship between development and ecology than that  however. Many developing countries  owing to their economic plight  are compelled to over-exploit their natural resources. The economy-ecology relationship must be made one of the main items of the agenda in the North-South dialogue. The violation and destruction of nature is much the same as the violation of human rights. The damage caused in one country is the concern of all- Who would still dispute that this has long since become a task of world domestic policy? For this reason  all German development projects are thoroughly examined as to their compatibility with the environment. Such a review should be carried out as a matter of course in the context of all development co-operation between North and South.The extent of the danger to which we are all exposed is obvious from the changes in the world's climate. The gap in the Earth's ozone layer is constantly widening. A commission appointed by the German Federal Republic Parliament came to the conclusion that a catastrophic deterioration of the Earth's climate can be avoided only if the present international agreements are drastically tightened up in the next few years and if the aerosols causing the damage to the ozone layer have been almost completely removed by the year 20Ã0 Over the past 20 years more than 3 million people have lost their lives as a result of natural disasters all over the world. More than 800 million people have suffered as a result of such disasters and damage to property has exceeded $23 billion. The forty-second session of the General Assembly quite rightly proclaimed the last 10 years of the century the decade for disaster prevention.The number of disasters afflicting mankind that do not have natural causes but are nature's reaction to its maltreatment by man is increasing all the time. The repair of damage resulting from such disasters must be complemented by preventive measures designed to ensure their early detection and mitigate their consequences. We already have the science and technology to achieve this  if only we can pool our efforts. This is a dictate of political and economic reason and applies to all members in the community of nations. The international community as a whole is responsible for the state of the Earth  which has been entrusted to us for safekeeping. The consequences of any aberrations affect us all.Genetic engineering will soon give man the power to change himself. This poses the question of our self-perception as human beings  a question which no congress of biogenetic engineers  no State  but only mankind itself can answer. It therefore needs to be dealt with by the United Nations. Let us bring together the best and the wisest citizens of all nations so that they may tell us where man should set his own limits if he is not to betray himself  if he is not to abandon his dignity  his uniqueness.We must set our minds to that task. It  too  calls for a new approach. The scientist accepts as a matter of course that there is a complex interdependence  an interaction of different elements and processes. Similarly  politics too must now be understood as the interaction of quite different people  States and systems with but one framework for their actions  the biosphere in which we live  and with one dimension of responsibility  which extends far beyond our age  embracing the survival of mankind and the fate of the whole of creation.Let us erect a barrier against the maltreatment and destruction of creation. Because we all depend on the success of these efforts  we all depend on one another. While dependence compels all of us to desist from trying to dominate others  to desist from an arms race and to reject the arrogance of power and the egoism of the stronger.West and East  North and South  must channel their energies into a new responsibility for this planet and for the future of mankind. We must no longer ask what our neighbours are doing to protect the Earth. We must ask what we ourselves can do  what can we do together. We need not despair in the face of this responsibility  which is unique in the history of mankind. We have no reason to be faint-hearted or despondent. As we face up to our responsibility for the future our best allies are the nations themselves. The people wish to live  they wish to live without fear; they wish to live without want. They will no longer allow themselves to be made objects of exploitation  oppression and power politics. They demand the chance to exercise their human rights  their civil  economic and social rights. The people are determined and inspired by the idea of their inalienable human dignity  the idea of freedom and the idea of peace. Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come. The time has come. We must act now."
"41",1887,"DJI",43,1988,"ï»¿Since our last session the international situation hats clearly changed. Our goal of peace and development seems closer. Conflicts and tensions that have aroused our concern in recent years are being resolved  and we hope very sincerely that the dialogue that has started between the various belligerents will produce the necessary solutions.Before continuing  Sir  I am pleased to take this opportunity to pay tribute to your eminent qualities and attributes  which made a big contribution to your election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I congratulate you most warmly.I also pay tribute to the outgoing President of the forty-second session  Ambassador Florin of the German Democratic Republic. We are grateful to him for the outstanding way in which he conducted the General Assembly's work.I also wish to express my Government's gratitude to the Secretary-General  t Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his ceaseless  praiseworthy efforts for world peace  I wish him well as he continues to persevere in his noble mission. We are gratified by the recent award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces.As I have just emphasized  this session is of special interest. It is being held at a time when major events are being witnessed  such as the cease-fire in the Iraq-Iran conflict and positive developments in the question of Afghanistan In recent times East-West relations have been marked by the combined efforts of the two great Powers  the Soviet Union and the United States  to promote international detente. The most striking event was the signing of a Treaty to bring about a 50 per cent reduction in strategic nuclear weapons. We hope that that positive event will not only lead the parties to respect their commitments as scrupulously as possible  but will also provide a new point of departure to conclude new agreements leading to comprehensive and complete disarmament.- It is time to envisage building a non-violent world  free of nuclear weapons.The Government of the Republic of Djibouti welcomes the desire for peace shown by the two neighbouring Muslim countries  the Republic of Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  by their acceptance of the cease-fire and Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We urge the two countries to abide by their commitments to peace and to start direct negotiations  a necessary pre-condition for the establishment of a just and lasting settlement in the region.Furthermore  we hope that this peace will not be limited to the borders of the two neighbours  but that it will be extended throughout the region  because other neighbouring areas have experienced dangerous tensions. Pot that to be achieved  it is important that all States fully enjoy freedom of navigation.With its hundreds of thousands of victims  the Iraq-Iran war has been one of the longest and most deadly conflicts since the end of the Second World War. The Republic of Djibouti expresses its full support for the process under way and hopes that it will fully succeed  so that the peoples of Iraq and Iran may finally live in peace.For almost 10 years the situation in Afghanistan has caused deep concern. However  after the repeated appeals of the international community  a partial withdrawal of foreign troops recently occurred. We believe that the fraternal people of Afghanistan should recover its independence and freedom by freely choosing the political system that it considers appropriate  without any constraints.The question of Palestine remains at the core of the Middle East problem. We support the legitimate popular uprising of the Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territories and condemn the policy of oppression and aggression practised by Israel in those territories. Faced with a defenceless population  the array of occupation does not hesitate to fire on children  women and old people. It uses all kinds of weapons  in violation of international law. The massacre of the civilian population continues and the number of victims increases daily. Faced with the repressive Israeli machine  the resistance is increasing  at the cost of hundreds of martyrs.The Palestinian people must recover its territory and fully exercise its legitimate rights  under the guidance of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  its sole and legitimate representative. Another requirement for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East is Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories  including the Holy City of Jerusalem and southern Lebanon.With regard to Lebanon  we urge all components of the Lebanese people to take part in a frank and sincere dialogue to bring about mutual trust  for the establishment of peace and national unity.Djibouti supports the efforts to convene an international peace conference on the Middle East  in conformity with the provisions of the relevant General Assembly resolutions  a conference in which the PLO would participate as an independent party and on an equal footing with the other parties.In South Africa the racist regime is perpetuating its hateful  inhuman system of apartheid  and the situation gets worse every day  with new restrictions imposed on the South African people  with  in particular; continued detention  torture and assassination. My country supports the just struggle of the people of South Africa  and appeals to the international community to take appropriate steps to dismantle apartheid. The serious internal situation is coupled with acts of aggression and destabilization perpetrated by the racist regime against neighbouring States. A just settlement of the question  in conformity with various United Nations resolutions  can be brought about only by imposing comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the Pretoria regime. Such sanctions remain the most effective way to dismantle apartheid.The international community must also put pressure on the South African regime to obtain the immediate  unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners.The racist regime of South Africa continues its illegal occupation of Namibia  in contravention of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We hope that the quadripartite talks new under way will make it possible to give the Namibian people power on the basis of their own wishes  freely and democratically expressed. Finally  we pay tribute to the South West Africa People's Organization  the sole representative of the Namibian people  for the heroic struggle it is waging.On the Korean peninsula the beginning of dialogue between the two fraternal countries is an encouraging sign and will permit the development of a climate of mutual trust.In Kampuchea we desire the total withdrawal of foreign forces so that Democratic Kampuchea may regain its independence and enjoy full sovereignty and integrity.With regard to the question of Western Sahara  we welcome the Secretary-General's efforts to resolve the conflict  and support the holding of a referendum on self-determination for the people of Western Sahara  organized by the United Nations.There can be no world peace and security without prospects of economic prosperity for all mankind. Peace  security and well-being are closely linked  like members of a single body. The world is a single entity. Everything that happens in one region has direct repercussions in other regions. All nations need each other  without exception. Unfortunately international economic relations are structured nowadays in such a way that it is the developing countries that suffer from the damaging effects of an obviously unjust international economic order. In order to remedy this profound economic and financial crisis  we must find meaningful solutions and proceed to the elaboration of principles and instruments to establish a new order in international economic relations.Thus the United Nations  in 1986  adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for the Economic Recovery and Development of Africa  and the Organisation of African Unity  in July 1985 adopted the Priority Programme for the Economic Recovery of Africa for the years 1986 to 1990. While it is not necessary to speak at length here about the crisis affecting Africa  or to mention the price paid by the African countries  we cannot fail to stress the meagre results achieved  particularly after these two years of effort and sacrifice by our continent.To create the basis for self-sustained economic development  the African countries decided to take a number of steps to attain that goal. More than half of them  in fact  have instituted economic reforms  as devised in the Priority Programme for the Economic Recovery of Africa  and they are already at the stage of implementing their structural adjustment programmes  with the support of financial groups such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) â However  these structural adjustment programmes do not provide an answer to economic conditions  particularly at the present stage of development of the majority of the developing countries.With regard to the African debt  the international community has acknowledged that it is a major obstacle to development. Accordingly  the Toronto summit in June proposed  some debt relief. Certainly  this can be viewed as an encouraging sign  but unfortunately it is limited in scope  involving only a certain number of African countries. But fairly satisfactory results can be obtained if the industrialized countries implement the resolutions of the General Assembly and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on debt relief  and if they provide specific effective support for the recovery efforts of Africa  as included in the United Nations Programme of Action. Furthermore  we salute the honourable initiative taken by certain donor countries which wiped out the debt as ODA - official development assistance - or which took similar steps in keeping with resolution 165 (S-IX) of the Trade and Development Board of UNCTAD and we hope that that initiative will be followed by other donors.Given the critical economic situation in Africa and the specific nature of the crisis  the responsibility that falls on the international community is basic. The international community has pledged assistance to these countries by taking supplementary steps and providing the necessary resources. However  we hope that the quality and modalities of this assistance and co-operation will be improved upon and strengthened.Africa refuses to rely entirely on external action to resolve its problems  and is committed to making the necessary efforts for its own development. Several initiatives bear witness to this - inter alia  the fact that economic regional and subregional groups have been established or are now being established. Without a doubt this type of group will provide a basis for the true African community and will thereby help to resolve a certain number of problems.It is within the intergovernmental authority on drought and development that sincere dialogue is now under way in Djibouti between our two neighbours  Ethiopia and Somalia - dialogue which  as representatives know  has led to the cessation of hostilities and to the restoration of diplomatic relations and an exchange of prisoners. Over the last decade major progress has been made in Djibouti in achieving our development goals - achievements that have helped to build an independent  sovereign  neutral State. These assets have been enhanced by a climate of political stability. Indeed  faithful to its traditions  the Republic of Djibouti has made constant efforts to ensure the full mobilization of its domestic resources to achieve our fundamental goals of socio-economic development and the promotion of human rights.Despite efforts made by the Government of Djibouti  the economic situation remains precarious. The prolonged drought we have experienced in recent years has seriously disrupted the lives of much of own nomad population  causing major losses of livestock and imposing on the Djiboutian authorities the additional costs of implementing resettlement programmes and providing services. The Government of my country launched an appeal for international assistance.The problem of refugees has been such a heavy burden on our State that it deserves special attention. The Government of Djibouti has steadily stepped up its efforts to provide an adequate solution  and in 1936 launched a programme  in co-operation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  for voluntary repatriation. However voluntary repatriation is the only authentic solution and  therefore  it is urgent to increase assistance to continue this programme.Bearing in mind all the serious problems that hamper to a large extent the process of economic development in Djibouti  members of the group of least developed countries look forward to support and assistance from the international community - from countries and from international organizations. The challenges of poverty  ignorance and hunger are enormous. Greater solidarity from the international community is necessary to overcome these scourges. Therefore we must combine our efforts because  together  we can build a better world. "
"42",1952,"DNK",43,1988,"ï»¿After a period in which the United Nations was seen by many as marginal to the great issues of the world  events during the past year have demonstrated quite the contrary. The Organization can play a key role in the solution of serious international conflicts. In particular  after years of tragic and bloody wars in Afghanistan and between Iraq and Iran  the United Nations has made crucial contributions  in co-operation with the various parties  towards bringing them to an end.The painstaking end meticulous efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative with regard to Afghanistan were brought to fruition with the conclusion of the Geneva Accords in April; and in August  Iran and Iraq finally agreed to a cease-fire  on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1988)  after years of careful diplomacy by the Secretary-General and the Council. Much remains to be done  of course  but firm bases for bringing these international conflicts to an early end have been formed.Let me take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General for his skilful and quiet diplomacy  as well as to those military officers from various countries who have selflessly volunteered to serve as United Nations observers in the two areas.The United Nations and its Secretary-General have also  in varying degrees  important roles to play in finding comprehensive  just and lasting solutions to other regional conflicts; Cyprus  Kampuchea  southern Africa  the Arab-Israeli conflict  Lebanon  Western Sahara  Central America. While the political will to find peaceful solutions on the part of the partiers concerned is indispensable  impartial United Nations mediation provides an essential ingredient in helping these parties to overcome their differences and implement agreements reached. All Member States must support such efforts. My Government welcomes this resurgence of confidence in multilateralism. It is testimony to an increasing awareness that regional conflicts affect us all and that commonly agreed solutions are therefore called for.With these substantial achievements in mind  one can hardly believe that the United Nations is at the same time struggling financially. The fact is  however  that the very existence of this Organization is at stake owing to withholdings of assessed contributions from Member States.It is evident that it is time - indeed  more than time - for all Member States to live up to their financial commitments to this Organization. It is not only a Charter obligation  but also  as illustrated recently  in the clear interest of all Member States  both individually and collectively  to have a strong and effective United Nations  while statements of political support are important  \.hey must now be followed by the necessary action from those Member States which have not paid their dues. In this connection we welcome the recent first steps taken by the United States Administration.At the same time this Organization must be efficient and rational. The reform process decided upon two years ago has already shown much progress  in particular owing to the follow-up action undertaken by the Secretary-General.However  with regard to the study of the United Nations intergovernmental structure and functions in the economic and social fields undertaken by Member States  the results were highly disappointing. Denmark believes that renewed efforts towards achieving major reforms in the economic and social fields are necessary in order to make the United Nations more effective and thus to strengthen its work in these areas.The international situation facing us today is filled with signs of hope and promise  and in some cases also with remarkable achievements. It would be incorrect  however  if I tried to imply that all issues on which the East and the West do not see eye to eye have disappeared over the past year. That is still far from being the case. But even in this field we have witnessed developments and results which make us believe that the community of nations is on the right track in coming to grips with many of the outstanding problems.The achievement of President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev at the summit meeting in Moscow  where for the first time in history agreement was finalized on the dismantling of a whole class of nuclear weapons  sent a message of hope to people all over the world.Regular and constructive dialogue at the highest level is a positive factor in its own right and gives us great encouragement.The agreed solution to end the tragic occupation of Afghanistan is another sign of improved international relations. Those are only examples  albeit very important ones. I venture to believe that developments will not stop here  that the process of improving East-West relations will go on  that both sides know the agenda ahead of us and that there is a willingness to move forward. We are aware that many of our partners in the East are deeply engaged in transforming their own societies in fundamental ways. We are following their efforts with interest and we are hopeful that these efforts  if successful  will in themselves serve to lessen tension and to promote understanding and co-operation among countries in both East and West. Still  we must get on with the work between us.An early conclusion of the Vienna Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) follow-up meeting with a balanced and substantial result will be a major contribution to consolidating the improvement of East-West relations in Europe. A successful conclusion of the Vienna meeting will pave the way for East-West negotiations on conventional stability. It will also open up possibilities for major progress in the human rights field of direct relevance to ordinary human beings in all Europe.Possibilities for achieving substantial progress in negotiations on disarmament are favoured by the prevailing political climate in the world. Against this background we regret that it did not prove possible to reach consensus on a final document from the third special session on disarmament. It would  however  be wrong to classify the session as a failure. The discussions and negotiations took place in a positive and co-operative atmosphere  and valuable work was done during the session. On many issues the session succeeded in narrowing differences and in reaching new grounds of consensus.One of the tasks of this session of the General Assembly will be to recognize and affirm the progress made in individual areas and to continue the pressure and encouragement towards further agreement in the disarmament field. We must strive to maintain confidence in the multilateral negotiating system.Many have been the calls over the years for a ban on chemical weapons. We appreciate the progress made at the Conference on Disarmament. The abhorrent use of chemical weapons has made even more urgent the task of reaching agreement on a global convention prohibiting such weapons. All sides must take an active part in the negotiations towards this end.Denmark has signed the 1925 Protocol without conditions. We do not have any chemical weapons. We do not want any. This has always been our policy and we have declared it openly. It would be a sign of confidence and an important political signal if all countries declared their policy towards chemical weapons and whether or not they possessed those weapons.We note the call made yesterday by the President of the United States in his statement for an international conference to consider actions which can contribute to prevent the use of chemical weapons as an important initiative  which is of particular attraction after the horrible use of chemical weapons which we have witnessed in the Gulf war - a use for which not even the slightest excuse can be found and which we strongly condemn. The Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) remains one of the most important arms control agreements reached to date. Since its entry into force 20 years ago  it has made a significant contribution to world stability. Reports of nuclear ambitions of certain countries in various parts of the world are extremely worrying. The nuclear option must never become an attractive solution to perceived security needs. Suspicion and mistrust must be countered by openness and trust. The non-proliferation regime is a crucial part of building that trust. We therefore urge all States at present outside the NPT to accede to the Treaty. Increased concern over the complex issue of conventional disarmament has been manifest over the last years. All States have a direct responsibility in this field  and the issue of conventional disarmament should also be kept at the forefront of the multilateral debate on disarmament in the United Nations. This would serve to stimulate and support efforts and negotiations at the regional level.Among regional conflicts  one area which suffers from particular tension and armed violence is the Middle East. Lately  however  we have seen the beginning of a dialogue take the place of armed confrontation in perhaps the most brutal conflict of our times. Denmark has consistently supported the efforts of the United Nations to bring about an end to the war between Iran and Iraq  and we rejoiced when it became clear that a termination of the hostilities is no longer a distant hope but a reality at hand.It is understandable that eight years of warfare does not create an atmosphere of mutual confidence conducive to a peaceful settlement of the dispute. The road to permanent stability may be long and arduous  but we must do whatever possible to ease and shorten it. Peace and security will not only bring immense benefit to the peoples of Iran and Iraq; it will make the world a safer place to live in. I pledge our wholehearted support to the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative  Ambassador Eliasson  in their further efforts in this conflict. The Danish participation in the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG) bears witness to our commitment to contribute to a peaceful solution. It is a source of deep concern to the international community that  in the aftermath of the war  arms have been turned against Kurdish civilians. Not only is this brutality evidenced by the presence of a huge number of refugees in a neighbouring country  but we have even received reliable reports that chemical weapons have been applied. This is despicable. The use of illegal weapons and violations of human rights are not internal matters but a legitimate concern of the international community.Dialogue has regrettably not replaced confrontation in the Arab-Israeli conflict. An atmosphere of violence and mutual mistrust prevents the creation of an environment of mutual trust which is indispensable for getting negotiations between the parties off the ground. The tragic events in the territories occupied by Israel bear this out only too clearly. We appeal to all parties to exercise restraint. The repressive measures taken by the Israeli forces are not in conformity with international law and must stop.The declaration of 31 July by His Majesty King Hussein to the effect that Jordan no longer claims sovereignty over the West Bank has created a new situation. I implore all parties to exercise moderation and take only steps which will further the cause of peace.An international conference under the auspices of the United Nations seems at present the only way to bring about a just and lasting settlement of the conflict.In Lebanon  mutual mistrust has had disastrous consequences in terms of disorder  civil strife and human suffering. The constitutional crisis over the election of a new President has highlighted the problems  and we appeal to all parties to exercise restraint and good will to save the very existence of Lebanon. It is obvious that the serious situation now existing in southern Africa is to a very large extent the result of South Africa's policy. Through acts of destabilization in the form of military aggression  economic pressure and direct support to armed rebel movements in the neighbouring countries. South Africa has severely undermined social and economic development in the region  thereby adversely affecting the daily lives of millions of persons.In South Africa itself the abhorrent apartheid system continues without major changes in sight. Apartheid remains a flagrant violation of the fundamental human rights laid down in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Many thousands are gaoled for political offences. Others are forced to seek refuge abroad. For the millions of victims of apartheid that remain in South Africa the situation is constantly deteriorating. There is an urgent need for a genuine national dialogue in South Africa across lines of colour  politics and religion. It goes without saying that it is incumbent on the Organization to reflect and act upon the deep concern and indignation of the entire international community at the persistence of such serious violations of fundamental human rights as those being perpetrated by the apartheid regime. Apartheid cannot be reformed. It must be abolished.In Namibia the South African illegal occupation and the oppression of the population continue. Namibia's independence is long overdue and should be pursued by all peaceful means. The ongoing negotiations between the United States  Angola  Cuba and South Africa have established the basis for some hope that the South African Government will withdraw its forces from Namibia and that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) will be implemented. Denmark hopes that the negotiations can stop armed interventions by South African troops inside Angola and lead to the establishment of peace in Angola. The Danish Government has for many years actively supported the struggle against apartheid and assisted the countries of southern Africa in their development efforts. Pending mandatory sanctions by the Security Council  the Danish Government has taken unilateral measures in order to terminate trade with South Africa and Namibia and to limit other relations with South Africa to an absolute minimum. Our diplomacy is engaged in a systematic effort to encourage their countries to increase their contribution to reinforced and more effective international pressure against apartheid.In March this year Denmark and its Nordic partners adopted a revised Nordic programme of Action against Apartheid. The Programme calls for increased assistance to South Africa's neighbouring countries in order to alleviate the factors of destabilization  to strengthen their power of resistance and to reduce their dependence on South Africa. Many of the countries of southern Africa are major recipients of Danish development assistance bilaterally as well as regionally through the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC). Our joint efforts are geared towards promoting economic  social and human-resources development. Suchdevelopment is also of prime importance to enable these countries to handle the racial problems of the region brought about by apartheid  political disturbance  and natural catastrophes.My Government welcomes the successful conclusion of the Afghanistan talks with the signing of the Geneva agreements on 14 April  paving the way for the withdrawal s Soviet forces after more than eight years of occupation. We congratulate the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative on the success of their untiring his skilful efforts; and we pay a tribute to Pakistan for its readiness to accept Ñ lions of Afghan refugees over the years. These agreements represent an important step towards a solution of the Afghanistan crisis. We hope this will lead to a comprehensive political settlement  including the voluntary return of the refugees  the opportunity for the Afghan people to exercise its right to self-determination  and the re-establishment of a sovereign  independent  neutral and non-aligned Afghanistan. Major aid efforts under United Nations auspices are under way  and Denmark will not fail to make its contribution in this regard.The people of Kampuchea has suffered untold hardship  first at the hands of the notorious Pol Pot regime  then because of the Vietnamese occupation. Kampuchea must be free both from foreign troops and from any prospect of a return to the appalling brutality of the Khmer Rouge  The Jakarta Informal Meeting in July offers glimmerings of hope that all parties concerned now realize that a political solution is called for. We urge that the dialogue be vigorously pursued  and we hope that it will lead to the re-establishment of a sovereign  independent  neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea in accordance with resolutions of the United Nations. The right to self-determination of the Kampuchean people must be fully respected.With regard to the Korean peninsula my Government has been encouraged by initiatives in recent months  in particular President Roh's declaration of 7 July and his proposal for a meeting of the Presidents of the North and the South. A resumption of the suspended direct dialogue between the two parties is the only way to reach a solution by peaceful means. Denmark is on record as being a firm supporter of the principle of universality; it is our hope that  in keeping with that principle  the people of Korea may soon gain full membership of the Organization. My Government extends its best wishes for the success of the Olympic Games in Seoul.A year ago there was a feeling of satisfaction and relief in the Assembly after the conclusion of the Guatemala peace plan. During the autumn of 1987 we saw a number of measures taken by the Central American countries in implementation of that agreement. However  genuine peace and true democracy have not yet been achieved in the whole of Central America. And recent developments  unfortunately  point in the wrong direction. Respect for freedom of information and opinion and other fundamental liberties  intended by the Guatemala accord to be the corner-stone of the process  are again being gravely infringed. Violence and disrespect for basic human rights go hand in hand with attempted coups and other disturbances. Genuine peace and true democracy again seem a distant hope.The Danish Government continues to believe that without democracy  allowing for full public participation in the political systems  and without respect for basic human rights no lasting solutions to the manifold problems of the region can be found. Thus we remain convinced that it is vitally important for the countries of Central America to continue their efforts in accordance with the agreement reached in Guatemala. At the same time  all countries with links to and interests in the region must co-operate constructively in that process. Together with our partners in the European Community  we are ready to continue our active support for these efforts.Denmark's support of United Nations peace-keeping operations has always been an important part of our United Nations policy. We have actively demonstrated our support by participating in peace-keeping operations and observer missions in the Middle East  Kashmir and Cyprus  as well as in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Most recently  Denmark has placed officers at the disposal of the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group. We have also reiterated our willingness  in principle  to participate in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia. Denmark has time and again stressed that all United Nations Member States carry a joint responsibility for the peace-keeping activities o' the United Nations and for the financing of these activities. Regrettably  some peace-keeping operations are still faced with serious financial problems  especially the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and the United Nations Force in Cyprus. In these two cases the financial burden is carried by the troop-contributing countries to an unreasonable degree. If the United Nations Transition Assistance Group is decided upon as planned  it will no doubt add a new and even more difficult dimension to the already existing problems.Against this background we find it imperative that agreement among Member States be found on the financing of ongoing and forthcoming peace-keeping operations in order that the financial burden will no longer be carried by the troop-contributing countries alone. Should efforts to this effect  however  prove fruitless  Denmark might feel compelled to reconsider how best to allocate its contributions to peace-keeping operations.Turning to international economic questions  I wish to emphasize the crucial importance of a common understanding of the challenges confronting us. Improved macro-economic co-ordination is necessary in order to correct the major imbalances. Another important element is the successful outcome of the Uruguay Round. We all share the responsibility for securing and strengthening the open  liberal  multilateral trading system. Protectionist tendencies must be curtailed  and solutions must be balanced with increased benefits to all participants  including the developing countries. While respecting the principle of differential and more favourable treatment  the newly industrialized countries should gradually and in accordance with their ability be encouraged to integrate themselves more fully into the open  multilateral systems of international trade and monetary and financial matters.It is hardly possible to speak on a number of economic development problems without also underlining the necessity of such development being sustainable. Short-term solutions which undermine the environment and the natural resource base upon which longer-term economic and social development must build are - where at all avoidable - cynical and an affront to coming generations  which do not have a voice to speak out against today's decision-makers.Recent incidents of illegal exports of dangerous waste to other countries are but one of many examples of practices that have to be corrected. It is to be hoped that the ongoing process of study  review and implementation of recommendations set forth in the report of the World Commission for Environment and Development and in the Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond will gradually take us a large step in the right direction. There is a need to strengthen the concessional assistance to the low-income countries in support of the efforts to revive social and economic development. Resources  however  remain scarce. It is of serious concern that the level of official development assistance lags far behind the internationally agreed targets. In fact the ratio of official development assistance to gross national product is declining  and I therefore urge all industrialized countries to increase their official development assistance.A few years ago Denmark decided on the basis of a broad political consensus to increase the development assistance gradually so that it will reach 1 per cent of the Danish gross national product in 1992. In 1988 our development assistance has reached 0.88 per cent of our gross national product.Many of the economically and socially strained developing countries are facing serious environmental disruption. The problems have assumed such dimensions that often they are beyond the financial and administrative capacity of those countries. Therefore it is important through multilateral and bilateral assistance to strengthen their capacity to solve the environmental problems so as to support sound and sustainable development. The United Nations system has a leading role to play in these efforts. Politically the need for action has been acknowledged. This understanding must be transferred into operational and concrete action.Women play a decisive role in the development process. Therefore it is imperative to continue and to strengthen development efforts for the advancement of women economically  socially and legally.The consensus adoption in 1986 of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development was a recognition of the need for strengthened and concerted efforts in tackling the problems of the sub-Saharan countries. The Programme has proved its success by the concrete initiatives which have been taken during recent years by the African countries themselves and by the international community. The outcome of the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on Review of the Programme of Action underlines the continued mutual commitment to the Programme of Action and clearly demonstrates the need for further action by all parties.We are on the eve of a fourth United Nations development decade. Unforeseen changes in the international environment have drastically altered the realities of the present decade. We have learned that a strategy cannot address all development problems in general. A new development strategy for the fourth development decade should be flexible in its targets. A fresh approach is necessary  it must be pragmatic and realistic  committing developing as well as developed countries.The fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  which we shall all celebrate on 10 December this year  reminds us that one of the basic duties of this Organization is to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all  without distinction as to race  sex  language or religion. After 40 years this duty is  unfortunately  still relevant.Since the adoption of the Universal Declaration this Organization has been engaged in intensive work of standard-setting. One of the important tasks for us in the years to come is to implement these standards. My Government is therefore concerned that the implementation of various instruments is weakened by the fact that some Governments do not fulfil their financial obligations under these instruments  thereby hampering the monitoring systems  if the United Nations is to be more effective in combating human rights violations  it is necessary that all States adhere to these instruments and meet their financial obligations.A sad consequence of the many abuses of human rights is that millions of people have been forced into fleeing their countries out of fear for their life or liberty. Although we have witnessed some encouraging developments in the world refugee situation over the past year  the international community is still faced with the enormous challenge of finding durable solutions to the plight of these millions of refugees. We recognize and commend the efforts carried out by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  but at the same time we realize that these efforts will succeed only if his Office can count on the full support of all members of this Assembly. Over the years my Government has been a staunch supporter of the Office and would like to see its role further strengthened and developed. To this end my Government launched two years ago in this Assembly some ideas aimed at strengthening the role of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  inter alia through a global scheme of resettlement places at the disposal of the Office and through additional financial resources to countries of first asylum. In Europe the outline of a structure to deal in a humanitarian spirit with this problem is beginning to emerge. My Government feels confident that only through such concrete action  and with the active involvement of the UNHCR  shall we be able to work towards a comprehensive approach to the international refugee problem.It is my hope that the elements contained in this undertaking can be further developed and employed in other regions where the refugee situation is presenting an equally distressing picture.This session of the General Assembly will have to deal with numerous complex issues of peace and human progress. Bearing in mind the important progress made on several questions over the past year  it is my earnest hope that further headway will be made in the months to come."
"43",1997,"DOM",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of the Government of the Dominican Republic and the allegation of which I am Chairman  I have pleasure  Sir  in asking you to convey to Mr. Dante Caputo my sincere congratulations on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its forty-third session. His personal and professional qualities and his dedication to the path of diplomacy augur well for the outcome of the session.I also congratulate his predecessor  Ambassador Peter Florin  on the exemplary and impeccable way in which he presided over the forty-second session. His work contributed greatly to the Organization's good image. We also wish warmly to congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the successes he has scored thanks to his persistent efforts for international peace and co-operation  efforts that have been widely and fully recognized by all members of this world body. The Nobel Peace Prize given to the peace-keeping forces is the best testimony of what we have just said. The Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization in addition to being a source of information of incalculable value for us all is a sure guide to follow in the various situations that exist in the interdependent world of today.As a member of the great Caribbean family I wish also to hail an exceptional Caribbean  the Ambassador of Barbados. Her intelligence and her hard work have earned her the appreciation of the international community represented in this forum  as shown by the support given to her candidacy for the presidency of the General Assembly.In referring to the Dominican Republic as a member of the great Caribbean family I am highlighting its geographical  political  economic and ethnic facts. For those same reasons  and out of a birthright  we are also part of that great thriving  generous  suffering reality  although a land aware of its effective capabilities  and I am referring to Iberian America.We hope that our island  as in the past  will be the catalyst in all necessary endeavours to achieve a worthy life  something to which our brothers in the mainland and in the Caribbean archipelago are entitled.The concise text of my address has been distributed to all delegations and representatives attending this session of the General Assembly as well as to the various officers of the Secretariat. However  I will now read a summary which contains the most  salient points which the Dominican delegation wishes to bring to your attention. First I wish to refer to the situation in Haiti our brother country with which we share geography economic and social interests history culture and hopes. The Haitian people have striven to open up a path to the application of human rights and to democracy  but it would be naÃ¯ve optimism to hope that all traumas and remnants of the oppressive system in existence for so many years and with such deep roots will disappear from one day to the next. It will take time to root them out definitively. The situation obtaining in that sister nation is a sensitive one and the international common should lend generous and understanding assistance not as charity but as investment in a people which was the first to become independent in the continent colonized by Spain and which has maintained its independence despite all difficulties. The Dominican Republic has received some Haitian leaders as guests. These were human beings who feared for their lives rightly or notÂ· thiswas above all a humanitarian action. This act of generosity is in keeping with the ethics of the Dominican people. Some groups in Ñ country have criticized this action as if generosity should follow the concepts of discrimination or should be guided by political motivations. It is better that one hundred guilty parties go free than that one innocent person be condemned. The Dominican Government will continue to honour that precept because to offer asylum on a discriminatory basis would be to violate the honour of our people an. one of the most sacred principles of the Ibero-American system. Last year we stated ""Peace is not merely the absence of war or peace imposed by a superior force.Â· (Ã/42/PV.1S P. 3) Today we say that peace should not be the outcome of a balance of forces  of the so-called forces of deterrence. An error of judgment  a mechanical failure or action in bad faith could bring about an outbreak leading to a final destruction that would spare neither the developed nor the developing countries.We consider that the agreement readied between the two super-Powers on the elimination of intermediate-range missiles is a positive step for world peace. The Dominican Republic congratulates the United States and the Soviet Union on this Important agreement and trusts that the action which has begun after lengthy conversations will not be interrupted.The Dominican Republic reaffirms that maintaining peace and the principle of non-intervention are the unvarying standards of its foreign policy.For the Dominican Republic the United Nations is the appropriate; irreplaceable forum in which to debate the major problems facing the world today. We believe that it is neither wise nor in order to propose other forums or the creation of new organizations to discuss matters of world peace. In the list of items to be discussed In this speech we would like to refer first to drugs  since my delegation considers the drug problem to be one of the major scourges of our respective nations. Drugs are a real and growing threat to all mankind. Every effort roust be brought to bear and the various organizations fighting this scourge must unite under leadership that would avoid duplication and wasted effort. We also believe that the fight against drugs must begin in those places where the raw material is produced. To that end  however  imaginative procedures must be used which go beyond the borders of the developing countries where the farmer  frustrated and ruined by the low prices of his commodities on international markets  proceeds to sow marijuana and coca which are more profitable. It is the protectionist measures which establish quotas and prices that have taken traditional crops out and geared action towards the attractive and profitable crop of coca leaves.Owing to the characteristics of its social components the Dominican Republic rejects every form of discrimination  be it racial  apartheid  political or religious. Such discrimination runs counter to every ethical concept. That is why the item on South Africa has continued to appear on the agenda of this great forum and will remain there until that country changes its behaviour. In our view  external debt poses a great challenge to the governments of developing countries  it is a shadow that follows us in all we do  both on the international scene and domestically. Because of its economic  social and political consequences  the level of indebtedness of developing countries is an urgent and complex problem. It grows worse given external factors weighing heavily on the debt of developing countries. These include interest-rate fluctuations  unstable floating exchange rates and action by industrialized countries to maintain their protectionist measures.To ease the debt problem  some industrialized countries should promote a reduction in the real interest rates  even though to do this they will have to reduce their excessive budget deficits. International banking could contribute to the solution of this pressing problem by reducing loan margins  especially for countries in the midst of an adjustment process.Efforts by lending institutions are limited to viewing the situation from the monetary and economic point of view> rather than helping  their measures merely contribute to unemployment  shrinking real income and deteriorating public services in short  to plummeting standards of living for the lowest-incomes and therefore neediest groups. During this crisis  lending institutions must maintain a positive net flow of resources towards our countries. Otherwise debt servicing to those institutions will be nearly impossible to carry.The debt problem is not the sole responsibility of the debtor countries. The responsibility is shared variously among the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  the World Bank  the Governments of creditor countries  the Governments of debtor nations  private and public debtor institutions and  very important  the policy of expanding credit promoted by the big banks until 1981. To emerge from the international debt crisis  the industrialised nations must agree to share fairly in the adjustment efforts and sacrifices we in the developing countries are carrying out. Their greater economic power obligates to join in this task  from which we shall all benefit.Let me refer again to the protectionist policies of developed countries. Free and vigorous world trade is indispensable for the well-being of the in international economy. Every protectionist measure drives us further from such trade.Notwithstanding the great trials it has had to go through  and thanks to the work of one of the greatest statesmen  Mr. Joaquin Balaguer  the Dominican Republic is growing  using its own resources and with a very small external debt and a policy of absolute priority in the use of public resources. Only a man like President Balaguer could have achieved this feat while maintaining the climate of political  social and economic stability enjoyed by Dominican society.With respect to foreign policy  we have from the very outset supported all efforts to end the conflict in Central America  and we shall support all future efforts. We firmly believe that dialogue among the parties  free from selfish intervention by third parties  is the best way to resolve situations that could develop into conflicts.For that reason we opened our doors this year to the parties to the conflict in Nicaragua so they could speak freely  protected by Dominican impartiality. Our sole interest in Central America is the achievement of peace among brothers  with all its attendant benefits. In the Dominican Republic all ideas - political  religious or connected with any other school of thought - can be expressed freely and without constraints. That is because ideological pluralism is the norm in Dominican political life. We therefore call for better political will to reach accord and to enable us to move forward with programmes of action already agreed upon to strengthen peace.In the Korean peninsula there have been encouraging steps towards better understanding between two countries with a common origin and language and a shared history and culture.	We hope that an independent Namibia will shortly join our Organization.The situation in the Middle East is very close to us as Dominicans because in our ethnic makeup there are major components of Arab and Jewish culture and blood. We maintain a steadfast friendship with the family roots of the branches that flourish on our soil  and we hope dialogue will take the place of terrorist attacks in that part of the world.I regret I cannot refer in this statement to all the issues worthy of attention from the nations represented here. But I cannot omit a brief reference to the situation in my country in the political and social realms  a situation founded  m the institutional end democratic process that began in the early 1960s when the Dominican Republic began a fresh period in its history as a republic.The reed has been long and tortuous  but we are now setting an example of stability and substantial progress towards the final consolidation of a rule of law that will guarantee the survival of our institutions and civilized coexistence among all Dominicans with absolute respect for individual rights and total loyalty to the independence of State institutions. Today  the Dominican Republic is an example in the Americas of stability and democracy  notwithstanding the harsh economic pressure to which all third-world nations are subject. All this has been possible thanks to steadfast efforts by a leader who has been able to combine the solution of our local problems with fulfilment of the State's commitments. We understand and has repeatedly stated that we have a duty and an obligation to honour our debts  but not at the sacrifice of resources needed for the growth and development of the Dominican people. In the Dominican Republic  the cradle of Spanish activities in the new world  there is absolute respect for human rights and  from the pinnacles of power  the independence of the institutions of the State is maintained as an inviolable norm. That is a reality which only those confused by the promptings of their conscience could deny or call into question.In my country there is not a single political prisoners justice acts with absolute independence and the free exercise of political pluralism is increasingly widespread and established.What we have said is a fact that neither our nationals nor foreigners can deny without a breach of the truth  what we are referring to is an achievement which is a source of pride to us and for which we Dominicans feel religious respect  because we have learned that this is a source of social well-being and harmony for our fellow citizens. We say this because we understand that  as was said by His Holiness Pope John Paul II in his address in the Holy See to the diplomatic corps in 1988j""Lasting peace is that which ensures that social injustices do not occur.This is what we Dominicans believe and this is the spirit which the delegation I have the honour to head is bringing to this gathering on behalf of the Government and people of the Dominican Republic."
"44",2044,"DZA",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of the Algerian delegation I should like to congratulate you  Sir  upon your election to the post of President of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. In so doing I extend to you my personal best wishes for success in the onerous but lofty task ahead of you. Your election is justified by the range of talents we have come to appreciate it is also a well-deserved tribute paid to the friendly nation of Argentina and a recognition of the great contribution made by Latin America to our joint endeavour for peace and co-operation among our peoples and nations.The President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session Hr. Peter Florin  also earned the appreciation of the United Nations. We fulfilled his office skilfully  with devotion  ability and farsightedness. The Algerian delegation would like to join in the unanimous tribute paid to him.The United Nations collectively  and our own nations individually  will remember Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar as the invaluable craftsman responsible for restoring the standing of the Organization and for winning it back its rightful place in contemporary international relations. 1 should like to express to him Algeria's congratulations and encouragement and assure him of its continuing and  hole-hearted co-operation in any place and at any time that he may be engaged in the quest for peace  justice and co-operation  which he is pursuing in the name of and tot the better well-being of mankind.The Organisation is emerging from a grave period of crisis  it has gone through a time of doubt  suspicion and dereliction  it has been afflicted by introspection and by the abandonment of multilateralism. However  in the darkest hours my country never ceased to believe  and to say  that the United Nations is the manifestation of an act of hope - and a strong  righteous hope never dies. The United Nations embodies this hope  which  in turn  represents the sustenance  the very well-spring  of the Organization.Are our joint endeavours geared now to the triumph of the values and ideals we set for ourselves when the Organization was founded?We see the beginning of an improvement in international relations. Is this due to the dawning recognition that mankind is a whole and can have no future or destiny without understanding  co-operation and peace? Have we finally faced the fact that it is better to build together than to develop the tools for destruction - that mistrust and the thirst for domination are not inevitable  but rather that mankind has a collective genius in which are to be found the resources that can ensure well-being and happiness for all? Are we ready at last to use our ingenuity and ardour to construct a world of security for all  and to wage the real struggle  the struggle foe development?These are the challenges  and they must be met.There are already some portents of a better morrow for all. However limited they may be  these signs and developments are encouraging  and we hope that they will be matched by others of even greater scope and implication. In this respect Algeria once again hails the conclusion of the Treaty on the elimination of intermediate-range nuclear weapons. In so doing we hope that this first act of nuclear disarmament will be consolidated and expanded  and that negotiations on strategic nuclear weapons will follow the same path of wisdom and lead to a similarly welcome conclusion. Disarmament is an essential factor in the peaceful world order that we hope to build  and all of us have a contribution to make. Consequently  my country has always considered that bilateral measure in the disarmament field  measures we welcome and commend  should not rule out multilateral action  let alone be considered as a replacement for such action.The regrettable failure of the third special session of the United Nations voted to disarmament  was an ill omen in this respect. We trust that this was simply an unfortunate incident on our route  a perverse development that will shortly be corrected. When the safety and peace of all mankind is at stake  unity in action and resolution is the order of the day.The first disarmament measure too which I have just referred  as well as the other measures of which it is the forerunner  and to which we look forward  were possible only because of major changes that have taken place in the doctrines  policies and strategies underlying modern international relations. Heretofore these have been founded solely open the free exercise of the balance of forces and competition in pursuit of a decisive position in an arms race - to sum up: a view of the world and a logic both based en confrontation.The Movement of the Non-Aligned Countries was founded at the time when this vision and this logic prevailed. It has constantly warned of the dangers end perils of such an approach for world peace. In the changes coming about today it cannot but find confirmation of the rightness of its arguments and of the positions it has taken at a time when there seemed to be no other alternative to the policy of strong-arm politics enshrined with the emergence of the two opposing alliances.We have not yet seen the end of power-bloc politics  to which the movement of the Non-Aligned Countries was founded as an alternative 40 years ago  nor have we seen the end of great strategic rivalry. But we do see the first signs of change  and this suggests a possible alternatives an alternative of dialogue  trust and respect for the interests of others that offers the possibility of founding a new world balance upon a safer  stable and fairer set of relations.Let us find the wherewithal fear this alternative option. Let us have faith in it and find the political will-power that is required. Let us avoid the errors and miscalculations of the past  which suggested that a limited reshuffling of East-West relations would be sufficient for the establishment of a peaceful order. That faith did not stand up to the test. It was not enough to bring about a lasting relaxation of tensions between the two opposing military alliances. Rather  regional and local hotbeds of tension proliferated and grew worse.Mankind is a single species  and peace must therefore also be indivisible. International relations will not be strengthened in terms of security  stability or duration unless all the countries in the world join in the task of building a peace that is unrestricted and has room for all. It is gratifying that today there is growing recognition of this vital need and that efforts are being made to improve East-West relations and to resolve regional and local conflicts  crises and tensions. That is the right approach  the only one to be followed  unswervingly  whatever the obstacles and whatever sacrifices have to be made. The road to peace will be long and difficult  whether we are dealing with disarmament  the establishment of trust and understanding between East and Hest or putting an end to the tragedies of the Middle East  the Gulf  southern Africa  Central America  Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Cyprus or Western Sahara  but there is no alternative to peace it is the only option.As I told the Assembly last year  the contribution we intend to make to this collective enterprise for peace consists of the construction of the Great Arab Maghreb. Since I spoke last year this enterprise in which we are engaged with our partners in the region has been launched  and I think I can say that it has been well launched. The holding of the Maghreb summit in Algiers last June was the starting-point for the enterprise upon which we are setting out together P with imagination  determination  and whatever else it takes. Cur peoples and our countries have waited too long  and therefore our first concern now must be to make up for lost time. We are determined to do co  and we have the wherewithal. We are now working to equip the Maghreb entity we are establishing with the institutions  trained manpower and machinery which will then permit political co-ordination and economic integration on a rational  progressive basis  without thereby losing any opportunity to make further progress.A dynamic  and united Maghreb is therefore on the march. We are keeping the momentum going  thanks to a political resolve unaffected by ulterior motives or reservations. For the first time in its long history the greater Maghreb enjoys all the necessary conditions for unity. However  we are aware of the obstacles on the way ahead; We shall overcome them  because we have no other choice at a time when international events are calling for a pooling of efforts and resources. There can be no doubt that the revolution of the conflict in Western Sahara will help speed up the construction of a united Maghreb. The acceptance in principle by Morocco and the POLISARIO Front of the proposals put to then by the current Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAD) and the Secretary- General of the united Nations concerning the conditions for the holding of a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara is a good omen in this respect.It is only just that a people that has shed its blood for freedom should have the right to choose its own future it is right that the people of Western Sahara should determine its own destinyÂ·The international community has understood that  and a consensus has emerged within the Organization of African Unity  the Non-Aligned Movement and this Assembly clearly spelling out the conditions for a resolution of the Western Sahara conflict. That consensus took the form of resolution 104 adopted in 1983 by the Conference of Heads of State or Government in Addis Ababa. Subsequently endorsed by the united Nations  it is the basis of the joint United Nations good offices. Direct negotiations to conclude a cease-fire and to organize a referendum on self-determination  free from administrative or military constraints  are the two key requirements for a just and lasting solution to the conflict in the Western Sahara.Those who are fighting each other today need to be able to talk together tomorrow  and it is a good thing for the Moroccans and Saharaouis to go to the referendum hand in hand rather than back to back. Fraternal dialogue will lead to brotherly reconciliation  and thus the Maghreb will gain in stability  security and unity. In the Middle East there is still no end to the tragedy of the Palestinian people  which has missed out on the wave of peace affecting other crises conflicts and sources of tension. The tragedy of the Palestinian people continues to be the tragedy of this century.The uprising in occupied Palestine reminds us that the Palestinian's national identity is still alive. It shows that the Palestinian people has not abdicated its national rights and that its claim to its own State on the land of which it was cobbled will not be defeated. The uprising serves to identify the requirements for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The extraordinary Arab Summit Conference held in Algiers in June defined the common Arab position on the nature competence and aims of the international peace conference on the Middle East and on who should participate. Because the question of Palestine lies at the heart of the conflict in the region the international peace conference would fail if it did not consider it as such and face up to the subject squarely. To seek to reduce the Arab-Zionist conflict to a succession of bilateral territorial or security disputes and hence to obscure the central Palestinian element in the conflict  would be to doom the conference to failure.Because the Palestinian people has chosen those whom it wishes to speak on its behalf and to express its aspirations the Palestine Liberation Organization (Ð LO) its sole and legitimate representative cannot be deprived of its place at the international peace conference. Attempts to find other representatives will be unsuccessful. Lastly  we know of the fete that has befallen the search for an alternative hone for the Palestinian people. We have to recognise that the destiny of the Palestinian people is only going to be fashioned on the soil of its own historic land  Palestine.In the same region  Lebanon has suffered setback after setback. Occupation has followed by fratricidal divisions  and today its very institutions are under threat. We are firmly devoted to the independence  unity  territorial integrity and sovereignty of that brother country. Lebanon has other battles to fight. It cannot allow itself to be divided against itself  rational reconciliation is vital  and it is the first battle that will determine its victory in the other fights ahead. It must win it and win it with our assistance. It can rely upon my country's aid in this respect.In the Gulf the noise of battle has died down  giving way to dialogue and negotiation. We congratulate Iraq and Iran in a brotherly fashion. Eight years of conflict have left too much suffering  misunderstanding and distrust for us to imagine that the path to peace will be an easy one to follow  but we do trust that courage  a sense of responsibility and wisdom will finally prevail.The apartheid system lies at the heart of all the tragedies in southern Africa. Its full and complete dismantling will be the only way to bring peace back to that long-suffering region. The independence of Namibia  the restoration of all the rights of the South African people and a guarantee for the security  stability and territorial integrity of the front-line States are a collective responsibility which we must all fully live up to. My country  for its part  wishes to assure the South West Africa People's Organisation  the African National Congress and the front-line States of its solidarity and support until the triumph of the causes of justice and freedom which they defend. In Central America the hopes aroused by the Arias plan and the Esquipulas and Sopoa agreements are proving sadly slow to bear fruit. The Contadora and Lima Groups are making a valuable contribution to the cause of peace in the region.They deserve our full support. The peoples and the States in the region must be able to live in understanding  co-operation and mutual respect  free from outside interference and with respect for each other's political  economic and political choices.In the Group of 77 a few days ago I expressed a few thoughts on the subject of international economic relations  thoughts which I should like to share with the Assembly today.I observed that the real path to genuine peace must be one whereby all the peoples of the world enjoy not only their right to equal security but also their right to development. I observed that the genuine peaceful order we aspire to should not simply spare mankind from destruction it must ensure his fit and proper survival once and for all. I observed that humanity would one day have had enough of gambling with death and would build for its future  that development would become the new name for peace and be its key ingredient.In the light of those comments I made a number of observations and drew some conclusions.First of all  underdevelopment is the worst of the wars which mankind is currently waging against itself. Are not more people dying of famine  malnutrition  epidemics and the lack of a medical infrastructure  than as a result of open  armed conflict? Clearly  more people are dying from underdevelopment than from war. Secondly  underdevelopment is - and if no solution is found it will continue to represent - a threat to international peace and security just as much as open armed conflict. Surely the international community has a duty to put an end to a process which is so menacing to mankindâs future. Thirdly  the  international community must mobilize for the triumph  of human rights. We must mobilize to ensure that no citizen of the planet is deprived of his civil rights  his rights to express an opinion  his right of assembly  his right to be heard and his right to defend himself in the name of all the rights which he legally enjoys. Yes  we must mobilize so that no citizen of our planet dies from the denial of his rights. I might add  however  that besides these rights we have a duty  and it is one which has not yet been fulfilled: the duty to ensure that no citizen dies or suffers from neglect of his vital needs. We have acted together so that development is considered in terms of rights fog our peoples. I night say today that the right to the development of peoples is a key element in human rights  because when one talks of underdevelopment one is talking of matters of life and death. This calls for collective solidarity and a collective sense of responsibility. Lastly  at a time when we are welcoming the fact that mankind has begun to tread the path of disarmament  let us not forget that  that much remains to be done under this heading  the hardest task ahead of us is the challenge of underdevelopment  and everything that that implies.My conclusions  therefore  would be as follows.First  a crisis in international economic relations does exist and is a reality. The developed world felt that it had found its own short-term remedies  but those remedies are the product of short-sightedness.  Real interdependence proves daily that development and underdevelopment are interrelated in many aspects and that the panaceas advocated heretofore are no longer affective. To separate development from underdevelopment  to portray the first as a result of the ability of one group of countries and the second as a result of the fecklessness of others  is not acceptable. There is a system operating today which serves to nurture the developed countries at the cost of the underdeveloped nations.Secondly  changes are taking place  and an alternative is being pursued so that the underdevelopment of our countries does not serve to foster the development of nations which established the prevailing system  and which led the  to act in pursuance of the objectives they set for themselves in the past. That was short-sighted. The North-South split is intolerable and will become more so. As East and Hest are brought together  it will become increasingly clear that a peaceful future depends upon development.Thirdly  underdevelopment corns with an economic price  but still more with a political and social price  and it is one we have to pay. But how long can this go on? This is a matter that must be of concern to all. As member s of the international community we have assumed the Â¡responsibility to put our houses in order. We recognize this and it is proving beneficial  but it is not enough far from it. Structural adjustments which have been advised or imposed upon our countries are not the remedy for underdevelopment  far from it.fourthly  in the formation of underdevelopment  factors beyond the control of our countries were at play  The international environment was - and still is - a handicap for us. Internal structural adjustments will only work if the same structural adjustments are made at the global level. Whether with reference to the budgetary health of our countries  a fair price for our commodity exports  access to international trade  currencies and finances or technology  the present system of international economic relations frustrates all our hard efforts. The system must change. Such a change must be part of an overall change in global and regional relations. Global peace can no longer continue with a two-tier system in which the question of international security has priority and development is relented to a secondary place. An overall approach is required and we must seek to correct all the existing imbalances.Do the encouraging notes which we are hearing from so many directions now herald a new age of reason? They say  if mankind can finally meet the overriding requirement: a sense of global conscience."
"45",2091,"ECU",43,1988,"ï»¿We are proud that Foreign Minister Dante Caputo of Argentina is presiding over the General Assembly- Argentina and Ecuador are States linked by brotherly ties in the past and by solidarity in the present. Apart from his great qualities as a statesman  he firmly believes in democracy and his presence here leading our debate is therefore a guarantee of success. .ÅThrough the Secretary-General  we wish to reaffirm our adherence to and support for the world Organization. It seems that at long last the value and t usefulness of this visionary instrument of mankind are being understood. A few weeks ago we Ecuadorians elected a new government. We see this election as an important step in our effort to consolidate democracy. The Government proclaims social justice with freedom  and on this its first attendance at the highest international gathering  it wishes to express its determined support for the principles and commitments of the international community. A legal order was established in San Francisco which is a guarantee for all nations  to the extent that all of us respect it and to the extent that all of us contribute to strengthening it. Our attitude and our foreign policy are consonant with that purpose. They were clearly defined by President Rodrigo Borja on his assumption of office. They are aimed at closer ties of friendship and co-operation with all the countries of the world. We shall seek peace  security and development in our foreign endeavours. Without peace there is no freedom nor can there be development. Without security and without development we cannot speak of co-operation or of international social justice.We firmly believe  therefore  in the need to defend peace wherever it may be threatened. We have faith in the spirit of understanding and solidarity which is giving new hope to mankind.We believe in the possibility of building a community of nations which in their domestic and international life will give practical and real effect to the vocation of free menÂ·We believe in the freedoms. We uphold them and advocate them as the framework and basis of all human rights. We link these rights to the possibilities and requirements of well-being and respect for man as an individual and for peoples as nations.Our conviction leads us to seek fervently the development of our people: an integrated development which goes beyond mere growth and provides opportunities for all  justice with freedom and harmonious coexistence.We feel confident that we can thus advance the national effort  appropriately uniting all interests. We are aware of the magnitude of our shortcomings and of the seriousness and urgency of the problems. We know that we must make a gigantic national effort. In order to do so we are counting on resolute action from all sectors of the country and we shall ensure respect and security for their legitimate activities. We are counting also on co-operation from international bodies and friendly countries which we invite to join in the crusade we are launching to create the well-being our people demand.The world we all want  therefore  is a world of peace  solidarity  justice and freedom. In that spirit  we advocate a climate of harmony and of trust in our relations and in those of all countries  so that our borders and all borders will be places to meet in friendship and co-operation and not places of misunderstanding and incidents. That is why we firmly support processes to disarm morally  to reduce military spending and to end the nuclear race; that is why we strongly support the Latin American processes of integration; and that is why we advocate a peaceful solution to conflicts and disputes which poison relations among peoples  forcing them to divert resources to defence by reducing investment in urgently needed development projects.The stockpiling of weapons does not lead to greater security. Armed peace is not safe peace. It never was  nor will it ever be. World peace is indissolubly linked to general and complete disarmament. We welcome the fact  therefore  that the United States and the Soviet Union have concluded a treaty on the elimination of short- and intermediate-range nuclear missiles  it is important that the first true disarmament measure has been adopted  but new commitments in the same direction must also be adopted and resources that today are devoted to the construction of means of mass destruction must be released in order to meet urgent social needs in the third world.It has also become imperative to ban immediately chemical weapons  nuclear-weapon tests  the use of outer space for warlike purposes and the illegal and covert transfer of conventional weapons. The enormous sums spent on the arms race are ethically wrong and morally condemnable. The process of disarmament and arms limitation is closely linked with the duty of States to resolve their international disputes by peaceful means  in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter  with equity and with the norms and principles of international law. Ecuador has traditionally complied with these cardinal rules of international relations. That is why we welcome the fact that the negotiating process which led to the signing of the Geneva accords on Afghanistan has initiated what we hope will be a step towards a different world  in which war  solutions based on force  indirect confrontation and mutual mistrust will be eliminated. It would appear that  thanks to the efforts of the United Nations and of the Secretary-General  in the Persian Gulf  in southern Africa  in Kampuchea  in Western Sahara and Cyprus we are reaching the stage of the triumph of diplomacy over intolerance  the victory of reason over force  the supremacy of dialogue and ideas over the lethal confrontation of the cannons.We hope that this halo of hope will also surround the Middle East and Central America. We are particularly concerned about the conflict in the Central American region. We call upon all the parties involved to show the political will needed to implement and set in motion the formulas for a settlement which were so painstakingly drawn up and which are rightly based on respect for the sovereignty of States on the right freely to elect a certain form of government without foreign interference; on the exercise of true expressions of democracy  pluralism  social justice  individual freedoms and human rights.Ecuador supports the various initiatives and constructive proposals for a solution to the serious Central American crisis. In particular  we stress the need to preserve and carry forward the important negotiating process that has corns from the valuable initiatives of President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica and that is enshrined in the Esquipulas II agreement. He took great care to recognize the particular interests and situations of all the parties involved in the conflict. At this critical moment it has once again become urgent and necessary to remove immediately the obstacles which have arisen in the implementation of the Arias plan. Perhaps it can be reactivated by the holding of meetings between the parties in order to examine certain items or groups of items in a practical manner and with political foresight.We most recall  furthermore  that the international community owes a debt to Central America. After the political settlement  an intensive development programme must be implemented with a high degree of international co-operation. Unfortunately  the positive aspects which can be discerned on the international political scene are not matched in economic  financial and monetary relations. We shall not have a harmonious and stable international order unless we devise an equitable international system which consolidates the best aspects of external trade  reverses the unfavourable terms of exchange  provides just and remunerative payment for the goods we export  facilitates the transfer of science and technology and contributes to a positive net flow of capital for development. The North-South dialogue is deadlocked. That is unacceptable  and the dialogue must therefore be resumed. For Latin America the 1980s have been a period of economic stagnation and deterioration of the standard of living of its inhabitant. The consensus at present is that external debt and the manner in which it has been handled are perhaps the main element of the crisis afflicting the region today. However  the external debt of the countries is not an isolated event which arose spontaneously during the previous decade. To a great extent it is a result of the unjust international economic order  which is detrimental to the poorest countries and has limited the possibility of financing the growth of their economies.Therefore  the overcoming of the crisis in Latin America  which has lasted for almost a decade  depends  on the one hand  on the establishment of more just international economic relations and  on the other  on an understanding between debtors and creditors. For many years now the developing countries have called for acceptance of the conditions needed to achieve stable development of international economic activity for the benefit of both industrialized countries and developing countries.We wish to reaffirm here that Ecuador recognizes the legitimacy of the debt incurred and will see to it that its commitments are honoured  without requiring  to that end  greater sacrifices from a people that has already suffered for almost seven years. We advocate an attitude favouring dialogue and not confrontation. I reiterate that we cannot continue to lay the full costs upon the debtors alone  ignoring the responsibility incumbent upon those who at one time approached them and offered huge loans without stopping to assess the risks entailed in such operations.In other words  it is essential and urgent to promote understanding between the parties on the basis of mutual respect  seeking equitable solutions on the basis of which costs are shared for the sake of the resumption of the growth of the economics of the debtor countries. This would of course enable these countries to discharge their obligations more completely.In this task  it is up to the multilateral credit organizations to increase financial flows to the developing countries - favouring the objective of social well-being and reducing conditionality on the basis of strict economic and financial criteria. In order to achieve this objective  the industrialized countries must honour their commitments with regard to the capitalization of these credit institutions.These thoughts lead us to a conclusion that should be stated in this pre-eminent political forum. It is time for us to understand fully the close link between improving the standard of living of peoples and consolidating democratic regimes based on principles of freedom and justice.The Government of Ecuador has chosen a serious  responsible and democratic path in order to overcome the economic crisis and place the country within sight of development. We have drawn up plans to stimulate the activities of all Ecuadorians and ensure the success of their efforts. We want a society based on respect for the law and inspired by broad solidarity on the basis of justice and with a strong social imprint. In this effort  we welcome international contributions  within rules governed by equity  realism and due regard for national interests  made in such a way that they will serve our purpose of overcoming underdevelopment  creating sources of employment and ensuring the prosperity of our people.The delegation of Ecuador will indicate the position of my Government on the various agenda items in greater detail at the working sessions of this Assembly. I have mentioned the Government of Ecuador's concern and support for items of great importance such as disarmament and external debt. There are several other items  such as drug trafficking  that hold the special attention of my Government which  along with other Governments of the Americas  has pledged its unshakeable support for the struggle to combat this scourge of mankind.International co-operation and the political  economic  social and humanitarian work of this Organization are of prime importance to us. Our contribution will always be that of a country which looks with hope towards the changes taking place in the international community  which at the edge of the abyss and of a nuclear holocaust proved itself able to reflect and let the light of reason and common sense prevail. The new spirit that can be discerned in the super-Powers must open doors of understanding and comprehension  with vast possibilities for peace and friendship among peoples. It must also promote fulfilment of the just and heartfelt demands of the third world and those for the establishment of a true international legal order.'The relaxation of tension has been and must continue to be of invaluable importance for harmonious international coexistence. It is  without doubt  an essential factor in liberating minds from the spirit of confrontation and promoting dialogue and co-operation. The present economic crisis  with its tremendous weight of frustration for poor countries  has begun to awaken the world's conscience and its repercussions are becoming apparent in all countries. The United Nations has already shown its ability to adapt to new circumstances; the winds of change must lead to more adjustments and new approaches which will enable us all to respond to the new requirements of the time and of the peoples.In this spirit and with this conviction  Ecuador pledges its support for the efforts required of us all to make this the world we want to pass on to our children. "
"46",2136,"EGY",43,1988,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure that Mr. Dante Caputo has been elected President of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are all the more pleased to seeas President a person who comes from a friendly country  Argentina  and from asisterly continent  Latin America. His renowned wisdom and vast experience willcertainly enrich the performance of the General Assembly. We are confident thatthe current session will constitute an important landmark on the path ofinternational progress. By the same token  I wish to pay a tribute to hispredecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  Deputy Foreign Minister of the friendly GermanDemocratic Republic  for his wise guidance of the proceedings of the forty-secondsession and the third Special session devoted to disarmament.A few weeks ago  the Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries met inCyprus to review and assess developments in the international situation particularly the recent indications of the advent of a new era of detente betweenthe two super-Powers  a new era different from that which had prevailed in the1970s. This new era represents a more advanced phase towards positive peacefulco-existence. If allowed to maintain its momentum and to expand its scope  itwould create a favorable political climate conducive to general and completedisarmament  both of nuclear weapons and of other weapons of mass destruction.Such a new era could also be conducive to strengthening co-operation betweenthe approach towards the peaceful settlement of several international problems.countries with different social and political regimes and to enhancing theThere are a number of indications which testify to the importance of thisopportunities for their contribution to the world economy. It would further assistthe approach towards positive development  as is evident from the encouraging signs that several international and regional problems may be resolved. However  other problems arestill in abeyance. In the Middle East  the resolution of the Palestinian problem still facespersistent obstacles as a result of the intransigence of some parties and therigidity of their positions. This state of affairs has led the Middle East regionto lag behind other regions which have begun to proceed steadily towards just andlasting solutions.In recent years the Palestine question has witnessed attempts to impose afait accompli and to entrench the Israeli occupation. Nevertheless  thePalestinian uprising - the intifadah - has defied all forms of suppression andcoercion. The heroic Palestinian people  in their firm belief in their just cause have succeeded in imposing recognition of ""their existence and in gaining world-widesupport for their legitimate national rights.The Palestinian people have thus made it impossible to return to thepre-uprising conditions. So the escalating acts of repression perpetrated by theIsraeli occupation forces are futile. These acts include expatriation administrative detention without trial  imprisonment  confiscation of property  theblowing up of houses  torture  the closing down of schools and universities and thefreezing of labour unions' activities. They further contravene the rules ofIinternational law and the Geneva conventions and human rights. Such acts arestrongly condemned by Egypt  as they have been by the entire international community.The decision of King Hussein of Jordan last July to sever legal andadministrative links with the West Bank was aimed at fostering the representativestatus of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in implementation of theprime responsibility for the occupied Palestinian territories.Both the Jordanian and the Palestinian parties have reiterated theirdetermination and commitment to pursue their co-operation and intensify theirconsultations. Such a decision is triggered by the exigencies of the situation andby the unity of their objective  namely  the ending of the Israeli occupationwithin the framework of a comprehensive  lasting and just settlement based on thenorms and principles of international legitimacy.Guided by this noble goal  Egypt has called for the convening of aninternational conference on peace in the Middle East under the auspices of theUnited Nations. All parties concerned  includin9 the PLO  the sole  legitimaterepresentative of the Palestinian people  as well as the permanent members of theSecurity Council  are to participate at that conference  thus allowing directnegotiations between the parties  with the aim of reaching a lasting settlement ofthe Palestinian problem and putting an end to the regional tension in the MiddleEast  which threatens international peace and security.International support for the convening of the international conference hasundoubtedly become one of the basic tenets on which Arab and internationalpolitical and diplomatic action to resolve the Palestinian problem is based. Thereis also a general international consensus on holding such a conference at theearliest possible time.In this context  we welcome the United States approach based on the politicalrights of the Palestinian people and on the principle of ""land for peace""  both ofwhich were reaffirmed in the initiative of the united States Secretary of state Mr. Shultz  in April 1988 and again at the tripartite meeting attended byPresident Reagan of the United States on the 26th of the current month. Theseprinciples conform to the provisions of the United Nations Charter and to thesecurity Council resolutions  foremost among which is resolution 242 (1967)  whichconfirms the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territorythrough war. We believe that this principle is a sine qua non for the wholeresolution and is central to ensuring its implementation and to the establishmentof a comprehensive and lasting peace which would not entail a recurrence of thedispute in future.Refusal to face the facts  failure to admit the inherent nature of theconflict  persistent disregard of the Palestinian people and their legitimaterepresentatives and disregard of the national rights of those people  foremostamong which is their right to self-determination - all these will keep thisconflict unresolved and will lead to far-reaching consequences in the region. Itis high time the various parties took historic and courageous decisions in order toovercome the obstacles to peace. In this respect  I wish to welcome the statementsof Palestinian officials at the highest level which emphasize the willingness ofthe PLO to negotiate a peaceful and lasting solution of the Palestinian problem  aswell as the willingness for a mutual and simultaneous recognition of Israel. Thisdevelopment  which reflects a sound understanding of the situation and itsexigencies  deserves every encouragement. I also wish to take this opportunity tocommend the peace-loving forces in Israel on their efforts for the achievement of alasting and just settlement.If our strategic goal  as I have mentioned  is to reach a lasting and justsettlement of the Palestinian problem  which would ensure security and stability inthe Middle East  we are equally aware that the introduction of nuclear weapons orthe threat of their introduction into the Middle East would create seriousimbalances with grave consequences to security and stability in the region.Therefore we call on Israel once again from this rostrum to renounce thenuclear-weapon option  to accede to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of NuclearWeapons and to subject all its nuclear facilities to the safeguard system of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency. Such a decision would certainly boostconfidence and advance the drive towards peace.In this regard  Egypt has been working persistently for the establishment of anuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. We hope that this objective will beachieved at the earliest possible date.Turning to the situation in the Gulf  we observe that the Iraq-Iran conflict after eight years of war  has entered a new phase in which all parties recognizethat political settlement and serious negotiations are the only means of achievingsecurity and justice in that region.The mere acceptance of security Council resolution 598 (1987) by the parties and the halt to military operations do not in themselves mean the end of conflict and the advent of peace. Rather  good faith and serious efforts are necessary requirements. While appreciating the efforts of the United Nations to bring about a peaceful settlement of this dispute  we express the hope that Iran will substantiate its good faith. It's appreciation of the exigencies of the present situation  as has already been demonstrated by Iraq  would accelerate efforts towards a just and honourable settlement of the dispute and an early establishment of peace and stability  thus allowing the States and peoples of the region to 1ive in peace and to harness their human and economic resources for reconstruction and development inthe interest of all peoples of the region.As for the plight of the brotherly Lebanese people  the regional parties interfering in their affairs still refuse to admit that regional ambitions  the narrow political outlook and attempts by alien parties to impose control overLebanon will not achieve genuine peace for any party. Eventually it will be theLebanese people themselves who will pay the price and sustain the loss.we appeal to all our brothers in Lebanon  irrespective of their creeds confessions or positions  to place the interest of the people and the unity integrity and security of their country above any other consideration.The Situation in Afghanistan has passed through positive developments duringthe present year. The United Nations and its secretary-General have played aneffective role in bridging the gap between the viewpoints of the different parties thus facilitating the signing of the Geneva Accords relating to the situation inAfghanistan. These Accords have moved the problem into a new and brighterperspective after all the untold suffering sustained by the valiant Afghan peoplewho had engaged in an historic struggle.In this context we wish to welcome the Soviet decision to withdraw fromAfghanistan and its declared intention of complying fully with this decision.However  these positive developments should not distract us from the fact that agenuine and definitive solution to the problem of Afghanistan will not be forthcoming unless its people are enabled to choose their government freely and independently and unless its refugees are repatriated and a halt to foreignintervention is achieved.The African continent has recently observed the silver jubilee of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  which has been rich in accomplishments despiteall the difficulties: Positive developments have recently taken place  giving aglimmer of hope that the heroic people of Namibia would soon be able to gain theirindependence under the leadership of the South west Africa People's Organization(SWAPO)  their sole  legitimate representative and that the territorial integrityof Angola would be preserved and respected.We wish to reiterate our support for the heroic people of South Africa underthe leadership of their national liberation movements and their leader Nelson Mandela. We also call on the international community to continue shouldering its responsibilities for eliminating the abominable policy of apartheid.As regards north-west Africa  we welcome the developments towards peace on thequestion of western Sahara in the past few weeks. We believe that the proposals ofthe Secretary-General and his constructive efforts towards a settlement - so longas they are accepted by the parties - represent a great advance. We look forwardto the implementation of those proposals and to the achievement of further progresstowards the resolution of this question  which has long been causing concern forthe international community  the Arab world and the African countries.At the same time  a number of other regional problems have been benefiting from this positive climate. The problem of Kampuchea is witnessing genuine endeavours to achieve its independence and territorial integrity and sovereignty as well as a just solution that would ensure self-determination for its people  free from foreign intervention.There is also a forward movement on the issue of Cyprus under the aegis of the united Nations. This positive development leads us to look forward to a future in which agreement is reached on preserving the unity and territorial integrity ofCyprus within a federal non-aligned state  where all people and all communitiesenjoy equal rights. We hope that the emerging dialogue between the President ofCyprus and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community will constitute a positivestep in that direction.We also hope that the prevailing spirit of settlement will include the Koreanproblem in accordance with the des ire of the Korean people for the unification ofthe Korean peninsula.The recent positive developments in respect of a number of regional problemshave demonstrated that the United Nations can play an important and efficient rolein the settlement of regional disputes if enabled to do so. We therefore appeal toMember States to help extricate this Organization from its financial crisis so thatit may be able to continue assuming its role as an effective tool for therealization of justice  solidarity and peace in accordance with the provisions ofits Charter. I am pleased to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate theunited Nations on the occasion of the conferring of the Nobel Peace Prize on theUnited Nations peace-keeping operations in recognition of the growing and effectiverole of those operations in various parts of the world.Since the international community has expressed satisfaction at the increasingrole of the United Nations in the settlement of regional problems  it is necessary to emphasize once again that that role emanates from one of the fundamental principles of its Charter  namely  the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes. This principle is one of the most firmly established methods for the establishment of peace. The extent of commitment to this principle reflects the level of international maturity in the practice and organization of relations between States through breaking stalemates and seeking solutions to such disputes.In this regard I wish to refer particularly to the agreement between Egypt andIsrael on 11 September 1986 to resort to international obligatory arbitration inorder to resolve the dispute that came up regarding some international boundaryposts between Egypt and Palestine - under the Mandate - in what came to be known asthe Taba problem.. The two par ties had agreed on the terms of arbitration inaccordance with the provisions of the Charter  in particular Article 33  whichurges the par ties to a dispute to seek its resolution through one of the methodsmentioned therein.Thus  the ruling by the international arbitration panel in Geneva on the Taba problem on 29 September 1988 - that is  yesterday - encourages resort to the principles of international law and commitment to the noble principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We are gratified that the ruling of the arbitration panel has confirmed that Taba is an Egyptian territory that falls under Egyptian sovereignty and that the legal and historical documents and evidence provided by Egypt have been proved authentic. I am confident that speedy implementation  in good faith  of that ruling would lead to results that would transcend the disputedissue and improve the political climate in the region  thereby facilitating morepositive developments.As we approach the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights it behooves us to recall that Egypt has been at the forefront in signing oracceding to most international conventions and instruments relating to human rightsand in honouring the obligations arising there from. This attitude echoes our conviction that the human being is the target of peace  stability and development which cannot be attained without his efforts and which enhance his feeling ofdignity and his sense of freedom.Egypt also attaches great importance to the issues of childhood and maternityand has therefore set up the National Council for Childhood and Maternity  whichwill hold a national congress at Alexandria in November 1988 in collaboration withthe United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and a number of its regional offices.A number of Egyptians and others involved in the various aspects of child medicalcare and legal protection will participate in that congress  so that the widestsupport of public opinion may be mustered for the draft United Nations conventionon the rights of the child.I should like to refer here to the establishment of the Arab Council for Childhood and Development  which makes every effort to create better conditions for the bringing up of Arab children and to develop methods of control over the implementation of laws relating to children in the Arab world. Egypt has been elected vice-president of that Council. Egypt calls for the early preparation of the international convention on the rights of the child so that it may be adopted next year on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child.Referring to social development  I must express our appreciation of theconstructive contribution of the united Nations Development Programme (UNDP) andthe United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) inthe field of cultural development and the preservation of the ancient historicalheritage of Egypt  in particular the revival of the library of Alexandria as anEgyptian and international cultural edifice.The current world economic situation remains a source of deep concern  in viewof the difficult conditions through which most countries are passing. However because of their special conditions  the effects of that situation have been moreadverse to and painful for the developing countries. The increasing debt anddebt-service burdens and the unfavourable external and internal conditionsresulting from the decline in commodity prices  together with the burdens oftackling problems of underdevelopment  have led many developing countries to cuttheir imports and suspend some development programmes. Consequently  livingstandards have deteriorated and austerity measures have had to be adopted  withincreasing social and economic risks and consequences that threaten social andpolitical stability in most of those countries.I wish to refer in particular to the critical economic situation in Africa.The impact of the adverse international economic environment on the efforts of African countries to achieve economic recovery and development has beenshattering. African countries have made tremendous efforts to implement the UnitedNations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development1986-1990. Despite those efforts the economic situation has not appreciablyimproved  for reasons beyond Africa's control.In view of the internationalization of economic life  the interrelation ofinterests and the increasing interdependence of the countries of the world  bothrich and poor  economic issues and the problems of the developing countries make itnecessary for the industrialized countries to view the problems of developingcountries from a different perspective. Such perspective should be based on theconcept of mutual interests  equity and collective responsibility  thus allowingfor a healthy development of economic relations in the interest of all parties.The destiny of the future world will be a common one: progress for allretrogression for all. There is a dire need for all countries to engage in seriousand comprehensive negotiations aimed at improving world economic conditions.Serious dialogue through multilateral co-operation has proved its usefulness  andthe results of the seventh session of the united Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD) testify to that.In this connection  the Egyptian delegation to the second regular session ofthe Economic and Social Council last July took the initiative of calling for theconvening of a special session of the General Assembly to be devoted to discussionof the world economic and social situation and the means of promoting developmentand international economic co-operation. The formulation of a coordinated plan ofaction for the international community in the 1990s aimed at resolving theeconomic and social problems facing the peoples of the world is needed.Power is not the best means of establishing peace and security. The bestmeans is  rather  removal of the motives that lead to war  the supremacy ofpolitical rationality; making peace a life-style for our peoples.For this reason we should step up our support for the United Nations to enableit to increase its positive contributions. We should act together in solidarityand shared responsibility - Politically  economically and socially - so that we cancome closer to a more humanitarian world that would instill in mankind faith initself and its creative power to forge a better future and a brighter tomorrow."
"47",2206,"ESP",43,1988,"ï»¿The election  as President of the General Assembly  of a dear friend and colleague has been for me a source of great satisfaction. I should like to congratulate you. Sir  and also to congratulate ourselves because I feel entirely confident that your professional ability and proven diplomatic skill will ensure that the discussions in this forum will have the positive results for which we all hope. I also wish to express our gratitude for the work carried out by your predecessor as President  Mr. Peter Florin.Year after year  as we have debated the important issues on our agenda  we have observed with a feeling of frustration that many conflicts have continued to stagnate just where we left them the year before  and that nothing and nobody seemed capable of staying the sinister hand that wields the scourge of war. To this feeling of impotence was added a feeling of frustration because of a rather widespread tendency on the part of the public to dismiss the United Nations  and multilateralism in general  as an appropriate means of solving the most difficult and complex problems facing mankind.Today  however  there are reasonable grounds for optimism. The work of the United Nations over the past year has borne fruit in the area of the peaceful solution of international conflicts. The role of our Organization has been strengthened and has gained credibility in the eyes of the public.My Government has always believed in the need and usefulness of multilateral channels in today's world. Three years ago - on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Organization - Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez reaffirmed Spain's unqualified support for multilateralism  and for the United Nations in particular. A year later  this was also the chief message conveyed by His Majesty King Juan Carlos I when he addressed this Assembly. We have always thought that as long as there is the necessary political will on the part of the Member States  and as long as we are capable of introducing the readjustments that are needed at any given moment  this Organization's potential should be practically unlimited.It is not only the goodwill of the Member States and the new climate of dialogue among the great Powers - which has been reflected in the recent unity of action among the permanent members of the Security Council - that have contributed to bringing about this encouraging situation; the patience  the tenacity and the skill of the Secretary-General have also been instrumental. His hard work  which is now  quite rightly  winning international acclaim  continues to enjoy the full support of my Government  We trust that we are witnessing the start of a successful period during which the United Nations will be the forum in which everyone's efforts to implement the objectives and principles enunciated in the Charter will converge.With regard to regional problems  I shall begin with the long and terrible war that has confronted Iran and Iraq. The united action of the Security Council and its co-operation with the Secretary-General have started to bear fruit  with the adoption of resolution 598 (1987)  the Security Council had already laid the foundations for a just and lasting solution. With the full and unqualified acceptance of that resolution as a whole by both sides  a process of negotiation has formally begun under the auspices of the Secretary-General and his special representative. Ambassador Eliassen  who  in spite of the many obstacles and difficulties to be overcome  is to secure not only a cease-fire but true peace for these two peoples  worn out by so much death and sacrifice.In the Afghanistan conflict  the beginning of a solution can also be glimpsed as a result of the signing of the Geneva Accords last April. The determination and tenacity of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative  Mr. Cordovez  were also decisive in drawing them up. We must now trust that the different parties involved will abide scrupulously by the agreements  that the withdrawal of Soviet troops of occupation will proceed in accordance with the agreed timetable  and that the Afghan people will be able to exercise their right to self-determination and finally achieve true sovereignty and independence. The setting up of a widely representative Government  and the free and unhindered return of as many refugees as wish to go back to their homes  will constitute the real proof of national reconciliation  to which the international community must contribute all possible aid for the urgent rebuilding of Afghanistan  through the Special Co-ordinator appointed by the Secretary-General.In southern Africa  together with the hopeful progress towards the solution of the problems of Angola and Namibia  we observe that South Africa's policy of destabilization of neighbouring countries is being maintained and that the hideous and iniquitous system of apartheid is still in force. The repressive measures of all kinds taken over the course of the past few months and the re-imposition of martial law are clear signs of the unwillingness of the Government in Pretoria to engage in dialogue  while it radicalises the situation and makes the solution of the domestic problems more difficult. Once again we repeat our appeal for the immediate liberation of Nelson Mandela and the other political prisoners  as well as the legalization of all political organizations. We are determined to reinforce  together with our partners in the European Community  both the positive actions and the application of pressure necessary to promote peaceful change in South Africa  which would pave the way to a pluralistic  democratic and non-racist society. However  it appears that there are also signs of hope in the region. On the one hand  in the talks new under way among the Governments of Angola  Cuba and South Africa  with the positive mediation of the United States  we perceive a desire for flexibility and a general political will to overcome the last obstacles that still hinder the attainment of peace and stability in Angola. On the other hand  the implementation of United Nations resolutions  and in particular Security Council resolution 435 (1978) - and  incidentally  today is the tenth anniversary of its adoption - appears to be drawing progressively nearer  after so many years of stagnation. The process of independence for Namibia will undoubtedly require significant effort on the part of this Organization and its Member States. Spain is prepared to co-operate fully with the Secretary-General in this process and to provide  if so requested  support for the human and military infrastructure that may be needed in order to bring it to a successful conclusion.There are also better prospects for a solution to the problem of Kampuchea. For the first time in many years there is perhaps an opportunity for this unfortunate country  and the entice area of South-East Asia  to enjoy peace  stability and an end to violence. We are encouraged by the dialogue that has begun among the various parties to the conflict and the countries concerned. We support the constructive efforts of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and believe that contacts between China and the Soviet Union on this issue can also be useful. Any lasting solution requires the withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea and the setting up of a Government of national reconciliation  representing the different political parties  thus averting once and for all the danger of a return to the immediate past  which we have all condemned.In the Maghreb  a region to which my country is linked by innumerable ties. We have also noted over the past few months a significant easing of tension. Spain welcomed with great satisfaction the renewing of diplomatic relations between two of our friends  Algeria and Morocco  as well as the first steps towards progressive regional integration. In this new context  we observe that important steps have been taken towards the solution of a conflict  that of the Western Sahara  about which my country is understandably concerned. The Secretary-General  guided by the resolutions of this Assembly  and in conjunction with the President of the Organization of African Unity  has done some very constructive work here. This consisted in the sending of a technical information mission to the area; the maintaining of constant contact with the parties to the conflict - Morocco and the POLISARIO Front - and the submitting of concrete proposals to both these parties last summer with a view to holding a referendum for self-determination  duly organized and supervised by this Organization. We note with satisfaction that these proposals have received the initial agreement of the parties. Regrettably  the Security Council authorized the Secretary-General to appoint a Special Representative  who has ahead of him a delicate task in order to conclude the peace plan successfully. Spain is willing to provide all the technical co-operation the Secretary-General may require in this process. Furthermore  we are confident that  through the free and unhindered expression of the will of the Sahraoui people  an end will be put to a painful conflict that impedes this future of progressive integration that the peoples of the Maghreb desire.We also wish to express our satisfaction at the progress made on the question of Cyprus. The recent talks between the leaders of the two communities  under the auspices of the Secretary-General  are a good omen that perhaps a way has been found to solve another long-standing conflict. My country supports this direct dialogue and is confident that it will lead to a final settlement which will guarantee the unity  sovereignty  independence and territorial interest of the Republic of Cyprus in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations  while at the same time making possible peaceful coexistence between the two communities on the island.Unfortunately  in the case of other regional conflicts we cannot say that there has been significant progress in the past few months.Last year at this time I pointed out from this rostrum the advisability of not delaying the convening of an international peace conference  under the auspices of the United Nations  to seek a just  global and lasting solution to the conflict in the Middle East. A few months later  the Palestinian population of the occupied territories rose in protest  and this has attracted international attention both in connection with the deteriorating economic and social situation and the injustices being suffered by the Palestinian people and in connection with the repressive measures taken by Israel with a view to stifling the national aspirations of that people. The deterioration of the situation in the occupied territories makes clear the dangers involved in a stagnation of the peace process My country trusts that  under the auspices of the United Nations  gradual and constructive initiatives will be introduced which will permit an agreement in principle among all the parties involved in the holding of a conference at which a final agreement could be reached. This agreement must guarantee respect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including the right of self-determination  as well as the existence of all the countries in the region  including Israel  within secure and internationally recognized borders. Meanwhile  the recent decision by Jordan to break off legal and administrative ties between the two banks of the river Jordan has left a void that requires  on the one hand  greater involvement and aid by the international community and  on the other  greater moderation  prudence and realism by all the parties directly involved in this conflict.  Within the context of the Middle East  we see with great concern the recent aggravation of the political crisis that has been going on for so many years in Lebanon. Spain supports the wishes of the Lebanese people to put an end to the bloody confrontations that have taken so many lives in that country since 1975 and trusts that  through dialogue among all the communities  a strengthening of its constitutional institutions may be brought about which will make possible peaceful coexistence in a sovereign  independent and united Lebanon My Government continues to support resolutely the process of the strengthening of democracy in Latin America  although  unfortunately  clear threats and resistance to the progress of freedom still persist. Democracy presupposes pluralism  respect for human rights  and also the right of peoples to determine  freely and without outside interference  their political  economic and social systems. We therefore welcomed the Acapulco compromise for peace  development and democracy  which was signed by the Presidents of eight Latin American countries in November last year  and we hope that Chile will soon return resolutely to its democratic traditions.With regard to the serious crisis in Central America  Spain greeted with hope the signing of the Esquipulas II agreements as a highly significant step towards the peace  reconciliation  and economic and social recovery of the countries of the region. It is true that since then other significant steps have been taken and that the will of the peoples concerned to find genuinely regional solutions to the problems of the area have remained unaltered; however  in general terms  there is a disturbing stalemate which must be overcome as rapidly as possible. In this regard  the convening of the long-delayed summit of Central American Presidents  which has gained better prospects recently  can contribute to give a new impulse to the peace process. The national dialogue must continue  respect for human rights must be strengthened and there must be strict observance by all the parties concerned of the commitments in the Esquipulas agreements. There are no alternatives to this peace process  to this peace framework. At the same time  an essential element for the consolidation of the momentum towards peace is the implementation and development of the special plan for aid to Central America  which my country will continue to support fully. As we have incessantly repeated  the grave problems of this region have their roots in underdevelopment and the persistence of unjust social and economic structures. This Assembly  which has acted as a true catalyst in the process of decolonization  has nevertheless been unable to eliminate certain pending issues from its agenda. With regard to East Timor  we trust that the contacts between Portugal and Indonesia will be continued and that progress will be made towards a just and internationally acceptable solution. As for the Malvinas Islands  direct negotiations should be held between Argentina and the United Kingdom that will enable Argentinean territorial integrity to be restored while safeguarding the legitimate interests of the population.I cannot fail to mention another pending colonial issue that directly affects my country. The Spanish Government and people continue to remain firm in their determination to find a definitive solution to the problem of Gibraltar that will restore the Rock to our country while safeguarding the interests of the population . In this connection  we have continued the dialogue with the United Kingdom and we shall continue to do so in the future along the lines of the agreements contained in the 1984 Brussels Declaration and in accordance with the decision taken by both Governments in Geneva in 1985 to deal with and resolve all aspects of the problem  including the matter of sovereignty  through negotiation. During this past year significant progress has taken place in the talks on some technical problems  such as air facilities  and it is our firm intention to continue along this path of negotiation  with the goal of being able to conclude the process of decolonization through the restoration of our territorial integrity  thus implementing the resolutions that were adopted by this Assembly at the time.Recent positive developments in some regional conflicts and the continued efforts of this Organization and its Secretary-General to bring about a solution for others have brought the United Nations peace-keeping activities to the forefront. As has been mentioned  the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for 1988 is something we all welcome and in which we can take satisfaction. The resolute action by the Security Council in this field is a particularly encouraging factor. The growing containment to the concept and the practice of peace-keeping operations among Member States and  above all  the political will to co-operate in their implementation on the part of those who have shown most reserve in the past provide a solid basis for developing them more thoroughly at a favourable time such as the present.We feel that the time has come to draw up general regulations on the financial arrangements and the supply of facilities  services and personnel by Member States. My delegation considers that it would be most advisable to revitalize and strengthen the activities of the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations  whose recent meetings a few months ago  after five years without being convened  strengthen our optimism about its possible future role in this important sphere of the work of the Organization.The new trend towards peace on the international scene prompted me to the first with regional conflicts. But obviously the task of this Organization does not end with the solution of regional conflicts. There are many other areas in which the United Nations  with less spectacular but nevertheless tenacious and continuous efforts  has been demonstrating for years its capacity for dealing with the major problems facing the international community. I have in mind three areas in which the importance of multilateralism can hardly be denied and in which the Organization's efforts have been especially significant: disarmament  co-operation for development  and the protection and promotion of human rights.Some three months ago  at the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  I gave a detailed outline of my Government's views on the many items of the agenda related to this important issue. At the start of this forty-third session  I should like to make some remarks of a more general nature. Over the course of this year several developments have pointed to the possibility of developing a new pattern of East-West relationships  which had focused on confrontation  with scarcely any margin for dialogue and co-operation.The Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - the slow but sure progress in the strategic arms limitation talks  the advances towards the limitation and ultimate banning of nuclear testing; these are all stages in a new bilateral dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union aimed for the first time at reversing the arms race on Earth and preventing its extension to outer space. However  their significance is not limited to the field of arms control and disarmament  nor to the strict framework of bilateral relations between the super-Powers.The satisfactory implementation of the intrusive verification procedures provided for under the INF Treaty is a confidence-building element which will affect other areas. Thus  in the field of arms control and disarmament  a new impulse could be given and new initiatives could also be introduced in international forums.The fact that it was not possible to agree on a final document at the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament is soma thing that we regret  but that has not undermined our confidence in multilateralism. In our opinion; the document - which never saw the light of day although it had obtained broad consensus on most points - contained many elements which deserve more thorough treatment in the immediate future and which could provide an excellent working basis for the debates during the present session. The issue of conventional stability is especially important within the European regional framework. In this connection  within the context of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)  it is necessary to proceed without delay to a reduction of the existing imbalances in the conventional field  which will make possible enhanced security with lower levels of forces. At the same time  Spain is in favour of the adoption of new confidence-building measures that will complement and reinforce those adopted at the Stockholm Conference.Progress in the field of security must be accompanied by substantial advances in other areas of the CSCE process  particularly with regard to human rights and fundamental freedoms. We are following with growing interest the process of greater openness in Eastern Europe  which we hope will have a positive effect at the Vienna meeting. Spain is confident that a substantial and balanced final document will be agreed upon promptly at that meeting  so that negotiations in the area of security can begin as soon as possible.However  there is a matter of serious concern that I should like to stress. The renewed use of chemical weapons  together with the proliferation of ballistic missiles  gives new urgency to the need to achieve decisive progress in concluding an agreement for the complete and effective elimination of the whole category of chemical weapons.Economic development is another major issue facing the international community. It is perhaps the major question facing it. The recent economic recovery in the industrialized countries has served to enlarge the gap between them and the developing countries and to make the poverty of the latter more visible. Commodity prices have been another disruptive factor in the past few years. Protectionism is directly related to economic power. Six years of external debt have condemned the majority of those countries to a pathetic and hopeless effort  especially in Latin America  where they are beginning to speak of a lost decade. We are seriously concerned about the grievous situation in Latin America  where the burden of debt servicing and the unpredictability of financial flows for development have turned the countries of the region into net exporters of capital  which is an unprecedented phenomenon in international economic relations.While addressing the subject of the debt of these middle-income countries  I should like to recall the words of the Spanish Prime Minister a few days ago  when he addressed the Governors of the Central Banks of Latin America and the Philippines:""Facts show that the present strategy to solve the debt crisis 1 unable to provide for a timely solution of the outstanding problems.""Let us face the truth. We need to reconsider the strategy  now that public opinion and the banking situation are favourable. The problem must be dealt with multilaterally within the framework of the international financial institutions  the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  a consensus being reached with regard to interest capitalization and the reduction of the debt burden. The resulting financial margins could be used in support of the necessary adjustment policies that must continue to be implemented.With regard to the least-developed countries  we shall carefully study the proposals of the Toronto summit meeting. We are also ready to participate actively in the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  to be held in Paris in 1990  at which financial issues will undoubtedly be of special relevance.I have previously mentioned the link between the external debt of developing countries and the evolution of commodity prices. Despite the recovery of some commodity markets  the majority of commodity prices are still below 1980 levels. Here  the foreseeable entry into force of the Common Fund for Commodities could give rise to hope.In the face of the protectionist pressures that have surfaced in international trade  the progress made in the present Round of multilateral trade negotiations  launched by the Punta del Este declaration in 1986  is also an encouraging sign. Despite present difficulties  we cannot afford to let this Round end in failure. We hope that  with the necessary political will  the review of progress achieved  scheduled to take place at the ministerial meeting next December in Montreal will be a valuable and positive contribution to the ultimate success of the Uruguay Round. Finally  the efforts and determination of the United Nations to alleviate the most urgent problems have been outstanding. In this connection the funds and specific programmes are especially relevant  among them the United Nations Development Programme  which continues to work effectively in assisting developing countries. Spain is determined to continue to increase its voluntary contributions to the funds for and programmes of operational activities for development.As we all know  the African continent is now facing one of the most difficult and agonizing development problems in the world. This General Assembly session marks an important turning point in the assessment of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. The nucleus of the Programme of Action contains the twofold commitment made by both the African countries and the international community. On the one hand Africa must lay the foundations for stable development and sustained growth through structural adjustments and improvements in its economic policies  and on the other the international community must substantially increase its assistance and adopt initiatives in support of the African efforts. Although it is true that in the short term neither commitment has had any visible results  it is also true that with a medium-term programme such as this there must be enough time for it to become properly established.Spain will continue to assist African countries  both multilaterally through its participation in the conventions and programmes of the European Economic Community  the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  and the United Nations agencies  and bilaterally through co-operation agreements with individual African countries.When speaking of development it would be inexcusable not to mention the dangers inherent in ecological imbalances. It is urgently necessary for all of us  but most especially the industrialized countries  to do everything possible to preserve the environment  with a view to ensuring a more habitable world for future generations. The Brundtland report and the measures subsequently taken have been fundamental in this connection.One of the fields in which the work of the United Nations has been most innovative and successful is the promotion and protection of human rights. Thanks to this Organization's efforts  the international community now has a large number of legal instruments in which basic human rights are defined and the necessary mechanisms established for their control and defence. The initial corner-stone of this imposing edifice is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the fortieth anniversary of which we shall be celebrating in December. Its few brief articles comprise a resounding reaffirmation of faith in the value and dignity of every human being  and of the principle laid down in the Charter that universal respect for human rights is the concern of all peoples and Governments. The best proof of the great moral and legal value of the Declaration is the way it has influenced many constitutions and national legislations  as well as the international legal system that it has been drawing up over the past few decades  from the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights to the recent Convention against torture  which my country ratified in October last year.The Spanish Government is convinced that we must continue to advance resolutely along this path. The situation in many countries shows  regrettably  that we are still a long way from being able to feel satisfied. We believe that from now on our efforts  without forgetting the drawing up of new legal instruments aimed at perfecting the current international system and filling its possible gaps  should be directed above all towards the application and development of existing ones and the effective monitoring of their observance. A good way of making progress is through the world information campaign on human rights  which the Secretary-General has proposed should be launched on the anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration.Three years ago the Assembly took an important step when it condemned unanimously and unequivocally all acts  methods and practices of terrorism where so ever and by whomsoever committed. The bodies and agencies of this Organization must now continue to advance along the path opened up at that time and design a strategy for combating terrorism in their respective fields of action. The initiatives aimed at reinforcing international protection for civil aviation and promoting security at sea have our whole-hearted support. The terrorist threat has acquired universal proportions and the efforts to eradicate it must also be universal.The Organization's work in the social field also deserves to be mentioned. The process of drawing up an international convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs will no doubt be concluded in December. Its entry into force will enable the international community to deal effectively with a problem of universal dimensions whose repercussions  given the ramifications which link the illicit traffic in narcotics to activities such as arms traffic and terrorism  and whose solution depends on close and resolute international co-operation. The speed and determination with which work is proceeding towards the conclusion of the convention shows the international community's awareness of this issue.At the beginning of my statement I said that this was a particularly promising time for the United Nations. However  there is a shadow threatening the work of the Organization - that of the financial crisis which for three years now has been hovering over its daily work as a result of the unjustifiable failure of some Member States to fulfil their obligations under the Charter. During that time  significant efforts have been made to make better use of existing resources. Progress has been made also with regard to substantive issues  such as the decision-making process in budgetary matters and the beginning of a review of the necessary  although complex  restructuring of the economic and social sectors. I should like to call on all the countries represented here to do their utmost to meet their financial obligations to our Organization and to co-operate in introducing  at this particularly felicitous time  the adjustments needed to speed up and rationalize its operation and make it more flexible.Year after year  as autumn comes to New York  we meet in this Assembly in a long-established ritual in which speeches are delivered  meetings are held and agreements are negotiated. This time we all have the impression that this exercise  which goes on quietly throughout the year  can be  and is  successful. We know very well from experience that what is happening is not the result of ineluctable fate  but that  rather  we are facing issues created by men  now or in the past  and that those issues must be solved by men  now or in the future. In any event  we are more responsible than ever before because we are better informed and have more resources than ever before.Ancient Stoic wisdom consisted in knowing what depends on us and what does not depend on us. Now nearly everything depends on us  both the problems and their solutions. We are finding the solutions  and we shall continue to find them  not with less dialogue but with more dialogue  not with less justice but with more justice and not with less freedom but with more freedom; and  starting with this Assembly  which has now become so encouraging  we shall do so not with less hope but with more hope.

"48",2278,"ETH",43,1988,"ï»¿Let me first extend to Mr  Dante Caput the congratulations of the Ethiopian delegation  as well as my own  on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session . My delegation is confident that under his wise and skilful guidance this session will reach a successful conclusion. In this regard I should like to assure him of the full co-operation of my delegation as he discharges his heavy responsibilities.May I also take this opportunity to express our gratitude Ñ his predecessor. Comrade Peter Florin  who presided over the last session of the General Assembly with admirable skill.I should like at this juncture to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier PÃ©rez dc Cuellar  for the exemplary dedication and competence with which he has always discharged the heavy responsibilities entrusted to him. In reaffirming to him the deep appreciation of my Government  already expressed on a number of occasions over the last few years  I wish him ever greater success in his future endeavours.Few are those who deny that nations are becoming increasingly interdependent. There has probably been no period since the dawn of human civilization when various societies have lived in complete isolation from each other. The growth of human progress itself would have been inconceivable without close contacts and the exchange of ideas among different societies. Ours has especially become a period in history when the various challenges facing humanity can hardly be tackled outside the context of interdependence. Ours has  indeed  become a time when the imperatives of survival dictate that we all take seriously the fact that not only are we interdependent but also that we share common destiny.Perhaps no one denies this incontrovertible truth  but the lack of political will to bridge the huge gap between what is asserted on the plane of declarations and what is done in practice is a vivid demonstration of the fact that our actions are not commensurate with the immense challenges facing humanity as a whole. In this context two closely related challenges  among others  demand our concerted and co-ordinated action: the strengthening of peace and security on the one hand and the promotion of development and progress on the other.This session of the General Assembly is being convened at a most propitious time from the point of view of the relaxation of international tension. There is no gainsaying that the period since the last session has been marked by a number of encouraging and positive developments on the international scene. The improvement in relations between the two major Powers and the increased level of mutual understanding between them accords fully with the yearning for peace that we have all been voicing for too long.In this regard we view with satisfaction the Treaty concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States on the Elimination of their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles. Although only 3 per cent of the nuclear arsenals of the two major Powers are meant to be destroyed under the Treaty  the symbolic significance of the achievement can hardly be underestimated. In general we feel the Treaty represents a step forward in the area of nuclear disarmament.Subsequent political developments likewise give us reason to view the international political scene with optimism. Among such developments is the acceptance by both Iran and Iraq of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). This constitutes a major achievement towards the restoration of peace in the area and the enhancement of international peace and security.The Geneva Accords on Afghanistan  which came into force on 15 May 1988  are yet another step which has contributed towards the change to a better political climate than that which prevailed a year ago. The positive steps that have been taken so far towards the withdrawal of South African occupation forces from southern Angola and the efforts being made to facilitate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  on Namibia  are also welcome developments. However  given the chronic duplicity of the racist regime  we feel obliged to caution that the international community should follow the unfolding situation with the utmost vigilance.We also draw satisfaction from the resumption of the inter-communal talks aimed at addressing the question of Cyprus. We are likewise optimistic regarding developments towards seeking a solution to the problem of the Western Sahara.It is also pertinent to mention here the concerted efforts that are being deployed to restore peace in Kampuchea and the progress that has so far been made towards the restoration of peace in that region.It is a source of great satisfaction to us that the United Nations  consistent with the provisions of the Charter of the Organization  has spearheaded the search for solutions to the various political problems that I have just referred to. While this is testimony to the continued relevance of the United Nations  ray delegation also finds it most appropriate to pay a tribute once again to the Secretary-General for his dedication and untiring efforts in the cause of international peace and security.As we take note of the improved climate in international relations and the prevailing relaxation of tension  we are at the same time duty bound to make a realistic assessment of what has already been achieved and what remains to be done in the area of international peace and security. I should also add that whatever conclusions we arrive at must be firmly founded on an objective analysis of the state of affairs now prevailing in the world.In this connection it will suffice to refer to the disappointing result of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. As is well known  the session closed without agreement being readied on a final document  although great efforts were exerted to arrive at a consensus. It is obvious  therefore  that we should redouble our efforts towards progress on a number of interrelated disarmament measures. A comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty is a goal the achievement of which could go a long way in arresting the nuclear-arms race but which has so far eluded us  despite a near universal consensus on the issue. Other priority measures in the field of disarmament include steps to prevent the extension of the arms race into outer space  agreement on the prohibition of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons and the speedy conclusion of a chemical-weapon convention.I might also mention here the contribution that the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones in different parts of the globe could make towards the ultimate goal of a nuclear-free world. In this context I wish to express our appreciation to the Government of the German Democratic Republic for organizing in June of this year an International Meeting on Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones.In any discussion of the subject of nuclear-weapon-free zones it is appropriate to refer to the initiative that the peoples of Africa have taken to keep the continent free of nuclear weapons. It was 24 years ago that the Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity adopted  at their summit conference in Cairo  a Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa. This initiative represented one of the first regional attendees at the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Since then  the General Assembly has adopted a series of resolutions calling upon nuclear-weapon States to respect the wishes of the peoples of Africa to protect the status of the continent as a nuclear-weapon-free area. However  it has now become clear that the African peoplesâ commitment to free the region from the nuclear-arms race has been challenged by the reckless policy of the racist regime in Pretoria to acquire nuclear-weapons capability. In fact  it now appears from available evidence that South Africa has indeed achieved the capability to produce nuclear weapons.The implications of this ominous development for international peace and security cannot be over-emphasized. Such capability  acquired by a regime that would have no scruples in using them  should be viewed with alarm by all who have genuine concern for the maintenance of international peace and security. There is  of course  little doubt that it would have been practically impossible for South Africa to achieve this capability without the support it has been able to get from those who  with characteristic myopia  regard South Africa as an indispensable partner.As if this were not enough  the people of Africa are also being challenged by a new and grave development. In recent years it has become clear that some in the West have started to engage in activities that pose imminent danger to the African peoples and to the African ecosystem. I am referring here to the dumping of nuclear and industrial wastes in African countries by some Western transnational corporations.The indignation of the African peoples at the callousness displayed by those who perpetrate this crime has been echoed by the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  meeting in its forty-eighth ordinary session in May of this year. My delegation deems it appropriate that the dumping of nuclear and industrial wastes in Africa has been inscribed as an item on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. We are confident that the session will give serious attention to the matter and adopt decisions reflecting the gravity of the problem. Much as we are encouraged by the significant political achievements registered during the first half of 1988  we remain none the less concerned by the continued use or threat of use of force  under any pretext  against the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of small States.No better example of this can be provided than the prevailing situation in Central America where  despite the various regional peace efforts and the decision of the International Court of Justice  Nicaragua still finds itself under constant threat to its independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty. Thus the international community's solidarity with the people of Nicaragua must be strengthened so that that country can be totally free of the covert and overt intervention to which it has been subjected for too long.Similarly  there are a number of other issues relating to international peace and security  as well as to the rights of peoples and to justice for those facing egregious forms of discrimination that still cry out for solutions.The problems posed by the evil Â¡system of apartheid in South Africa clearly demonstrate how long indeed is the distance that the international community has yet to travel in laying the foundation for international relations based on justice and basic human decency. The noble goal of eradicating this abhorrent system continues to demand unremitting struggle. Apart from the call for comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the racist regime  for the success of which the international community needs to deploy greater effort  final victory against it requires all those who stand for justice to continue to rally behind the struggle being waged by the people of South Africa. As in the past  Ethiopia will continue to provide concrete assistance to the people of South Africa until apartheid is dismantled and justice and democracy ace firmly established in South Africa. It is also appropriate to emphasize here that continued solidarity with the front-line States is part and parcel of the struggle against apartheid. In that context  we are all duty bound to render the fullest possible assistance to these countries to enable them to withstand the military intervention and economic pressure of the racist regime.In the Middle East  the problem that emanates essentially from the denial to the Palestinian people of their rights as a people still awaits a just solution. I should like to take this opportunity to reaffirm Ethiopia's continued support for the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East  with the participation of all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization.The situation in the Korean peninsula is one other problem that requires the attention of the international community. I believe we are all aware of the fact that the quest for reunification by the people of the peninsula is still frustrated by certain major impediments  Ethiopia fully supports the desire and efforts of the Korean people for national reunification without foreign intervention.While the past year has witnessed a number of encouraging developments in the sphere of disarmament and the resolution of regional conflicts  it is regrettable that existing negative trends have persisted in other areas.Far from showing improvement  the issues of development and progress that represent another challenge to the international community have instead become a cause for ever greater concern  both for their serious implications for international peace and security and for the immense human tragedy they entail.The deteriorating economic and social conditions in developing countries  especially in the least developed among them  obviously require concerted action from the international community to be contained and reversed. Instead  what we have been witnessing is lack of sufficient political will on the part of many developed countries to create the necessary economic environment for developing countries to rehabilitate their economies.It has now become clearer than ever before that the serious difficulties facing the developing world emanate mainly from the external economic situation  over which they have very little control. The policies pursued by some developed countries  particularly in the areas of trade  money and finance  have further aggravated the problems  which are deep-rooted in the prevailing international economic system already characterized by unjust and unequal relations.Developing countries are endeavouring  within the limits of their resources  to revive their economies and to ensure a decent life for their peoples. But to no avail. Some of the reform measures required of developing countries have  in fact  become potential causes of political and social instability. Furthermore  the determined efforts made by these countries have invariably been frustrated by such external factors as the decline in commodity prices and export revenue  unfavourable terms of trade  widespread protectionism  accumulation of external debt and decline in net resource flows  the combined impact of which has seriously impeded their overall development process.In the case of African countries  most of which belong to the group of least developed countries  these externally Induced obstacles to development have further compounded the difficulties they have encountered as a result of widespread drought  desertification and other natural calamities.It is to be recalled. In this connection  that it was in response to the economic plight of African countries that the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to the critical economic situation in Africa was convened more than two years ago. The result of that session was United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. While the Programme of Action is intended to help improve the performance of African economies  the full implementation of the reform measures it requires has been rendered difficult owing to various factors. Significant among these is the unfavourable international climate characterized  among other things  by accelerated deterioration of the terms of trade Ï the low level of resource flows  mounting debt-servicing  and the inadequacy of external support for our efforts. The recent raid-term review conference has clearly shown the constraints faced by Africa in the reform process. We are therefore hopeful that the international community will be more forthcoming in supplementing the efforts of African countries towards the desired objective of improved productivity and rapid economic recovery.As Ethiopia is a country already confronted with immense problems caused by natural calamities  it should come as no surprise that the negative impact of the external economic environment on its efforts towards economic recovery has been enormous. Although the amount and distribution of precipitation during the main rainy season this year appear satisfactory  the adverse effects of the series of droughts my country has experienced for almost a decade and a half can hardly be tackled with our own resources within a short period of time. However  Ethiopia will continue to exert every effort to make effective use of available resources with a view to overcoming its economic difficulties and accelerating its development.In this connection  it is indeed regrettable that some continue to display a glaring lack of judgement as regards my country in their assessment of the problems in our sub-region. Rather  they see fit to subject Ethiopia to their habitual criticism  which is as biased as it is unwarranted  and in sharp contrast to the prevailing reality in the country.Fairness and objectivity would have demanded that they should  at the very least  recognize the maximum efforts Ethiopia is exerting to offset the consequences of the drought  the attainment of food self-sufficiency and accelerated development while at the same time coping with the problem created by the huge influx of refugees into the country. In the circumstances  it would have been most appropriate to sensitise the international community to this reality with a view to supporting Ethiopia's efforts to meet effectively the manifold challenges it is facing.When I had the opportunity to address this Assembly last year  I expressed  inter alia  Ethiopia's readiness to forge and strengthen relations with all countries  particularly those which are in our region and with which we have had difficult relations"". (A/42/PV. 22  p. 19-20)In that statement  I expressed Ethiopia's commitment to peace and its determination to do as much as possible to help relax the tension in our region. We have always been willing to muster the necessary political will to take two steps forward towards the normalization of relations with all peace-loving countries for every one step they may take towards the same goal.Today  it gives me immense satisfaction to refer to the highly significant step that has been taken by my country and Somalia towards improving our relations. An agreement on normalization of relations between the bio countries was signed on 3 April 1988. In accordance with this agreement not only have we restored diplomatic relations and exchanged prisoners of war but we have also embarked at a rapid pace on the normalization of relations  which  we are confident  will create the necessary conditions for both countries to devote their resources and energy to their economic development. This demonstrates our good will to bury the hatchet with a view to promoting regional peace. I should like to take this opportunity to reaffirm that Ethiopia will be second to none in its determination to build a bridge of friendship with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In this regard  I should like to acquaint this Assembly with the fact that  consistent with its commitment to ensure durable peace in our region  Ethiopia is at present engaged in sustained and painstaking negotiations with the Sudan with a view to identifying the root causes of the problems between the two countries and to finding appropriate solutions. For its part  my Government is determined that the Joint Expert Committee which the two countries have established will soon complete its tasks and present its recommendations. Given a similar commitment on the part of our Sudanese brothers to lasting peace between the two countries  my Government remains confident that all outstanding issues could be resolved in the interest of peace and co-operation in our part of the world.We derive satisfaction from the national  regional and international appreciation and support of our peaceful endeavours. On the other hand  we find it hard to comprehend the view of those who still fail to grasp the significance of these achievements as steps towards the restoration of peace by the countries of the region themselves  and continue to express lingering anxiety about tension in the area.In opening ray statement I referred to the fact that the challenges of development and progress  on the one hand  and of international peace and security  on the other  could be tackled only within the context of interdependence. Thus  it becomes obvious that our well-being lies only in multilateralism. As a founding Member of this Organization  there is nothing that gives us greater joy than to see the United Nations become increasingly effective in the quest for solutions to the major challenges facing humanity.	In recent months  the United Nations has shown how truly effective it could be in implementing and promoting the purposes and principles of the Organization as enshrined in its Charter. We are  indeed  encouraged by this positive trend. At the same time  the financial situation of the Organization continues to be a cause for concern. Putting pressure on the United Nations by withholding assessed contributions to the regular budget of the Organization constitutes a violation of a treaty obligation on the part of Member States. My delegation is hopeful that such a state of affairs will not be allowed to continue and that the growing efficacy of the United Nations will not be adversely affected by a financial crisis.In the interest of global peace and security  and in the interest of the prosperity and well-being of the human race  let us therefore rededicate ourselves to strengthening the viability and effectiveness of the United Nations. As for Ethiopia  it will always remain committed to the purposes and principles of the United Nations."
"49",2324,"FIN",43,1988,"ï»¿At the outset I should like to convey to you. Sir  my most sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly  which is a tribute to Argentina  whose commitment to peace and international co-operation is known to all of us here. It is a country to which Finland is bound by ties of warm friendship. We know your experience and your abilities  and we are certain that with your leadership this session will be a truly fruitful one.  At the same time I want to express our sincere appreciation to the President of the forty-second session  Mr. Florin  for the excellent manner in which he discharged his responsibilities.I should also like once again to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  with whom we enjoy relations of deep trust and esteem  and to reiterate to him the Finnish Government's appreciation for his effort to promote the principles of the United Nations Charter and to strengthen the role and machinery of the Organization. The United Nations has often been criticized for its inability to perform the tasks entrusted to it in the Charter for the preservation of peace and security. The role of the Organization has been questioned. This criticism has not been totally unfounded. The opportunities offered by the Organization have not always been taken. The United Nations has too often been utilized as a forum for aggravating differences.Yet the dramatic developments of the past weeks and months have demonstrated that the United Nations is still able to serve as a forum for resolute action in the interests of security and peace. The authority of the Organization has been enhanced by the recent achievements in various parts of the world. Those achievements demonstrate that the United Nations is an invaluable tool of peace-making and co-operation. This development is particularly welcome to Finland. My country has throughout maintained its firm belief in multilateral co-operation and support for the world Organization.Indeed  there is hope that confrontation is gradually giving way to co-operation. This development has been most striking in East-West relations. The dialogue between the Soviet Union and the United States has widened and deepened significantly. Fresh approaches can be discerned in big-Power relations. These approaches have led to tangible progress in reducing the risk of war and military confrontation in Europe. Serious international problems cannot be solved without patient work and willingness to negotiate in good faith. Our Organization is the one best suited to offer a forum for a meeting of minds and a mechanism for resolving conflicts. Recent positive developments bear witness to the fact that the many years of efforts in the United Nations and elsewhere to work our solutions to these conflicts have not been wasted. In some instances results have been achieved which a year ago seemed nearly out of reach. The United Nations must now decisively seize the opportunities offered by the existing favourable international atmosphere. Struggling with Î± serious financial crisis  and after years of soul-searching  the United Nations must re-emerge as an important factor in inter-State relations. The late President Kekkonen of Finland once said in this Assembly; ""Rather than as judges  we see ourselves here as physicians"". (Î/?Î½.1040  p. 489  para. 10). The policies of Finland in the United Nations still accord with that vision. In fact  we believe that the whole Organization very largely follows the same precept  and should continue to do so. Acute problems may require skilful management and treatment. A strong world Organization is needed in order to make this possible. The new situation warrants a reassessment of international approaches to conflict resolution. In order to function effectively  our Organization needs a wider communality of views. Decisions on important issues should be made by consensus. A basis for such communality already exists. It is the Charter of the United Nations and strict respect for all its provisions by all nations  whether big or small  aligned  neutral or non-aligned.Today  in the light of recent experiences  nobody should deny that international problems can be treated and solved in negotiations between the parties concerned. Nobody should deny that the United Nations can also be helpful in making such negotiations possible. Nobody must forget that the United Nations  in the Charter  has set universally accepted principles for all States  and in fact has enjoined States to settle their disputes if possible through negotiations. Dialogue and negotiations constitute the very essence of an orderly conduct of international affairs.The results achieved this year are encouraging. For example  I pay tribute to the successful efforts made with great patience in dealing with the situation in Afghanistan. The services rendered by the United Nations in this matter have been crucial. Many uncertainties remain regarding the future of Afghanistan  hut the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the return of the refugees  together with a broad programme of humanitarian assistance  should make it possible for the people of Afghanistan to resume building its own future in peace.The cease-fire worked out between Iran and Iraq is a major achievement  both by the parties and the United Nations. After years of bloodshed a cessation of hostilities was negotiated on the basis of a resolution adopted by the Security Council  This achievement would not have been possible without the universally appreciated peace-making efforts of the Secretary-General. In the negotiations on a final settlement of the conflict every effort should be made to work our solutions acceptable to all.We have followed with keen interest the negotiations concerning the problems in south-western Africa and the process of independence for Namibia. Not only the peoples concerned  but the whole world community  are anxious to see further concrete results emanate from these negotiations. The progress made so far is promising  and it is to be hoped that the ongoing negotiations will  without delay  lead to independence for Namibia and to a durable solution in the area. Meanwhile  the world community is also entitled to react appropriately to the intolerable situation that continues to prevail in both Namibia and South Africa.In South Africa the apartheid system remains fundamentally unchanged. Finland unequivocally condemns the apartheid system as an abhorrent violation of human rights and human dignity. The need for concerted international pressure on South Africa to change its policies remains. There can be no compromise on the principle of the equality of every human being or on the need to have that principle observed in practice. As a response to the inhumane racial policies of South Africa  Finland  together with the other Nordic countries  is now implementing the third common Nordic Programme of Action against Apartheid. Full economic and other sanctions are already in operation. We are now concentrating on additional measures  trying in particular to work for wider sanctions  including mandatory sanctions to be instituted by the Security Council and for increased international assistance to the front-line States of southern Africa.The continuing stalemate in the long-standing conflict of the Middle East is in striking contrast with events in other parts of the world. No immediate solution is in sight. Violent developments in the occupied territories underscore the need for a speedy solution to the conflict. The basis for a solution is there. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  as well as the right of the Palestinians to self-determination  must form the basis for a final solution. Likewise  progress is not possible without recognition by Israel and the Palestinians of each other's rights. An international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations constitutes the best way to achieve a negotiated settlement. The convening of such a conference  which is almost universally desired  is long overdue.It is not difficult to find other examples of problems in respect of which patient work carried our within the framework of the United Nations deserves to be rewarded with success. Where spectacular success has not yet been possible the role of the United Nations has often remained one of helping to keep the precarious peace or of continuing to encourage and facilitate a political dialogue.My country is always willing to support such work. By providing personnel for the United Nations good-offices mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan and for the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group  Finland tries to do its part in helping to implement the agreements reached this year under United Nations auspices. Finnish soldiers are now serving the United Nations in all the ongoing peace-keeping operations. We are ready for the next one  the one we had expected would have begun many years ago  namely to help in Namibia's quick transition to independence.	.My observations do not mean that Finland is in every respect satisfied with the experience gained heretofore in United Nations peace-keeping efforts. The use of military personnel contributed on a voluntary basis by various countries for peace-keeping in the service of the United Nations is intended primarily as a temporary measure. Its purpose is to create better conditions for the political task of peace-making. Yet we have seen that too often the United Nations troops have become the guardians of a status quo in which no meaningful political progress is taking place.A better common understanding of the basic goals and principles of peace-keeping is needed. The United Nations peace-keeping activities should be put on a secure financial and political basis. A comprehensive review of peace-keeping is now called for. In that process the need for sufficient financial reserves for peace-making and peace-keeping should also be dealt with. This is more urgent than ever now when the lack of financial predictability threatens the very launching of peace-keeping operations. For Finland  as a major contributing country  this is of special significance.Finland welcomes the progress made in the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States that has led to agreement on the elimination of their land-based intermediate-range and shorter-Â·range nuclear missiles. We look forward to concrete results in the continuing negotiations with regard to the reduction of long-range strategic nuclear weapons. We would also hope that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)  which is now meeting at Vienna  would soon agree on a continued and enlarged process of confidence-building and disarmament in Europe.Disarmament has become one of the principal concerns of the Organization. Finland took the third special session devoted to disarmament very seriously. We made a number of proposals and worked hard for them and for a successful outcome of the session itself. We regret that it was not possible to reach consensus on a comprehensive concluding document. However  a number of important initiatives were introduced at the session  and the collective efforts of Member States with regard to disarmament must continue.In order to promote disarmament. Member States should be willing and able to use the agencies and organizations in the United Nations family more effectively. The multilateral approach is necessary if we want to have an effective ban on chemical weapons  if we want to monitor nuclear testing everywhere  and if we want to make more progress in the urgent task of limiting conventional weapons. In our opinion the United Nations could also usefully assume an increasing role in the field of verification of compliance with disarmament and arms-control agreements that have been concluded.Verification is tantamount to the collection of information and the comparison of that information with certain pre-established rules and standards. Such tasks are already successfully handled by certain agencies in the United Nations system. In the security field relevant experiences have been gathered  for example by observers on peace-keeping missions. The systematic collection of data related to the verification of agreements in the disarmament field could be a logical step in expanding the useful functions of the Secretariat. I have now spoken mainly of the political tasks of the Organization  of the management and settlement of disputes. The magnitude of the work performed by the United Nations appears even more striking when the activities pertaining to economic and social issues and human rights are also taken into account. My country will continue to do its share in those United Nations activities as well.Combating the ever-increasing degradation of the environment will be one of the greatest challenges to mankind during the coming decades. The state of the environment will not be improved unless the detrimental consequences of human activities are not systematically taken into account. That is one of the central ideas of the concept of sustainable development discussed in depth during the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. It is necessary that the work already started towards sustainable development within the United Nations system by intensified. Finland's strong belief in multilateralism has been repeatedly stated. Only global multilateral efforts can help us to bridge the dangerously wide  and widening  gap between rich and poor. Environmental and developmental concerns make us focus on the interrelated problems where multilateral co-operation  and especially the United Nations  has a decisive role to play. We need a strong and effective United Nations system  with all its components  if we are to succeed.We expect that the process of reforming the economic and social structures of the United Nations will be continued so that concrete results are achieved. That is an essential element in the process of restructuring the United Nations as a whole in order to improve its ability to meet present and future challenges.The future of world economic development is closely related to the creation of -a better environment for world trade. We are convinced that the negotiations in the context of the Uruguay Round and the work carried on by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UMCTAD) will enhance possibilities for a better external environment in the field of trade  which will be beneficial to both developing and developed countries and to their peoples. A positive development is the entry into force of the Common Fund for Commodities  which will give a new impetus to the important worn of UNCTAD in this area.As the 1990s approach  the international community should consider comprehensive measures which take into account the changing circumstances in the international economic environment. The debt crisis affects us all. Renewed emphasis on such development objectives as poverty reduction  population policies and environmentally sustainable development is called for. At the same time  an assessment of the relationship between domestic policies and international support measures is required. Consideration at this session of the preparation and elaboration of an international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade offers an opportunity to that end. It is a challenge to the whole international community which Finland  for its part  is ready to take up.Over the past years Finland has been one of the few industrialized countries that have rapidly and substantially increased the volume of their aid. The budget proposal for 1989 now before our Parliament contains appropriations for official development assistance representing 0.7 per cent of our gross national product. Thus  Finland will reach the target set by the United Nations.The United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990 was reviewed just before the beginning of this session. Finland has actively supported the United Nations Programme and has continued to stress the importance of the development of African agriculture  measures against drought and desertification  human resources development and policy reforms. The necessary domestic structural adjustment measures in Africa can be sustainable when complemented by external assistance in a spirit of partnership.Some two thirds of Finnish bilateral assistance is directed towards African countries. Compared with the 1986 figures  Finland's assistance to the programme of multilateral financing institutions benefiting Africa has more than tripled this year. In the future too  sub-Saharan countries will remain major recipients of Finnish development assistance. Continued stress will be placed on co-operation with the countries of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference.The costs of the United Nations are not high. I will not repeat the various comparisons that have been made with the costs of other human activities. Nor will I attempt to calculate the usefulness of the United Nations in quantitative terms. Finland demands efficiency in the administrative and financial functioning of the Organization. We pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his implementation of administrative reforms. We realize that the cutting of costs may sometimes lead to improved overall performance. However  regardless of the level established in any given year for the United Nations budget  there are certain principles regarding the financing of our joint undertaking that in our view must always be respected by all.The United Nations Charter is a treaty between sovereign States  which have agreed to abide by certain obligations. Among these are rules that specify how decisions are taken and how costs are shared. The United Nations may sometimes have implemented programmes that Finland has not supported  but we have never doubted that it is our legal obligation to contribute our share to cover the costs of all legally established programmes. In our view  assessed contributions should be paid in full and on time. The unilateral withholding of contributions undermines multilateral co-operation.Despite some positive signs in the financing of the Organization  the United Nations continues to operate with inadequate income. The Secretary-General has appealed to Member States in order to secure the financing of United Nations activities. He is  in particular  referring to the new challenges that the Organization is facing in peace-making and peace-keeping. If additional expenses have to be met  Finland  for its part  will be prepared to participate in joint action to help.It is clear to my Government that by its work the United Nations continues to demonstrate its usefulness every day. We need the world Organization. It is only logical that my country  for its part  wants to be useful to the Organization and thereby help to serve the needs of Member States. The Finnish Government continues to pledge its allegiance to the Charter and to joint efforts to promote the vital objectives of our Organization. That we can best do by pursuing our long-standing policy of neutrality and by a consistent search for reconciliation  dialogue and negotiation. That  then  is the Finnish credo in this forum.The General Assembly is embarking on its work on a positive note. Let it demonstrate that the world community is united in the search for peaceful co-operation and dialogue. Let it become testimony that Member States want to see the United Nations effective and strong  and to assume responsibility for it. "
"50",2368,"FJI",43,1988,"ï»¿It is a pleasure  Sir  for my delegation to see you presiding over the forty-third session of the General Assembly. We are certain that with your experience in international affairs and your personal qualities you will lead and guide our work with skill and diplomacy. We congratulate you on your election and assure you of our fullest support and co-operation.Our thanks go also to His Excellency Mr. Peter Florin  who so ably guided the work of the forty-second session. The year 1988 and the forty-third session of the General Assembly will probably go down as the most momentous in the history of the United Nations. Perhaps never since its founding has the Organization played such a dramatic role in conflict resolution  and that at a time when it faced the most acute financial crisis of its life. The Secretary-General and his staff deserve our highest praise for their tireless  painstaking efforts. We are confident that they will be rewarded even more for their work before the final gavel falls at the closure of the forty-third session in September next year.The cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq on 20 August last after one of the longest wars of the century - and perhaps the bloodiest - brings relief to two embattled nations and their peoples. My delegation hopes that the peace process currently under way will lead to a lasting solution to the differences which separate those two proud nations. Peace between there will mean so much less turbulence in a region important to the economic and political stability of the world.As is evident from the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq brought about through the patient mediation of the Secretary-General  the United Nations can play a major and positive role in conflict resolution. The cessation of hostilities in the Gulf war was not the first success of the initiatives undertaken by the Secretary-General within a period of a few months. Before that came the accord that led to the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. Those developments prove that  irrespective of the numerous resolutions the General Assembly might adopt  there can be little hope of resolving conflicts without accompanying positive steps towards mediation. The intervention and good offices of a third party with no motive other than the promotion of international peace and security  appear to constitute an acceptable avenue. The United Nations  through the good offices of the Secretary-General  is the third party which  as has been proved  can play that vital role most effectively.My delegation is confident that the best of intentions will continue to be displayed by both parties in the Iran-Iraq conflict during the peace negotiations and that they will soon establish the basis for a just and acceptable long-term solution to their differences. Likewise  we also hope that the parties to the Afghanistan accord will do nothing to jeopardize the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan.Let us hope that progress towards peace in those two areas will impel the parties involved in conflicts elsewhere to accept the good offices of the Secretary-General to help resolve their differences. The signs are favourable in Namibia  Cyprus and Western Sahara. We urge all the parties concerned not to allow the opportunity to pass  but rather  using the Afghanistan and Iran-Iraq settlements as beacons  to add momentum to mankind's most cherished hope of a peaceful world. We are certain that the Secretary-General  who has an open mandate from all Member States to denote international peace and security  will be ever willing  ready and available to use his good offices in the cause of peace. For small countries like my own  one way of demonstrating our commitment to the ideals of the United Nations is to contribute to peace-keeping operations. We are pleased to note that some countries which had withheld payments for many years are now meeting their commitments. Regrettably  a major contributor has become a defaulter. We urge all Member States not to cripple the Organization at a time when it is poised to make its most significant contribution to peace and security since its founding. Here I should like to reiterate that my country will continue to support the United Nations in all its peace-making and peace-keeping endeavours. We shall continue to contribute troops  as we do to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the United Nations Good Offices Mission for Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNGOMAP) and to any other peace missions which might arise. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is a fitting tribute to the Organization and the various troop-contributing countries  including my own.The events in Fiji last year which necessitated a review of our constitutional basis retrains a major preoccupation for us. We are grateful for the support which many countries have expressed for our efforts to devise a solution relevant to our circumstances. As those familiar with our part of the world will know  we are determined to pursue a course of action which will be fair and just to all our people.The Interim Government has pursued two major objectives since it took office on 5 December 19Î7. Those objectives are the reconstruction of the economy and the preparation of a new constitution. On 15 September 1988 the Interim Government released the eagerly awaited draft constitution  which contains guarantees for the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms  including protection of the right to life and personal liberty; protection from slavery and forced labour protection from inhuman treatmentÂ·  protection from deprivation of propertyÂ·  protection for privacy of homes and other property  protection of freedom of conscience  freedom of expression  freedom of assembly and association and freedom of movementÂ·  and protection from discrimination on the grounds of race or religion. It is envisaged that a consensus will emerge on the draft constitution  enabling the Interim Government to fulfil its promise to hold a general election within two years of taking office - that is before the end of 1969.Fiji is a multiracial country  where all ethnic groups live in harmony without any systematic harassment. We will never institutionalise racism  as was alleged recently. At the same time it is vital that the needs and fears of the indigenous community be addressed if long-term peace and stability are to be assured. We need to take affirmative action as a matter of urgency to ensure that the indigenous community does not become an underprivileged minority in its own country.The issue of decolonization still occupies a prominent place on the Assembly's agenda every year. There are now only a few colonial Territories left. We remain fully committed to the principle of self-determination for all the colonized peoples. The option of which choice to accept must be left to the people. Once they have made their decision the administering Power and the international community Rust respect their choice and assist in the implementation of their decision.Among the few Non-Self-Governing Territories now remaining  none is of greater international concern than Namibia  which is being illegally occupied by the minority racist regime of South Africa. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) provides the basis for the just settlement of the Namibian question and we would like to see it implemented in its totality. The agreement reached last month is a positive and welcome sign and the international community must now use all its endeavours to give it momentum  so that the people of Namibia may be granted their inalienable right to self-determination and independence. The good offices of the Secretary-General may be vital in the pursuance and achievement of that goal.On the opposite side of the world there is another people yearning for self-determination. There  too  we now see more hope than was evident a few months ago. My Government welcomes the positive measures that the new Government of France has adopted in its policy towards New Caledonia. The reopening of dialogue with the people of the Territory has resulted in the formulation of a timetable for a genuine act of self-determination.It was with cognisance of those positive developments that my delegation  with the full support of other South Pacific Forum members  put forward a resolution on the question of New Caledonia which the Special Committee on decolonization adopted by consensus. That same resolution will come before the General Assembly. We believe it reflects the developments now taking place. It is positive and constructive in language and forward-looking in scope. We are confident that the General Assembly  taking note of the current situation in the Territory  will also adopt the resolution by consensus.The reunification of the two Koreas remains the hope of the people of both those countries  ardently supported by much of the international community  but it can become a reality only given the determination of both parties to resolve outstanding difficulties. Until that happens my Government sees no reason why either erne should be denied its rightful place in this Organization. We support the admission of both North Korea and South Korea as full Members of the United Nations pending reunification. For the present  however  if one is unable or unwilling to take its seat  the other should not be penalized by being prevented from joining the Organization.While some positive developments give us reason to be hopeful  my Government once again voices its strong support for the Kampuchean people in their struggle to restore peace and stability to their war-torn country. The independence and territorial integrity of Kampuchea must be restored and this can coma about only through the withdrawal of all foreign forces. The people of Kampuchea have a rightful claim to peace and security. While problems and conflicts between countries can be resolved through mediation  nothing can restore dignity and equality to a people who are oppressed by a regime which is bigoted in its thinking and dogmatic in its policy. The minority regime in South Africa continues to fly in the face of international opinion and persists with its policy of apartheidÐ Regrettably  it is emboldened in pursuing its oppressive racist policy because some influential Member States lack the political will to apply appropriate pressure. If all Member States that strongly condemn and abhor the policy of apartheid had exerted consistent and firm pressure on the Botha regime  the oppression of the majority in South Africa would not have gone on for so long. If the international community continues to vacillate and not take effective measures against the apartheid regime  it must accept the responsibility when the volcano of suppression erupts. That day does not appear to be far away. Let us therefore act collectively and effectively so that bloodshed and violence can be avoided.The easing of tensions and the resolution of regional conflicts has been given a greater impetus by the recent improvement of relations between the two super-Powers  leading to enhanced prospects of a more lasting peace through arras reduction. But much more remains to be achieved if the world is to be spared the scourge of another war. If the world is to be saved for succeeding generations  the elimination of nuclear weapons must remain our principal concern and steadfast goal. Until agreement can be readied on this score  however  we believe that the time has come to cease all nuclear testing. In this regard  my delegation condemns in the strongest possible terms the continued testing of nuclear devices in the South Pacific region  which  under the Treaty of Rarotonga  has been declared a nuclear-weapon-free zone. We urge Prance to respect that Treaty and desist from defiling our part of the world. We would go further and urge the three nuclear-weapon States - Britain  France and the United States - which have not yet done so to accept and sign the Protocols t  the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty.The impact of the continuing international financial turmoil has a particularly devastating effect on the third world  and more so on island developing countries such as ray own. The vulnerability of such States means that when the world economy is healthy we are unable to take full advantage of the boom. But when conditions are difficult we suffer the greatest penalty. The escalating debt crisis  worsening of the terms of trade and rising protectionism will mean a grimmer future unless comprehensive steps are taken to cushion their impact on the developing world. Much is made of partnership between developed and developing  but this has to be reflected in more equitable policies and a greater willingness to share.Through its numerous social and economic programmes the United Nations has given dignity and self-respect to millions of people in every corner of the world. Now it is embarked on a major task - to improve international peace and security. Yet the Organization is faced with a worsening financial crisis which today is more critical than it has ever been in its 43-year history. Every Member State has the right to criticize the Organization  to point out its shortcomings  to ask for reforms and greater cost-effectiveness. But no Member State should expect to be able to exercise that right when it does not honour its financial obligations.The Organization continues to face a critical financial situation. Repeated requests by the Secretary-General for timely and full payment of assessed contributions continue to go unheeded  taking the Organization nearer to the brink of bankruptcy. We support and join the Secretary-General in his plea to all Member States to honour their financial obligations under the Charter. The United Nations has long been accused of being ineffective. The events of the last few non the prove that when Member States show the will to support it the Organization can play an important role in helping to build a more peaceful and better world. Let us therefore give it the support it deserves. Let us make it an Organization to be proud of and one under whose aegis we can build a better world for our children."
"51",2415,"FRA",43,1988,"ï»¿I begin by paying tribute to the wisdom of the members of the General Assembly at its forty-third session  who  in electing you President  Sic  have made clear both the deservedly high esteem in which they hold you and the prominent place held by Argentina and  beyond Argentina  by Latin America in today's world.I wish to add that I deeply appreciate the great honour of having this opportunity to address the Assembly again.Having just learned  as the Assembly has  the news about the Nobel Peace Prize  I wish immediately to convey my congratulations to the United Nations on the award of the Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces.When I came to this rostrum five years ago the world was dominated by the East-West confrontation  the proliferation of regional conflicts  the deepening of the gulf between North and South and repeated violations of human tights and the rights of peoples. Have those realities now disappeared? Is our planet decisively turning towards unity and peace? I shall not claim that that is so. In spite of the passing years  I seem to hear too often the same words  the same vain incantations  and to see too often the same hopes being aroused only to end in the  same disillusionment. The expectations of too many peoples remain unfulfilled. Two centuries after the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen there are still many Bastilles to be taken  many liberties to be won  many rights to be safeguarded. But here and there some progress is being seen. What had seemed for ever immovable has begun to move. Will hope come into its own again in the society of men?We know how much we owe to Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev  who have had the intelligence and the courage to have done with the arms race and the escalations of confrontation.Similarly  the adversaries engaged in some regional conflicts - whether they have taken stock of the limits of their action and the attrition of their strength  have changed their appraisal of their people's interests  or have wanted to contribute to the general movement towards the easing of tensions - are trying to disengage themselves from the tragedy they have been living through.I wish to express my gratitude to peace-loving men and women everywhere who have worked ceaselessly to bring about such a result. Among them I should mention the name of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Perez de Cuellar. Without his skill  his persistence  his constant readiness to serve and his cultural resources  we should not have come this far.For the first time since the last World War the two greatest Powers have begun to explore the path of disarmament. It must be stated that their agreement on the elimination of United States and Soviet intermediate forces in Europe is a good agreement. On behalf of France  I unhesitatingly approved it from the very first day. It is now my expectation that the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will make progress in the reduction of their strategic nuclear armaments  as they have planned to do. If the negotiations they are conducting lead to agreements consistent with the imperative rules of balance and verification this will do much to strengthen the security of all.These questions are  of course  of tremendous importance. But it will be readily understood that  as the head of a European State  I attach priority to the reduction of the conventional armaments which are stockpiled in Europe  and stockpiled unequally  to the disadvantage of Western Europe. It is my earnest hope that the 35 participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will take up the substance of these negotiations as soon as possible.We have been offered an opportunity  unprecedented in the past half century  to ensure the establishment of a stable balance at a lower  sufficient and reasonable level of armaments. Will this balance be achieved? That will depend on the political will of the States involved. But who could assume the responsibility of rejecting this chance out of hand?The objective is easy to formulate: that everyone should be able to defend himself  as is his right  without threatening anyone else. But how shall we go about this? I venture to suggest some elements of an answer.First  by ensuring that no army and no coalition of armies in the area where East and West are facing each other has the means for the sudden launching of a surprise attack  nor for waging a prolonged war. To that end  it would be desirable to arrange measures in that area for the reduction  withdrawal and de-concentration of troops and equipment - tanks  armoured vehicles  artillery  portable bridges and all other techniques for crossing water barriers - and measures for the limitation of reserves and stockpiles.Secondly  by preparing procedures for verification and inspection to prevent any violation of treaties. These new measures of transparency and confidence would usefully supplement the arrangements arrived at in Helsinki.My country has taken a number of initiatives concerning the definition of the area in which these constraints would be applied  the ratio between new military equipment and foreign equipment and the ceiling to be set on the basis of an individual country in relation to the whole. It would also be my wish that at the end of the next two years the status of negotiations should be examined. If nothing had been achieved  there would be nothing to prevent people from exercising their freedom. However  a favourable outcome would open vast new prospects for the future of Europe. All of us  Europeans both in the East and in the West  belong to the same continent and derive our heritage from the same culture. History and geography invite us patiently to overcome  by every possible means  for the security of all  the confrontation of hostile blocs.As for chemical weapons  whose ravages we have unfortunately observed in the recent past  we must eliminate them as quickly as possible. What President Reagan said last Monday about this subject was quite right. He expressed himself in lofty and urgent terms  which echoed our own concerns  and in a manner that is all the more timely because his country possesses such weapons. 1 noted with equal interest that the Soviet Union  which also possesses chemical weapons  had supported this proposal.The proposals put forward by France  which has no chemical weapons  are of three Hinds. First of all  my country  the depositary of the Geneva Protocol of 1325  naturally favours a meeting of the 110 signatories to that agreement. The purpose of such a meeting  in our view  would be to solemnly reaffirm the commitment not to use chemical weapons  to prevent their proliferation to encourage new accessions to the Protocol  to improve investigative procedures - in short  to indicate a common desire for the success of the work currently being carried out at Geneva within the context of the Conference on Disarmament. .Secondly  my country wants to increase the role of the United Nations in the struggle against the proliferation and the use of chemical weapons. In 1982 Prance was the originator of the resolution enabling the Secretary-General to arrange investigations in those parts of the world where chemical weapons had reportedly been used. This procedure has already confirmed that such weapons have in fact been used. Let us go further: let us create a situation that would make it impossible for any State to use chemical weapons with impunity to settle its external or internal problems. If any State should use them  I think it would become necessary  among other measures  to impose an embargo on all deliveries of products  technologies and  more generally  weapons to that State. For its part  France is ready  after consultation with its partners  to submit a draft resolution to this effect. This would be without prejudice to any sanctions decided upon by the Security Council.The third and last point is the one I particularly wish to stress: we must prohibit not only the use of chemical weapons but also their manufacture. The risks of the normalization and the proliferation of chemical weapons compel us to accelerate our efforts to bring about the destruction of stockpiles  as well as to maintain close supervision of the means that would make it possible to rebuild them.In signing the convention  each State possessing stockpiles of chemical weapons would undertake to destroy them. In the view of experts  this will take several years  and in the meantime the chemical threat will continue to exist. This is why I believe that chemical-weapons factories should be closed as soon as the convention enters into force and  like stockpiles  should bÂ© subjected to international surveillance before they are dismantled. France declares its readiness  as of this moment  to renounce under the same conditions - that is to say  as soon as the future convention enters into force - any possibility of producing chemical weapons.0Â£ course  the banning of chemical weapons could not be imposed on some if others  including the nuclear Powers  retained a clear field for themselves and did not persevere in their desire for nuclear disarmament.In this connection  I recall that in September 1983  speaking from this rostrum  I stated the conditions under which my country would agree to participate  at the proper time  in a nuclear-disarmament conference among the Powers that possess nuclear weapons: a decisive narrowing of the gap between the arsenals of the great Powers and our ownÂ·  a halt in the anti-missile  anti-satellite and anti-submarine weapons race; and correction of the Imbalances In conventional armaments. Today I maintain what I said at that time.I would add that limiting the disarmament effort must be extended to space  the common heritage of mankind. That is why France is opposed to an arms race in space but supports the use of space-borne means of control.Before the INF treaty  the importance of which is becoming more apparent every day  and the on-site verification for which it provides - a clause the Importance of which can never be over-emphasized - disarmament negotiations had stalled over this problem. At the special session of the United Nations last June - the third special session devoted to disarmament - my country advocated control by satellite and by automatic surveillance  as well as the so-called routine or challenge on-site inspections. We can now define  on a case-by-case basis  a combination of means of control adapted to each disarmament agreement. But nothing can be done without the political will of States.Coming now to regional conflicts  I can only welcome the developments in the Gulf  what has been initiated in Afghanistan  and what is expected in the Western Sahara  Cambodia and  perhaps  Cyprus. This is the easier for me because France has always refused to recognize the fait accompli  has ceaselessly condemned terrorist or military intimidation  and has tirelessly pleaded for settlement of conflicts by peaceful means. Far be it from me to underestimate the scope of the progress made in the past few months. I have noted  however  that while the rapprochement between the United States and the Soviet Union has contributed to the cessation of fighting  it remains insufficient to restore lasting peace  for the underlying causes persist. In this connection  I have noted that this period of diplomatic calm has not reached several parts of the globe; the Middle East  Central America  despite the Arias Plan and the action of the Contadora and Lima Groups  which France supports; and  while there may be some respite now and again  southern Africa  a direct consequence of the intolerable policy of apartheid.It is the responsibility of the international community to consolidate what has been achieved and help extinguish the last retraining pockets of violence. When weapons have fallen silent  so much will remain to be done agreements to guarantee  wounds to staunch  adversaries to reconcile  economies to be rebuilt.It will do no good to shower the work and the person of the Secretary-General with praise  if we are going to withhold our support from him tomorrow. For peace has its prices sending armed troops there  organizing a referendum here  and elsewhere setting up aid for reconstruction. All this has to be financed. I would hate to think that after being so lavish in their war efforts  States  particularly the most powerful  would be tight-fisted when it comes to peace efforts.In Afghanistan no one can ever be satisfied with replacing an international conflict by a civil war. The withdrawal of foreign troops should normally open up the way for the restoration of the sovereignty of that country  the return of refugees and economic reconstruction. But this can only come about with extreme vigilance.It is my wish that the cease-fire between Iraq and Iran will lead  as quickly as possible  to a genuine peace  a settlement of conflicts  the reconstruction of  disaster-stricken areas and the restored freedom of navigation in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.Peace is contagious and everyone  the States and the peoples of the region  will reap the benefits. At this time  how can we be unmindful of the fate of a minority which has suffered in a two-fold way  such as the Kurdish people? I hope that renewed conciliation in Western Sahara will prevail. We could believe it today. This will remove an obstacle to the construction of the Greater Maghreb  bringing with it peace and prosperity  a plan of which Prance approves. Here we count upon the wisdom of leaders.In the Middle East  the uprising of Palestinian youth and the decision of King Hussein of Jordan have shown once again that the status quo no longer protects those who are subject to it  those who seek to benefit from it  and that it is increasingly deadly for those who are subjected to it.Let us go back to the basic principles of a lasting settlement  as defined by the United Nations. All members are familiar with them. For my part  I outlined them both in the Knesset in Jerusalem and in the Arab capitals. Israel has the right to exist within safe and recognized borders; the Palestinian people are entitled to aspire to a homeland and to take charge of their own destinies.In order to arrive at a peace settlement  which would enshrine these rights  there must be dialogue between the parties. Each side  Israelis and Palestinians  must do its share. Each must be willing to accept for the other what it demands for itself  and each must be able to say this in no uncertain terms. I do understand how difficult it is to take the first step.In order to facilitate dialogue and break down the walls of distrust  the international community must clearly act as an intermediary. A procedure exists: the international conference. It is the only framework within which teal partners can meet and establish bilateral contacts between them. The international conference has become a reference point. Let us make it a reality. I proposed some time ago that a preparatory committee earnestly go about laying the groundwork. Mr. Gorbachev was in agreement with me on this idea. Now the time has come to revive this. I suggest that a diplomatic arrangement be made among the five permanent Members of the Security Council in conjunction with the Secretary-General. This preparatory work should result in recommendations on the organization and calendar of the future conference and recommendations about who its participants will be.France  of whose ties to Lebanon need not remind the Assembly  will not resign itself to watching that country's independence and unity disintegrate. We call upon the United Nations as a witness to the obstacles which have been placed in the way of the free exercise of the sovereignty of the people. We appeal to the sense of reason of the neighbours of that country. A peaceful  reconciled Lebanon is no threat to anyone. A Lebanon dismembered and the object of conflict and dispute will remain an area of insecurity for us all. Let us urge the Lebanese to draw upon their national pride and patriotism to summon the strength and courage to have faith in their country. I can assure the General Assembly  in any case  that France will remain at the side of those who  in mutual respect  are fighting for a democratic future for Lebanon  as well as its territorial integrity and sovereignty.Farther away  towards the Far East  an end to the sufferings of Cambodia is in sight. The decision announced by the Government of Viet Nam to end its intervention  the initiatives of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  the actions of such leaders as Prince Norodom Sihanouk may bring us closer to the hour of a political settlement. My country  which facilitated the initial meeting between the Cambodian partners  will continue to work even harder at this  and soon  I hope. We stand ready  if they so wish  to invite the parties involved to meet in Paris in due course.At this point in my address  I wish to tell the General Assembly that nothing seems more important to me  whatever the importance of the subjects I have touched upon this morning - disarmament and the settlement of regional conflicts - nothing  I stress  is more important to me than closing the ever-widening gap between developed and developing countries. The causes of this disparity  as the General Assembly knows  are many: political  social  economic  demographic  financial  and so on. They have become so serious that many are tempted to dismiss all remedies as futile. That is not the case with France. For seven years now - and I am certainly not the only one - I have been repeating that it is in the interests of the North to help the South; that there is no such thing as fate; that man can always master the course of events and that it is urgently necessary to do so. I see in the persistence of the current imbalances the most damaging cause of tremendous unhappiness  a misfortune which  more assuredly than any other danger  will drive the world towards the endless chaos of war  or something even worse.Nevertheless  International multilateral or bilateral aid is stagnating or receding. France - which  of all the industrially advanced countries  allocates the highest percentage of its gross national product to development aid - believes that it has not yet done its duty. The target of 0.7 per cent remains its ambition. In particular  the debt burden calls for immediate action. Î number of very Interesting Initiatives have been launched by one country or another. For ray part  I suggested to the major industrialized countries at their Toronto meeting this year that they make the terms of repayment considerably easier for the poorest countries. As for France  It has chosen to cancel one third of the debt owed to it by these countries. This significant step is but a beginning.For other heavily indebted countries  particularly In Latin America and Africa  debt also represents an intolerable burden  and in certain cases a threat to democracy. In the face of this situation the International community must show that it can be more realistic and more imaginative. All debts Incurred must be repaid  but the cost of this can be reduced without passing on the burden to the taxpayers of creditor countries.Thus  last year the United States  in a bold move  guaranteed a proportion of the principal of Mexico's commercial loans. Several countries and many experts have thought of creating a multilateral fund which would lower the cost by guaranteeing interest payments. Various methods of financing this fund have been put forward.In the view of France  the best technique would be to create a fund in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to guarantee the payment of interest charged on certain commercial loans converted into bonds. This fund would lower significantly the finance charges payable by debtor countries and would involve them more actively in world trade.In order to finance this  the developed countries would set aside their share of a new issue of special drawing rights for use by the developing countries. I realize that the implementation of this project would represent a significant legal and financial innovation. It would require lengthy preparatory work and many consultations among creditors and with their debtors. However  this alone would seem to be equal to the challenge.But development requires many other things.  I  would mention the following: stabilizing the export earnings of countries in the southern hemisphere and diversifying and increasing the value of their production - and the Uruguay Round must take these into account; environmental protection  which only a short time ago was endangered by industrial wastes from the North being disposed of in the South - and the international community will have to agree to regulations and the necessary precautions; a massive transfer of technology and know-how from the North to the South - and I would like in this regard to suggest a new approach  modelled on what is known as Europe's EUREKA project  in which Government stimulus  together with initiatives freely undertaken by companies and universities  leads to co-operation on an equal footing. I continue ray brief list: launching major programmes of universal interest which can mobilize our energies to bring help to regions facing catastrophes due to natural causes or the folly of men. I cite as an example the stabilization of the rivers that have been flooding Bangladesh  the cause of a terrible catastrophe  as an appropriate beginning for a project of this kind. France  for its part  is ready to contribute.Two centuries ago France began a revolution that changed the course of history throughout the universe. In doing so  France took a position in the battle which has yet to be won  and is still necessary  for a greater measure of freedom  equality and brotherhood. As we prepare to celebrate this bicentenary  let us defend human rights more fiercely than ever before  from the earliest recognized to the latest: human rights  the rights of peoples  the rights of mankind. Today  in certain emergency situations  in situations of distress or extreme injustice  we should affirm the right of humanitarian assistance.Economic and social progress is the only solid foundation on which to build democracy; the moral weight of public opinion and unflagging vigilance will be its best guarantee.So many people are still being denied their most elementary tights and for so many men  women and children poverty is the only world they know  and the absence of eights is their only horizon.Surely the time has come to acknowledge that rights of mankind exist and should be defined. I am thinking of the protection of our natural environment in the face of the sometimes irresponsible requirements of our economy. I was happy to hear the representative of the Soviet Union asking for a plan to be worked out before 1992 on this subject. I am also thinking of the protection of the human species  the ravages of drugs  and the extraordinary possibilities of science  in particular genetics. The conference of Nobel Prize-winners which I convened in 1988 in Paris elected us to the dangers of this. It is not knowledge in itself that is dangerous; it is rather the applications of science that must be controlled  that we must master. Since we are accountable in proportion to the power we now possess in transmitting a natural and genetically intact heritage to our descendants  we must lay the foundations for the ethics of the third millennium.I must stop here. Since  with you  I have been looking at the future  I dream of the day when Europe  as it is trying to take shape  will be able to speak here with a single voice  using  as I have just done  the language of peace among nations and confidence in the destiny of humanity."
"52",2483,"GAB",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of the Gabonese Government Sir  I offer you most cordial and heartfelt congratulations on your election to preside over the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that your experience  your long and praiseworthy career in international affairs  and the fact that you are a man of culture whose depth is recognized by all  augur well for a successful outcome to the session.I am also happy to take this opportunity to greet in you  Sir  the representative of a great country  the Argentine Republic  with which the Gabonese Republic  my country  has commendably close relations.I wish also to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Ambassador Peter Florin  your predecessor  for the outstanding way in which he guided the work of the forty-second session.The Gabonese delegation includes in these congratulations and tributes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. No praise is too high for his admirable initiatives and the action he has taken  aimed at calming tensions and securing the peaceful settlement of disputes  to give concrete form to the contribution of the United Nations  the strength of its principles and the soundness of its purpose of bringing about world peace and prosperity. Gabon continues to be dedicated to those fundamental principles of international life as set forth in the Charter  just as we reaffirm that our foreign policy  based on the permanent quest for solutions conducive to peace and development  manifestly serves noble causes.The work of this session is beginning at a turning-point in international relations  first with the commemoration this year of the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  an ideal common to all peoples and all nations  and  secondly  with the setting in motion of a process of ending regional conflicts and eventually securing their definitive settlement by peaceful means.On a number of occasions Gabon has emphasized that the establishment of the United Nations constituted a decisive phase in the history of the world and has expressed the hope that everything will be done to attain the goals and principles enshrined in the Charter in San Francisco. The fact that the Organization is contributing to the settlement or adjustment of conflicts by peaceful means demonstrates its ability to promote peace and international security. It is a source of satisfaction for m/ country to see the United Nations carrying out one of its missions in this way  thus earning the Nobel Peace Prize  which has been awarded to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. This is a fitting occasion to point out that this event received special attention from the President of Gabon  Mr. Omar Bongo  who addressed a special message of congratulations to the Secretary-General in this connection. How can we fail to express our satisfaction at the series of negotiations now going on in order to resolve the problems of the independence of Namibia; the frontier dispute between Chad and Libya  the Western Sahara and the Iran-Iraq conflict - to mention only those  we can only welcome the positive developments in each of those disputes  at the same time urging the concerned parties to show a spirit of open-mindedness and dialogue.The commemoration of World Namibia Day on 26 August last provided us with an opportunity to note with great interest the development of the situation in that part of Africa  which we believe is destined to achieve independence in the near future.Gabon welcomes the conclusion of the Geneva Accord providing for the withdrawal of South African troops from Angola and has been following with interest the modalities of its implementation  which  to be effective  require the consent of the parties concerned  particularly the front-line States. It was in that spirit that the President of the Republic of Gabon took the initiative of meeting  on 1 October this year  at Franceville in Gabon  with the Heads of State of Angola and Congo. There they discussed the question of the peace and security in Angola and the independence of Namibia  noted with satisfaction the positive development of the quadripartite talks which will shortly resume in Brazzaville and welcomed the efforts made by the People's Republic of Congo in order to secure the successful conduct of the negotiations. Further  they encouraged the parties to the negotiations to do their utmost to achieve a final agreement: as soon as possible  this being a prerequisite for lasting peace in the subregion. Without any doubt  such Ð° meeting augurs well for the implementation of the provisions of the Geneva Accord  the purpose of which is to organize free elections  under United Nations supervision  in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The entry into force of the cease-fire in southern Angola aid on the Namibian border  in accordance with the provisions recently accepted by the parties  confirms the positive role which they have played.While we therefore welcome developments in southern Africa  we must remember that southern Africa consists of more than just Namibia. The problem of apartheid is more than a source of concern in that part of the continent and it remains as grave as ever. Apartheid is considered a crime against mankind  as it excludes from the exercise of power some 20 million blades  who are constantly the victims of aggression and torture and whose lives were always in danger. It is thus a factor of permanent insecurity in international relations. Far from being excessive  the description of apartheid as a crime against mankind is now clearly widely accepted by the international community. Recently  under the auspices of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  two meetings were held in Harare  in Zimbabwe - an international conference of children against apartheid and a symposium of persons involved in science  the arts and letters  to promote the survival and development of children in the front-line States. That double meeting was an opportunity to re-emphasise the indignation felt throughout the world at the atrocities and sufferings inflicted on the black majority in South Africa.At the Conference of Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries just held  in September  in Nicosia  representatives of States from all continents once again agreed on the wisdom of the description of apartheid as a crime against mankind and emphasised that its regime constitutes an insult to the universal conscience. The United Nations must attach prime importance to that judgement by the Non-Aligned Movement and find within itself the resources to meet this historic challenge. The frontier dispute between Chad and Libya has always been in the forefront of the concerns of Gabon  particularly since the Organization of African Unity conferred upon it in 1977 the mandate of chairmanship and entrusted it with the work of the Ad Hoc Committee of Mediation charged with finding ways and means of bringing about a settlement. The forty-second session of the General Assembly has already given roe the opportunity to report on the conclusions of the first summit meeting of that Ad Hoc Committee  held in Lusaka  Zambia  in September 1987. I now take pleasure in reporting that in fulfilment of the decisions taken at that time the second summit meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee met in Addis Ababa last May  during the twenty-fourth summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity. In accordance with a resolution adopted by that body  and on the invitation of the President of Gabon  the Foreign Ministers of Libya and Chad met at Libreville from 7 to 9 July last for the first time  it should be noted  since the outbreak of the conflict. The representatives of the two parties then broached  in a spirit of open-mindedness and candour  all questions which needed to be discussed in order to bring about an atmosphere of trust conducive to the normalization of their relations in spheres of common interest  particularly those of diplomacy and co-operation. The recent release by the authorities in Tripoli of Chadian prisoners  the recognition of the Ndjamena Government by Libya  affirmed here again by my Libyan colleague  and the recent decision by the two countries to restore diplomatic relations are the logical sequence to the meetings that I have described. We can only welcome these events and express our keen hope that the two parties  in good faith  will make whatever effort's are necessary to resolve all the questions still pending in accordance with the charter of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations Charter  in a spirit of fraternity and responsibility and in co-operation with the Ad Hoc Committee.With regard to Western Sahara  the Secretary-General's visit to Africa in February 1988 enabled him to focus attention on this issue. The decision taken at the forty-second session of the General Assembly by the Chairman of the OAU and the Secretary-General to send a technical mission to that region for fact-finding purposes and to secure acceptance by the two parties of the proposed United Nations peace plan  which provides for a cease-fire followed by a referendum on self-determination  is a source of satisfaction for my country. We follow this momentum for peace with particular attention  since it will lead to a climate of detente and co-operation in the inter-Maghreb zone.With regard to the Iran-Iraq conflict  my country wishes to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General and his Persons! Representative for their efforts to ensure the successful outcome of the Geneva negotiations aimed at finding a compromise satisfactory to the two parties in accordance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987). My delegation takes this opportunity to appeal most emphatically once again to those two brother countries to associate themselves fully and in good faith with the process for the settlement of this conflict that la new being pursued under United Nations auspices The situation in the Middle Beat  particularly recent developments in the occupied Arab territories  is a threat to international peace and security. That is why Gabon reaffirms and supports our organizationâs Insistence that any settlement of the Middle East crisis must necessarily Involve the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories occupied since 19671 de jure recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people; and recognition of the Palestinian right to the free exercise of their right to self-determination and  especially their right to their own State with internationally recognized borders.Gabon also endorses the holding of an international conference on peace in the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties concerned. Including the PLO.The situation in Lebanon causes us great concern in particular because of the excellent relations between Lebanon and Gabon. That is why we call upon all the parties concerned to put an end to this fratricidal struggle  and for an end to all the foreign interference that has caused the threat of partition to hang over that country.With regard to the situation in Afghanistan  Gabon endorses the principle of the right of the Afghan people to decide for itself the form of its own government and to choose its economic  political and social system without foreign Interference. My country welcomes all the efforts and initiatives that have resulted in the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghan territory  thus helping to bring about the political solution of the situation in that State.We are also convinced that the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea is a prerequisite for a just and lasting settlement of the problems of that country  which must regain its inalienable right to choose freely its political  economic and social system.The situation in the Korean peninsula is still deadlocked. Gabon  which is pleased to count both Koreas among its best friends  will support whole-heartedly any initiative aimed at the reunification of Korea. The agreement which the two Koreas have reached on the inclusion in the Assembly's agenda of an item entitled  ""Promotion of peace  reconciliation and dialogue in the Korean peninsula"" is an encouraging development and prompts us to urge them to persevere in their search for a negotiated solution  for a United Korea would be a guarantee of peace and stability in South-East Asia.The mounting tension in Central America is also a source of great concern to my country. Gabon reiterates its support for the Contadora Group and welcomes the additional contribution made by the Lima group  since these provide the framework necessary for dialogue and better mutual understanding in the region. In mentioning these various conflicts I intend only to highlight the commitment of the United Nations and various Member States  particularly the super-Powers  to reach a settlement with the increasing help of the Secretary-General.The third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  which was held in New York from 31 May to 24 June last  was preceded by the American-Soviet agreement on the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - in December 1987  demonstrated that the protagonists on the international scene are acting in keeping with the purposes and principles of the United Nations.Particularly meaningful in this general movement are the agreements that have been reached and the events that have taken place in the field of disarmament in the course of this year between the two super-Powers which will contribute to reinforcing detente in international relations. That is why my country welcomes with interest not only the American-Soviet agreement  but also the inclusion in the agenda of the current session of item 72  ""Review of the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security"".Gabon considers  in particular  that resolution 42/92  adopted at the previous session of the General al Assembly and containing a provision calling upon members of the Security Council to take appropriate and effective measures to turn Africa into a nuclear-free zone  deserves practical follow-up. It is specifically in this context that Gabon  concerned about the future of Africa  notes with alarm and is watching the compelling manoeuvres  both treacherous and illegal  directed towards making our continent the depository  the rubbish-bin  for the toxic wastes of the industrialized countries. The agreements entered into for this purpose between some African countries and multinational enterprises have quickly been revealed as fool 's bargains.Hence  at the roost recent summit meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Addis Ababa last May  such an operation was viewed as constituting a criminal act against Africa and African populations and that meeting recommended that member States of the OAU should participate in a working group to prepare a world convention to monitor trans-border carriage of harmful wastes.My country can all the more easily endorse that step because it has not responded to the various offers that have been extended to it to give all or any part of its territory to those new merchants of death for the purpose of storing their dangerous products. Similarly  it endorses any initiative that has been taken within the United Nations directed towards preparing an international convention on the transfer of waste. We are therefore pleased to see that this question has been included on the agenda of our work and we express the hope that the General Assembly will consider it with all due attention. For our part  we are convinced that the industrial development of Africa must not become counter-productive  in particular by destabilizing its ecological and human balances. Development must be achieved in security in order truly to be a bearer of peace.Hence  security and development ate interconnected. Disarmament and development are as well. This is a concern which  upon the initiative of our Governments  is being discussed in various international bodies  both at the world level and at the regional level. In this connection  my country approves the work that has been carried out by the Regional Centre of the United Nations for Peace and Disarmament in Africa  which met in LomÃ©  Togo  last February. It is easy to note that  beginning from our Organization and its own involvement  this wind of peace that is blowing throughout the world is dependent upon the will of the parties to conflicts themselves  and  generally speaking  upon the restored spirit of mutual trust in the conduct of current international relations.The work of the United Nations is not solely restricted to the political sphere. All Member States will agree in noting that the United Nations recently has been concerned at the particularly critical economic situation on the African continent. A number of its initiatives have led to the establishment  in December 1986  of a Steering Committee composed of the directors of United Nations agencies  as well as the establishment of an Advisory Group on Financial Flows to Africa. Each of these mechanisms is to recommend to the United Nations solutions which can limit the serious financial problems which our countries are experiencing.With regard to the Advisory Group on Financial Flows to Africa  the roost recent Conference of Ministers of the Non-Aligned Countries noted that it had estimated a yearly shortfall of approximately SS billion between the real needs of African countries and prospective contributions. On the basis of that estimate  the Conference felt that it should emphasize the urgent need to reduce that shortfall. It seems timely to me to point out that the economic situation in Gabon clearly deteriorated in 1986  just at a time when its fifth five-year plan  begun in 19Î¸4  had very nearly achieved its objectives. In the course of that difficult year  the average price of Gabonese oil  our main source of revenue  fell by more than one half  the slump of crude and the decline in the rate of the United States dollar being at the root of that movement. The outcome has been a drastic decline in our gross national product. This handicaps our development and prevents us from finding solutions to our ills. These include insufficient infrastructure in river transport and telecommunicationsÂ·  the use of migrant labour  which is expensive for the country  and the weakness of the agricultural sector  sharpened by the rural exodus.With regard to this last point  I should like to tell you that Gabon is able only to meet 20 per cent of its food needs itself. The remaining 80 per cent dangerously affects our balance of payments  resulting in insufficient savings and systematic recourse to loans in order to finance any projects  to such an extent that debt servicing is becoming ever more heavy.Here and now 1 should like to thank the authorities of the United Nations Development Programme which  in the course of its work in the Governing Council in Geneva  from 6 June to 1 July last  annulled Gabon's obligation to become a net contributor to reimbursing pre-financing of some of our projects. This evidence of attention and pragmatism on the part of international organizations towards our country constitutes assistance which we appreciate at its proper value.However  these are not the only reasons why we are concerned when we know that  between 1985 and 1987  the countries of sub-Saharan Africa paid the International Monetary Fund a net amount exceeding $2.2 billion and  as was noted in 1966 by the Executive Secretary of the United 'Nations Economic Commission for Africa  Mr. Adebayo Adedeji  the decline in commodity prices and debt servicing caused an outflow of capital at an amount of 334 billion while  at the same time  Africa received no more than 318 billion.The Final Declaration of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Geneva in July-August 1987 sheds a new light on our apprehensions in that  in view of the instability in export revenue from our commodities and the resultant vulnerability of the economies of our countries  UNCTAD is advocating a diversification of exports on the one hand and the preparation of studies of phenomena that impede such diversification. Despite a slight increase in commodity prices in 1983-1984  the unfavourable conditions that weighed on our markets since the beginning of the 1980s continued in 1985. The weakness of commodity prices in the course of recent years is due to the fact that despite increased supply of products  demand has hardly increased.With regard to debt  in order to avoid its increase  our countries have had to reduce imports and sums reserved for investment. Despite this  the debt of Africa exceeds $200 billion. The debt and its servicing  between 1984 and 1986  averaged 310 billion a year. The figure will exceed 315.5 billion between 1987 and 1989.In its 1988 report the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) emphasized that in sub-Saharan Africa the per capita gross national product had declined by 14 per cent in real terms between 19 80 and 1987  and said that this debt burden had destabilized internal economies by sharpening social conflicts and affecting expenditure on improving the human resources and material infrastructures essential for future development.These data  which were reported to the Society for International Development by Mr. Stephen Lewis  the former Permanent Representative of Canada to the United Nations and now the Secretary-General's Special Adviser in connection with the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990  revealed the extraordinary situation that our countries are confronting. That is why the member countries of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) defined a common position regarding the urgent convening of an international conference on African debt  since it is the aim of our countries to embark resolutely on the path of economic growth and development. The recent proposal of the Head of State of Gabon for a discounting of African countries' debts has the same objective.Taking all this into account  the Secretary-General has emphasized that the margin of manoeuvre available to Africa in the implementation of the Programme of Action has been reduced by an unfavourable financial climate. This justifies his conclusion that it is essential for the international community to act speedily to free additional financial resources and increase flexibility. I cannot conclude without referring to some social and cultural aspects of man's development in his dual dimension  individual and collective  which has been one of the concerns of our country  and  first and foremost  human rights  which cannot be forgotten this year as we commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Careful thought and the expedience gained regionally  nationally and internationally have convinced us that there can be no development without a policy of promoting and protecting human rights  just as there can be no promotion and protection of human rights without a peace policy.Gabon  a delegation which participated in the work of the meeting of the Governing Council of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in New York from 18 to 29 April 1988  greatly appreciates the recommendations made by that institution for overcoming the present particularly difficult economic situation. Among the measures proposed  the promotion of ""human adjustment""  which is designed to protect vulnerable groups while struggling effectively against the economic crisis  and the Bamako initiative  designed to lead towards the establishment of a self-help system with regard to medical assistance  enjoy our country's support.As UNICEF has indicated in its 1988 annual report  the mortality rate for children under 3 years of age remains very high  at approximately 174 per 1 000. My country is pursuing a social policy with the following objectivesÂ·  to contribute to protecting the family  children and youth; to participate in the fight against such major endemic social scourges as tuberculosis  leprosy  alcoholism  venereal diseases and diarrhoea  epidemics  mental illness and juvenile delinquency. In the context of this policy  vaccination  thanks to the expanded vaccination programme  carried out in our country with the assistance of UNICEF  had covered more than 50 per cent in 1987. Paediatricians noted five times fewer cases of measles than in previous years. Our country is pleased to see that UNICEFâs activities have found their place within the broader context of the Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. This satisfaction extends also to the recommendation made by the Governing Council of UNICEF that the needs and priorities of women are taken into account in all projects that receive its assistance.With regard to all these activities  Gabon would like to express its special gratitude to the United Nations for its pragmatism and effectiveness which certainly remains to be done. That is why I take this opportunity to assure the Assembly of my country's readiness to co-operate with the Organization so that together we may contribute to the progressive improvement of the social condition of mankind.At this moment  as we reaffirm our dedication to the purposes and principles of the United Nations  we must declare faithfully that we will do nothing that might impede their achievement. Let us commit ourselves to do our utmost to ensure that these words become a reality  that the Organization truly becomes an effective tool in the service of peace  freedom  security and justice - values which mankind has perhaps lost  but which it hopes to regain in order to recover its self-esteem.This is the message that I address to the representatives of other nations meeting in this Assembly  and the commitment that I reiterate on behalf of the President of the Republic  Mr. Hadj Omar Bongo  and the Government and people of Gabon as a whole. "
"53",2530,"GBR",43,1988,"ï»¿Sir  may I offer you my congratulations on taking up the presidency of the General Assembly and send my warm thanks to the outgoing President  the Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic.This has been a year of unprecedented natural disaster. No outsider can fully share the tragedy of the flooding in Bangladesh. The hurricane devastation in the Caribbean and Mexico has horrified us all. From South Asia  through Africa  to the Caribbean and even to the grain belt of America  we have seen destruction on a scale rarely equalled before.Last week I was in Africa. I went first to the Sudan. I saw there the devastation caused by the recent floods and the brave efforts of the Sudanese Government and people to cope with that crisis. I visited a refugee camp of 500 tents supplied by Britain  made in Malta. Alongside them were tents from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Nations from all over the world had come to Sudan's aid. The following day I flew to Kenya  where pictures of the famine and suffering in southern Sudan were front-page news in the Nairobi press.The tragedies that have been occurring this year are seen and felt by people in towns and cities around the globe  and the world community has responded with rarely equalled sympathy and generosity. My own country alone has this year contributed some Â£80 million to disaster relief around the world. The total contributed by the Western democracies is likely to have been at least 10 times that amount.These immediate natural disasters are a poignant reminder of the need to tackle an issue that is of longer term but crucial for us all; the health of our planet as a whole. Some of its present transformation is good. Its resources are being better used for the benefit of mankind. But other elements are leading to a progressive pollution of the land  the sea and the air.There has already been some disruption of natural patterns. Damage to the ozone layer  first identified by the British Antarctic Survey in 1985  caused instant international alarm. That concern has already led to agreement to limit the production of certain industrial chemicals.The possibility of climatic change caused by the increase in the greenhouse gases  leading to a global heat trap  has become a real concern. The increases predicted in global temperatures would have substantial effects  within the next few decades  on life and human society. Even small variations would have great consequences in a crowded world.We are totally dependent on climate. Damage it beyond repair  and the earth becomes a Lifeless desert spinning in space. We cannot leave a problem of this magnitude to technical bodies. Britain is among those who have pressed for a serious debate on the subject within the United Nations. Last year we welcomed the Brundtland report  the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. We want to carry forward its work. So we welcome the forthcoming discussion in the Second Committee. The problem must command an urgent place on the world agenda.It is in the face of natural disaster that we are made most vividly aware of the fragility and interdependence of human existence. Faced with the enormity of the difficulties  the speed and universality of response are extraordinary. Yet sadly  in the face of man-made disasters we have not so far been able to respond in such a United and effective way. Their causes are more complex  their effects are equally devastating  and they too demand our utmost and our urgent energy and ingenuity. This year we have broken the pattern of the past by applying the principles of the Charter to the resolution of a lengthy and bloody dispute  the conflict between Iran and Iraq.Each one of us here is committed  bindingly committed  to the Charter of the United Nations; not just to words on a page  but to fundamental principles ofÂ·' justice and international law. It was those principles that I had in mind when I spoke here a year ago at the height of the Iran-Iraq war. I said then: ""The blunt truth is that the way in which the United Nations handles the conflict between Iran and Iraq must have a decisive effect upon its reputation in the eyes of all the peoples whom we represent."" (A/42/PV.8  p. 58) I called then for a degree of unity which the international community had rarely been able to achieve  and a year later the scene that then seemed so dark and hopeless has been lighted by the united efforts of the international community.Many factors have helped to foster this change; the realization by Iran and Iraq that war to the death would mean mutual destruction the spirit and resolve of the Secretary-General and his dedicated staff; and  perhaps above all  the part played by the Security Council and its five permanent members.The permanent members are given a unique power under the Charter. That power  the power of veto  carries with it a special responsibility  a responsibility that has rarely been exercised. But the last year has witnessed the development of a new co-operation among the five. It began tentatively; it was pursued pragmatically; but it was born of principle as well as pragmatism  of a combined determination to do all we could together to bring an end to the devastation of a senseless war.  That determination  coupled with the skill  patience and persistence of the Secretary-General  culminated in the successful achievement of a cease-fire. Now the action has switched from the battleground to the negotiating table  from the banks of the Tigris to the banks of the East River. The Secretary-General must be allowed to build on the cease-fire so as to arrange the withdrawal of forces and the repatriation of prisoners of war. The framework for peace is Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  which provides for negotiations under the auspices of the Security Council. Britain will do all in its power to sustain the spirit of co-operation and to contribute to a peaceful settlement.If the international community can find a way forward on the dispute between Iran and Iraq it cannot ignore the plight of the Kurds  driven from their homes not by natural disaster but by unnatural force and brutality. The containment of conflict in one form must not lead to its prosecution in another.The charge that Iraq has used chemical weapons against the Kurds adds gravity to the situation. Under Security Council resolution 620 (1988)  the Secretary-General can conduct a prompt and independent inquiry. The need for such an inquiry is evident. The refusal of Iraq to co-operate in such an inquiry is all the more to be deplored  because the spread of chemical weapons is one of the most disturbing of recent developments.As more countries develop a chemical-weapons capability  the risk of the increased use of these weapons as an instrument of war and terror multiplies. It is for that reason that Britain has taken a lead in preparing an international convention for the world-wide suppression of chemical weapons and in pressing the crucial case for greater openness in this field. Nowhere is glasnost more necessary. At the special session in June I made important proposals to strengthen the international standards of the 1925 Geneva Protocol. So today I welcome President Reagan's proposal to reconvene the 1925 Geneva Conference to mobilize the international community behind the search for a convention on chemical weapons which would outlaw their use.Co-operation on the resolution of the Iran-Iraq conflict has been unique. But it must not be the only example of the constructive exercise of shared responsibility among the permanent members of the Security Council. There are grounds for hoping that will not be the case  for we have also been witnessing this year a change in the atmosphere which increases the scope for such co-operation.East-West relations themselves have moved on to a new footing. The Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - the Washington and Moscow summits and the Moscow Party Conference have all been remarkable in their separate ways.Perhaps just as significant has been the recent acknowledgement by Mr. Shevardnadze that foreign policy is no longer to be seen in Moscow as a special form of class struggle. ""The struggle between the opposing systems""  he said  ""is no longer a determining tendency of the present era"". I believe that most of the members of this Assembly will say ""amen"" to that. No longer  to paraphrase Clausewitz  need foreign policy be the continuation of class warfare by other means.Even so  progress on arms-control talks would not have been made without the constant and united determination of the members of the North Atlantic alliance. Of course we want to see success in the negotiations between Washington and Moscow for a reduction in strategic weapons  but we want to see early progress as well in cutting the conventional imbalances in Europe  which prejudice the security of millions of people. Arms-control negotiations no longer bear the full burden of East-West relations. They remain a vital component in the creation of a climate of confidence. So too does the search for a world-wide pattern of respect for human rights and freedom. In Europe we look for further progress in this regard from an early conclusion of the Vienna Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The fundamental principle  which we have long proclaimed and which Mr. Shevardnadze endorsed in his statement yesterday  is that the rule of law and the right of the individual to determine his own future are inseparable.More widely than that  if we can establish confidence in East-West relations we can harness energies which have too often pulled in different directions  and put them to constructive work. The place to do that is the United Nations.There are many tasks  many regional conflicts  but also growing signs that progress is possible.Recent developments over Afghanistan are one example. Eight years after its forces invaded Afghanistan the Soviet Union has finally begun to take them home. Over half have now left. This may well reflect a new realism in Moscow  but it is also a consequence of the courage and determination of the Afghan people and of the sustained and overwhelming support of this General Assembly. Tens of thousands of Afghans have died. Millions have been driven from their homes. That is why we now look forward to the complete and prompt withdrawal of Soviet troops. The Afghan people as a whole must then be given the chance to select a truly representative government by a genuine act of self-determination. Only then can Afghanistan start to live again.It is possible now to perceive as well that universal condemnation of Viet Nam's illegal occupation of Cambodia is also having its effect. Britain was among the first to insist that Viet Nam must withdraw from Cambodia unconditionally and quickly. Viet Nam cannot by itself sustain its occupation; its own economy is in ruins. One consequence of Viet Nam's policy has been the huge exodus of its own people in boats to Hong Kong and other destinations. It is time for this tragic migration to cease  time for Viet Nam to take back its own people in humane fashion. Hong Kong's policy of seeking to return those people who are not genuine refugees is the only way to cope with what would otherwise be an unmanageable influx.We also think the time is now right to look closely at ways of promoting a settlement in Cambodia. The aim should be to secure the early and unconditional withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and a political settlement to give Cambodia a stable and secure Government  that must by definition preclude a return to the horrors of the Pol Pot regime.Just as in the Gulf one resolution of the Security Council offers the prospect of peace  so in southern Africa another resolution offers similar hope of a peaceful end to an old dispute. Ten years ago tomorrow Security Council resolution 435 (1978) was adopted. It remains the best framework for independence for Namibia.  The first crucial step has been taken in South Africa's withdrawal from Angola and the establishment of an effective cease-fire. The next task is to achieve the withdrawal of South African forces from Namibia; and all Cuban forces from Angola and free- elections in Namibia  leading to independence. That will require enormous ingenuity  perseverance and compromise.It will require from South Africa a new respect for the integrity of its independent neighbours. We hope the recent reaffirmation of the Nkomati accord represents a commitment by South Africa to the stability of the region as a whole.It will require from Angola a determined effort to achieve reconciliation within Angola  where the Cuban presence has helped to make an international issue of what is essentially a matter for internal resolution.Just as Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has stood the test of time  so too has the British Government's commitment to act in its support. We long ago offered to provide a signals unit to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG). We remain ready to play our part  and are ready  with our partners in the European Community  to offer assistance to an independent Namibia.A settlement in Angola and the independence of Namibia would not in themselves resolve the intractable problems of South Africa. The principle at stake there is a simple one; the liberty and dignity of the individual. We are committed to the abolition of the system of apartheid  which stifles liberty and denies dignity. We have to find the lever that will effect that change. We do not believe that comprehensive sanctions are that lever. Some see sanctions as a political gesture which should be made almost for its own sake  but it would be an empty gesture. It would be a gesture with too high a price attached; too high a price in terms of the millions of black jobs  black livelihoods  which would be at stake. Our goal is the same as that of our friends in Africa. We are doing all we can to bring apartheid to an end.Our aid to South Africa's neighbours since 1980 is worth well over Â£1 billion. We supply defence assistance to Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The Limpopo railway is being repaired with British help and defended by Mozambican troops trained in Zimbabwe by British army officers.We give aid to black groups and individuals within South Africa so that they can educate themselves  build their own enterprises and free themselves from the oppression of apartheid.In southern Africa  the parties to a longstanding dispute seem at last to be seeking agreement within the framework of a Security Council resolution.The principles of a settlement in the Middle East were similarly laid down in a Security Council resolution 21 years ago. They are no less valid today. Israel and the Palestinians have a historic sense of injustice. That injustice is aggravated  not alleviated  by terrorist attacks against Israel. And the violent suppression of Palestinian aspirations jeopardizes the search for a peaceful settlement.The international community cannot afford to give up the search for peace. The need for an international conference involving the five permanent members of the Security Council is more vital than ever. We shall be persistent in our efforts to help create the conditions in which such a conference can be held.In Western Sahara  we have been the two sides to a dispute brought together by the commendable efforts of the Secretary-General. They have accepted that a referendum is the only way of resolving their differences. I hope that this new willingness to seek peaceful solutions will prove contagious. Regarding one dispute with which Britain itself is concerned  let me just say one thing; the right of the Falkland islanders to self-determination cannot be compromised  hat my country will continue energetically to seek ways of restoring more normal relations with Argentina.Regional disputes around the world are by no means all or even the worst of our problems today. Conflicts within a nation pose some of the most complicated and intractable problems facing the international community. Often they are at a level deeper than a dispute between one nation State and the next. Often they escape the procedures and the mechanisms by which we are accustomed to operate. Yet the way in which they dislocate the very fabric of nationhood is itself a cause of tension and a challenge for the international community.The tragedy of the Lebanon is an example of such sub-national conflict that divides a country down the middle and at the same time extends beyond its borders. We can think of other examples. Earlier this month  in Sudan  I saw the tragic consequences of an internal conflict unresolved. And the conflict in Ethiopia has exacerbated the horrors of famine and starvation in that country.In Burma  we have been appalled at the killing of unarmed demonstrators  women and children  which has taken place over the past three months. Such violence will solve nothing. The Burmese authorities must recognize that the only way to a lasting solution to the country's internal crisis lies in meeting the desire of the Burmese people for greater freedom and multi-party democracy.This type of internal problem poses particular difficulties for the international community. We must work hard to find answers.I welcome the resumption of the peace process in Cyprus. The Secretary-General has met the leaders of the two communities on the island. Agreement has been created on negotiating a just and lasting settlement by 1 June next year. As we meet here  another international event is under way on the far side of the world. In Seoul  in Korea  the hosting of the Olympic Games is a tribute to the remarkable political and economic progress made in that country. We welcome the recent contacts between North and South: we hope that they will contribute to the improvement in atmosphere that will one day lead to the Korean people being properly represented with us here in this institution.We can extend our co-operation into new areas to deal with new challenges to international peace and stability  challenges which postdate the creation of the United Nations itself.The battle against international terrorism is one such. Following the hijacking of KU 422 in April  Britain launched an initiative which led to an agreement in the International Civil Aviation Organization on the detaining of hijacked aircraft so as to contain the spreading of a hijack crisis from one country to another. We must build on that measure to strengthen international protection against future hijackings.The evil of drug-related crime also challenges us to a united response. In some parts of the world the malevolent forces of drug trafficking do as much damage as traditional armed conflict. Individually  many nations may feel they are victims of forces beyond their control. Together  the international community has a power immeasurably greater than the greatest threat. We must create powerful weapons for ourselves  above all by denying the use of the financial system to those that profit from this trade and by preventing funds from being ploughed back into that trade  through co-operation to seize drug traffickers' assets wherever they are. My own country has adopted legal powers to help do this. We cannot act alone. We urge the international community to consider similar action. With the terrorist  the hijacker  the drug trafficker  we have to find ways of directly attacking the environment which sustains him. We must deny him the life support of finance or the comfort of a bolt hole on the other side of a frontier. Drugs and terror are partners in crime. We must be partners within this Organization in fighting them.We must be partners  too  in fighting afflictions which are not man-made but which require human resource to solve. When AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) first started  there was a tendency to put up moral barricades  maximize blame and minimize action. Now we know better. In January  Ministers of Health from all over the world met in London to discuss the problem openly  compare our experience and co-operate in finding solutions. In the face of such disparate and complex issues it is not always easy for the international community to act. None the less  the greater the degree of unity we can display  the greater our chances of finding solutions.In the face of such disparate and complex issues it is not always easy for the international community to act. None the less  the greater the degree of unity we can display  the greater our chances of finding solutions. I am convinced that we can go further together.I began by speaking about my recent visit to Africa and of how different countries  helped by the international community  are coping with man-made as well as natural hazards. In each of the five African countries I visited I was enormously conscious of the economic problems with which they are grappling. Their experience is mirrored in other continents. So we warmly welcomed the positive conclusion last weekend of the meeting under United Nations auspices which reviewed the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. We will continue to do all we can to help. We can now build further on our partnership with the countries concerned Disparities between rich and poor cannot be reduced overnight. It will be a long process. Aid can help. So  too  can the creation of more open conditions for international trade  and likewise internal economic reform  within the framework of structural adjustment and with adequate support from other countries. That is the importance of relieving the burden of debt on those least able to bear it. These are all matters in which Britain will continue to play a prominent  and in many respects a catalytic  role.The proposals on debt relief which we launched over a year ago are now coming to fruition. This opens the way for a number of countries to benefit from rescheduling on concessional terms before the end of the year. But in the last resort it is the Governments and peoples of the countries concerned that must work out their own destiny. We support their own strong determination to that end and we will work to sustain our own partnership with them.There is a new spirit throughout the world in seeking to live up to the undertakings which we have all given under the United Nations Charter. There is a new resolve to put this Organization to work for our common good. We must sustain that spirit and that resolve in the year ahead."
"54",2601,"GHA",43,1988,"ï»¿I wish to congratulate you warmly  Sir  on behalf of the people and Government of Ghana and on my own behalf on your election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I have every confidence that the vastness of your experience and the accomplished diplomatic skills that you bring to that high office will contribute significantly to the General Assembly's work at this session.May I also pay a well-deserved tribute to your immediate predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic  for his superb handling of the last session.The common experience of developing countries since the General Assembly met a year ago has undoubtedly been the difficulty in dealing with the range of very grave economic problems that continue to affect them. The economic crisis  which is about a decade old in the developing world  is still with us. The gap between the haves and the have-nots continues to widen. For the vast majority of mankind the vision of a world of greater social justice and a better standard of living remains illusory. In sub-Saharan Africa in particular  the economic crisis has assumed alarming proportions. Despite the adoption of structural reform policies by most African countries  the subcontinent continues to suffer from the combined effects of  among other things  the sharp fall in the prices of commodities  the dramatic fluctuations in currency exchange rates and crippling debt obligations.In the last five years the critical economic situation in Africa has occupied a position of high priority on the international economic agenda  culminating in 1986 in the adoption of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. That Programme outlined the policy measures which should be pursued at various levels in order to halt Africa's economic decline and put the continent back on the path of economic growth. Halfway through the term of the Programme  however  Africa's economic performance has shown no significant improvement.Since the adoption of the Programme the majority of African countries  in fulfilment of their commitments  have been engaged in resolutely implementing credible structural adjustment and economic reform programmes. Many more African countries may follow. But what incentives do those still weighing the question have in the face of the inadequate support that the pioneers have received? It should be possible to assure countries such as mine which are struggling with the task of implementing structural adjustment programmes that their efforts will not be in vain and that adequate and timely support will be forthcoming.The mid-term review and appraisal exercise undertaken a few days ago by the Ad HÐ¾Ñ Committee of the Whole of the General Assembly has afforded us a welcome opportunity to examine critically the implementation of the mutual commitments assumed by the African countries and the international community. The shortcomings and constraints have been identified and the General Assembly should decide during this session on the measures  policies and initiatives for overcoming them.It is therefore pertinent to emphasize three separate but interrelated questions  because  in my delegation's view  they are fundamental and must be addressed squarely. I am referring here to the low commodity prices  the serious debt-servicing problems and the inadequate flow of development finance.Africa would very much wish to be in a position to provide the bulk of the resources needed to finance its development through the returns on its own efforts. I it how can it realize this aspiration when prices of primary commodities of interest to Africa remain depressed? In the various structural adjustment programmes  rehabilitation of agricultural infrastructure and incentives to farmers have absorbed a large part of the investment  and it is discouraging that  when these efforts succeed in raising output  the returns are not enough even to cover the cost of investment. At present  Africa loses billions of dollars every year on account of 1Ñ commodity prices. Development and investment have suffered thereby and our debt-servicing capacity has been seriously undermined. In a marketplace where one group of operators is continually selling its wares cheaply and buying those of others dearly  protection needs to be given to the weak and vulnerable operators until such time as they are in a position to deal at armâs length with the strong ones. This has been done even in the so-called free market economies. The present situation of the African countries in the commodities trade call for this approach and we note that it is part of the purpose of the Common Fund for Commodities to give such protection to producers of commodities. Apart from the economic provisions foe stabilizing commodity prices  provision is also made to enable producing countries to diversify their production. The Common Fund Agreement has at last met all the requirements for entry into force and presents us with a unique opportunity to eschew lip-service and ideological rigidity in favour of pragmatic and sincere efforts to remove one of the severe constraints on Africa's economic development. We call earnestly on all those countries which have not yet ratified the Agreement to do so.The second fundamental question is the external indebtedness of African countries and the serious debt-servicing problems faced by most of them. The International Monetary Fund (IMF)   in a recent survey  concludes that the external debt position of sub-Saharan Africa has worsened considerably. It is an indication that the strategy for solving the problem has not worked  because frequent rescheduling has only postponed current obligations and added to the debt obligations of some African countries. We are pleased that some of these debts have been converted into grants. We also greatly appreciate the initiatives pertaining to the debt of the poorer countries undertaken by the recent Toronto summit. But  as we have constantly argued  it is only through a strategy that leads to significant reductions in debt stock as well as rescheduling of any residual debt over longer periods that the severe hardship imposed by debt-servicing burdens will be brought to an end.A way will have to be found to deal with the debt owed to the international financial institutions  which  as a matter of policy  do not like to reschedule. As of now  five African countries have been declared ineligible for the use of IMF resources because of their arrears to the Fund. This is a serious development and if debt relief does not come in time many other African countries may find themselves in a similar situation. A number of proposals have been made in an attempt to find an acceptable solution to this problem. The Advisory Group on Financial Flows to Africa established by the Secretary-General has suggested refinancing of sub-Saharan countries' obligations. These proposals deserve serious attention in view of the prospect of mounting indebtedness disrupting relations between African countries and the Fund. The third fundamental question relates to the inadequate flow of development finance to the African countries. Although the international community has made a commitment to relieve the resource constraints of African countries  resource flows to Africa have in recent years suffered a decrease. More importantly  official development assistance  which constitutes a significant component of financial flows to Africa  showed a decline in real terms in 1987 - a fact over which the Secretary-General was moved to express disappointment in his address to the Economic and Social Council during its second session in Geneva this year.It is a matter of grave concern that at a time when many African countries are making determined efforts to implement structural adjustment programmes their efforts should be undercut by crippling financial constraints. The upshot has been the adoption of adjustment programmes in which demand management has been emphasized  even though it is generally accepted that adjustment with growth is the best route to economic recovery and development. Expenditure reduction measures  such as cost recovery and retrenchment of labour  have created serious strains in African societies  threatening the sustainability of the economic reform programmes.My delegation recognizes  of course  that the international community  including the international financial institutions  has adopted some measures and taken certain initiatives in support of Africa's efforts. Those measures and initiatives have been belated and inadequate. Together they do not constitute a coherent and integrated programme that could seriously tackle the monumental development challenge facing Africa. As we take stock of our performance  let us boldly address the fundamental questions that have for so long bedevilled the economic development of Africa; and let us resolve to translate our commitments into concrete action. The General Assembly is convened this year against a background of some financial uncertainty  even though there are some prospects for better times ahead. It would be unfortunate for the United Nations to be financially handicapped at a time when it finds itself actively engaged in urgent peace-keeping efforts in the Gulf and Afghanistan  with prospects for similar services in other areas of conflict. The administrative measures agreed upon in 1987 have either been implemented or are on course. We hope therefore that the withholding of funds by Member States will become a thing of the past. Financial obligations under the Charter are no different from other treaty obligations and they should be discharged without pre-conditions.As far as the political scene is concerned  Ghana welcomes the current wave of peace sweeping the globe. Conflicts which but a few months ago seemed intractable are now being resolved at the negotiating table. The happy turn of events in the Iran-Iraq conflict comes as a relief to the entire world. The eight years of conflict  entailing unspeakable loss of human lives  cannot be justified. The cessation of hostilities is thus welcome. Ghana applauds the Secretary-General for the prompt steps he has taken to initiate the implementation of the provisions of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We urge Iran and Iraq to extend maximum co-operation to the Secretary-General at this critical period of returning the war-weary region to peace and normalcy. Both parties must however realize that lasting peace can be built only on foundations of equity and justice.Ghana equally welcomes the prospects for peace in Angola and Namibia. The denial of peace to the people of Angola since that country achieved independence 13 years ago cannot be justified on any grounds. The Angolan experience is a classic example of the consequences of unwarranted external interference in the internal affairs of a State Member of the United Nations. Similarly  the unsettled question of Namibian independence has seriously threatened the credibility of our Organization. Now that South Africa appears to appreciate the futility of policies of colonization  destabilisation and aggression  Ghana would like to believe that there will be no turning back.Bearing in mind South Africa's vacillations and prevarications in the past  we must naturally remain sceptical. We recall that the present moves are similar to those of four years ago  when the Lusaka agreement was to have led to a cease-fire  a South African disengagement and the establishment of a joint monitoring commission. By the end of that year  however  not only had the Lusaka agreement collapsed but also South African troops had mounted a large-scale invasion of Angola. We also recall the insincerity of the Botha regime in relation to the implementation of the Nkomati Accord.It is important that the international community should not adopt a complacent attitude towards the southern African situation. The truth of the matter is that the apartheid regime has not only intensified repression of its people but also introduced Draconian laws to stifle the expression of dissent. The banning since last November of all political activities by organizations committed to non-violence and the arrest of peaceful marchers  including clergymen  show that the apartheid regime is not interested in any meaningful reform. South Africa shows every indication of maintaining the apartheid system  and that means the likelihood of more aggression against the front-line States. The international community must take such measures as are necessary to eradicate the apartheid system  to deny the South Africans the capability of aggression and to strengthen the front-line States to withstand South African aggression. It is within the power of South Africa to live in peace with its neighbours and to become a respectable member of the international community by taking appropriate steps to eradicate totally its apartheid system. Among the steps that need to be taken  the Botha regime should release Nelson Mandela and all political prisoners forthwith and initiate talks with the black leadership with a view to sharing power democratically with all South Africans  irrespective of race  colour or creed  Ghana believes that until that is done a further tightening of sanctions is necessary to ensure the total isolation and collapse of the South African regime.Another outstanding regional conflict in Africa which also cries out for a solution is the one over the Western Sahara. We urge all parties to co-operate with the Organization of African Unity and the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the settlement of the conflict and an unimpeded realization of the self-determination of the Sahraouian people.Hopes for peace have also been raised in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  and we are grateful to all those who continue to seek peace in those countries. Ghana welcomes the Geneva accords and the commencement of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. We are especially appreciative of the bold decision of the Soviet Union to withdraw from that country. We urge all parties concerned to co-operate for the successful implementation of the measures being promoted within the context of the United Nations Good Offices Mission for Afghanistan and Pakistan to help the Afghan refugees to return and to participate in the reconstruction of their country.The recent exploratory talks in Indonesia between the parties to the Kampuchean conflict also constitute a welcome development."" We believe that by building upon that foundation the parties to the conflict could narrow their differences and perhaps reach agreement. The people of Kampuchea yearn for peace and their wish must be fulfilled with the active support of the international community  but in the final analysis peace is possible only if the parties to the conflict summon the political courage to resolve their differences.Hopes of peace in the Middle East continue to fade with each passing day.That is largely due to the imperviousness of the Israeli Government to the wind of change that is sweeping the world. The intractable problem of the occupied Palestinian lands has taken a turn for the worse. The uprising which started in December 1987 is still raging with the Palestinian death toll mounting every single day. The real tragedy is that Israel continues to regard the uprising as simply a matter of law and order and has therefore resorted to an ""iron-fist"" policy to deal with the situation instead of recognizing that the uprising is a legitimate outburst of accumulated Palestinian grievances. We urge the Israeli authorities to face issues and to place a higher premium on human life  good-neighbourliness and peaceful coexistence with their neighbours and the rest of the international community.It is the view of Ghana that the General Assembly should renew its call for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East. All parties concerned should be allowed to participate in the conference without any pre-conditions. The situation in Central America also continues to be a matter of concern. The hopes that we cherished last year for the subregion have been dashed by the breakdown in the implementation of the Central American peace accord thanks to the intransigence of the contras. Every effort must be made to revive the peace process without undue external pressure or interference. External pressures motivated by ideological considerations in our view underline the peace process. The General Assembly should appeal once again to all parties concerned to strive to achieve a political settlement and to abide by the principles of the United Nations Charter.Another area in which political tension threatens to be permanent is Korea. The continued division of that country and the disagreements between the north and south do not advance the interests of Koreans. Ghana is glad to note the resumption of contacts and talks between the two parts of the country and hopes that even though no concrete advantage has as yet accrued  the dialogue will be maintained and intensified with a view to attaining the reunification of the country. The Korean people should be left free to determine their future without external pressure or influence.The ever-escalating arms race remains a major threat to the survival of mankind. There can be no moral justification for current levels of expenditure on arms while the vast majority of mankind lacks basic necessities. It was against this background that we had hoped that the fifteenth special session of the United Nations  the third special session devoted to disarmament  held last spring  would provide an opportunity to adopt a programme of action that could give further momentum to the disarmament process. Regrettably  that special session failed  in spite of the propitious international climate provided by the signing of the Treaty between the United States of America and the USSR on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (the INF Treaty).The special session did however provide the opportunity for various new proposals to be advocated  particularly those presented by the 120 non-governmental organizations which participated in it. These proposals should be examined for possible adoption. The Ghana delegation would be willing to work with any delegation that might wish to study and formulate those proposals into resolutions for the consideration of the General Assembly.Although we continue to attach the greatest urgency to nuclear disarmament we also believe conventional disarmament deserves no less attention. The extravagant purchases of weapons in recent years clearly show that the international community should not relinquish its efforts to sensitise public opinion about the urgency of disarmament in all its aspects. But that must go hand in hand with a similar effort for social  economic and political justice for all nations. Let us hope that the co-operation that is developing between the super-Powers will aim at justice for all nations and peoples  particularly those nations and peoples that have been the victims of arbitrary power and insensitivity for centuries. The small nations will have no choice but to fight against any attempt to impose on them a vision of the world that ignores their essential prÐµ-occupations.In conclusion  my delegation renews its appeal to all Member States to put their minds and resources together in support of the principles and objectives of the Organization. The United Nations may not be perfect but it still is  and will continue for a long time to be  an indispensable instrument of peaceful coexistence."
"55",2647,"GIN",43,1988,"ï»¿In addressing this Assembly  I would like to assure it of the political will of the delegation of Guinea to make its modest contribution to the success of the work of the forty-third session.I should like to take this opportunity to convey the message of friendship of the people of Guinea  and of its Government  which is courageously led by His Excellency General Lansana ContÃ©.Your well-deserved election as President of this session  Sir  is a just reward for your laudable efforts and your outstanding human qualities  which give our work a spirit of serenity and expectation of success. Your country  in addition to belonging to the third world and to the Non-Aligned Countries;  has warm and friendly relations with Guinea  which therefore is sincerely gratified by your election. We can assure you here and now of the active support of our delegation.Furthermore  the forty-second session is still fresh in our minds  and I should be remiss if I failed to pay a sincere tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic  who guided the work of the last session with sensitivity and skill.We should like solemnly to hail our outstanding Secretary-General  whose firm dedication to the cause of pea e and fruitful co-operation among all States has been expressed in the various negotiations he has skilfully guided throughout this year to find just and comprehensive solutions to the various regional conflicts.The full shouldering of this heavy responsibility is a clear guarantee of the achievement of the legitimate hopes which mankind has placed in the universal Organization. Although  unquestionably  many events have occurred in the past year and a new impetus has been given to the dynamic process of finding solutions to them  it is reasonable to conclude that consideration of the international situation does not justify undoubted optimism. In fact  hotbeds of tension continue to exist throughout the world  and more specifically in the southern hemisphere  which is subject to various political upheavals  aggravated by an extremely precarious economic situation.Against this backdrop  the alarming situation in southern Africa is of vital interest because of the policy of apartheid and the acts of destabilization carried out by the racist regime of Pretoria against neighbouring States  as well as its illegal occupation of Namibia. We are therefore following with continued attention the four-Power talks that are now taking place with regard to the sensitive area of the African continent. In fact  we remain confident that these talks will lead to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  on the accession to national sovereignty of the Namibian people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). Moreover  we support the Declaration and the Plan of Action adopted by the International Conference on the Plight of Refugees  Returnees and Displaced Persons in Southern Africa  held last August in Oslo. The South African regime cannot stamp out the internal contradictions which batter at the apartheid regime. The attention of international public opinion cannot be distracted from the imposition  of a state of emergency and from all the other violations  including repeated acts of aggression against the front-line States and the support given to puppet movements.The permanent members of the Security Council have a particular responsibility and a decisive role to play in bringing Pretoria round to reason. We hope that these countries  which are dedicated to Freedom and to human rights  will assume their share of responsibility for success in the implementation of global and binding economic sanctions as a means of exerting effective pressure on the racist regime of Pretoria.With respect to the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  bold decisions have been taken here by the heads of State and Government  designed to strengthen moral and material support for the fighters of the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC)  as an essential condition for its intensification in the struggle against apartheid and for the establishment in South Africa of a multiracial egalitarian and democratic society.Among our concerns  the question of the Western Sahara is of high priority. It is encouraging to see the lifting of the clouds which for a long time have darkened the relations between Algeria and Morocco  two brotherly countries linked by history  by geography and by culture. These events reflect not only an act of faith but also mark an important step in re-establishing confidence and the consolidation of Afro-Arab co-operation and the building of a united and prosperous Maghreb.My delegation greatly values the commendable efforts made in particular by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. His wisdom and far-sightedness have been important factors in resolving the crisis and in ensuring a return to an atmosphere of mutual understanding.In this respect I should like also to pay a tribute to the OAU and to all the brotherly African and Arab countries whose contribution has in any way helped to improve the situation.We note with satisfaction the favourable development of the process of settling the dispute between Chad and Libya under the guidance of the Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU  and my delegation firmly supports its mediation efforts.  The significant results of contacts between the leaders in the Horn of Africa deserve our attention. This resumed dialogue should be encouraged and pursued with a view to establishing unity  fraternity and co-operation  in the sub-region on the ashes of hostility and mutual distrust.We must also stress the positive development of the situation in the Comorian island of Mayotte. We hope that the talks will lead to a just solution to the question.The same holds true for New Caledonia  where any initiative likely to eliminate the atmosphere of confrontation should be implemented. Here  the repercussions of the recent visits of the Prime Minister of France to New Caledonia and the new steps undertaken by his Government are clear signals of good will.The developments in sensitive areas dominated by instability make us think of the continuing crisis in the Middle East. In that region the heroic uprising of the Palestinian people as the expression of the natural right to legitimate defence against foreign occupation. It is as a function of this inalienable right that justice-loving nations demand the recovery of the occupied Arab territories and the creation of an independent Palestinian State under the aegis of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).The convening of an international peace conference in the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all parties concerned  including the PLO  now seems a viable means of concerted action to find a lasting solution to the conflict.Moreover  we cannot but be satisfied today at the happy outcome of the fratricidal war which for eight years has pitted Iran against Iraq and which has caused untold loss of life and damage. The cessation of hostilities will doubtless give vigorous impetus to the work of national building and will lead to progress and stability. Here  we should hail the persevering efforts of the Secretary-General to bring the two parties to a peaceful settlement to the conflict through the proper implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and as an important stage in seeking a just and global solution to this terrible conflict. For its part  the Government of Guinea encourages the two parties to the conflict to pursue negotiations and to demonstrate political will  given the steps that are being taken at various levels to overcome all obstacles  within the frameworks of a peaceful settlement of this dispute.Concerning the situation in Afghanistan  we continue to hope that the process of normalization will continue through the proper and systematic application of the Geneva agreements by all the parties involved. This will allow that country in the very near future to decide on its own destiny  free from any foreign interference.This trend towards the defusing of tensions also holds true regarding Kampuchea  where the withdrawal of foreign troops remains the key to the problem. The direct and indirect talks among interested and concerned parties deserve our encouragement.Tensions continue however in the Korean Peninsula despite the existence of numerous constructive proposals. Foreign intervention and the policy of over-arming seem to be the two fundamental obstacles to the peaceful and independent reunification of the northern and southern parts. The meeting of the North Korean and South Korean parliamentarians is an encouraging event inasmuch as it provides a possibility for the opening of dialogue  which can lead to conclusive results.Regarding the crisis on Cyprus  the last meeting between the President of the Republic of Cyprus and the representative of the Cypriot-Turkish community in Geneva gives rise to a glimmer of hope regarding the re-establishment under the aegis of the United Nations of national unity and territorial integrity. The situation in Central America continues to be of concern to our community. The hope aroused by the Arias Plan for a global political settlement to the conflict is no longer being reflected in facts. The establishment of an atmosphere of good-neighbourliness among all States of the region and the return to democratic principles  as laid down in that Plan  could  however  have created the necessary conditions for a return to peace and security. There is  therefore  reason to encourage the Contadora Group and the States of the Support Group to continue their efforts with a view to for the integral application of this Plan.Regarding disarmament and the growing threat which the build-up of nuclear arsenals represents for mankind  the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to Disarmament had the task of assessing and adopting corrective measures. My delegation keenly regrets that the session was unable to adopt a final document because the defence of national interests dominated over the categorical imperative of global security. Benefiting from a favourable international climate  that session could  through a process of consensus - which to be sure is difficult to achieve on a question as thorny as that of disarmament - have supplemented the positive gains achieved in the bilateral negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. However  throughout this period the arms race has been continuing  devouring enormous financial and material resources which could have contributed to the process of socio-economic development throughout the world. In my delegation's view it is impossible to maintain peace without a consistent policy of general and complete disarmament under effective international control  just as it is unrealistic to attempt to establish a balance in international relations in an environment characterized by non-military threats to security. A newÂ·/ vision has emerged over these last years in dealing with crucial questions linked to security  following the progress achieved in the disarmament field - in particular  nuclear and chemical disarmament. It is up to multilateral disarmament forums to pursue that work in order to achieve even more substantive results. In addition  the rather positive geo-political environment of the last few years  characterized by a definite will to go beyond political and ideological divergences  is a manifestation of a progressive awareness of leaders and peoples of the virtues of frank dialogue and serious concerted action.Concerning the zone of peace and co-operation in the South Atlantic  the Government of Guinea will support all efforts likely to promote achievement of the objectives of the declaration in resolution 41/11. It was in this spirit that my country participated in the meeting at Rio de Janeiro  whose final document symbolizes the determination of the States of the South Atlantic to make of their region a genuine zone of peace and co-operation.Paradoxically  these recent encouraging and positive developments are in contrast to the rather gloomy picture of the international economic situation  given the continuous and increasing difficulties experienced by the developing countries in general and by the African States in particular. Indeed  despite the great sacrifices made by the latter in their various programmes of structural readjustment  they have not yet been able to enjoy the advantages that they have the right to expect  even if  on the domestic front  they have had a slight rise in their gross domestic product and some growth in food production.In any case  we note with some concern that financial flows are dwindling. The tendency rather is for a transfer of capital from the South to the North. In fact  foreign investment  which represents for our economies a life-saving breath of oxygen  which can achieve certain national growth for development  is drying up. A glimmer of hope appeared when the international community demonstrated understanding and political will by adopting the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. The assessment of the implementation of that Programme has not yet shown prospects for specific measures  although certain international institutions have demonstrated some readiness to take action.The situation regarding debt-servicing is unfavourable  while inequalities in international terms of trade are worsening. There are reasons for satisfaction at the conclusions of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  which  although of limited scope  stressed these problems while urging rich and poor to pursue negotiations  which at the moment are deadlocked  in order to promote continued and lasting growth of the world economy.In the Sudano-Sahelian region of Africa  natural disasters  such as locust invasions and floods  are  first and foremost  endangering food production and are decreasing the volume of exports  which have suffered already from unequal terms of trade. That is why it is essential to have an overall view of these various economic and social trends and to emphasize the ever-growing interdependence in international economic relations  ultimately  in the multipolar world in which we are living  balance can be achieved only through political will  linked to a realistic approach on the part of the international community. It will be recalled that a positive initiative was undertaken by the Secretary-General in 1986 regarding the setting up of a strategy to enable us to cope  through the United Nations Programme for the Environment  with the damage caused to the environment. This decision was based specifically on the attention given to environmental problems throughout the world and  in particular  in the African countries confronted with a most alarming advance of the desert because of deforestation  the practice of large-scale cultivation and other factors contributing to deterioration.Another ecological phenomenon  which is even more ominous  is threatening the developing countries. If I take the liberty of stressing this  it is precisely because my country  like many others  has been considered a dumping-ground by certain groups of countries and companiesÂ·  which find yet again in Africa a favoured place for casting out all the evils and ills of this world. Energetic measures must be taken by the international community to do away with such attitudes  which seriously endanger biological diversity and the ecosystem  and are in violation of all international conventions in this field.Above and beyond its will to co-operate with all well-intentioned countries  the Republic of Guinea  for its part  will adhere to all legal guarantees that are in conformity with international norms and to the recommendations of the Organization of African Unity concerning prohibition of a recurrence of this type of situation in its national territory. We consider that these inhuman actions contribute to the sowing of disorder and dismay among our peaceful peoples and that they are a serious threat to present and future generations.The promotion of respect for human rights and their universal application  by encouraging co-operation among States  is one of the fundamental objectives of the world Organization. In keeping with the spirit and the letter of the Charter  the events of today are an acknowledgement of the close relationship between respect for human rights and the maintenance of peace and international security- The fact that  through zealous efforts  the United Nations has succeeded in establishing a set of human-rights principles and rules that are internationally recognized should be noted among its most outstanding successes. For us  one of the essential tasks of the United Nations is to take effective measures against mass and flagrant violations of human rights  violations which are indeed a threat to peace and international security. Lack of respect for the right of peoples to self-determination  as well as humiliating practices and policies inspired by racism or apartheid  or existing for any other reason  require of our Organization  and of each of the Member States  the adoption of a firm position and adequate measures. The principle that there must be respect for  and implementation of  human rights is  we are convinced  the corner-stone of our civilization - a value shared by all mankind  a value that we have all set  and one that we must preserve and allow to grow.The United Nations has demonstrated that it is an irreplaceable universal forum  whose central role has enabled us to resolve certain conflicts and to expand the foundations of democracy  peace  security and development. Its Charter includes rules and general principles that must serve as permanent reference points in our collective and individual actions. Any concept that is opposed to multilateralism undermines the idea of the interdependence of nations and sabotages the will to co-operate. It is by that will that all States - large or small  rich or poor - can effectively contribute to the establishment of a world free from distrust and terror  so long as its structure and means of functioning are adapted to today's realities.While the uncertainty of a better future makes some sceptics view happiness on this Earth as a mirage  or as the horizon which recedes as we advance towards it. My delegation  for its part  nevertheless dares to hope that with the dawn of the third millennium the human race will provide the necessary surge of awareness to achieve - burning and eternal in all disillusioned hearts - the basic prerequisite for man's existence which is the thirst to live free and in peace.

"56",2686,"GMB",43,1988,"ï»¿I wish to extend to you  Sir  the warm congratulations of the Gambian delegation on your election to the high office of President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I am sure that with your diplomatic skills and ability  as exemplified by your illustrious career  you will guide the deliberations of this important session to a successful conclusion. In the discharge of your duties you can count on the full co-operation of my delegation.I should like to take this opportunity to express my delegation's profound thanks and gratitude to Mr. Peter Florin  Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic  for the efficient and businesslike manner in which he conducted the deliberations of the forty-second session of the General Assembly.Permit me also to pay a special tribute to our indefatigable Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his laudable efforts in the promotion of international co-operation and his devotion to the search for peace among nations. The decision of the Nobel Committee to award the 1988 Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces deserves our praise and admiration. This well-deserved recognition is also a testimony to the dedication and courage of the thousands of men and women spread around the globe and fully committed to the aims and ideals of the Charter of the Organization. The United Nations family deserves to be congratulated.Last year at this time  when the forty-second session of the General Assembly convened  the world was still caught in a web of escalating tensions and regional conflicts. In some areas  these conflicts took on higher intensity and wider involvement  fuelled with even more destructive weapons. The cost  both in material and in human terms  became incalculable  and unprecedented since the last World War.From the heat of the Sahara to the lush greenery of southern Angola  from the Shatt al-Arab waterway to the rugged mountains of Afghanistan and into the plains of Indochina  the principle of the peaceful resolution of disputes became illusive. It seemed as if the world had forgotten the solemn declaration of the United Nations founding fathers that they were determined ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". Indeed  conflicts  disputes and a general state of instability continued to prevail. But  at last  there is today a glimmer of hope in the international atmosphere for the resolution of several Long-outs banding conflicts and disputes. In fact  recent developments in many troubled areas have opened up new possibilities for the peaceful settlement of disputes and for co-operative coexistence among nations.Who would have believed  only a year ago  that during this session we would all be basking in the genuine hope of a more stable world  because of the remarkable achievement of a super-Power agreement actually to destroy a whole class of nuclear weapons? Perhaps  by this act  mankind has finally taken that important first step away from the threat of a nuclear conflict. With the present spirit of co-operation  my delegation is confident that this is just the first step  and that the best is way to come. As the Chinese saying goes  ""A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.""At their last summit in Moscow earlier this year  President Reagan of the United States and President Gorbachev of the Soviet Union laid a solid foundation for a realistic approach to the question of peace  stability and the reduction of the risk of global conflicts. The whole world notes with satisfaction their determination to prevent the risk of war  whether nuclear or conventional.As the result of a remarkable series of initiatives and of greater understanding  both super-Powers have contributed greatly to the transformation of the world political situation. The new climate of mutual respect  understanding and dialogue has opened the door to more meaningful advances in the efforts of all nations  especially the super-Powers  to strive for a world without nuclear weapons.My delegation welcomes the fact that disarmament has been a major theme in world politics during the last 12 months. We remain hopeful that the United Nations will continue to play its rightful role in creating the atmosphere for meaningful dialogue and that all current negotiations on this important issue will be expeditiously and successfully concluded. It is also the hope of my delegation that greater attention will be given to increased security in a wider sense  namely  in the release of human and material resources for redeployment on social and economic programmes for the general welfare of all underprivileged peoples around the world.In his statement to the third special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament  held in June this year  the President of the Gambia  His Excellency Alhaji Sir Dawda Kair aba Jawara  addressed this issue of the unfortunate competition in the allocation of available resources for armaments and development as follows: ""The allocation of massive resources for armaments is simply a major constraint on the development process  as armaments and development both tend to compete for the same limited resources. Given the general global economic and financial crises  reduced military spending could contribute significantly not only to an increased flow of development assistance to developing countries  but also to an improved climate for global economic growth. We should therefore work tirelessly to ensure that the progress made in disarmament results in increased attention to economic and social development matters and in particular to increased assistance to developing countries. Remote as the chances for this may seem at the moment  we should continue to strive for this important transition  and I would urge that the General Assembly give this important question particular attention at this special session."" (A/S-15/PV.9  p. 12)The current climate of peace  of renewed hope and optimism  is not only evident in the search for a more stable and sustainable relationship between the two super-Powers: it has  as we all know  reached the other areas of conflict around the world.In Afghanistan  foreign troops that have occupied that country for eight years are now withdrawing. We hope that the signing of the Geneva agreements and the total withdrawal of foreign troops will create conditions that will enable the Afghan refugees to return to their country in safety and dignity. In this way  all Afghans can sit together and chart their own destiny without any external influence.At this juncture  my delegation would like to pay tribute to the positive and responsible attitude adopted by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Despite the threat to its security  which emanated from the presence of foreign troops in neighbouring Afghanistan  the Islamic republic of Pakistan gallantly provided shelter and relief to over 3 million refugees in accordance with universally recognized humanitarian principles.We have also been following with keen interest the developments in the Gulf region  mainly because of our genuine desire for peace. In fact  as we all know  the President of the Republic of the Gambia  in his capacity as Chairman of the Peace Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  has since 1984 been actively involved in the difficult task of trying to bring an end to the Gulf war and to create better understanding between the brotherly peoples of Iran and Iraq  fortunately  recent developments in the area have generated much optimism. This conflict has caused immense suffering to the populations of the two countries. It is our fervent hope that the cessation of hostilities and the current initiatives of the Secretary-General will lead to an honourable resolution of all the outstanding issues without further delay.In South-East Asia  we welcome and applaud the initiatives of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  which culminated in the recent Jakarta informal meeting  and its endeavour to find a solution to the Kampuchea n problem. We appeal to all sides concerned to explore all possible avenues for the restoration of the rights of the Kampuchean people  while at the same time ensuring the legitimate interests of all the countries in the region to live in peace with one another.Our support for the current search for & solution is based on the principle that no country should be permitted to define its security in a way that creates insecurity for others. The presence of foreign troops in Kampuchea and the repeated incursions into Thai territory have heightened tension and posed security problems in the region. It has also transformed a large section of the Kampuchean population into refugees and placed an intolerable burden upon neighbouring countries of first asylum  particularly Thailand.Like the rest of the international community  the Gambia is committed to the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea  in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions. This would allow the Kampuchean people to determine their own future  with the full participation of all Kampuchean.In the Korean peninsula  we continue to support genuine efforts for the peaceful reunification of North Korea and South Korea  in the best interest of both parties. In this regard  a meaningful dialogue is the key to a lasting solution and must therefore be vigorously pursued. Pending reunification  however  my delegation will support the admission of both North Korea and South Korea to the United Nations  based on the principle of universality.With regard to the situation in the Middle East  the international community must ensure that the already explosive situation in that area is not immune from the prevailing climate of peace  dialogue and understanding. Developments in the occupied territories over the last few months have proved beyond doubt that the time has come for the prevailing winds of peaceful change to blow in this area. While there is anxiety over the need for all States in the region to live within secure and recognized boundaries  we should admit that it is equally important to emphasize that realization of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to have a homeland of their own is long overdue. We  in the Gambia  will therefore continue to support the Palestinian people in their heroic struggle for an independent homeland. We consider the convening of an international conference  under the auspices of the United Nations  a very important step in the search for a genuine and lasting settlement. But if such a conference is to succeed  it must guarantee the full and effective participation of the Palestinian people  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).On the question of Cyprus  my delegation will continue to encourage the ongoing contacts and negotiations taking place under the good offices of the Secretary-General. We reiterate our hope that the two communities will continue to co-operate with the Secretary-General with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable political settlement of the problem. In this connection  an arrangement based on the equal rights of both communities could be an ideal solution.Let me now focus my attention on Africa. As members are aware  we in Africa have just celebrated the Silver Jubilee of our continental organization  the Organization of African Unity (OAU). The celebrations  however  took place at a most critical time in southern Africa. The celebrations also coincided with the tenth anniversary of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on Namibia  thus serving as a sombre and bleak reminder of the nature of the monstrous regime in Pretoria.Today  there exists world-wide revulsion against the racist regime in South Africa. However  this widespread international outcry is not due to the international community sudden realizations that apartheid is evil  violent and immoral. This growing international reaction is due to the sustained struggle being waged by progressive and democratic forces inside South Africa itself. It is the internal struggle that made South Africa the focus of attention. But in bringing this about  the people of South Africa and the front-line States have had to make great sacrifices. In spite of the past record  much has been made by the racist regime and its supporters of South Africa's intention to institute reforms in compliance with internationally recognized norms.If there is any regime that qualifies to have Chapter VII of the Charter invoked  then surely it is this regime whose policies have been rightly and universally declared as a crime against humanity. We must therefore make greater efforts to support the struggle of the South African people by continuing to strive for the application of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions. The international community must find ways and means of adopting further measures designed to impress on the authorities in Pretoria the compelling urgency of dismantling apartheid and creating the structures of democracy in South Africa.My delegation would also strongly urge the international community to provide the front-line States with such assistance as would guarantee their territorial integrity and independence. We should  however  make sure that such assistance is not simply regarded as an easy alternative to dealing with the root cause of the crises in southern Africa which  as we all know  is South Africa's ever-increasing internal repression and brutality in its futile attempts to perpetuate apartheid.At the moment  there is steadily mounting optimism with regard to the peaceful settlement of the Namibian question. Naturally  we  in Africa  welcome the series of negotiations that have so far taken place. We hope they will eventually lead to the independence of Namibia  within the framework of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).On several occasions in the past  hopes have been raised that South Africa would bow to international public opinion and to morality by accepting the provisions of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Those hopes have been repeatedly thwarted by a defiant South Africa; hence the reason for our cautious optimism. We hope that this time  the international consensus on the illegality and inadmissibility of Pretoria's actions and its several military setbacks in southern Angola will ensure that South Africa stays at the negotiating table.We all do recall that when the founding fathers of the United Nations drew up the Charter in 1945  they reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person. Besides the Charter  the United Nations has also made clear pronouncements on human rights in many fundamental texts  such as  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948  the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966.As we commemorate this year the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  let us remember that all these solemn declarations and covenants recognize that freedom from want and fear can be achieved only if conditions ate created whereby everyone enjoys his or her civil and political rights.The issue of the protection and promotion of basic human rights cannot therefore be separated from the immediate problems of human survival. There is an indissoluble link between the two. Human rights is indivisible and universal  incorporating  as it were  social and economic rights  such as  the right to a decent diet  shelter and access to basic health care and educational facilities.In view of the widening gap between the universally accepted practices of human rights and the stark realities in many parts of the world  we must make more intensive efforts to defend the rights and dignity of the individual. The Gambia does not wish to interfere in the internal affairs of any State. Our stance on human rights is motivated only by a special concern for the individual and his freedom and dignity. It is gratifying to note that specific steps within each region to improve the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms are particularly promising.In Africa  important decisions have been taken towards the institutionalisation of respect for and protection of human rights in the continent. As this Assembly may be aware  an Organization of African Unity (OAU) Commission on Human and peoples' Rights has now been established and the Gambia's offer to host the headquarters of the Commission has been unanimously accepted by the member States of the OAU. We believe that the confidence and trust which have been reposed in the Government and people of the Gambia are based on our firm and irrevocable commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights  a commitment which is derived from the principles enshrined in both our domestic laws and our foreign policy.Besides the decision to host the Secretariat of the OAU Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights  we in the Gambia ace currently in the process of establishing a centre for democracy and human rights studies in order further to promote and consolidate our achievements in this area. I hasten to add that the proposed centre will be a non-governmental institution  open to all those who share the Gambia's commitment to democracy  the rule of law and the principles of freedom and the integrity of the individual.Those are some of the more pressing political issues confronting the international community. Throughout the world there seems to be renewed commitment and hope that these political problems  despite their seeming complexity  will all someday be resolved peacefully.But if the political climate offers some hope for the future the same cannot be said for the international economic environment. My delegation notes  with a great deal of anxiety  that our current economic crises  which pose no less of a threat to international peace and security  are not being imaginatively and effectively tackled. Notwithstanding the special concern about long-term structural problems  the necessary political will to solve them is regrettably still lacking.As a result of global recession  unfavourable terms of trade  persistent high interest rates in some developed countries and the increasing cost of debt servicing  most African countries  including the Gambia  have had to put in place a comprehensive package of reform measures in order to remove structural imbalances in our economy and establish a firm footing for recovery and development with growth.Although there has been marked progress in redressing some major macro-economic and sectoral distortions  much still remains to be done. The Government of the Gambia is fully aware of the hardships and difficulties brought about by these domestic policy reforms  but we continue to show full determination in implementing all measures required for a speedy economic recovery and for laying the foundation for sustained long-term economic growth and prosperity.However  it is clear that our efforts to help ourselves will fail without a new and substantial flow of financial resources on a concessionary basis. We hope that the international community will give significant support to our efforts  in conformity with the commitments made in the context of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  adopted in 1986. It will be recalled that this Programme of Action was recently revised and reviewed by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the General Assembly. My delegation sincerely hopes that at this session the Assembly will decide on the measures for overcoming the shortcomings and constraints that have been identified. The root cause of the current economic crisis of the developing countries has been the collapse in commodity prices. According to recent estimates  the cumulative loss for developing countries resulting from the decline in commodity prices relative to those of manufactured goods imported by them between 1980 and 1985 amounted to about $US 50 billion. Such large losses in a period of declining official development assistance emphasizes the need for increased multilateral co-operation generally.Nor should we lose sight of the fact that developing countries' dependence on primary commodities has remained strong  ranging between 68 per cent and almost 100 per cent. Moreover  in some cases  such as that of the Gambia  one or two primary commodities account for 90 per cent of total exports. The share of primary commodities in gross development product for the developing countries is over 30 per cent  whereas for the developed market-economy countries it is less than 10 pat cent. Consequently  a decline in commodity export earnings has far-reaching implications for us  not only for current account balances but also for fiscal revenues.One aspect of the African crisis  which could be directly linked to commodity prices and which places a premium upon the need for flexibility and a new approach towards its solution  is the problem of acute external indebtedness. Africa's economic development has been held back by debt more than by anything else.This  need for an international conference to tackle this problem is becoming even more urgent  It must be fully recognized  however  that despite the debt-relief measures adopted so far by some developed creditor countries the African debt crisis can be solved only if our economies are given the necessary impetus to grow and all debts are converted to grants. In addition to the restructuring of our national economies  the present crisis in Africa has focused attention on the urgent need to take further action on operating and sustaining closer subregional and regional co-operation. It cannot be overemphasized that Africa's future lies in greater co-operation and self-reliance  with a view to ensuring a balanced development  within the framework of our drive towards the total economic emancipation of Africa in consonance with the spirit of the Lagos Plan of Action and the Final Act of Lagos. That is which the Government of the Gambia attaches the greatest importance to our subregional organization  the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).Amidst rapid economic changes and uncertainties  EOOWAS continues to find effective ways of improving the standard of living of millions of people in our region. In this regard the Gambian President will  in his capacity as the current Chairman of ECOWAS  strive to give new impetus to the implementation of various programmes of subregional organizations  including the EOOWAS Economic Recovery Programme. Still on EOOWAS matters  I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament for Africa for organizing a training programme on conflict resolution  crisis prevention and management and confidence-building among ECOWAS States  in Lome  Togo  from 22 August to 2 September 1988.The programme provided a forum for communication between senior military and civilian officials of ECOWAS States responsible for issues of peace and security in their countries  especially in the practical skills and expertise needed to prevent and manage conflicts. This approach was seen as helping to break down barriers of mistrust and thereby enhance confidence among EOOWAS States. Both military and civilian perspectives are essential in order to have a complete view of the dynamics of problems being analysed and to establish concrete mechanisms in the future for the realization of lasting peace and security in Africa.As a result of the success of this programme  the desire has been expressed to continue such programmes and to expand them to include other subregions of Africa.On this important issue of peace and security in Africa it is encouraging to note that the initiatives taken by our leaders to settle the differences between Chad and Libya  Morocco and Algeria and Ethiopia and Somalia are beginning to bear fruit. We whole-heartedly support this approach to the peaceful settlement of disputes between the brother peoples of Africa  based on the spirit and principles of the charter of the Organization of African Unity.At a time when all our energies are being concentrated on the twin problems of survival and growth  a new and dangerous phenomenon is beginning to cause widespread anxiety and alarm. I am  of course  referring to the totally unacceptable and irresponsible practice of dumping industrial and toxic waste in Africa. The Gambia is one of a number of countries that have been approached  but we have firmly rejected all requests for the disposal of industrial waste in our country. Given the gravity of this situation  we have also enacted very important and stringent laws to prevent the likelihood of any waste-dumping in the Gambia. And  as I have said on another occasion  despite our poverty no amount of money would lead us to agree to mortgage the future of our environment.Over the years the Gambia has paid special attention to the better management of our environment as we endeavour to improve the standard of living of our people. In fact  about a decade ago the Government of the Gambia issued a special declaration  known as the Banjul declaration  in which we ""pledged our untiring efforts to conserve for now and posterity as wide a spectrum as possible of our remaining fauna and flora."" Furthermore  following the long period of drought and the relentless encroachment of the desert in cur subregion  we in west Africa must be spared from any further form of environmental degradation.My delegation would therefore like to support the proposal first made by the Federal Republic of Nigeria  and now accepted as an Economic Community of West African States (ECDWAS) project  for the establishment of a ""dump watch""  in order that countries which may be subject to the dumping of industrial waste are alerted in good time to enable them to put in place all the precautionary measures necessary to safeguard their environment. The United Nations should set up a special committee that would look into the activities of industrial companies that are guilty of this crime. The countries that have been seductively subjected to the systematic pollution of their environment should also be compensated.This is the background against which the forty-third session of the General Assembly is convening. Never have there been greater opportunities and possibilities than today for the establishment of a world free of the menace of nuclear conflagration and regional conflicts.I should like to conclude by reassuring members of the Gambia's deep commitment to the maintenance of international peace and security  as well as to international co-operation for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all people.Let us  therefore  through collective action  rededicate ourselves to the lofty ideals and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations if we are to ensure the survival of mankind and preserve peace among nations."
"57",2726,"GNB",43,1988,"ï»¿There is a universal consensus today as to the far-reaching changes that are taking place in the world  changes that carry with them great hopes for a better future. This explains what is most special about this session of the General Assembly which  more them drawing up a diagnosis of the present international situation  should gear Its work to optimising and rendering irreversible the positive developments that now characterize the state of international relations. The progress made in the field of disarmament  in the process of the normalising of relations between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  and towards the peaceful settlement of the various conflicts in different parts of the world do seem to indicate that mankind is turning a new corner in an optimistic spirit. The Secretary-General of the Organization# Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar# expresses this situation in his report very ably and clearly# interpreting the feelings of the international community with the insight and political vision he has always shown in the exercise of his lofty duties. This is an opportunity for us to encourage him and to assure him of our steadfast support and appreciation.The changes under way are not the result of chance. It would be illusory to believe that the process we are witnessing is simply the result of isolated phenomena or intrinsic mechanisms.The rejection of the deterministic view by the community of nations is evident in the constant efforts of our universal Organization not only to preserve the world from destruction and the various ills that beset it politically  economically and socially  but also to build the foundations of the future. Our common future depends on the individual and collective attitudes we assume today  the maturity and good sense we bring to our actions  the conscience and interaction of our activities and the complementarily of our interests.The progress made over the last two years on the way to detente and in the settlement of regional conflicts in particular are encouraging indications that awareness of this is beginning to emerge. The time is ripe  then# for action to give a new direction to international relations. Will we be able to rise to this historic occasion?It is urgent that substantial steps be taken especially in the field of disarmament in line with the historic Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - between the United States and the Soviet Union. We feel  moreover  that the negotiations under way should soon produce tangible results leading to the elimination and complete prohibition of chemical weapons and the reduction of conventional weapons at the lowest possible level.Never since the end of the Second World War has mankind accumulated so much goodwill and success along the way to peace  mutual understanding and the creation of conditions favourable to peace and to more human international relations.In the present trends and the prospects they are opening up we see the expression of a humanism justified and stimulated by growing world interdependence and mutual contacts between peoples  cultures and development processes. But there can be no real prosperity so long as it remains the privilege of a few  so long as it is confined to certain areas of the planet and factors of progress and backwardness  stability and confrontation  continue to exist side by side.The debt crisis  the fall in exports  the stagnation and decline in the growth rate of developing countries  the continuous deterioration in the terms of trade and the decline in real terms of Official Development Assistance are some of the principal features of the present international economic order that stand in sharp contradiction to the growing interdependence of nations.Against that background  the economic situation of Africa is especially affected by the repercussions of the world economic crisis which are aggravated by the devastating effects of prolonged drought and other natural disasters. The correction of imbalances and the reversing of trends in the present international economic situation requires the introduction of vigorous structural reforms throughout the system  especially as regards its monetary and financial aspects  if we wish to prevent the development of some States taking place at the expense of others.The struggle to introduce a new international economic order is thus as relevant and urgent as ever. In recent years there have been many initiatives to eliminate imbalances and their harmful effects on the developing countries  which indicates the dawning awareness of the need to identify the causes of these ills and to unite in our efforts to eradicate them.The adoption at the twelfth special session of the General Assembly of the Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990  in the mid-term review of which we are now engaged  the platform adopted for settlement of the urgent problem of debt  and the results of the International Conference on the Relationship Between Disarmament and Development illustrate the growing concern of the international community with regard to development problems.We must  however  recognize that practical and comprehensive initiatives to give substance to our will to build a new world economic system based on justice and equity are still lacking. The failure to meet the target foe official development assistance set in the United Nations International Development Strategy is a clear illustration of this fact and indicates the need to consider carefully the objectives and priorities with respect to international co-operation.At the beginning of my statement 1 referred to the universal consensus that is emerging with regard to the changes now occurring in international relations. The broad prospects opened up through the peaceful settlement of disputes and the elimination of tensions in regions such as southern Africa  South-East Asia and Central America give us hope that these indications are not just temporary ones. In Afghanistan  in Kampuchea  in Central America  Chad  Western Sahara  Cyprus and the Gulf  we are seeing signs of hope that prove that peace is possible when there is a real will to make use of dialogue and co-operation in settling problems between States. We hope that the political realism shown by the different parties involved in these matters will become ever stranger and permit the definitive removal of the obstacles that continue to prevent a return to peace  stability and understanding in these regions.Nevertheless  we cannot fail to be concerned over the lack of progress in the search for a peaceful and lasting solution to the questions of the Middle East  the Korean peninsula and East Timor in particular.Of all the conflicts that have shaken the world over the last four decades  the conflict that persists in the Middle East is certainly one of the most complex and dangerous for world stability.To be just and lasting  any settlement of the Middle East situation must take into account the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to their own State  as well as the right of all States of the region to have their national independence and territorial integrity respected and to live securely within internationally recognized boundaries. In the case of East Timor we encourage the Secretary-General to continue his good offices with a view to the full affirmation of the inalienable rights of the people of East Timor to self-determination and independence.In southern Africa the negotiations under way have contributed to a change in the political climate and have brought progress in efforts to create conditions conducive to a global solution of the conflict in the region. We welcome this development but we must continue to express our concern over the persistence of apartheid in South Africa.The visit I have just made to the People's Republic of Angola and the People's Republic of Mozambique enabled me to observe the commitment to the constructive spirit and open-mindedness that characterize the position of those Governments in seeking a peaceful  just and lasting solution to the problems of southern Africa.In this context and although we remain alert to the positive direction the talks en South-West Africa are taking and the prospects of peace which they open up  the international community must be firm in pursuing its endeavours with a view to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and to the elimination of the system of apartheid as a necessary step towards guaranteeing peace stability and democracy in that part of the African continentThe election of Mr. Dante Caputo to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session which is taking place at such an important juncture is due recognition of his great abilities and competence in carrying out these delicate tasks.We are unanimous in recognizing the importance of this stage in human history. A new spirit of dialogue tolerance and agreement prevails in the world today and should be sustained. This cannot but contribute to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in resolving conflicts solving the problems of development and preserving international peace and security. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is a timely and well-deserved tribute to the courage and dedication of all of these men of good will.This session should echo the new sensitivity and the new approach Â£hat prevail in facing the problems of our era  showing a spirit of willingness to engage in dialogue and our ability to recognise the true challenges that we face today in analysing and discussing the questions on our agenda. We feel sure that  together; we can take advantage of this historic occasion and usher in the new dawn that is now breaking  with confidence in our ability to join forces as we build a new reality ever closer to mankind's deepest aspirations."
"58",2765,"GNQ",43,1988,"ï»¿The forty-third session of the General Assembly is beginning its work at a time when the international community is anxiously stating and claiming  more than ever before  its right to secure and lasting peace and tranquillity. This session  therefore  must not dash these urgent hopes of the human community  which  for countless valid reasons  calls It the hope of mankind.Against the background of that yearning of mankind  the delegation of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  which I have the honour of heading at this time  congratulates the President of the Assembly on his well-deserved election to preside over our discussions. His country and the Republic of Equatorial Guinea have had close and excellent diplomatic relations for a long time. Moreover  the Argentine Republic Is one of the countries that responded sincerely and positively  with grants and loans  to the call for help by His Excellency Mr. Qbiang Nguema Mbasogo  when he first took power  for help in rebuilding the country  which had been ruined - indeed  devastated - by the previous regime. The people of Equatorial Guinea government and will always remember this. For the moment  all I have been asked to do is express wholehearted thanks to the people of Argentina.The Argentine Republic's support for the ideals oÂ£ the United Nations is also acknowledged and appreciated by the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.The President's personal dedication  together with his negotiating experience and his recognized diplomatic gifts and talents  guarantees that the resolutions that will be adopted at the end of the debates will be impartial  beneficial and profitable for everyone. To that end  my delegation is fully at his disposal. We assure him that we shall do nothing to hinder his work to achieve the desired consensus.On behalf of the delegation of Equatorial Guinea  I extend our congratulations to the other officers of the Assembly  whose hard work in co-ordinating our activities is not always fully recognized and appreciated.With great nostalgia we express our gratitude to the outgoing President  Mr. Peter Florin  for the diplomatic and political wisdom with which he guided the delicate work of the forty-second session of the Assembly. His conduct gave us encouragement to continue the struggle against the injustice confronting the human community  and to do so in accordance with the words of our national emblems unity  peace and justice.The people and Government of Equatorial Guinea express to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  special gratitude for his great dedication and total devotion to the problems of the international community and his sincere aim of seeing concrete form given to the lofty and noble ideals of the San Francisco Charter. In paying this tribute to him  we should like to think that the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces was to a large extent the result of his efforts. If that is not the case  the Republic of Equatorial Guinea proposes to the bodies responsible for these awards the individual candidacy of the Secretary-General for the next Nobel Peace Prize.The report submitted by the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization is a very significant and eloquent document  with regard both to the positive achievements it describes and to ones it is hoped will be achieved - given  of course  the political will of the Governments involved in each case. In our opinion  there have been many successes. That is demonstrated by the very fact that the general debate of this forty-third session has reflected great optimism and a sincere recognition of the validity of multilateralism as well as the strengthening of the role and credibility of the United Nations. The United Nations has relit the torch of confidence which can guide us on the path to the solution of difficult  delicate and complex problems. Thus  it is the ideal forum and the impartial arbiter for; dealing with questions of interest to the international community. And that was what the Organization's founding fathers had in mind. That is a source of pride to the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. We reaffirm the confidence that we reposed in the United Nations when we became a Member. This confidence is not just a word; it is embodied in facts - facts that are applied within our country  where the recommendations of the United Nations are implemented in all sectors at the national level  and externally in all the international forums  where we pursue a strict policy of good-neighbourliness  co-operation  openness and dialogue with other States  in order to preserve the peace and tranquillity of our region  our continent and the world. In that respect  within our country governmental adjustments are made and new political  social and financial institutions are established  as the circumstances require  in order to comply with constitutional mandates. Examples are the political democratization programme and the economic reconstruction programme to achieve the desired comprehensive development on a firm basis.I should like to summarize by referring briefly to the political process in my country.On the basis of the law adopted by our Parliament in relation to political parties  the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea was recently established. Its first congress is being held now in the city of Bata. The democratization process has readied a stage where the participation of the people in the country's economic recovery and development can be more in keeping with their participation in the management of political affairs  thereby closing the gap which had continued to exist in our community's political and administrative organization. With the help of the United Nations Development Programme and other institutions of the United Nations system and bilateral donors  the Government of Equatorial Guinea has devised a global and sectoral strategy for the country's medium-term development and has convened a second round-table conference of donors in Geneva from 28 to 29 November. We ask the United Nations to make an appropriate assessment of the situation in Equatorial Guinea so that  in harmony with ongoing negotiations with international financial institutions  that conference might have truly successful results.Similarly  externally  every day our country accedes to governmental  non-governmental  regional and subregional organizations  and international economic and financial institutions  and it has broad-ranging diplomatic relations with other States. For example  recently Equatorial Guinea has acceded to the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  which were adopted by the General Assembly on 16 December 1966. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea has also recently acceded to the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer  concluded in Vienna on 22 March 1985.The Government of Equatorial Guinea has likewise taken due note of the recommendation contained in paragraph 1 of resolution 1988/54 of the Economic and Social Council  not only to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  but also conscientiously to reply to certain pernicious insinuations and references ~ to show that the Government of Equatorial Guinea has nothing to hide but  on the contrary  carries out its public activities in conformity with established rules and with the consent of the people. Our optimism and our confidence at this session are based on the report of the Secretary-General and also the course taken to solve the problems of Angola  whose negotiations with the Governments of Cuba and South Africa  with the positive mediation of the United States of America  have opened up a new era of hope.Also  with regard to the sad case of Namibia  Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is beginning to have positive effects in the achieving of full sovereignty and independence for Namibia years after it was declared.Then there is the open dialogue with Pretoria to do away with the system of apartheid and racial discrimination and to ensure recognition of the fundamental political rights of the black population  and on the question of the imprisonment of Nelson Mandela and other compatriots  who should be returned to their loved ones.There is also reason for optimism in the reopening of diplomatic relations between the sisterly and friendly countries of Morocco and Algeria.We hail the achievements in the improvement of the climate of relations between Chad and Libya and the cessation of hostilities between them. Once again  we express hope concerning their resumption of diplomatic relations  which we trust can be achieved within the framework of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) so as to achieve a suitable peaceful settlement to their border dispute.With regard to the referendum on self-determination proposed by the Secretary-General in co-operation with the OAU  accepted by His Majesty King Hassan II and shared by the POLISARIO Front  it must be carried out freely under international supervision and put an end to a conflict that is both painful and tragic. We welcome the new developments in this field.Our delegation is pleased to see that a direct  sincere and peaceful dialogue is taking place between the two Cypriot communities  as suggested by the Secretary-General  in an attempt to settle the long-standing dispute and to guarantee the unity  sovereignty  and independence of the Republic of Cyprus. My Government is especially pleased at the news that the Governments of Iran and Iraq have agreed to accept compliance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987) as the basis for a just and lasting solution. We are sure that this will lead to peace and harmony between those two sisterly countries.We are optimistic also with regard to the people of Afghanistan  given the accords signed in Geneva in April of this year  the positive effects of which are beginning to be felt with respect to self-determination and the independence of a people that has suffered for so long.We cannot fail to mention Kampuchea  which after so much pain and suffering has an opportunity to speak of peace and stability and end its people's suffering. My Government supports the initiation of dialogue between all parties to the conflict  for we believe that to be the only way that might lead to the establishment of a broad-based Government and lead to national reconciliation  which implies the withdrawal of all foreign forces.We wish warmly to congratulate the two Koreas on their expressed willingness to engage in a process of reunification. We also congratulate South Korea for the efforts it has made during the 40 years of its independence to activate this process of reunification free of foreign influence. The ideas of Korea's being among us as a Member of the Organization merits reflection by us all.Those are a few of the cases that have gained well-deserved approval from the international community and led to some serenity. But there are others that remain sources of concern  and we wish to state our hope that they too will be solved.There is  for instance  the doleful case of the Middle East  concerning which we say again that there is urgent need for the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and for the carrying out  with greater realism  of agreements that will result in the implementation of the Palestinian people's right to a sovereign State  which will guarantee the peace and security of the peoples of the region and their right  including the sovereign State of Israel  to live within safe and secure boundaries.We are even more gravely concerned about the crisis in Lebanon  which erupted as long ago as in 1975. The deterioration of the situation there must be stemmed by means of a sincere and peaceful dialogue between the authorities of the two communities. We hope that thus Lebanon can achieve peaceful coexistence  sovereignty  independence and unity.We are equally concerned about the situation in our sister countries of Latin America  where there are visible and chronic signs of outside interference that obstructs their self-determination and puts obstacles on their path to the stability and the development they desire. We regret the lack of compliance with the Esquipulas II peace accords signed in Guatemala by the Central American countries last year  which assumed the existence of the spirit of harmony necessary for the solving of the various problems among those nations. Regrettably  the situation concerning the Malvinas Islands is still one of stagnation. We therefore appeal to the Governments involved to begin genuine efforts to find a viable and internationally acceptable solution.Although consideration of the question of East Timor has been postponed to the next session  we invite the Governments of Portugal and of Indonesia to continue their contacts and redouble their efforts to achieve an acceptable solution. We deeply appreciate and are interested in the intention of the administration of New Caledonia to lead that Territory to self-determination.Some months ago the United Nations General Assembly held its third special session devoted to disarmament - a session which  to our great regret  concluded without formal agreement. Nevertheless  there was great optimism at the dialogue and bilateral agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union. On that occasion  at this very rostrum  the head of the delegation of Equatorial Guinea saidÂ·.""The Republic of Equatorial Guinea  paradoxically  will not eliminate or diminish this monstrosity of weaponry simply because it neither possesses nor produces them nor does it consider attaining them. But we do hope to eliminate and lessen the widespread illness  hunger and poverty that are the scourges of my country. There are countries that are wasting millions of dollars every minute on weaponry while our country is talking about debts of thousands of dollars as a matter of survival."" (A/S-15/PV. 21  p. 7) The delegation of Equatorial Guinea does not believe it necessary to go into great detail on the subject of armaments as the great threat to world peace  because  as we have seen  it is being dealt with by the giants who consider themselves the masters of the world. We prefer to speak about the economic imbalance between the nations of the world and  in particular  the countries of the third world  and the least developed countries  to whose number the Republic of Equatorial Guinea belongs. This  for us  is the real disarmament issue.Little or no progress has been made on the question of the new international order since it was first mentioned here and in other international forums. Every day we see the gap widening between the intransigent and arrogant positions of the industrialized countries and the just claims of the developing countries. The thinking of the two sides differs so enormously that a solution satisfactory to both seems impossible. We do not believe that a serene and happy world can come about while a large part of mankind lives at subsistence level.We also regret the fact that one of the cynical solutions invented and offered to the countries of the third world is the one of which the African continent has recently been a victim. I refer to the dumping of industrial  toxic  nuclear and radioactive waste  which is offered to African countries as the only way of achieving the degree of development of the industrialized countries. The fact that my country has not yet fallen victim to this Machiavellian machination is due to the great respect it has for the honour and dignity of a sovereign and proud country. The biased statements in this connection which are totally unfounded and are designed to distort the image of Equatorial Guinea  should be ignored by the international community  because they amount to pure imagination. Nor can the statements change our stand with respect to what is needed for the well-being of our people. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea knows what it really wants and knows how to achieve it. I take this opportunity to declare that my country has not received  and will not receive  any industrial  toxic  nuclear or radioactive waste. The delegation of Equatorial Guinea would like once again to state in this Assembly that His Excellency Obiang Nguema Mjasogo took charge of our country in 1979 when  because of its complete self-isolation from the outside world  it was about to disintegrate as a sovereign /hate. All the steps which have been taken since then have been arduous and slow  but they have been safe and good steps. The Government is observing fully the rules of the Constitution  which was adopted in 1982 under the supervision of the United Nations. The programme of democratization and comprehensive development that we began is irreversible. In this connection  we would like to invite anyone wishing to visit our country to do so  provided that he is willing to assess the considerable changes without preconceptions and in an impartial manner.Having said that  I should point out that we are convinced that the basic principles of international coexistence and the attributes of national sovereignty may be greatly harmed by continuing interference in the internal affairs of States. Thus we express once again our rejection of any interference in the internal affairs of Equatorial Guinea. This is a firm and indisputable principle of all States and also of the United Nations.At the beginning of this statement I said that the forty-third session of the General Assembly was the hope of mankind and that we should not frustrate or disappoint it. Equatorial Guinea hopes that at this session the General Assembly will adopt resolutions that will help to bring about world peace and security and that it will give priority in its resolutions to the situation of the poorest States. It urges other nations to abandon their selfish nationalism and calls upon them to view the problems of mankind from a point of view that will allow us to preserve the individual  who deserves better conditions  conditions enabling him to achieve the ultimate goal for which he was created. "
"59",2811,"GRC",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of the European Community and its member States I should like first to express my most sincere congratulations to the President on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.I should also like to express the Community's profound appreciation to the outgoing President for the way in which he conducted the deliberations of the forty-second session of the General Assembly.The 12 member States of the European Community wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  for his tenacious and constant efforts to find solutions to the problems facing the international community. We are delighted to see that in a number of cases his efforts have led to positive results.The forty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations opens in a climate marked by positive and encouraging developments. East-West relations have undergone a favourable evolution  highlighted by the summit meetings between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union. An important and significant agreement on arms limitation and control which involves the destruction of nuclear weapons has been concluded. The Treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States of America on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - which brings about for the first time the destruction of a whole category of weapons  is a milestone in the history of East-West relations and has opened the way for further progress in other areas of arms control and disarmament. It as an initiative fully supported by the Twelve. Considerable progress has been made towards the peaceful solution of some of the major conflicts affecting the world community. Soviet troops are in the process of withdrawing from Afghanistan; there is a case-fire in the Gulf; the conflicts in Cambodia and Angola look less unstable than they did a year ago. The Twelve  which have actively contributed towards bringing about this climate  cannot but rejoice.However  there are still serious problems to which no solution has been found and new challenges are looming on the horizon which will require persistent efforts on the part of all members of the international community. It is therefore essential that we pursue our efforts  convinced that it is in a growing spirit of realism  co-operation and dialogue that the problems that preoccupy us may find suitable solutions. The United Nations is and must remain the advocate of this spirit.It is with great satisfaction that the Twelve have welcomed the Organization's growing role as well as its accomplishments in recent months. It is an encouraging sign of the strengthening of respect for the principles enshrined in the Charter  which constitute the best basis for ensuring world peace  as well as for promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms and economic  cultural and social progress  especially this year when we ate celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We ate therefore determined to support every effort in order to enhance the authority of the United Nations and render its existing mechanisms and activities more effective.I must lay emphasis here on a problem of particular concern to us  that of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Need I recall the priority which the Twelve give to them and the importance they attach to the promotion of and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in all countries? In this field  the Twelve's activities are guided by the principles which were set out in their Declaration of 21 July 1986  principles which were initially enshrined in tie Charter of the United Nations  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two Covenants. We expect all Members of the United Nations to live up to the obligations they have freely assumed. We welcome any efforts aimed at strengthening the existing mechanisms established to ensure that nations' words are matched by deeds.This year in which we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  let us all recommit ourselves to its principles and their implementation for a better  humane world.The recent political events have enhanced the role of the United Nations in the process of settling international conflicts. It is  however  ironic that our Organization and  not least  its peace-keeping operations face a most serious financial crisis at a time when confidence in its usefulness is growing. The Twelve have made efforts to fulfil their financial obligations to the United Nations and ate determined to do so in the future. We strongly urge all Member States to show their support for the Organisation by fulfilling their financial obligations in full and on time  according to the Charter. We hope that our commitment to a strong and effective United Nations will be shared by all Member States. We live in an increasingly interdependent world in which very few problems can be solved by any one country alone. The very existence of the European Community reflects acknowledgement of this fact. A year ago my colleague the Foreign Minister of Denmark  which held the presidency of the European Community  stated that with the entry into force of the Single European Act the Community had entered into a new phase of close collaboration. I can add today that  in fact  the Community has embarked upon a stage of its development that is characterized by new momentum for integration combined with renewed confidence in our common future. We have made headway towards the objective of advancing European unity and contributed together to making concrete progress towards a European union. We have increased our efforts jointly to formulate and implement a European foreign policy  thus striving to promote peace and stability in Europe and the world. The Community is not  however  an inward-looking organization. It is inspired by an open spirit of co-operation and active participation in solving the political  economic and social problems affecting the international community.The Twelve have long supported and actively contributed to the process of improvement in East-West relations and are determined to continue to work in this direction in a realistic and constructive manner. They welcome not only the developments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe which have led to the opening of the political systems and economies of those countries but also the developments in the way those countries approach certain international issues. The changes contribute to consolidating and intensifying East-West relations. It is only between open societies which get to know one another and communicate without barriers that real trust can be created  this being the only reliable basis for lasting security.In this context  efforts regarding arms control and disarmament are of great importance. Since our last session of the General Assembly we have witnessed very positive developments in this field  above all the signature and ratification of the INF Agreement  which the Twelve fully supported. Many of the Treaty's provisions set an important precedent for future agreements on arms control  in particular asymmetrical reductions and intrusive verification procedures.The Twelve fully support efforts to bring about a 50-per-cent reduction in the strategic nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union  as well as an agreement on space issues which would be a significant contribution to world-wide stability in this field.We also strongly support the efforts made within the United Nations to tackle the problems of nuclear and conventional disarmament  verification  confidence-building measures and military transparency in the military field. The Twelve strongly advocate the early establishment of a global and effectively verifiable ban on chemical weapons and reaffirm their commitment to the total elimination of those weapons. Joint efforts at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva can bring closer the resolution of pending problems  including the complex but fundamental verification issues  in a way acceptable to all. Those of the Twelve who are participants in the Conference will continue vigorously to pursue this goal at the negotiations.The adoption of Security Council resolutions 612 (1988) and 620 (1988) was a notable further milestone. The Twelve consequently reiterate their support for action which could be undertaken to establish impartially the facts relating to alleged use of chemical weapons against the Kurdish population.The Twelve regret that the third special session devoted to disarmament was not brought to a close without an agreed concluding document. However  important constructive work was done during the session and it is hoped that the First Committee will profit from this experience.It is not surprising that in the framework of arms control and disarmament the Twelve attach particular importance to problems concerning security in Europe  where serious imbalances persist  in particular in the conventional field. Therefore  the need for conventional arms control - the key issue of European security - is especially urgent in this area also. The Twelve have long advocated the establishment of a stable and secure balance of conventional forces at lower levels within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) process  the elimination of disparities prejudicial to security  stringent verification and the elimination of the capability for launching surprise attacks and for initiating large-scale offensive action in the whole of Europe. We have noted with interest that certain ideas put forward recently by the Warsaw Pact countries reflecting in part  our concerns. We also favour an agreement on a new set of enhanced confidence- and security-building measures aimed at promoting mote openness and transparency in the military field. The Twelve accordingly consider that the negotiations on conventional stability and new confidence- and security-building measures should begin as soon as possible in a constructive spirit after the satisfactory conclusion of the current CSCE follow-up meeting at Vienna.Progress in the field of conventional arms control in Europe thus depends on the conclusion of the Vienna CSCE meeting  with a substantial result in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The CSCE process shows the way to overcome the barriers of distrust which divide the continent. Military security agreements alone cannot bear the full weight of East-West relations.The Twelve note with satisfaction the progress being made in the resolution of the issues before the Vienna follow-up meeting. We hope that the present sixth round of negotiations will bring that meeting to a prompt and successful end. In this respect the Twelve recall their recent appeal to the other participating States of the CSCE to settle the remaining issues  particularly those relating to the human rights and human contacts provisions of the Helsinki Final Act. The Community's aim remains an agreement on a balanced and substantial concluding document  permitting progress in all baskets and in particular in the fields of human rights and fundamental freedoms  co-operation and security.As far as human rights and fundamental freedoms are concerned  the Twelve insist on a better implementation of all commitments entered into by the States participating in the CSCE process.We believe that progress in the human dimension of the CSCE will make a substantial contribution to the creation of a real climate of confidence in Europe and in particular will give East-West relations the stability and continuity which they must have. The Twelve are determined to continue to strive for a dynamic development of East-West relations.A successful and balanced outcome of the Vienna meeting would secure the opening of negotiations on conventional stability in Europe  aiming at the establishment of a stable and secure balance of conventional forces in Europe at a lower level  on a further set of confidence- and security-building measures  and the convening of a conference on the human dimension.Turning now to the question of Cyprus  a member of the European family  I cannot disregard the fact that the tragic division of the island remains unchanged. The Twelve attach great importance to a just and viable solution of this problem. To this effect we reaffirm our strong support for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus  in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions. We stand fully by our previous statements and reject any action which purports to establish an independent State within Cyprus.We also express our satisfaction with the successful efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General to bring about a resumption of the intercommunal dialogue in the search for a settlement in Cyprus  based on the above principles  and we call upon the parties concerned to co-operate fully towards the achievement of that objective.The improvement in the international climate should render the task of finding just solutions to the regional crises  which continue to affect our age  more promising. The Twelve firmly believe that an important element for the implementation of arrangements or agreements to settle these conflicts will be the present and future United Nations peace-keeping operations. Some of the peace settlements we fervently hope to see materialize in a not too distant future will require peace-keeping and observer forces. Member States of the European Community have contributed Blue Helmets in the past and some of us are doing so right now. In view of the considerable peace-keeping tasks which may lie ahead  the Twelve will continue to attach great importance to the matter and are giving active consideration to its various aspects. They also wish to assure the Secretary-General that he can count on their full support.We emphasize our view that the costs related to peace-keeping operations based on decisions of the Security Council  in accordance with the Charter  are to be regarded as mandatory expenses  unless it is decided otherwise by the Security Council  to be borne by all Members of the United Nations  having been carefully examined in the appropriate way. We should be prepared to pay the price of peace.The Twelve call upon all States Members of this Organization  and especially the two super-Powers  to render their full support to these operations. It is only with this support that the encouraging developments we have recently witnessed will lead to positive results. The European Community and its member States have important ties with the countries and peoples of the Middle East  and they cannot be passive about or indifferent to the serious problems affecting a region which is so close to them. Today the conflicts in that region continue. The Arab-Israeli conflict remains an issue of deep concern to all of us. The status quo in the occupied territories is not sustainable. The situation in those territories remains tense. We have repeatedly deplored the Israeli repressive measures  which make a peaceful settlement harder to find. We urgently renew our call on Israel  pending its withdrawal  to fulfil scrupulously its obligations as an occupying Power in accordance with the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949.The Twelve's views on the key elements which must make up a solution to that conflict are well known. In accordance with the Venice Declaration and other  subsequent declarations  two principles are fundamental: the right of all States in the area  including Israel  to exist within secure  recognized and guaranteed borders and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  with all that that implies. These principles continue to be the basis of the policy of the Twelve. For the implementation of this policy  we have on several occasions reaffirmed our support for the International Peace Conference  under the auspices of the United Nations  as the suitable framework for the indispensable negotiations between the parties directly concerned.After so much suffering  so much tragic loss of human life  the time has come to break the vicious circle of repression and hatred. There can be no real security  nor any real peace  for any of the peoples in the region without a just  comprehensive and lasting settlement. All parties concerned should recognize each other's rights. We therefore address from this rostrum an urgent appeal to all the parties concerned to make the necessary efforts to achieve that aim. At this particular moment it seems especially important for all parties concerned to show political responsibility in order to permit the peace process to move forward. For our part  we remain ready to play our role fully in that effort.In Lebanon also  after 13 years of war and suffering  it is vital that a political solution be found. The proper functioning and strengthening of Lebanon's constitutional bodies is a pre-condition for such a solution. We regret that the mandate of President Geroayel expired without a new President being elected. We strongly appeal to all parties to favour the election  in all freedom and without external pressures  of a President capable of carrying out the task of national reconciliation and safeguarding unity  independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty in Lebanon. We emphasize our support for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and appeal to all parties to ensure that that Force is allowed to fulfil its mandate without hindrance.The Twelve have been following with great satisfaction recent developments in the Iran-Iraq conflict. We have welcomed the announcement of a cease-fire and the decision of the Governments of Iraq and Iran to accept that cease-fire  to be followed by direct talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General  The Twelve remain determined to support the efforts of the Secretary-General  and they call upon both parties to co-operate intensively with him in order to achieve a comprehensive  just  honourable and durable settlement of the conflict  in full compliance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  so that peace and security may be restored to the region.In this connection  the Twelve pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts and dedication. The success of his endeavours enhances the prestige of the United Nations and paves the way for the Organization to play an increasing role in the maintenance of international peace and security.The Twelve note with satisfaction the improvement in relations among the countries of the Maghreb. That development creates new prospects for co-operation between the two shores of the Mediterranean Sea and for regional stability. We also welcome the positive reactions by the parties concerned to the peace plan on Western Sahara which has been put forward by the Secretary-General and endorsed by the Security Council and which is aimed at the holding of a referendum on self-determination under the auspices of the United Nations. We believe that all parties will demonstrate their willingness to restore a just and lasting peace to the region.In southern Africa there have been some encouraging signs of progress after years of South African aggression and destabilizing acts against neighbouring States The Twelve have  both individually and collectively  declared their support for the efforts currently under way aimed at securing peace for Angola and independence for Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  They have also welcomed  as recently as 26 August in their statement on the occasion of Namibia Day  the encouraging agreements reached in the quadripartite talks for the implementation of that resolution. The Twelve are looking forward to the rapid and successful conclusion of the ongoing negotiations  leading to Namibia's independence. They express the hope that the dialogue that has been initiated will ease the existing tensions and pave the way for peace  security  stability and social  and economic development  based on respect for human rights in the entire region. In this connection  they welcome the prospect of a bilateral agreement between Angola and Cuba which will include a timetable acceptable to all patties for the phased and total withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.The Twelve reiterate their strong support for the efforts of the front-line States and other countries of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) to achieve security and economic stability. Furthermore  the Twelve reaffirm their willingness to contribute to the implementation of the Oslo Declaration and Plan on the Plight of Refugees  Returnees and Displaced Persons in Southern Africa. Yet the abhorrent system of apartheid remains entrenched in South Africa. This year has again been marked by serious and disturbing developments  like the adoption in February of new restrictive measures against a number of organizations peacefully opposing apartheid and several of their leaders  the arrests of church and trade-union leaders  the detention without charge of men  women and even young children and the maltreatment and torture inflicted on a number of detainees  the uncertain fate of the Sharpeville Six  and the bill threatening to deprive peaceful anti-apartheid organizations of external funding. All those developments point to the fact that Pretoria is still unwilling to commit itself to real and significant change  and we fear that that will worsen even further the relations between the Twelve and South Africa. The Twelve once more stress that apartheid must he totally abolished by peaceful means and the vicious circle of repression and violence that it provokes must be replaced by a constructive national dialogue. Only negotiations involving the genuine representatives of the black community and all other components of the South African population can bring about a future of peace and prosperity in a free  democratic and United South Africa with no racial discrimination.In our view  there can be no dialogue as long as the state of emergency j still in force and the African National Congress  the Pan-Africanist Congress and other political parties are banned and while Nelson Mandela  now seriously ill  and other political prisoners are not released.In pursuit of their stated objectives  the Twelve follow a policy of persuasion and pressure. Apart from declarations and pressing demands to the South African Government  the European Community and its member States have adopted a number of restrictive measures as well as positive programmes of assistance to the victims of apartheid.As regards the Horn of Africa  the Twelve have noted with satisfaction that normal relations have been established between Ethiopia and Somalia  which represents a step towards achieving lasting peace in the region. However  the serious tensions in both Ethiopia and Somalia  which have caused loss of life and an exodus of civilian population as well as economic and material damage  continue to be a cause of great concern.. The conflict in northern Ethiopia still endangers the distribution of food to millions of people threatened by famine and starvation. The Twelve appeal to all concerned to make serious efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflicts in the region. The Twelve express their deep concern about the dramatic events in Burundi and the resulting flood of refugees at the Rwanda's border. They hope that the situation will soon be normalized and that a satisfactory and lasting solution will be worked out in order to prevent further outbursts of violence in Burundi.Nearly 14 months ago the international community warmly welcomed the historic decision by the five Presidents in Central America to sign the Esquipulas II Agreement in order to bring about stable and lasting peace in their region  a process to which the European Community and its member States have given their unremitting support.We have on several occasions appealed to all the parties directly or indirectly involved to give effect to the agreement in letter and spirit by fully implementing all the commitments they have assumed and to contribute towards the region's efforts for peace  democracy  economic development and social justice.Today we wish to express our concern that the momentum of the peace process should be maintained. Although progress has been achieved in some fields  the Twelve note that the principal conditions for a stable and lasting peace in Central America have not yet been met.Our view concerning the solution of the region's problems is based on the principle that responsibility for peace and democracy rests with each country individually and with all of them collectively. The arrangements provided for in the Esquipulas II Agreement represent an indivisible entity and should be implemented as a whole.I must stress once again that there will be no authentic democratic process without pluralism  involving respect for human rights and promotion of social justice. There will be no peace and democracy unless the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and the right of all nations to choose their economic  political and social models freely and without external interference of any kind are respected.We urge the Central American countries to make every effort to give new impetus to the peace process. For their part  the European Community and its member States wish to reaffirm  once again  that they are committed to contributing  to the best of their ability  to the process set up in Esquipulas  including the creation and the functioning of the Central American Parliament  and to the economic and social development of the region. We call on other countries to do likewise.We have followed with particular interest the efforts initiated last November in Acapulco by the Heads of State of eight Latin America  countries to establish a permanent mechanism for consultation and concerted political action. We welcome this initiative  which has opened up new paths for regional concentration and we intend to pursue our dialogue with these countries aimed at promoting peace  development  democracy and stability in Latin America.The Twelve are encouraged by the progress made in the process of democratization throughout Latin America. We appeal to the Governments of those few countries that have not yet seen the re-establishment of full pluralistic democracy to engage in a process of genuine democratization that will enable their peoples to express themselves freely and to build a future worthy of them.The Twelve welcomed the signing of the Geneva agreements on Afghanistan  which constitute an important step towards the settlement of the crisis. They now call on all parties involved to spare no effort in pursuing the peace process. An overall political settlement of the Afghan problem involves the withdrawal of all Soviet troops in accordance with the agreed timetable  the unimpeded return of refugees in safety and honour  the establishment of a fully representative government through a genuine act of self-determination  and the re-establishment of a genuinely independent and non-aligned Afghanistan. It is essential that the resistance be fully involved in this process. Also in this forum I wish to reiterate the readiness of the European Community and its member states to contribute  when the time comes  to the resettlement of refugees and displaced persons as well as to the reconstruction of the country in accordance with the priorities laid down by the United Nations Co-ordinator for Humanitarian and Economic Assistance to Afghanistan.Concerning the Question of East Timor  the Twelve reiterate their support for the contacts between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. They express the hope that it will soon be possible to achieve progress  thus paving the way to a just  comprehensive and internationally accepted settlement of the Question  with full respect for the Â·interests of the people of East Timor.A return to peace and stability in South-East Asia is still contingent upon a solution being found to the problem of Cambodia. This conflict is the result of a foreign military occupation in violation of the fundamental principles of the United Nations and international law and must be brought to an end. In this connection  the Jakarta informal meeting was an encouraging step towards a political solution of the conflict resulting in an independent  democratic  neutral and non-aligned Cambodia. We express our firm support for the constructive efforts made by the Association of South-East Asian Nations for the promotion of a political solution to the Cambodian problem that would ease tension in the region and enable the Cambodian people freely to decide their own future. We stress the essential role that Prince Norodom Sihanouk can play in a new Cambodia that must be free from any prospect of return to the universally condemned policies and practices of the recent past. The Twelve renew their appeal to Viet Nam to withdraw all its troops from Cambodia. We call upon all concerned to pursue their efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive solution in accordance with repeated United Nations resolutions. There is no doubt that the full withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops and the re-establishment of a genuine peace in Cambodia would open the way to international co-operation for the reconstruction of the region.Furthermore  the dramatic increase in the number of boat people from Viet Nam is a source of serious concern for the Twelve. In co-operation with the countries in the region and with international organizations  we have been trying to alleviate the suffering of these people and to help them. We believe that Viet Nam must assume urgently its responsibilities according to international law and internationally accepted practice.The Twelve express their deep concern at the renewed violence and loss of life in Burma. They are firmly convinced that the Burmese people's clear desire to enjoy the benefits of peace  prosperity  the full protection of human rights and a multi-party democracy should be met. As we recently declared  we are ready to assist  to the best of our ability  a fully representative democratic Government in Burma to secure the social and economic recovery of the country.As to the division of the Korean Peninsula and the continuing tension there  we welcome efforts to resume the suspended direct dialogue between North and South as the only way to reach a solution by peaceful means. As in the past  we express again our hope that  on the basis of the principle of universality  the people of Korea may soon gain full membership of this Organization. It is encouraging to note the progress made towards democratic reforms in the Republic of Korea. Turning now to the Olympic Games in Seoul  we express our appreciation that they are taking place in an atmosphere consistent with the classical ideal that gave birth to them.The Twelve have repeatedly and firmly condemned terrorism in all its forms. We reaffirm the principles adopted by the Council of Europe in 1986 - in particular  the principle that there should be no concessions under duress to terrorists or their sponsors. We have never left any doubt about collective determination to fight terrorism by all means.Unfortunately  terrorism has continued to take innocent lives and to bring bloodshed to our countries. We are determined to continue our efforts and to strengthen international co-operation to fight this scourge of our age  for terrorist attacks can never be justified and do not serve whatever political cause the perpetrators claim to be assisting. In this context  we support the initiatives undertaken in multilateral organizations  both to strengthen international protection of civil aviation and to enhance maritime security. We reiterate our appeal to all the countries which have not yet signed the international conventions on this matter to examine the possibility of acceding to these important instruments.The Twelve  considering that drug abuse and trafficking have become a terrible scourge for the whole of mankind  make an appeal for wider and strengthened international co-operation in this field. In this spirit  they call for a successful outcome of the plenipotentiary conference in November-December in Vienna  with a view to the adoption of the United Nations convention  against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs. Moreover  specific initiatives are needed in the area of supply reduction  demand reduction and the rehabilitation of drug addicts. It is  therefore  extremely important that the role of the United Nations and its institutionÂ· in this field  especially the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control  be strengthened and increased.Recent weeks have seen a succession of natural disasters that have taken a heavy toll and caused much suffering. The European Community and its member States wish to express their sympathy and support for the Governments and peoples of all the affected countries  and their willingness to continue to provide  to the best of their ability  humanitarian assistance as well as  where appropriate  longer-term support for economic recovery.Allow me now to turn to another very important issue. Two years ago all States Members of the United Nations undertook the difficult but essential task of improving the Organization and making it more efficient and effective in dealing with the complex problems of contemporary reality. At this point I would like to reiterate the full support of the Twelve for the Secretary-General  who has demonstrated his determination to follow up seriously the reform process initiated by General Assembly resolution 41/213.The Twelve believe that the Secretary-General  in implementing the part of the reform that was entrusted to him  has performed his duties with flexibility and political judgement. The matter is now at the hands of Member States  which must show the same kind of political perspicacity and determination. In this respect we cannot fail to note with regret that the Special Commission undertaking the in-depth study of the United Nations intergovernmental structure and functions in the economic and social fields has not been able  so far  to achieve concrete results. Concerted action during the summer session of the Economic and Social Council led to a consensus resolution concerning the rationalization of the work of the Council. However  no considerable progress was made on other issues. Our commitment to reforms remains strong  and we consider the reform of the Economic and Social Council to be another significant part of this exercise. We expect that other Member States will not lack the political will to engage in fruitful consultations with a view to reaching a substantive reform that would undoubtedly enhance the ability of our Organization to deal effectively with the current economic and social problems.The improvement in the political climate coincides with encouraging developments in the general economic situation. The European Community  through the achievement  by 1992  of an economic space without internal frontiers  is determined to make its full contribution to enhancing world-wide economic growth for the benefit of all. The upturn in economic activity in the industrialized countries in 1987 was greater than expected. Moreover  it is encouraging to note that the stock market crisis in October 1987 did not unduly upset the growing climate of confidence in the economies of the industrialized countries. For this year the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts a further increase in the growth rate to almost 4 per cent. Whether this growth performance is sustained will depend  inter alia  on how the international community deals with problems such as renewed inflationary pressures  rising interest rates and continued large external imbalances. Moreover  the level of unemployment in many industrialized countries is high and the state of the international financial markets remains unsettled To turn to more specific matters  the economic situation of the European Community in 1988 has been characterized  so far  as in 1987  by a growth performance of 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent. Average inflation is scarcely a quarter of what it was in 1980  despite certain deviations. However  vigilance is needed to prevent its re-acceleration. There has been an increase in productive investment in industry and services. Trade  both within the Community and with the rest of the world  forms the corner-stone of internal recovery. On the other hand  unemployment  which affects 11 per cent of the active population  is a grave economic and social problem for the Community of 12 and afflicts 16 million Europeans  particularly young people and women.The developing countries  for their part  are expected to show an average growth rate of some 4 per cent  but that figure conceals considerable differences between the various regional groupings. While economic growth remains strong in certain Asian countries  many other developing States  for example in sub-Saharan Africa  continue to experience low economic growth and falling standards of living. Above all there is the problem of the external debt of many developing countries  a problem which concerns the whole international community. The burden of debt servicing is compromising prospects for growth and political stability  particularly in African and South American countries  and in the case of some countries it is a constant threat to the international financial system. Economic maladjustments  aggravated by adverse external developments  have affected the growth performance of these countries negatively and undermined confidence in their economic prospects.As a result there continues to be cause for concern. It is essential  therefore  to strengthen international co-operation and increase individual and collective efforts in a number of areas. The European Community and its member States are fully aware of their weight in the world economy and their responsibilities with regard to future economic growth and development and the international trading system. They have taken  and will continue to take  specific actions to achieve balanced  non-inflationary growth and a strong  liberal  multilateral trading system. No effort is spared to assist developing countries in dealing with such obstacles to rapid  sustainable growth as debt problems  excessive economic dependence on raw materials  trade protectionism and structural bottlenecks  and in protecting their environment.The European Community and its member States believe that the evolving debt management strategy  which is based on a co-operative approach by all the parties concerned  remains the only viable response to the developing countries' debt problems. They continue actively to support attempts in all competent forums to find suitable growth-oriented solutions to the debt problems. Major initiatives have been taken since the last session of the General Assembly to strengthen and update the implementation of the debt strategy. In particular  the financial resources of the IMF  notably through the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility  the World Bank and the African Development Fund have been extended significantly. Following the conclusions of the recent Toronto economic summit  the poorest indebted developing countries should continue to benefit on a case-by-case basis from debt-service relief through the Paris Club.The Twelve are participating actively in the co-financing of internationally approved programmes. Moreover  the Community has also taken action on its own part. In December 1987 the Council of Ministers adopted a Community programme to fund certain highly indebted low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Under that programme  500 million ECUs were made available  of which 300 million ECUs were additional to existing commitments under the LomÃ© Convention. This facility was -rapidly put into effect. It is intended that these resources be fully disbursed by 99Ï. This initiative is tied in with the relevant measures being taken by the World Bank to help the indebted countries in Africa  measures with which most of the member States are also closely associated.The Community believes in the effective and efficient functioning of the economic and social sectors in the United Nations system. We stress our readiness explore with other parties any initiatives aimed at improving their operation.The Community has always shown a special interest in the problems of h-Saharan Africa. I think that the mid-term review of the United Nations programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 at the present session will give us the chance to evaluate together the results achieved and the progress made in this sector. But more needs to be done. Additional financial resources are needed to give that continent a chance to develop - a view that is supported in the report on financing African development. It is a fact that the majority of developing countries derive a large proportion of their revenue from the export of raw materials and first-stage processed products. They have therefore been adversely affected by the generally low level of commodity prices during the last few years. However  there are new signs of an increase in the prices for some commodities. There is a clear need to seek ways and means of bringing about a diversification of commodity-based economies and an approach to trade in commodities that takes into account market conditions. In this context  the Community and its member States operate a system of stabilization of export earnings. The Community and its member States are ready to play a constructive role in the proceedings of the Governing Council of the Common Fund for Commodities and expect other countries to do their part to enable the Fund  when it is brought into operation  to function with maximum efficiency consistent with the altered economic environment of the late 1980s.For all countries as a whole  another important development  one that calls for even greater attention than it commands today  is the depletion of natural resources  along with the degradation of the environment  to the detriment of future generations. It is becoming increasingly clear that progress depends not only on growth rates but also on the duality of such growth. The concept of sustainable development must - as was done by the participants of the Toronto economic summit - become endorsed by all countries. The Community is prepared to contribute to international environmental co-operation as mentioned at Toronto. We urge that similar resolve be demonstrated in all regions and organizations. We wholly support the action set in motion within the United Nations to promote sustainable development.With a view to the further improvement and expansion of international economic relations  the Community supports the development of a more open  viable and durable multilateral system of trade within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) through the negotiations under the Uruguay Round.It is imperative that in order to preserve a favourable negotiating climate  participants in the Uruguay Round should implement the commitments to standstill and rollback undertaken at Punta del Este.We are convinced that greater liberalization of international trade  which is envisaged in the new Round  will bring major benefits for all the countries taking an active part in the negotiations  and in particular the developing countries  which the Community is certainly not going to ask to take on obligations that are incompatible with their level of development. Indeed  the Community has accepted  in accordance with the commitments in the Punta del Este Declaration  that special attention should be given to the fullest liberalization of trade in tropical products which are of particular interest to developing countries  and has submitted concrete proposals in Geneva.It is not  moreover  a matter of chance that despite its sensitive nature and the problems encountered in international trade  for which all countries bear some responsibility  the agricultural sector in general  which is of particular interest to the developing countries  has been included among the items under negotiation.Having recognized this need  the Community has  for its part  since 1984  taken far-sighted measures with the aim of fundamentally restructuring its agriculture. In February 1988  we agreed upon a series of measures for a range of products which provide for automatic reductions of guaranteed support prices where production thresholds are exceeded  ensure that producers will bear a proportion of the costs of disposing of increased outputs  and facilitate the withdrawal of land from production. Clearly  these adaptations are helpful in the context of ongoing negotiations within the framework of the GATT Uruguay Round. As we indicated in our proposals  both short and long-term actions are needed to reduce support. All producing countries should contribute to this end with a view to the restoration of balance in the international markets.In December  at the ministerial meeting in Montreal  there will be a review of the results of two years of negotiations in all sectors. The Community is looking forward to the meeting in the hope of a fresh political impetus that will help to further advance all aspects of the negotiations. On the basis of the progress that is seen to have been achieved  guidelines will be established for the next phase  so that the entire effort will be in line with the principle of globality  that is  balanced results for all participants at the end of the negotiations.The Assembly will also be well aware of the close relations between the Community and the African  Caribbean and Pacific Group (ACP) which  within the framework of the Third LomÃ© Convention  are in many respects a model of relations between industrialized and developing countries.Already  with a view to the renewal of this Convention  those concerned are giving intensive consideration to the problem involved in an effort to further improve and promote co-operation. In this context  it is in the first place important to safeguard what has already been achieved in the earlier Convention  and in particular the priority given to agricultural development and security of supplies. At the same time it is necessary to adapt  in agreement with our ACP partners  the next convention in order to be able to respond more effectively to the current situation in those countries. The Community is intent on widening the range of its support for ACP-partner countries pursuing structural adjustment and confronted with grave macro-economic difficulties.The European Community has constantly supported the normalization  improvement and development of East-West relations at all levels and in all sectors.On 25 June the European Community and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON)  signed a joint declaration establishing official relations between them. Such relations are being established between the European Community and most of the member States of COMECON. These are very important steps and will  it is hoped  lead to the further development of East-West relations in general and economic relations in particular. These relations with our European neighbours should pave the way for the rapid development of intra-European co-operation and its extension to all sectors of common interest which are of mutual advantage. In this context  I should like to emphasize the importance of the European Community-Hungary Trade and Co-operation Agreement  which was signed yesterday. Agreements are also currently being negotiated with other COMECON member States and contacts are being maintained in order to define future relations with the remaining countries of the group. This is a clear indication of our desire to make substantive progress  where economic and political conditions allow  as opposed to the past when links between the Community and its Eastern European neighbours were either limited or non-existent.The European Community has  moreover  wide-ranging bilateral agreements with individual Mediterranean countries. The purpose of these agreements is to guarantee continued favourable access of those countries' exports to the Community market  provide financial assistance to agricultural and industrial development  and promote large-scale co-operation.The European Community has also developed  during the last few years  constructive relations with a number of Asian and Latin American countries. The wide-ranging co-operation agreement with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in particular registers very active progress.Since the Community is itself the reflection of a strategy of regional integration  it is only natural that it encourages and supports similar efforts of other countries in a way compatible with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). For that reason  it has also signed co-operation agreements with the Andean Pact and the Central American countries. Finally  the Community recently signed a co-operation Agreement with the Gulf Co-operation Council  which provides for the broadening and diversification of economic relations between the contracting parties and  in a second stage  should lead to the liberalization of bilateral trade.The completion of the internal market of the Community by the end of 1992 means  on the one hand  that goods  services  capital and people will move freely within the European Community. This holds true for imported goods as well as for goods produced in the Community. Therefore  as far as goods are concerned  1992 will mean better access for exports from third countries. All the European Community legislation regarding the removal of internal barriers will be consistent with GATT. The Community will seek to preserve the balance of advantages accorded  while respecting the unity and the identity of the internal market. As far as services are concerned  the Community will make sure that internal progress towards free circulation shall be translated into more free trade at the international level through progress in the Uruguay Round.On the other hand  the completion of the Common Market  through the combination of economies of scale and increased competition  will improve the structural adjustment capacity of the community  increase its growth performance and thereby improve prospects for world economic growth and international trade. More specifically  we believe that through this challenge and the efforts made through the structural  regional and social funds there will be a further one-point increase in the rate of growth of the Twelve  which will in turn bring about a further increase of 1.2 per cent in third-country exports to the single market of 32u million consumers. In short  the creation of a single European market will help to achieve greater economic liberalization internationally. "
"60",2852,"GRD",43,1988,"ï»¿I bring greetings from the Government and people of my country. My delegation joins. Sir  in the many expressions of esteem  felicitation  confidence and goodwill addressed to you as you assume the high office of President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly  to which the world looks with high expectancy and fervent hope for abundant success.Additionally  grateful appreciation is extended to your immediate predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic  for his skilful and expeditious conduct of the historic forty-second session of the General Assembly.My delegation wishes to place on record its pride in and gratitude for the outstanding contribution that the Secretary-General is making to the international community through his sound  skilful  judicious  committed and unobtrusive leadership.It is no accident that in many areas of the world peace appears to be springing forth. This can be attributed to the realization that there is nothing to be gained by the indefinite prolongation of conflicts within and among nations. On the contrary  so much is lost in terms of human lives and scarce resources that if conflicts are allowed to continue indefinitely  there can be neither winners nor losers in the end. The wind of change that is blowing in the direction of peace in the international community provides a favourable climate for its enhancement. The Secretary-General  a tireless disciple of peace  in his report on the work of the organization  dated 14 September 1988  said of the United Nations ""the small boat in which all the people of the Earth were gathered seemed to have caught a light but favourable wind."" (A/43/1  p. 2). Continuing that nautical metaphor  permit me to quote the words of the immortal William Shakespeare: ""There is a tide in the affairs of men  which  taken at the flood  leads on to fortune; emitted  all of the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries."" (Julius Caesar  IV: ill) The pieces of peace - if I may be permitted this clumsy pun - that are breaking out in certain regions of the world  afford the international community  whose prestige is on the rise  the opportunity to sail with the flood tide in the pursuit of peace.Grenada reaffirms its unswerving commitment to the United Nations  the Organization of American States  the Commonwealth  the Caribbean community and all other regional or international organisations which assist us in achieving our foreign policy objectives  the centrepiece of which is peace.My delegation notes with profound satisfaction the new detente and rapprochement between the super-Powers  whose relationship has for so long been a cause of concern in the international community. We hope that the improvement in relations will continue and serve to reduce tensions around the world. We take this opportunity to congratulate President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev on their contributions  and to urge them to continue their dialogue so that the process now begun may lead to a significant and internationally acceptable level of arms reduction  both nuclear and conventional - the kind of contribution to international peace and security that the world so desperately needs.Against this background  the international community notes with pleasure the strides made in the past months to secure peaceful solutions to seemingly intractable situations in certain regions of the world.In Afghanistan  the Geneva Accords  negotiated under the auspices of the Secretary-General and guaranteed by the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  afford the region the first real opportunity for the peaceful resolution of the conflict  which can provide the basis for self-determination by the Afghan people.The cease-fire  on 20 August  in the long and costly Iran-Iraq war  followed by face-to-face talks five days later in Geneva between high level representatives of the two countries  with the Secretary-General as mediator  gave hope to the world that at long last a long and costly conflict would finally come to an end. I wish; however  to remind the Assembly of the continuing plight of the members of the Bahai faith in Iran. They continue to suffer persecution and death because of their religious belief. The continuance of that problem will always be a hindrance to the attainment of peace and stability in that country  and I again call upon this body to take such steps as would cause the Iranian Government to grant to the Bahais their God-given right to the sacred freedom to worship God in their own way.The quadripartite discussions taking place among Angola  Cuba and South Africa  with the United States as mediator  offer some hope that with goodwill  good judgement and  whenever possible  resort to non-confrontational and non-adversarial positions  the independence of Namibia may be possible without further bloodshed or delay.In the interval between the last session of the General Assembly and the present  the situations in Cyprus  Kampuchea and Western Sahara have shown encouraging signs of peaceful resolution through political and diplomatic negotiations. There remain  however  other regional problems of concern to the international community. In the Middle East the festering relationship between Israel and the Palestinians has been further exacerbated by recent events on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. It is the hope of my delegation that those who preside over the destiny of nations  espousing first as individuals peace in their own hearts  will be capable of devising a formula that will be acceptable to all parties  that is to say a formula that satisfies the quest of the Palestinians for a homeland and protects their right to self-determination and recognizes the existence of Israel as a sovereign  independent State and also its right to exist within secure and recognized boundaries.The situation in Central America  where it was hoped that the signing of the Guatemala Procedure in August 1987 by the five Central American Presidents would quickly bear fruit  remains a matter of cautious optimism.Nevertheless my delegation views with a tremendous measure of satisfaction the efforts of the people of the region collectively to assess and define their security needs and to minimize the threat to the peace and stability of the area. We laud the leaders of the region for their initiatives to resolve their problems within the framework of consultation  co-ordination  co-operation and joint endeavour.The fate of the Korean peninsula - basically one family  now divided into two parts as a result of the Second World War - is a perfect example of the futility  Idiocy and tragedy of war. This dichotomous arrangement has resulted in prolonged human suffering of the roost heart-rending kind  where families related by affinity  consanguinity and spiritual relationship have been torn apart with only occasional opportunity to visit one another.My delegation spoke in the general debate last year. We expressed the view that  through the universal medium of sports and through the universal language of music  the world stood the best chance of attaining the universal goal of brotherhood. My delegation is still of that opinion. This reference was made in connection with the XXIV Olympiad recently completed in Seoul. We extend heartfelt congratulations to the Government and people of the Republic of Korea for successfully hosting the twenty-fourth Summer Olympic Games in Seoul  substantially free from politically motivated boycotts and tragedies.Moreover  it is the prayer and hope of my delegation that the inclusion of the item entitled  ""Promotion of peace  reconciliation and dialogue in the Korean peninsula""  in the Assembly's agenda at this session will be debated constructively  rationally and in the spirit of conciliation  to the end that a satisfactory resolution of the Korean dichotomy might appear on the horizon. In the case of the Korean peninsula  as in the case of so many areas of conflict  we need to explore the many hidden similarities in our apparent diversity. Let us concentrate on our collective strength rather than on our individual frailty.In view of the recent successes of the United Nations in mediating disputes in the international community  the time has come for us to consider seriously whether or not the objective of attaining national reunification between North and South Korea through dialogue and negotiation would be realized if both countries were granted full membership of the United Nations. We have a moral obligation to attempt to ensure that peace  stability and reconciliation do not continue to elude the people of the Korean peninsula. I therefore wish to propose that this question of membership be given immediate consideration so that the over 70 million people of the peninsula could be accorded their right to representation among the membership of this Organization.I crave the indulgence of delegations to speak a few words with respect to my country  Grenada  five years after it was rudely and abruptly thrust upon the national and international some following the execution of the Prime Minister and a number of innocent citizens as a result of a vicious intra-party struggle for power. This dramatic and cataclysmic episode took place on 25 October 1983. After law and order were restored  an interim administration was created. Its main term of reference was to create the climate and prepare the country for general elections and the return to pluralistic  participatory  parliamentary democracy  which Grenada had always enjoyed except in the period 1979 to 1983  when ideological bigots came into power  having overthrown the elected government by force. In the general elections one year later  in December 1984  the people of Grenada elected my party by an overwhelming majority. I am happy to report to this fraternal forum of the United Nations that today Grenada is at peace and that human rights and individual freedoms are scrupulously guaranteed.A few cardinal principles inform and constitute the basis of our conduct within the global family  that is  equality  respect for the sovereignty and independence of States and for their right freely to choose their social and economic systems. Grenada does not subscribe to reproach and recrimination in pursuit of its international relations.My delegation wishes to refute as utter nonsense the propaganda of a few disgruntled members of this fraternal forum to the effect that there are still foreign forces in my country. The few countries which persist in this course of conduct have neither a democratic experience nor a democratic culture. I am pleased to report that the ballot-box replaced the gun as the ultimate instrument of political discourse in Grenada and to state boldly  categorically and without fear of challenge that there are no foreign troops in my country and that this has been so since 1985.Grenada shares the concerns and suffers the consequences of the vulnerability of island developing countries  in particular  and of developing countries  in general. With regard to the question of the specificity of the problems of island developing countries  the destruction recently visited upon Jamaica by Hurricane Gilbert also brings into sharp focus the vulnerability of islands to natural disasters.It is to be hoped that in devising a strategy of emergency assistance to Jamaica the international community would bear in mind the fragility of island economies. Moreover  under agenda item 82 (b)  the General Assembly is being called upon to countenance a series of measures that could alleviate the problems experienced by this specific category of developing countries.My delegation issues a call to United Nations agencies and individual nations to respond more favourably to our valid appeals for special consideration.The General Assembly should also be cognizant of the threat to the ecosystem of island developing countries posed by coastal pollution resulting from the dumping of wastes at sea. Indeed  the recent unpleasant experiences of marine pollution in several parts of the world have highlighted the deleterious effects of resorting to the ocean as a giant dumping-ground. Thus  over and above the concerns being addressed under agenda item 64 (k)  it is imperative that a programme of action against all types of dumping of harmful wastes at sea - be they nuclear  industrial or medical - be devised  thereby saving future generations from potential environmental suicide.In the matter  of the effective functioning of the United Nations my delegation would like to register its concerns regarding the financial situation of the Organization. The fact that there are in essence two agenda items which address the issue  items 50 and 116  is indicative of the paramount importance of the question. It is to be hoped that any revision of the scale of assessments will adhere to the principle of ""equitable apportionment"" and will respect the capacity of Member States to pay. There should not be the anomaly of developed countries benefiting from a reduction in their scale of assessed contributions  while certain debt-distressed developing countries are burdened with an upward revision of their financial obligations to the Organization.The external debt problem with its adverse global economic consequences  especially in the developing countries  is a perfect example of how international peace and security can be threatened by a situation which can have dire social  political and economic consequences . Debt repayment and debt-servicing pose a hardship for  and stranglehold on  the economies of many developing countries  akin to a millstone around their necks. While the repayment of debt is a legal and moral responsibility of the debtor  debt relief should be a humane and moral consideration of some of the creditors  who  in the context of the present global situation  may be practising simple justice  by putting back into the good earth a little of what has been taken out. History is replete with examples of how exploitation and injustice could have contributed to the debt problem. To the least developing countries  whose social and humanitarian programmes are held in abeyance because of debt repayment and debt-servicing  the cynicism mingled with humour of a socio-economist can be applied  namely that the inherent vice in some economic systems is the unequal sharing of blessings  while the inherent virtue in others is the equal sharing of miseries. In the final analysis  if the external debt problem is allowed to remain unsolved and unmitigated the economies of both developed and developing countries stand to suffer.An area of global interest and common concern is the illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances which  like the plague  is spreading over the face of the earth and gnawing at the very fabric of society. Concomitant with the craze for these dangerous substances is the proportionate increase in the level of violence which is fast becoming a seamy sub-culture in some societies. It is generally believed that drugs and international terrorism have a direct relationship. This twin menace is growing bolder every day and wreaking havoc on innocent and unsuspecting people. We favour a multidimensional approach to the tackling of this awesome problem involving the agencies of education  health and law enforcement in the three crucial areas of the production  trafficking and consumption of drugs.	'Another area of global concern is the rapid spread of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)  which  like a scourge  is approaching pandemic proportions. In this regard the United Nations prestigious world Health Organization (WHO) should continue to focus on the aetiology  prognosis and therapy for this health hazard  which has dangerous social consequences.The odious and pernicious practice of racial hatred  apartheid  in South Africa remains the greatest impediment not only to peace in southern Africa but to world peace generally. This institutionalized and systematized phenomenon of racism attempts to place a stranglehold on democratic advancement in southern Africa and continues to deprive the black man of his rights to freedom and self-determination.If our response is to apply pressure on the South African Government to dismantle the apartheid system  then towards that objective ray delegation favours the employment of collective  comprehensive  mandatory sanctions against South Africa  we are not persuaded by the arguments advanced by a few influential actors in the international community that sanctions will adversely affect the black majority in South Africa. We observe with interest that the imposition of sanctions is a potent and attractive option which is applied selectively as a punitive measure or as one designed or calculated to draw concessions. In any event  it is folly and presumptuous on the part of other countries to attempt to speak on behalf of the black majority of South Africa. Rather  their concerns should be reflected in concerted appeals to the authorities in South Africa to initiate negotiations with the legitimate leaders of the people.If it is determined that a spokesman is required  then pressure should be directed at the South African Government to release  unconditionally  the most articulate and authoritative spokesman of the black cause. Nelson Mandela. This drum major for justice in South Africa has been imprisoned unjustifiably for 26 years. We call upon the Government of South Africa to free him now so that he may be able to participate effectively in shaping the destiny of his country and his people.We call on South Africa to suspend armed intervention in the front-line States and to respect their sovereignty and territorial integrity. Tremendous progress towards a peaceful and amicable resolution of the regional conflict could be achieved with the speedy implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 435 (1978) for the independence of Namibia which  in my delegation's view  constitutes the only real basis for the attainment of this objective. Finally  the curtain has risen on the forty-third session of the General Assembly under favourable auspices. The contours of peace are beginning to appear in many regions  the erstwhile battlegrounds of ideological conflicts and actual war. Just as we know in the physical sciences that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction which can be measured quantitatively  so too  to a limited extent  we can extend the same idea to the social sciences in which peace is central  by applying a qualitative measurement of the promising peaceful events taking place in many regions of the world. The centrifugal forces of discord and disquietude are beginning to yield to centripetal forces of peace and concordance within nations and among nations. The Washington and Moscow summit meetings between President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev and the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  with verification provisions  are factors which we hope will contribute further to long-term global peace. My delegation wants to believe  however  that the triad of disarmament  development and solidarity  which have a syllogistic relationship  affords humankind the best hope of attaining the universal goal of peace and brotherhood for which the world has been waiting so patiently and so long.May God bless us and guide us as we continue our deliberations in pursuit of these lofty aims."
"61",2899,"GTM",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of the delegation of Guatemala  which I have the honour to head  I wish to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. He enjoys the support of the international community represented here  because of our esteem for his country and his well-known diplomatic skills and personal attributes.I take this opportunity to reaffirm my admiration for the work carried out by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. During his term he has set an example of dedication to the Organization  placing his talent  enthusiasm and tenacity at the service of the United Nations and the cause of international peace and security.I wish also to congratulate the United Nations peace-keeping forces on having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.The international peace and security guaranteed by the United Nations requires that we focus our efforts on the strengthening of our institutions  both within our countries and in our international relations and our gradual adaptation to the demands of the realities of the time. The United Nations must gradually become an instrument enabling the principles of its founding Charter to be fulfilled in all nations. All countries must strive towards institutional compliance with the obligations set out in the Charter.Over the past 32 months my country has shown its belief in compliance with the principles of the United Nations  and we shall not rest but do everything necessary to remain firm in that determination. Obviously  the noble purposes of the United Nations cannot be achieved while a part of mankind continues to live in poverty and ignorance. All human beings have the right to dignity  progress and intellectual and spiritual development. The priority task of the United Nations  apart from the quest for international peace and security  must unquestionably be to strengthen co-operation in promoting the all-round development of the poorest countries. We are convinced of the value of dialogue as the most effective way of settling disputes and removing tension  and our foreign policy is based on the basic need for peace. In our international relations we reject the threat and use of force and spare no effort in the quest for peaceful political solutions. We continue to observe these essential values both internally and externally. We condemn human rights violations wherever they occur. That clear and definitive stand has been recognized by the international community. Because of all our efforts in this important task  international personalities and organizations understand that in my country the Government of the Republic guarantees the full enjoyment of human rights and unrestricted exercise of all freedoms. Our foreign policy is in keeping with the purposes and principles of the charters of the United Nations and the Organization of American States. We reaffirm our belief in the self-determination of peoples and in non-intervention; in ideological and political pluralism; and in the settlement of disputes through peaceful means. Our international policy at the Central American level is one of solidarity and fraternity  continuously promoting the values that sustain our convictions. We recognize and promote a Latin Americanist sentiment and we stand in solidarity with the just aspirations of ail third-world countries. We too wish for an international order based on justice and equity.In this context  I wish to refer to my country's deep concern over the external debt problem  given its overriding importance for our countries. More than five years have elapsed since the first initiatives were taken in this area  but not only does the problem persist but there have been no positive prospects for a solution. I believe that the time has come to analyse the problem once again  theÂ· time through a more realistic and pragmatic approach  lb this end a basic strategy should be established by taking account of the positions and interests of the debtor and creditor countries alike  not only in financial terms but also through a broader  more comprehensive approach  without underestimating other problems such as political  social and economic problems which stem from or are the cause of the debt problem.Our countries cannot afford not to grow  sacrificing their economic expansion to honour 'their financial commitments. Neither can we forget the impact this is having on the standard of living of the majority. On the contrary  Governments are accountable to their peoples; that is why my Government has decided gradually to take care of the social debt consisting of the accumulation of health  education and housing needs which for years had not been met. Hence my country is in favour of holding a meeting to seek multilateral  comprehensive solutions to the anguishing problem of foreign debt. The Central American crisis is deeply rooted in past injustices - social injustice  economic injustice and political injustice. Our recent history is replete with examples of institutional needs - the lack of democratic processes  the absence of pluralism and the denial of democratic participation. There has been much speculation on the peace process in Central America. I wish at this time to state the following: peace in Central America will not result solely from the political will of Central American Governments or peoples; peace in Central America as a fundamental goal will entail a long  difficult and complex process. The root causes of the crisis obtaining today in Central America are authoritarianism  misunderstanding. Intolerance  alienation of certain groups  poverty and illegitimate government. That means that the peace which is so deeply desired by 25 million Central Americans  and sought by almost all countries of the world cannot be attained solely through good will on our part.The goal of peace urgently requires clear and transparent processes of internal democratisation in each of our countries  so that every citizen In Central America will enjoy a certain and secure area so that our peoples will become the protagonists of their own destinies  the builders of their own future. We require all the inhabitants of Central America to play a leading role in forming their social model and their historical destiny. To this end  it is essential and urgent to bring about the basic conditions needed for the comprehensive development of the human person - and that means social justice  economic justice and political justice.If we truly wish for peace for each and every one of our countries  as we stated in the document entitled ""Procedure for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace in Central America""  we must continually  in the eyes of the world and before history which is our judge  give testimony of our resolve to maintain  above all  a leading role for our peoples  legitimate government  pluralistic and democratic participation and the unalterable applicability of fundamental human rights and freedoms.It is not enough to speak out and to make promises) we must take action and demonstrate that we are taking action.On 14 January 1986 President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala initiated and promoted steps at the Central American level with a view to arriving at an instrument for peace. It was in Guatemala that the two historic meetings of Esquipulas were held  meetings which gave form and content to the Esquipulas II plan  the Guatemala procedure to maintain Ð° firm and lasting peace in Central America. It was President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala who proposed forming a Central American parliament - an appropriate forum and a fitting instrument for discussing the political problems of the area  the economic problems that weigh upon us  and Central American integration as a model of unity to which we Central Americans have aspired for so long.President Cerezo  the Government of the Republic and the people of Guatemala have spared no effort to promote peace in the Central American subregion. We have drawn up procedures and proposed actions} we have accepted advice and criteria; we have done everything within our means and we will not rest until we attain the goal we have set ourselves. After 32 months of work on  involvement in and commitment to this process  we are able to say to the peoples of the world that we in Central America are continually making progress in building this model - a model in which Central Americans have taken on the leading role that history requires of us  valiantly and resolutely shouldering out own responsibilities  We are facing up to the complexity of our problems with goodwill  imagination  resolve f 1 faith. Today Central America is not the Central America of two years ago  nor is it the Central America we hope to see in a short time  but in Central America today new areas have been opened up and we are marching towards the fu LureÂ·  above all  we know full well that we cannot turn back. We know that the task ahead is difficult but we will continue to strive to find appropriate  timely and correct solutions. In this process  we require the goodwill  solidarity and co-operation not only of international institutions but also of all the peoples of the world.Here I wish to refer in parenthesis to the valuable and noble solidarity of the Contadora Group and Support Group countries. Those brother countries became involved in our problems and opened up for us valuable and worthwhile opportunities  putting us on the path we had to follow.X also wish to express gratitude on behalf of my country  Guatemala - and I am sure that I am reflecting the feelings of the 25 million Central Americans - for the valuable and timely co-operation given us by the United Nations  which is actively seeking mechanisms to implement a plan for the economic and social development of Central America.We are also grateful for the solidarity and co-operation of the European Economic Community  which  in many forums and institutions  has joined us in the quest for peace in Central America. We thank the United States of America for its constant display of solidarity and co-operation  and all the peoples of the world which have joined us in pursuing the cause of peace.I am happy to take this opportunity to state that the Government of the Republic of Guatemala has fulfilled  and will continue firmly to fulfil  the commitments entered into within the framework of Esquipulas. We have maintained  and will continue to maintain  a policy of active neutrality with regard to the Central American crisis  so that the peace process may result in the establishment of conditions of democracy  freedom  prosperity and respect for the human rights of Central Americans  their eight to the territorial integrity and their right to self-determination and to choose their own way of life.	.We are giving new evidence of that  with President Cerezo  a number of us last week visited the other countries of Central America to propose new mechanisms to revitalize and reinvigorate the procedure for seeking peace in Central America. I can tell our friends throughout the world that in November there will be another meeting of the Central American Presidents  in the sister Republic of El Salvador  to assess - and this way involve self-criticism - the extent to which we have not been able to comply with Esquipalas II  and to strengthen the will and the commitment to comply with all its provisions The path that we have followed in Guatemala to achieve a democratic Government that is respectful of its role  the guarantor of freedoms and the faithful interpreter of the aspirations of the Guatemalan people has been long and difficult. My Government faced a difficult task 32 months ago - that of rebuilding a country that was just awakening to the dawn of a democratic era. It is no easy task to initiate and consolidate a de no era tic process in such a short time. Its enemies are many  as are misunderstandings and frustrations. In ray country the majority were forgotten  only marginally benefiting from development and enjoying only minimum respect for their fundamental rights. Today we are learning how to live in a democracy. Guiding a people with a tradition of lack of understanding and intolerance requires moral strength and a firm commitment. Our daily struggle is hard  as we wish to build a truly free  truly just and truly united land. Our commitment is the result of our unbending will  our democratic faith and our historical experience.However  as we strive to consolidate democracy we face the intransigence of extremist elements using every means available to them to deny us democratic opportunities  slandering and discrediting the process and using international forums and the good will of some representatives to mislead and to distort the truth of what is happening in my country  presenting pictures of earlier times  not of what is now going on in Guatemala.Here I would appeal to the international community not to allow itself to be misled by groups that politicise human rights committees  thus trying to win outside the country battles that they have lost within it. Condemnation and criticism of countries that have started on democratic consolidation are no help. We have this year worked closely with the expert adviser rightly designated by the Commission on Human Rights  with whom we have prepared a plan of support for national institutions that promote respect for human rights and monitor compliance with the law and its correct implementation.This is not the appropriate forum in which to go into details about the progress made in this matter. However  I would refer to the case of Guatemalan refugees outside the country  who have continued to return. This year there was a 300 per cent increase in the numbers of those returning  encouraged by the internal democratic climate and by the support that the State  in co-operation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  is offering them. In this regard  I wish to emphasize the importance of the choice oÂ£ Guatemala as the host country of the first international conference on Central American refugees  to be held next year. We hope that the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  will honour us by opening the session.We are determined to maintain and consolidate not only political democracy  but also economic democracy  eliminating the serious inequalities that exist  the alienation of many groups in our population  and extreme poverty  and overcoming the lack of opportunities for our young  all with the aim of achieving true social justice.We seek to establish a broad-based  non-sectarian Government  and we ate achieving that. With social and human sensitivity and a sense of tolerance  but modestly  we are establishing a Government based on participatory democracy  with profound respect for every citizen. The policy that we are carrying out is based on the conviction that man can and must play a central part in his own history. The Government is working with justifiable optimism  aware of the hard  creative to assess - and this may involve self-criticism - the extent to which we have not been able to comply with Esquipulas 11  and to strengthen the will and the commitment to comply with all its provisions.The path that we have followed in Guatemala to achieve a democratic Government that is respectful of its role the guarantee of freedoms and the faithful interpreter of the aspirations of the Guatemalan people has been long and difficult. My Government faced a difficult task 32 months ago - that of rebuilding a country that was just awakening to the dawn of a democratic era. It is no easy task to initiate and consolidate a democratic process in such a short time. Its enemies are many  as are misunderstandings and frustrations. In my country the majority were forgotten  only marginally benefiting from development and enjoying only minimum respect for their fundamental rights.

Our commitment is the result of our unbending will  our democratic faith and our historical experience.However  as we strive to consolidate democracy we face the intransigence of extremist elements using every means available to them to deny us democratic opportunities  slandering and discrediting the process and using international forums and the good will of some representatives to mislead and to distort the truth of what is happening in ray country  presenting pictures of earlier times  not of what is now going on in Guatemala.Here I would appeal to the international community not to allow itself to be misled by groups that politicise human rights committees  thus trying to win outside the country battles that they have lost within it. Condemnation and criticism of countries that have started on democratic processes is not helpful. We put forth our efforts together with all the people of Guatemala  who because of their patriotism  their hardworking spirit  their moral and spiritual stature and their readiness to overcome difficulties and adversities  have been called upon to fulfil a great destiny.I can give an assurance at this world forum that the democratic Government of Guatemala is meeting the challenge of history with unshakeable will and resolve. "
"62",2988,"HND",43,1988,"ï»¿Mr. President I take especial pleasure in conveying to you my Government 's satisfaction at the decision taken by this Assembly to place the representative oÂ£ a recently restored democracy in charge of our deliberations. That decision is  without any doubt  based on recognition of your personal merit and of your professional skills. It is also an honour to your country  with which we are fraternally linked by bonds of history and geography and by our common identification with the ideals and principles underlying democracy. We are sure that  under your guidance  this Assembly will conduct its business in a manner which will ensure its complete success.Similarly  I wish to express to your predecessor  Mr. Peter H. Florin  our congratulations on the sound  intelligent and constructive manner in which he conducted the business of the last session of the Assembly.Over the last few months  mankind has witnessed - at first with disbelief and  later  with mounting hope - the way in which a number of the crises from which the world had been suffering seemed to be nearing a solution  thanks to a combination of new circumstances. The conflicts in the Persian Gulf  Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Cyprus  Western Sahara and southern Africa appear to be moving towards a negotiated solution.Among the circumstances which have helped restore faith in the ability of human beings to resolve their differences in a peaceful manner  mention must be made  on the one hand  of the detente in the relations between the super-Power s resulting from a realistic and positive dialogue between the United States of America and the Soviet Union and  on the other  to the role played by the  Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Pates de Cuellar  in his quest for negotiated settlements to those conflicts. His prudence  diplomatic tact and amply demonstrated perseverance are factors of fundamental importance which now allow  us to glimpse a process of peace in various regions suffering from conflicts. I wish to offer to the Secretary-General our gratitude for his extraordinary hard work for peace and also our encouragement to him in his efforts.	My Government reiterates its faith in  and support for  the purposes and principles of the United Nations  compliance with which is the best guarantee of the maintenance of international peace and security and also the best means of promoting the economic and social progress of all peoples.My Government wishes also to place on record its concern over the financial straits in which the Organization finds itself  which prevents it from fully meeting its objectives. The financial crisis continues to threaten the Organization notwithstanding the efforts made by the Secretary-General to implement the recommendations of the Group of Eighteen.We share the joy that is felt over the progress made in the negotiations with a view to the elimination of the spectre of a nuclear confrontation. The success achieved by the United States and the Soviet Union in agreeing on a treaty which means that  for the first time  there will be an actual reduction of nuclear delivery systems  is a step we all applaud. We trust that the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - will be a prelude to new agreements eliminating forever the threat of a nuclear holocaust and inaugurating a new era of understanding  peace and prosperity for all. The cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq and the start of negotiations between the parties is also a source of pride for our Organization. In keeping with the principle that all disputes can and must be resolved by peaceful means  we encourage those States that have suffered so terribly from the scourge of war to renew their efforts to find a peaceful  just and lasting solution to their disputes.We wish to stress the importance for world peace of the complete and final withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghan territory. It is to be hoped that this process will lead to reconciliation for the Afghan people and to the exercise of its right to self-determination.We are likewise encouraged by the talks taking place in Geneva with the participation of the Governments of Angola  Cuba  the United States of America and South Africa with a view to creating conditions that would enable Namibia to achieve independence and thus reduce tensions in that part of the world.We view with enthusiasm the positive turn taken by events in Western Sahara  where agreements are now beginning to emerge which  it is hoped  will lead to a settlement between the parties to the conflict. In this respect  the resumption of diplomatic relations between Algeria and Morocco has been a constructive factor.Regrettably the spirit of conciliation has not spread to other delicate situations in the world  such as the case of Kampuchea  where lack of agreement has prevented the withdrawal of occupation troops under international supervision. None the less  we are confident that the efforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nations will bear fruit In the near future.Honduras wishes to express once again its sincere hope that the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom will resolve their dispute over the Malvinas Islands through negotiation. We exhort the countries of the Middle East to put forth their best efforts to find a lasting solution to their dispute. The agreements arrived at by Egypt and  Israel are proof that the determination to promote peace  even in a region which has been a witness to bloody and prolonged conflicts  can bear fruit. In this respect  Honduras endorses the holding of an international peace conference on the Middle East.My delegation reiterates its view that the question of Korea must be resolved peacefully through dialogue and negotiations between South Korea and North Korea. Faithful to the principle of universality for this Organization  we reaffirm our belief that it is essential for all nations that endorse the principles of the San Francisco Charter to belong to the United Nations.My country wishes to emphasize its repudiation of all policies of discrimination  in particular the policy of apartheid  which the Government of South Africa continues to apply.One of the problems that my Government views with mounting concern is that of the illegal production of  trafficking in and consumption of narcotics. Honduras  as is the case of other neighbouring States in Central America and the Caribbean  by the mere fact of its geographical situation  equidistant from drug-producing and drug-consuming countries  feels threatened by the continuing attempts to use its territory as a bridge for drug trafficking. We wish to place on record our resolute support for the struggle against the scourge of drugs and our determination to participate in the new international efforts to halt the illegal narcotics traffic  as we have in the past.In the sphere of international co-operation for the solution of economic  social  cultural and humanitarian problems  we wish to acknowledge once again the work done by the Organization  particularly through the United Nations Development Programme. We fully share the concern expressed in this Assembly by the President of Venezuela who said that the need to overcome the problem of external indebtedness is fundamental to the attainment of social development. The Government of Honduras takes great pleasure in the decision by the United Nations Children's Rind (UNICEF) to establish in Tegucigalpa a regional office that will make it possible to deal more effectively and efficiently with the important programmes it is implementing in the Central American isthmus. We also welcome the presentation at this session of the Secretary-General's report on co-operation between the United Nations and the Organization of American States. The fact that both organizations pursue the same objectives dictates the need for a common endeavour. Our initiative  adopted last year  calling for closer and more productive co-operation between the United Nations and the Organization of American States was designed to achieve this goal.One of the organs of the United Nations system whose work in the Central American area deserves special emphasis is the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The Central American crisis  which is characterized by domestic crises in some of the countries of the region  has resulted in the international displacement of hundreds of thousands of people seeking security. Honduras shares borders with the three countries in the region in which civil wars or internal armed conflicts have taken place and have led to massive floods of refugees.Honduras extends protection in its territory at the present time to approximately 45 000 refugees - Nicaraguan  Salvadorians and  to a lesser extent  Guatemalans - in camps which receive assistance from UNHCR. To that number we must add about 200 000 citizens from those countries who have entered Honduras since 1979 and are living widely scattered over our national territory  in many cases lacking proper documentation. For a small country such as Honduras  which is struggling with great determination and self-sacrifice to emerge from underdevelopment  the entry of so many refugees into its territory imposes a burden that exceeds its capabilities. In this respect  it is essential to find a permanent solution to the problems of the placement of those refugees  whether by facilitating their repatriation  which necessarily requires a successful effort at democratization and domestic reconciliation in the countries concerned  or by their relocation in third countries. I wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to UNHCR for its difficult and meritorious work in connection with the material care of Central American refugees and in facilitating their voluntary repatriation.It is worth emphasizing that in May 1989 an international conference on Central American refugees will be held in Guatemala  with the participation of Mexico and the support of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  in order to find practical solutions to the problems of the repatriation of Central American refugees. We hope that the international community  which has so often expressed its interest in helping resolve Central American problems  will play an effective part in this international endeavour  which is of vital importance to our countries.Last year the General Assembly adopted resolutions 42/1 and 42/204  calling urgently for the preparation of a special plan of economic co-operation for Central America. The Secretary-General has already submitted to the Assembly  in document A/42/949  the special plan drawn up with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean  in close co-ordination with the Central American Governments and Central American regional institutions. This plan had the support of all the Members of the Assembly  which made it possible for the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme  at a later date to allocate special funds for the promotion  co-ordination  implementation and follow-up of the plan and the attainment of its objectives. Honduras is a small country situated in the heart of Central America between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans  and sharing a border with El Salvador  Guatemala and Nicaragua. Honduras pursues two fundamental objectives in its foreign policy; strengthening the democratic regime chosen by Hondurans as their way of life and government  and guaranteeing our citizens access to better levels of well-being. A basic prerequisite for the attainment of these objectives is a peaceful  stable and secure environment in the Central American isthmus  for which we have been struggling vigorously.Our foreign policy is pursued in compliance with the norms and principles of international law  in particular  the peaceful settlement of disputes  fulfilment in good faith of commitments entered into  respect for the right of peoples to self-determination  and the promotion and protection of human rights. These are the objectives which Ñ Government has sought to achieve  notwithstanding the crisis which has afflicted the region since the latter part of the last decade. That is why we have taken an active part in the negotiations sponsored by the Contadora Group and its Support Group  and later in connection with the Esquipulas II agreements. Esquipulas II is to a great extent a response to the regional crisis  in that it establishes a procedure agreed upon by the five Governments of the area aimed at the return of internal normalcy in the countries that have endured civil war and the strengthening of the democratic system of government.It should be recalled that on 16 October 1987 the General Assembly adopted resolution Ã2/1  voicing its roost resolute support for the Esquipulas process. In that resolution the Assembly renewed its support for a negotiated solution to the crisis  a support it has demonstrated since 1983.Honduras has fulfilled the obligations deriving from that process  including the deposit of the basic instrument of the Central American parliament. However  it is impossible to overlook the fact that the particular situation of those countries that are experiencing internal armed conflict is a determining factor in the regional crisis.Honduras acknowledges the difficulties that have arisen at the negotiating table owing to the complexity of the situation. In certain cases  the armed opposition has sought objectives quite contrary to democratic principles. But in other cases it is precisely the lack of will on the part of the authorities that has provoked a deadlock in the dialogue between the Governments and the opposition forces. That internal lack of will is also reflected in foreign policy. Indeed  the government of Nicaragua  which together with the other Central American Governments signed the Esquipulas II Agreements  has obsessively engaged in international actions that are mutually incompatible. Honduras has underlined that incompatibility both in this Assembly and in other bodies in order that the historical record will show that regional efforts to bring about peace have been adversely affected by the attitude of the Nicaragua Government. I refer to the legal proceedings brought by Nicaragua against Honduras in the International Court of Justice on the very same matter that is being dealt with in the regional political process. That incompatibility between legal recourse and the political procedure of Esquipulas II has emptied the latter process of its substance  thus thwarting the peace initiative of President Arias  endangering the plan Sot special economic co-operation for Central America adopted by the United Nations and even jeopardizing the co-operation between the European Economic Community and Central America - all efforts fully supported by Honduras.In July 1986 the Sandinist Government brought suit against Honduras and Costa Rica before the International Court of Justice for reasons it would be irrelevant to mention here since what is of importance is to save Esquipulas II.Honduras and Costa Rica  on the basis of applicable law  argued that the International Court of Justice lacked jurisdiction  both Governments emphasizing that they could not continue negotiating while the suit initiated by Nicaragua was still pending.On the basis of this criterion  upon signing the ""Procedure for the establishment of a firm and lets ting peace in Central America"" - Esquipulas II - Nicaragua withdrew the action against Costa Rica and promised to withdraw its suit against Honduras  a commitment it has not yet fulfilled.On the contrary  the Sandinist Government  violating the principle of good faith  sought to use its law suit as an element of pressure on Esquipulas ÎI.In view of this Sandinist stubbornness  and with the purpose of freeing implementation of Esquipulas II from the interference of the judicial procedure  Honduras requested the International Court of Justice to hold the oral phase on the question of jurisdiction  which took place in June this year. The Court's lack of jurisdiction in this case was firmly demonstrated before the Court by Honduras.The Government of Nicaragua has used the judicial proceedings in the International Court of Justice as a means of diversion  apparently with the purpose of justifying its lack of compliance with its own commitment in regard to national reconciliation  democratization and repatriation of the million Nicaraguan refugees - one third of the Nicaraguan population - which are now scattered around the world.The negotiations between the government of Nicaragua and the Nicaraguan resistance undertaken in Sapoa  Nicaragua  are unmistakable proof that the case brought against Honduras belongs to what in the practice of the Court is known as ""ongoing or fluid situations"" and is therefore not appropriate for judicial decision.Evidence produced in connection with these cases is intrinsically inappropriate and unsuitable for consideration by the Court.During the negotiations held by the Sandinist Government and the Nicaraguan resistance in the town of Sapoa  Nicaragua  both parties reached agreements in principle on security matters. Those agreements assumed the character of an international treaty  since the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States and representatives of the Catholic Church took part in the negotiations as qualified witnesses. The signing of the final document of Sapoa on 23 March this year was attended by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega himself.It is worthy of special mention that in that Sapoa agreement the parties to the conflict solemnly agreed to suspend military operations of an offensive character throughout the national territory - I repeat: to suspend military operations of an offensive character throughout the national territory.It is very difficult to reconcile this carefully chosen language with the accusations levelled by Nicaragua against Honduras to the effect that Honduras is hosting and supporting armed groups that supposedly carry out offensive actions from the frontier zone against the Government of Nicaragua.The reality is that the Nicaraguan resistance has never been recognized by my Government and its limited and sporadic presence in the Honduran frontier zones has been a de facto situation similar to what happened in the past with the Sandinistas  who also used our territory as a sanctuary in their fight against the Somoza regime.I consider it essential to emphasize that in the same Sapoa agreement  the Sandinista Government and the Nicaraguan resistance defined territorial enclaves within Nicaragua that add up to 20 000 square kilometres  almost the size of the republic of Î1 Salvador  where the resistance should concentrate without laying down their weapons until an agreement on a definitive cease-fire had been reached. It was also stipulated that the Nicaraguan resistance could receive foreign humanitarian assistance. It is a well-known fact that the Sandinista Government has deliberately delayed the negotiations on these points. In the light of these facts  the continuation of Nicaragua's suit against Honduras is totally absurd. It is the Sandinist Government  not the Government of Honduras  that recognizes the rebel army in its status as a belligerent organization with a territorial base  with the capacity to negotiate on an equal footing with the Government of its country. It is the Sandinist Government that negotiates and defines territorial enclaves  acknowledging the armed presence of irregular forces inside its own territory. It is the Sandinist Government that has agreed  as a matter of principle  to the delivery of foreign humanitarian aid to its armed opposition within the territorial enclaves inside Nicaragua.But the most absurd aspect of this hullabaloo is that the Sandinist Government  which calls on the Government of Honduras to prevent the use of its territory by the Nicaraguan resistance  defined at Sapoa three territorial enclaves  with an area of 8 000 square kilometres and a length of about 230 kilometres adjacent to Honduran territory.The Sapoa Agreement is the most eloquent testimony to the international conduct of the Sandinist Government  which  while calling for an international commission of inspection to verify the non-use by armed groups of territories adjacent to its two land frontiers  promotes conditions in which the Nicaraguan resistance can make use of Honduran frontier zones. By denying foreign humanitarian assistance  it inevitably compels the rebel army to infiltrate Honduran territory out of the sheer will to survive.How can Nicaragua dare thus to accuse Honduras  when its own nationals are crossing into Honduran territory to escape extermination? Was it not the Sandinist Government itself that agreed at Sapoa to have three enclaves right up against the Honduran border where the Nicaraguan resistance was to concentrate? How is it possible to reconcile  from the point of view of logic and political ethics  the  contradictory and irresponsible use of incompatible international procedures? Is it not clear that this is a political manoeuvre to serve the destructive domestic and international purposes of the Sandinist Government?The democratic and constitutional Government of President JosÃ© Azona has fulfilled all the obligations of Esquipulas II and has fundamentally met the obligation to maintain domestic peace. It has even established a national commission for reconciliation  though since 1957 Honduras has fulfilled the constitutional mandate to form governments of national conciliation. Lastly  it has approved  ratified and deposited the constituent instrument of the Central American parliament  also provided for in Esquipulas II.Given the disruptive elements that characterize and have caused the crisis in Central America - in particular the desire for political and military hegemony of a super-Power alien to the American continent  and the resistance provoked by such ambitions - it is essential that this problem have an international and global solution.In this forum my Government endorses the proposal we submitted on 12 November last year in the General Assembly of the Organization of American States  and in that respect  urges the Secretary-General .of the United Nations to work cowards the establishment of an international peace force consisting of units from Canada  Spain and the Federal Republic of Germany  to be stationed along the frontiers between Honduras  BÃ Salvador and Nicaragua to guarantee that Honduran frontier territory is not used by the armed insurgents in those countries. Honduras has frontiers with the two Central American countries in which several wars are now going on. Those internal conflicts are being fed by the two hegemonistic super-Powers.How can the Government of Honduras be compelled to disband the armed insurgent movements of Nicaragua and El Salvador when that would mean bringing Honduras into confrontation with the policies of those super-Powers? On what grounds is an attempt being made to impose on Honduras an obligation to resolve the security problems of neighbouring States? It is a universally recognized truth that the Central American crisis is a problem of a complex international character. Consequently  it is for the international community to bear its responsibilities for the maintenance of regional peace and security without excluding an international peace-keeping force. That force  through inspection and enforcement actions where necessary  would guarantee the non-use of Honduran frontier territory by Salvadoran and Nicaraguan rebels.However  it should be recalled that the Esquipulas II procedure was designed for the purpose of resolving not just the problem of Nicaraguan security  but also that of putting an end to the subversion  financed by foreign sources  of which El Salvador is a victim.It is equally important to prevent the trafficking of weapons to the Salvadoran insurgents  just as it is important to prevent the use of Honduran frontier territory as a sanctuary by Nicaraguan and Salvadoran rebels. For that reason the international peace-keeping force should locate these combatants far from Honduran borders  in Nicaraguan and Salvadoran territories. Their relocation in third countries should be carried out from sites in Costa Rica and Guatemala  whose Governments have declared themselves neutral  a declaration apparently not challenged by the Governments of Nicaragua and El Salvador.In parallel  the Secretary-General  through appropriate international machinery  would make the necessary arrangements to prevent new flows of refugees into Honduras and to promptly repatriate those already in its territory or relocate them in third States.The people and Government of Honduras cannot go on bearing the burden which has weighed down on them for nine years  a burden caused by the presence of tens of thousands of Central American refugees. We have thoroughly met our humanitarian quota  and it is unreasonable to expect us to make even more sacrifices detrimental to our economic and social development and our ecological equilibrium.In order that this plan may be carried out successfully  it is essential that the process of Central American normalization be liberated from any interference that might have a harmful effect on it - for example  incompatible international procedures.In implementing this initiative  it would be appropriate for the Secretary-General to call on whatever parties were necessary to overcome interference preventing the finding of a solution to the Central American crisis. For example  thought should be given to the holding of negotiations between the two super-Powers  on the one hand  and the five Central American countries  on the other - and also the United States of America and Nicaragua  when the parties deem it appropriate  as we suggested last November in the General Assembly of the Organization of American States. Such a global approach would guarantee parallel co-operation between all the parties concerned and would make it possible to take up the subject of security  focusing on the restoration of the balance of forces which has not so far been dealt with effectively.The problem of security is of particular importance in view of the irrational arms race upon which the Sandinist Government has embarked  having set itself the goal of recruiting hundreds of thousands of military personnel and having recently emphasized that the size of the Sandinist army ""is not subject to any type of negotiation"". This incomprehensible attitude is in sharp contrast to the agreement recently reached by the super-Powers to dismantle intermediate nuclear forces.The establishment of an international peace-keeping force as proposed by Honduras  and the adoption of the complementary measures which I have submitted to the Secretary-General for his consideration  would reinvigorate the peace-making impetus of Esquipulas II  which now seems to be in jeopardy. The establishment of stable  lasting peace in Central America depends on whether the Sandinist Government meets its obligation to allow the Nicaraguan people to choose its own destiny  without imposing its will in such a way as to prolong the people's suffering yet further  so that democracy  justice  freedom and peace may be achieved.In the same spirit  my country demonstrates its unswerving respect for the norms of international law  particularly those relating to the peaceful settlement of disputes through the procedures set out in the United Nations Charter and the charter of the Organization of American States.In conclusion  the Government and people of Honduras are delighted by the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces  on which we congratulate the Secretary-General. It is a well-deserved recognition of a job well done throughout many years of selfless dedication and sacrifice."
"63",3057,"HTI",43,1988,"ï»¿ I should like first of all to express Haiti's deep gratitude to the countries of our region for the invaluable support they have given us  both morally and diplomatically  in recent weeks. We are particularly grateful to the delegation of Saint Kitts and Nevis and our neighbours on the former island of Hispaniola  our brothers of the Dominican Republic  with whom we share not only geography but a common future in our two peoples' constant pursuit of dreams of peace  pluralistic and liberal democracy with a human face  based on social justice  freedom and fraternity. I am particularly happy  on behalf of the government and people of Haiti  to extend to the President our warm congratulations and wishes for success on the occasion of his election to preside ewer the General Assembly at its forty-third session. We should also like to pay a tribute to the outgoing President  Ambassador Peter florin of the German Democratic Republic   hose prestige and remarkable talents as a moderator enhanced the proceedings of last year's session.We are happy also to associate ourselves with the tribute paid to our Secretary-General  His Excellency Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his efforts on behalf of peace and the promotion of the ideals of the United Nations in its role as the conscience of humanity. Is it not  indeed  the vitalising source - even the special source - of the great achievements in the field of human rights in the twentieth century? Does it not also contribute to support for the community of nations as it moves towards a better world where dialogue and agreement will take the place of confrontation? The recent successes that have been scored - successes that augur well for a fruitful forty-third session of the General Assembly - emphasize once again that the Organisation remains  in the bleakest times  the last bastion of the equal sovereignty of States and the right of peoples to self-determination and  finally  the special place where the people's most precious hopes are placed  at this end of the century  for a future of peace  justice and international co-operation.The course of events has recently highlighted a clear lessening of tensions in certain regions of the world. Nevertheless  there are still many hotbeds of crises and many challenges that are of concern to the international community.The most striking and most pernicious case is without any doubt  in our view  that of South Africa  where the system of apartheid persists. Once again we raise our voice to say no - a thousand times no - to that regime of infinite degradation  exploitation and misery. It is essential that everything be done to put an end to that unspeakable regime and thereby do away with this serious threat to international peace and security.On the same subject  we are following with the greatest interest the progress of the talks designed to end the illegal occupation of Namibia. This is a time to reaffirm our solidarity with and support for the courageous Namibian people  who are struggling  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) - their sole  legitimate representative - to break the hated yoke of colonial  racist oppression. Continuing to refer to Africa  we were very much encouraged by the results of the negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations which led to the Geneva agreement of 30 August 1988. That is clearly a large step in the right direction taken by Morocco and POLISARIO. We cannot but encourage them to continue on that course  because we are convinced that  given the good faith of the parties and the political will  the people of Western Sahara will finally be able freely to exercise their right to self-determination.In the Middle East  the establishment of the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and the opening of bilateral negotiations in Geneva give us reason to hope that the peace process has really begun and that it will lead to a mutually satisfactory solution.On the other hand  we deeply deplore the wave of violence that continues to claim so many victims in the occupied territories. Nevertheless  we feel some optimism about the future because of the prospects for an indispensable dialogue between all the parties  which could finally lead to the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). In that regard  we support the principle of an international conference on the Middle East to lay the foundations for an overall settlement that would take simultaneously into account Israel's inalienable right to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries and the Palestinian people's inalienable right to self-determination  including the right to a homeland.So far as Lebanon is concerned  we endorse anything that can restore peace  beginning with the withdrawal of all foreign forces  which is a pre-condition for the restoration of the Lebanese people's sovereignty and national and territorial integrity. With regard to South-East Asia   e continue to give our full support to the constant efforts by the United Nations to find a negotiated solution in the case of Kampuchea as well as that of Afghanistan. Moreover  we continue to place our hopes in the reunification of the Korean nation and we offer our support to any initiative that could contribute to achieving that peacefully. The solution to the problems of Central America can be found only by the peoples of the region themselves. That is the real meaning of the Arias plan  which we are pleased to support unreservedly. We regret  however  that the dialogue which has begun has not yet produced all the expected results.We state again our conviction that there is an indissoluble link between disarmament and development  which are the undisputed bases of international peace and security. Today the expenditure on over-armament activities can be counted only in the thousands of billions of dollars - even after the recent Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - whereas a part of those resources could have been advantageously reinvested in meeting human and social needs and  moreover  would have increased the security of all.The Republic of Haiti protests against the practice of making the third-world countries the dumping grounds for toxic wastes from the Northern countries. It strongly condemns this new form of aggression and supports the idea of an international convention on the prohibition of and punishment for such acts.Finally  in response to the wishes of national public opinion  the Government of the Republic of Haiti intends to struggle tirelessly against the illicit traffic in drugs and is willing to accept any assistance that nay be given by the countries with some experience in this field.My country  which is classified among the least developed countries  cannot fail to note that  despite the strength of the economic recovery in the industrialized countries  the gap separating the North from the South continues to widen dangerously. In view of that situation  which is of the greatest concern  it appears quite legitimate far our peoples  the producers of raw materials  to wonder how they can again have the conditions of sustained and balanced growth when the fall in the prices of their commodities increases year after year and their external debt weighs heavily on their export capacities and compromises their prospects for investment. We are convinced that it is urgently necessary to infuse dynamism into official development assistance and make it more accessible. We feel that it is also indispensable to set up a new international order able to respond to the expectations of the least favoured countries through the effective democratization of international economic relations. Finally  we believe that the debtor countries should be given an opportunity  over and above their debt servicing  to meet honourably the obligations arising out of the social  political and economic contract that binds their Governments to their peoples. In that way the right of those peoples to the minimum well-being that Saint Thomas Aquinas said was necessary to the practice of virtue may be effectively taken into account.We turn now to the situation in our country following the major political events which have taken place recently  and we wish to testify to the hopes that have been aroused by the democratic renewal in all social sectors of our population. The Haitian people has just given striking new proof of its powerful attachment to freedom. Two years ago  on 7 February 1986   this people clearly indicated to the world the forcefulness of its democratic instincts and its unshakeable courage in the face of the burden of bankruptcy  an economy in ruins and social and political structures un-adapted to the challenges of the end of our century. In the enthusiasm of that time  a powerful desire for national reconstruction was born. Thus in the Constitution of 1987 we adopted a new charter of rights and freedoms that defined the main outline of a new social contract and a legal framework on which the institutions for guaranteeing Haitian democracy were to be founded.Unfortunately  our hard apprenticeship in the cause of freedom did not go forward uneventfully. Through one upheaval after another the country was plunged once more into a climate of violence and confusion in which suddenly the freedoms achieved and the victories in our struggle were again jeopardized. In that context the already precarious economic situation could not but worsen and social disorder increase. It was clear that we were moving towards the collapse of a regime that was incapable of undertaking the expected reforms and meeting the needs of the rural and urban masses.From the depths of the abyss  the Haitian army once again  in the face of our national peril  responded on 17 September  to the appeal of our country. It was guided solely by the need to defend the higher interests of our nation and by its faith in the dynamics of lasting structural change in laying the foundations of democracy in Haiti once and for all. Thus a new Government was formed in which the entire country could see its views reflected. It is a consensus Government  desirous above all of the common good and national dignity. It is determined to gather together all political trends  all schools of thought and all Haitians of goodwill  without exception  so as to seize the opportunity of establishing once and for all the foundations of genuine democracy that will put an end to the structural instability of power in Haiti and prevent any return to dictatorship.The nation has rediscovered its true nature and the State its authority. We see the new Government  in full agreement with the desires of the people  resolutely embarked on the course of necessary change  aiming to bring the people out of its period of transition to assume responsibility for its destiny through elections that at last will be free and honest  in a climate oÂ£ representative democracy irreversibly founded on a multi-party system  respect for essential freedoms  the inviolability of the rights of the human person  and social justice. To that end the 1987 Constitution  which was adopted by a large Majority  will be restored  with the changes that the people  in its sovereignty  may feel it necessary to make to it. The institutions that it had defined to ensure the proper working of the Haitian society will be re-established to meet a twofold challenge - the modernisation of our political structures and the invigoration of our economy. From now on  Haiti turns a new face to the world. Freedoms - I mean all freedoms - are guaranteed; the political parties are re-emerging; justice is resuming its rights; those who were forced to flee the country are coming back; and  above all and for the first time since 7 February 1986  a democratic dialogue has begun among all political trends and schools of thought and the Government  in a desire for complete national reconciliation  without which the reconstruction battle would be compromised from the outset.In the present circumstances there is only one possible policy that aimed at giving a lasting foundation to a regime of law and freedom end attacking the structural causes of absolute poverty. Those two courses are closely linked and inseparable. It is clear that it is impossible to exercise political rights in any meaningful way without full enjoyment of economic and social rights  and to that end we must tackle without further delay the major problems which the Haitian economy is now facing and which call for urgent medium- and long-term solutions. The grave deterioration of the physical environment as a result of the deforestation and erosion compounding the desertification of our country  deficiencies in the machinery of production and the uncertainty of Income  particularly in the rural areas  are factors behind the complete halt in economic growth  while population growth is about 1.5 per cent.It must also be emphasised that as a result of socio-political troubles during the period 1986-88 the problem of employment has only worsened  making the socio-economic situation of the needy sectors of our population even more difficult in a country that already had a highly alarming rate of unemployment.Another point to be stressed is the burden of financial difficulties  which have been aggravated by the freeze on international assistance for a year now. That is compounded by the considerable material damage caused by hurricane Gilbert.In short  the past eight years have been characterised by a serious  constant decline in production  employment and the level and quality of life in Haiti. We fear that the 1980s may be a lost decade for development unless energetic  timely action  strongly supported by the international community is taken to help what is the only least developed country in the Americas to break this vicious circle of underdevelopment. In this regard  the statement of the Episcopal Conference of Haiti on the events of 17 September this year was unambiguous. It reads: ""We beg you  the international organisations  to continue the assistance given to this country. But in the present circumstances we address an urgent appeal to you to increase aid for the development of our people ""In its programme of action the Government has set itself a three-part target - the establishment of a regime of freedom and human dignity  economic growth and social development - in a climate of exceptional economic difficulties. That is why we make an urgent appeal to the whole international community  friendly countries and the specialized agencies of the United Nations to mobilize the necessary resources to permit a return to sustained growth in Haiti after years of stagnation.In this regard  we believe that the proposals  recommendations and continents in resolution 39/196 of 17 December 1984  concerning a special United Nations programme for assisting Haiti  could be updated and their content could be expanded to enable our country to tackle its most urgent problems  overcome its many handicaps and deal with the structural problems that have all too often been neglected in the past.We hope above all that with mutual respect and trust Haiti's partners will work to ensure the implementation of that decisive plan of action  which the people of Haiti believes it has a right to count on  if it is to achieve by the year 2000 a level of economic  social and cultural development compatible with fundamental human rights and the requirements of human dignity.Foe our part  we shall spare no effort. That was the gist of the message of the President of the Republic  Lieutenant General Prosper Avril  when he said at the inauguration of the Cabinet:""The task is immense and cannot be put off. Let us begin it immediately  making it a point of honour that the true foundation of our legitimacy should be the extent of our services to the community. Today a man of good will is stretching out his hand towards other men of good will; a chain of solidarity must be formed and made longer and longer  stronger and stranger  so that Haiti nay live and make progress."""
"64",3103,"HUN",43,1988,"ï»¿I should like first of all to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly and to assure him of the co-operation of the Hungarian delegation in his responsible activity for the success of our deliberations.I believe that this session has good chances of success. The atmosphere and work of the forty-second session were favourably influenced by the positive change in East-West relations and the increasing momentum of the Soviet-American dialogue. The past year has seen this favourable process strengthened and enriched with new elements. Another Soviet-United States summit was held  and the dialogue has been extended to lower levels as well  with concrete results embodied in the accords reached. Those accords were concrete reflections of the efforts undertaken to curb the arms race and to eliminate hotbeds of tension  and they may give stimulus to further steps in this direction  both in the relationship between the two great Powers and on a wider scale. The dynamic development of Soviet-American and East-West relations has become a determinant factor of strengthening international security.Other favourable events of international politics  among them a large number of high-level meetings and initiatives by different groups of countries to strengthen international co-operation and to achieve a peaceful settlement of international problems  have also made their effects felt during the past year. There has been an intensification of efforts to resolve regional problems  including the elimination of hotbeds of crisis that have destabilizing effects and thus impede international Å-operation. Tangible and pioneering accords have been reached and encouraging negotiations are under way. No doubt world politics are still characterized by a great number of grave and pressing problems  but on the whole we have witnessed and acted to achieve a psychological breakthrough during the past year. Practice has proved that even the most complicated issues of world politics can be solved and that  given the political will of States  concrete results can be achieved which have a favourable influence on the international atmosphere and on the development of the international situation while giving impetus to the quest for solution of other problems. In this context  too  we attach decisive importance to the Soviet-United States agreement on the elimination of intermediate-range and shorter-range nuclear missiles and to the Geneva accords on the settlement of the situation relating to Afghanistan. The intensification of diplomatic activities to eliminate various hotbeds of crisis and the initial encouraging results allow us to hope that these favourable developments will be a prelude to the longer-term process rather than a momentary phenomenon. The United Nations has given practical proof that its involvement in similar efforts can be successful  while contributing to an improvement of its international image  and that its continuing active participation can promote the renewal of the world Organization.In this activity a leading role has been played by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  to whom I wish to express my deep appreciation for his untiring efforts.My Government is convinced that these favourable changes have resulted from the widening and the practical prevalence of the awareness that the mutual dependence or interdependence of States and peoples is a fact  a reality of our age. Consequently  it considers the strengthening of mutually advantageous international co-operation and of confidence among States and the peaceful settlement of emerging conflicts to be the only possible path of international coexistence. The Hungarian Government shapes the course of its foreign policy and participates in international relations in accordance with this spirit. It rejects the use of force or the threat of force; it regards security as a complex notion with closely interrelated military  political  economic  human rights and humanitarian aspects; and it maintains that no single State can establish its own security solely by military-technical means or to the detriment of other States and that security can only be built by political means  taking account of the interests of all States and by joint action resulting from dialogue.A pioneering role in advocating  disseminating and asserting this approach is played by the Soviet Union which has found partners in the leadership of the United States and other countries as well. At the same time  it is an equally noteworthy fact that the entire community of nations has also played a role in preparing and enhancing these changes: great Powers  medium-size and small countries  members of alliance systems  neutral and non-aligned nations alike  Hungary  as one of the small European countries  long ago recognized those opportunities which are at hand for a small country  and has been continuously and actively using them.The favourable processes of world politics  the gaining ground of the ideas of international understanding and co-operation and the emergence of an atmosphere of confidence among States are fully in line with Hungary's national interests and foreign policy. Government is therefore making great efforts towards the development of international co-operation. It is trying to make use of all possibilities  bilateral as well as multilateral  to expound its sincere endeavours and to strengthen confidence among States. It identifies itself fully with the new concept of international security and co-operation  and is convinced that this new approach is bound to prevail in world politics before long.This approach is represented by the foreign policy statements and practical steps of Hungary at the Vienna follow-up meeting on European security and co-operation  among others. We deem it highly important for the Vienna follow-up meeting to conclude its work as early as possible by the adoption of a substantive and balanced concluding document and  while giving a new impulse to European co-operation  making a favourable contribution to the creation of a common European home and improving the international situation as a whole. Present-day Europe is bound to the other continents by many ties. Given the specific conditions of Europe  a special model of co-operation is now evolving. An indispensable and useful framework and instrument for the realization of a common European home is the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) with a past of 13 years  which embraces the major components of an all-European home  that is  a programme for the reduction of the risk of military confrontation and the building of political  economic and humanitarian co-operation.For this reason  the successful conclusion of the Vienna follow-up meeting by the adoption of a substantive concluding document would mean a genuine step forward in comparison with the obligations undertaken in the Final Act of Helsinki and the Concluding Document of Madrid. Its most important result would be the integration of conventional disarmament into the process of European security and co-operation. After the conclusion of the follow-up meeting it would then be . possible to start negotiations between the member States of the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on questions of conventional disarmament. These negotiations would be far-reaching in terms of scope  goals and potential effect alike. Parallel to them  the talks on confidence-building  started in Stockholm  could be continued with the participation of all the 35 States.The concluding document: of the follow-up meeting should place greater emphasis on questions of economic co-operation in Europe. It is gratifying to note that progress can be expected on questions of industrial  environmental and scientific-technical co-operation  but it is no less important to make headway in the human rights and humanitarian fields.In our view  a real demand of our time is to set up a mechanism for consultations on human rights and humanitarian issues  one that would keep under review the status of implementation of the recommendations as formulated concerning the human dimension  envisaging compliance with agreements  respect for international expectations  a clearer definition of obligations already undertaken and creating guarantees for their fulfilment. The expert meetings  forums and other conferences  the convening of which can be expected to be mandated by the Vienna follow-up meeting  will serve a useful purpose in promoting substantive and balanced progress in the CSCE process and contributing to international security.In promoting the favourable international political developments of the past period  a significant part has been played by the recognition that the establishment of international security is a task of enormous complexity affecting all spheres of life. Each concrete aspect of security is closely related to and bears upon all the others. The initiative concerning comprehensive international security  which is included in the agenda of the General Assembly  is based on this recognition. We earnestly hope that the appeal to Member States for the continuation of the dialogue  the joint elaboration of the elements of comprehensive security  and the determination of concrete practical measures deriving therefrom will meet the understanding and support of Member States. We all share the goal of ensuring that the gap often in evidence between the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and the realities of the present-day international situation will be bridged as soon as possible.A basic aspect of security  directly affecting the security of life itself  is that of disarmament or arms build-up. The first genuine disarmament accord between the Soviet Union and the United States on the elimination of intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles is of historic significance  even though it affects a small part of the total stockpiles of weapons. The Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - has opened a new chapter of disarmament history by introducing a system of verification with a formerly inconceivable set of strict and widely regulated conditions for control of compliance. So far the experience of compliance has given proof in practice as well that the quest for security through disarmament is indeed possible. The representatives of the Soviet Union and the United States are working on an agreement on a 50-per-cent cut in strategic offensive weapons. We remain convinced that  if the parties continue to summon the necessary political will and remain ready for compromise  the political and technical obstacles to a treaty can be removed and another disarmament accord will be signed in the not-too-distant future  paving the way for building a world free from nuclear weapons.An outstanding event of multilateral disarmament diplomacy last summer was the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. Unfortunately the psychological breakthrough I mentioned did not take place in the field of multilateral disarmament. It remains a pressing task to ensure that multilateral disarmament strengthen its viability and produce results in the form of concrete accords similar to those in bilateral disarmament. Although the participants in the special session on disarmament could not draw up a final document based on consensus  the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic  along with many other countries  does not consider the session to have been a failure.In the view of my Government  the significance of the special session lies mainly in the fact that the need for a multilateral approach to disarmament issues has been reconfirmed by the international community. Furthermore  the participating States agreed that in future the United Nations should be assigned a greater role in dealing with questions of disarmament. It is of particular importance that the outstanding role to be played by the United Nations in controlling the fulfilment of disarmament accords received wide attention during the special session. We believe that such a substantive role could  in the long run  be fulfilled by an international verification agency to be set up under the auspices of the United Nations In this connection we attach great importance also to the efforts of the Delhi Six in this direction. During the special session a great number of concrete and important proposals were made which may serve as topics of future debate and negotiation at disarmament bodies or provide a basis for measures to be adopted by consensus. If we want to move forward in the field of multilateral disarmament those proposals should be considered on their merits at our present session as well.The increased interest in the Geneva Conference on Disarmament was likewise felt during the special session. The renewed emphasis on that irreplaceable forum of disarmament was reflected in the high-level visits this year and in the major policy statements made on those occasions.Among the agenda items of the Conference on Disarmament  special mention may be made of the intensification of work in the Ad Hoc Committee on the elaboration of a convention prohibiting chemical weapons. At the same time we deplore the fact that the Conference was unable to come any closer to finalizing a convention on the complete prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons.Starting substantive work on the complete prohibition of nuclear-test explosions remains a priority task for the Conference on Disarmament to accomplish in furtherance of nuclear disarmament. The setting up of an appropriate machinery brooks no further delay. We think that  in order to overcome the present stalemate  it would require States members of the Conference on Disarmament to accept the need for multilateral talks on this issue and to adhere to the principles of progressivity.In recent years the Conference on Disarmament has discussed the situation with regard to the prevention of the arms race in outer space and has identified the related problems. The present task is to elaborate concrete measures aimed at preventing  even if by stages  the extension of the arms race to outer space. In order to secure progress it would also be advisable to agree on partial aspects of practical relevance which by their importance affect the obtaining of the ultimate goal. One such aspect is the establishment of a mechanism for international verification.It is similarly desirable to speed up work on the prohibition of radiological weapons. Closely related to it is the complete prohibition of attacks against nuclear facilities which should continue to be treated as a matter of urgency.Also  in our days there is a growing international recognition that limitation and reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments at both global and regional levels ate major factors in affecting nuclear disarmament as well. The emphasis on conventional disarmament is logically consequential on the fact that the accumulation of conventional armaments is assuming increasingly threatening dimensions and that a significant part of the destructive capacity of such armaments is growing closer and closer to that of weapons of mass destruction and that conventional disarmament is marking time in comparison to the growing momentum of nuclear disarmament. The first promising efforts exerted in Europe to promote conventional disarmament will  we hope  be followed in other regions of the world as well.After the consultations of the 23  held parallel to the Vienna follow-up meeting  work is practically on the verge of being concluded on the mandate for the disarmament talks covering the area from the Urals to the Atlantic. My Government deems it important that the negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments get under way as soon as possible after the conclusion of the Vienna follow-up meeting. The measures likely to be adopted will affect the forward-based forces of the two great Powers as well as the forces of the small and medium-sized countries in the region and will call for the Â¡Increased activity and involvement of the latter States too. Hungary is interested in an arrangement under which the forces in its territory will also be affected by the first stage of reductions. We expect the talks to result in a notable improvement in Europe's feeling of security in the foreseeable future and to create  by eliminating elements of threat causing concern to the patties  a stable situation characterized by a balance of mutual offensive incapability of the opposing forces. Elimination of the regional hotbeds of crisis which pose a threat to international peace and security is an important element in establishing international security. Collective efforts and  in particular  the emerging understanding of the parties directly concerned have  in several regional issues included in the agenda of the General Assembly  placed increased emphasis on the effective involvement of the united Nations in the practical solution of such problems as well as in the creation of frameworks and technical conditions for settlement. The extent to which the world Organization will be able to perform its mission in maintaining peace and in securing cease-fires and their supervision will perhaps be a touchstone of the United Nations capacity for renewal.The Geneva Accords relating to Afghanistan can be regarded as a highly significant precedent. The progress in the withdrawal of Soviet troops is clear evidence of the good will of the Soviet Union. We hope that the agreement will be fully observed by all the parties and that the advance of the process of national reconciliation will bring peace to Afghanistan. We deem it necessary that the present session of the General Assembly consider this problem in this spirit  under this approach.The efforts of the United Nations or  more specifically  the Security Council and of the Secretary-General personally  have played an important part in achieving  after so many abortive attempts  a cease-fire in the Iraqi-Iranian war of nearly 10 years  which has claimed an enormous toll in human lives and material losses. Encouraging work is being done with the involvement of the United Nations to bring about peace. In the prevailing situation  particular importance is attached to the self-restraint of the parties concerned and their willingness to co-operate in the implementation of the relevant resolution of the Security Council. Our modest contribution to achieving lasting peace is the participation of 15 Hungarians in the contingent of the United Nations Observer Group to monitor the cease-fire. My Government is hopeful that the cease-fire will soon be followed by the conclusion of peace  putting an end to the hostilities and devastation.Of course  United Nations efforts alone will be insufficient to secure success  because the political will and determination of the Governments of the countries involved are equally indispensable for the liquidation of a hotbed of crisis. The recent past has seen a promising sign of this in the search for a settlement of the question of Cyprus.After many years the possibility seems to be opening up of progress in the settlement of the situation in the southern part of Africa. We support the efforts to bring about a negotiated solution  and hope that the ongoing talks will soon lead to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  the granting of independence to Namibia  and international guarantees of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Angola.The positive turn in the quest for the peaceful solution of regional conflicts strengthens our conviction that intensification of United Nations activities would increase the chances of a just settlement of the Middle East crisis too. It is increasingly recognized that the road to a solution of the conflict satisfactory to all the parties concerned leads through an international conference  to be held under the auspices of the United Nations. The events taking place in the occupied territories similarly underline the pressing need for an early settlement of the crisis.The entire international atmosphere would be favourably influenced by the early settlement of the conflict in Central America  which is a serious factor of destabilization  with the participation of all the countries concerned and on the basis of respect for the generally accepted norms of international law.My Government is in agreement with and follows with confidence the efforts being made to solve the question of Kampuchea by peaceful means within national frameworks. It is highly appreciative of the moderation and sense of reality displayed by the countries and the political forces working for a settlement of this problem.Hungary welcomes the proposals aimed at reducing and eliminating tensions in the Korean peninsula in an effort to find ways and means of creating the necessary conditions for solving the problem of Korea  keeping in view the strengthening of peace and security in the Asian region and having regard to the interests of the Korean people.The subjects of the world economy and international economic relations occupy an increasingly important place in the activities of the United Nations. We find this only natural since international co-operation and the external environment of economic development have become of vital importance to all Member States. However  the economic  financial  trade  scientific-technical and environmental activities of the United Nations and its specialized agencies still fail to reflect fully the actual conditions and priorities determined by the realities of the present-day world  although the 1970s and the 1980s have seen radical changes in the world economy.On the threshold of the last decade of this century  Governments should seek to ensure that the United Nations and its specialized agencies are not simply passive followers of world economic developments  but act to meet economic challenges  thereby contributing  on the basis of the common will worked out by consensus and by reconciling national and regional interests  to the creation of conditions that will ensure to the fullest c :tent possible the sustainable growth of national economies and the steady expansion of international economic relations.We have no doubt that this process will not be free from conflict. Efforts should therefore be concentrated on enhancing the role of the United Nations and its organs in forecasting developments and balances in the world economy  as well as their ability to manage economic  trade  financial  environmental and other conflicts and to promote their solution.  We are convinced that harmonization of interests and development of conflict management abilities can create the conditions for international organizations to exert the roost fruitful influence both on the development of national economies and on different areas of regional and global co-operation.My Government proceeds from the assumption that national  regional and global objectives can be harmonized on the basis of openness and mutual respect for interests. However  the common will  or a common policy arrived at in international organizations  cannot be truly effective unless account of it is taken of international realities and economic laws. The efforts to bring about regional integration constitute one such law at the present stage of development of the world economy. The regional integration organizations play an increasing role in the world economy and will act for a long time to come as a stimulus to economic growth. At the same time  certain trends of isolationism may also prevail at the stage of growing economic co-operation within integrated regions. We think that such trends  even though serving the interests of participants in such integration in the short run  work to impede the sustainable development of the entire world economy in the long run. Therefore we welcome the elevation of relations between the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CHEA) and the European Economic Community (EEC) to an official level  together with the bilateral agreement already concluded between Hungary and the ÐEC and other future bilateral agreements between BBC and CMEA member States. This development fits well into the European process of co-operation and confidence-building and serves to promote its fuller development.Work is to start soon on the elaboration of the programme for development and co-operation for the last decade of this century. We believe that in formulating this programme for the fourth development decade Governments should start from present-day realities in order to set the base for the future. I can assure members that my Government will take an active and constructive part in this highly important work.International efforts to protect and ensure respect for human rights should serve the same purposes as the solution of world economic and financial problems through mutual compromise and joint action Â· namely  to promote the welfare of the society and the individual  to create conditions of life worthy even of the next century  and to bring about the full enjoyment of human freedoms. A corner-stone of the Hungarian Government's foreign policy is the encouragement and strengthening of international co-operation in the human rights and humanitarian fields  with the fullest possible use of the channels provided by the United Nations for that purpose.Respect for and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the development of international co-operation with this end in view are important factors in increasing confidence among States. There is growing recognition that the enjoyment of human rights and the maintenance of international security are directly and closely interrelated. On the one hand  this linkage is manifest in that grave and systemic violations of human rights and disregard of internationally recognised norms have  as international experience shows  an adverse effect on inter-State relations and the international political atmosphere  and may jeopardize international security. On the other hand  the decades since the adoption of the universal Declaration of Human Rights have provided a not insignificant lesson that promotion of the exercise of human rights is possible only under conditions of detente and peaceful coexistence. I recall that one of the first victims of the cold-war era was precisely the cause of human rights.From this it follows that the proposition that the question of human rights is exclusively the interned affair of States has become a thing of the past  once and for all. By drawing up an international catalogue of human rights and establishing international organs and mechanisms to monitor and supervise compliance by States with their obligations in the human rights and humanitarian fields  the United Nations has given a new dimension to multilateral co-operation and focused the attention of the international community and international public opinion on the question of human rights. In this regard  as yet another sign of the Hungarian Government's readiness to co-operate  coupled with the openness of our policy  the Hungarian People's Republic earlier last month declared its recognition of the competence of the Human Rights Committee under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  and at the same time acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Covenant.By that action we wished to confirm that we were ready and willing to participate - as an equal partner - in the domain of human rights  too  while supporting joint international efforts to implement related norms and control compliance with them in a common  international activity.The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic and public opinion in Hungary follow with particular attention the enjoyment by nationalities of their rights  and are sensitive to violations of the individual and collective rights of minorities. This is natural for the added reason that Hungarians living in the neighbouring countries constitute the largest national minorities in Europe. We advocate at every forum  as elementary demands  the preservation of diverse cultural traditions and the folklore of national minorities'  protection of historic relicsÂ·  and full enjoyment of the right to cultivate and use the mother tongue  including education in the mother tongue in schools at all levels. We are convinced that forced assimilation of national minorities  their cultural oppression and destruction of conditions for their independent intellectual and physical existence are unacceptable to the international community of our times.Therefore  we deem it important that in the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights we should embark upon the road of codifying those rights which were not covered by the Declaration. In our view these are: the right of peoples to self-determination and the preservation of national culture and the effective protection of the individual and collective rights of national minorities. It is a basic requirement of our age to eliminate discrimination of any kind  including discrimination against nations and national minorities. In our belief such an international  legally binding regulation of norms would contribute to the deepening of human contacts  thereby making those contacts more substantial.We highly appreciate the efforts  which we think cannot be replaced by anything else  made under the auspices of the United Nations to put an end to mass  grave violations of human rights. Humiliating practices and policies of discrimination on grounds of race  nationality  religion or any other basis  violation of the tight to life  liberty and security of the person  torture and other cruel and inhuman punishment and treatment  physical coercion  forced resettlement  limitations on  or denial of  the fundamental economic  social and cultural rights of people are all phenomena whose elimination calls for effective and resolute action by the international community and the United Nations as its institution. Solving the problems of our age and extending international co-operation in keying with the interests of all States and peoples presuppose intensification of multilateral diplomacy. Forums for the multilateral accommodation of interests and the search for and adoption of arrangements acceptable to all parties concerned are achieved by Regional and multilateral organizations and conferences.The improvement of the international situation during the past year and the more favourable conditions prevailing at present will certainly increase the role oÂ£ the United Nations in  and its concrete possibilities of  performing the tasks laid down in the Charter. It is of importance to international co-operation and the settlement of outstanding pressing problems that the world Organization - and primarily we  representatives of Member States - make the most of the favourable conditions to renew the work of the United Nations  enhance its prestige and effectiveness  increase its capacity for practical action and ensure the smooth operation of the world Organization in accordance with the requirements of our time.The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic wishes to contribute to those efforts by pursuing a foreign policy fully in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations and by the active and constructive participation of its delegation in the work of the forty-third session. "
"65",3150,"IDN",43,1988,"ï»¿Let me first offer my sincere congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo on his assumption of the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. His election to that high office is apt recognition of his eminent qualities as well as a reflection of the esteem in which Argentina is held among the community of nations. His impressive record in international diplomacy gives us confidence that he will guide this session with authority and efficiency.I should also like to express our deep appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  for the exemplary manner in which he presided over our deliberations during a very busy year.Before proceeding I should like to convey Indonesia's sincere sympathy and solidarity to the Governments and peoples of Bangladesh  Jamaica and Sudan in the wake of the massive human suffering and destruction recently visited upon them by natural disasters. It is our earnest hope that the international community will extend adequate and timely assistance to the process of rehabilitation and reconstruction in those countries.A new climate of conciliation and mutual accommodation appears to be asserting itself throughout the world. Despite continuing uncertainties and ambivalence  some seminal trends in international developments are emerging as well as signs of a general relaxation of tensions  especially between the two super-Powers. In a number of regional conflicts  confrontation is giving way to dialogue and to efforts at finding negotiated solutions. Concurrently  basic movements are taking place on the economic landscape  propelling the world economy towards ever greater interdependence and integration.We have all welcomed the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan as a significant contribution to both regional stability and international security. We likewise rejoiced at the cease-fire and the start of negotiations between Iran and Iraq in the conviction that the blessings of peace will not only accrue to the benefit of the peoples of Iran and Iraq themselves but also to the interest of stability and progress in the entire Gulf region and beyond.Similarly  we are encouraged to note the enhanced prospects for a solution of the Western Sahara issue on the basis of the peace plan jointly submitted by the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity. On the question of Cyprus  a renewed dialogue is taking place between the President of Cyprus and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community which hopefully will yield an early settlement of all aspects of the problem.In southern Africa  progress is being made in negotiations which could prepare the way for the long overdue implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and for the total independence of Namibia. And in South-East Asia  the Jakarta Informal Meeting on Kampuchea  held last July  has generated a new momentum in the process towards a just and comprehensive solution of the problem In laying the groundwork and in sustaining efforts towards finding solutions to those and other protracted conflict situations  much of the credit should go to the United Nations and to our Secretary-General. Indeed r at no time in recent history has the irreplaceable value and potential of the United Nations been so vividly manifested. Consequently  there has been an upsurge of support among Member States for this unique multilateral forum  including a renewed commitment to its strengthening and revitalization. This yearâs award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is indeed a timely confirmation and magnificent vindication of the role our world Organization has played and continues to play in maintaining and building the peace in a tense and troubled world. While these developments augur well for our efforts to bring about greater peace and justice and equitable prosperity for all nations  we cannot deny that the international situation is still fraught with unresolved tensions and economic disorder and with a pervasive sense of insecurity and common vulnerability to the threat of nuclear holocaust. The politics of power  of political domination and economic coercion  of blatant intervention and aggression still feature all too prominently in present-day international relations. Vestiges of colonialism and institutionalized racism continue to obstruct the universal impulses for freedom  equality and the social and cultural advancement of peoples. Deeply rooted imbalances and unacceptable inequities still permeate international economic relations. And if  indeed  a hopeful brightening can be discerned in the global East-West relationship  the problems and predicaments in the North-South polarization are  on the contrary  being even further aggravated.It is clear that in facing the new opportunities as well as the challenges inherent in the evolving international situation we can no longer rely on such out-dated approaches as unilateralism or selective bilateralism  or on such notions as spheres of influence or power-bloc politics. The complexities of dealing with the new developments and trends now asserting themselves as global phenomena call for a conscious commitment to multilateralism  based on the imperatives of interdependence  common interest and shared responsibility among all nations of the world.Yet the major nuclear Powers still appear reluctant to accept that basic proposition  even on issues of such transcendental importance as disarmament and international security. While wholeheartedly welcoming the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - and the ongoing negotiations on strategic arms between the two major Powers  we cannot fail to observe that there has been no substantial easing of the arms race  especially in its qualitative or technological aspects. Furthermore  virtually all major issues on the disarmament agenda  be it the comprehensive test ban treaty  non-proliferation  the prevention of nuclear war or the militarization of outer space  continue to be subjected to such untenable arguments and considerations as strategic deterrence or the professed primacy of bilateral undertakings between the two major nuclear Powers. That is the undeniable reality faced by the Geneva Conference on Disarmament  which has yet to produce a single  substantive disarmament agreement since its reconstitution. That too was a major cause for the deeply disappointing outcome of the recently concluded General Assembly special session devoted to disarmament  which could not agree on even a Chairman's summing-up  let alone a final document of substance.Preventing the non-nuclear States from contributing actively to the process of disarmament negotiations is entirely unacceptable to us. The non-aligned and neutral States  including Indonesia  are therefore determined to assert their legitimate role in this respect and to redouble their efforts to achieve security for all  through multilateral negotiations leading toward total nuclear disarmament  the abolition of all other weapons of mass destruction and balanced reductions in conventional armaments. In that context we should in particular like to see the Conference on Disarmament complete as soon as possible the negotiations on a chemical weapons convention. Any other proposed course of action would serve only to divert us from this paramount objective. The conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty should also continue to be accorded high priority  as such an agreement would singularly contribute to arresting the development of new weapons systems and the refining of those already deployed  together with the delegations of Mexico  Peru  Sri Lanka and Yugoslavia  my delegation has formally submitted a proposal to the depository Governments of the Partial Test-Ban Treaty with a view to convening a conference at the earliest possible date to consider an amendment to the Treaty that would convert it into a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We believe that  in the light of the continuing deadlock in the Conference on Disarmament on the efforts to achieve such a treaty  the proposed amendment would provide a positive impulse towards that goal.Our collective capacity to rise to the challenges of a new era will be seriously impaired so long as millions of persons continue to languish under colonial domination and so long as the utter immorality of apartheid and racism continues to be condoned.With regard to Namibia  Indonesia has followed with keen interest the ongoing negotiations between Angola  Cuba  South Africa and the United States to establish a basis for just and durable peace in the south-western region of Africa and to ensure Namibia's independence. While we sincerely hope that these discussions will achieve concrete results  we cannot forget that South Africa was also a party to the negotiations leading to the adoption of the United Nations plan for Namibian independence and had committed itself to abiding by the provisions of that plan. But  ever since  Pretoria has used every means to undermine and forestall all efforts to effect its implementation. We must remain vigilant  therefore  and prevent the process now under way from being turned into yet another ploy by which the racist regime will again seek to gain time further to entrench its illegal occupation of the territory.It should be out common resolve that in this year of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) we shall finally secure the faithful implementation of the plan for Namibian independence. To that end  Indonesia supports the call for the early convening of the Security Council in order to adopt a resolution enabling the Secretary-General immediately to proceed with practical steps necessary for the emplacement of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia. In the meantime  we should continue our strong support for the Namibian people's struggle  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  to achieve the establishment of a truly independent and united Namibia.In South Africa itself  there has been no let-up in the brutal terror and repression by the Pretoria regime against all forms of opposition to apartheid. Consequently  the polarization and confrontation between the racist minority and the oppressed majority have taken on ever-more-violent dimensions. My Government remains convinced that the imposition of comprehensive  mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter will be the only effective means to bring a peaceful end to apartheid  so that in its place a non-racial and democratic society can be built. The international community should also intensify action to compel Pretoria to desist from its incessant acts of aggression and destabilisation against its neighbours. Concrete  material support to the African front-line States should also be stepped up in order to enable them to free themselves from this perpetual state of political blackmail and economic strangulation. The establishment of the Action for Resisting Invasion  Colonialism and Apartheid (AFRICA) Fund by the Non-Aligned Movement at the Harare summit conference in 1986 can be seen to be a concrete response to this challenge. Indonesia was pleased to be able to pledge a cash contribution of $2 250 000 to the Fund  to be disbursed over three years. The struggle of the Palestinian people for justice and national independence has always been at the root of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Today the question is no longer whether the Palestinians will be victorious in their sacred cause but  rather  how long it will take and at what sacrifice. The intifada  the sustained popular uprising in the occupied territories  has fundamentally altered the strategic equation by effecting a qualitative transformation in the nature and level of the struggle against Israeli oppressor. It has at the same time shattered the status quo of the past 20 years and with it the false air of smug complacency of the Tel Aviv regime. Indeed  the daily atrocities and acts of wanton violence unleashed against unarmed Palestinian protestors in the West Bank  in Gaza and in the Holy City of Al-Quds fully expose the bankruptcy of Israel's attempts to impose an annexationist fait accompli in the occupied territories. Those developments have also galvanized the people of the Palestinian nation  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PÅO)  their sole and legitimate representative  to prepare for a new phase in their political struggle.Indonesia fully supports the call of the States members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries upon the Security Council to place Palestinian territories under temporary United Nations supervision in order to put an end to the acts of intimidation and oppression against the Palestinian people. At the same time  political and diplomatic pressures should be brought to bear on Israel to persuade it to cease its opposition to the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East envisaged in General Assembly resolution 38/58 C  for it offers the only viable framework for a comprehensive settlement based on the total withdrawal by Israel from all occupied Arab territories  including Jerusalem  and the early realization of the Palestinians' inalienable right to self-determination and to a sovereign and independent State in Palestine.As events of the past year show  Israel's obsessive determination to impose by force of arms its own aggressive and expansionist designs on the region is also reflected in its blatant occupation of sovereign Lebanese territory. The arduous taste undertaken by the people of Lebanon to restore their unity and to bring about normalcy are continuously being undermined by such illegal Israeli actions. Indonesia therefore fully supports Lebanon's demand for the immediate  unconditional and complete withdrawal of all Israeli occupation forces.For the past nine years Indonesia  together with other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  has been engaged in efforts to put an end to protracted strife and bloodshed in Kampuchea and to the immense suffering of the Kampuchean people. As ASEAN's interlocutor  Indonesia has explored practical modalities that could bring about genuine dialogue and negotiations among the parties to the conflict and that  in turn  could lead to a comprehensive  just and durable solution. In the Ho Chi Minh City Understanding reached between the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Viet Nam in July of last year and at the Jakarta Informal Meeting that was structured on the basis of that Understanding and convened in July this year we believe we have found a viable framework within which to realize that long-sought goal.Through the Jakarta Informal Meeting a start has been made to replace armed conflict and confrontation with political dialogue and negotiations. It also represents the first time that all parties directly involved and the other concerned countries of the region were able to sit down together and to have a direct talk with one another to identify possible areas of common ground as well as the real obstacles to a solution.After frank and constructive discussions the participants in the Jakarta Informal Meeting agreed on the need to solve the Kampuchean problem through political means and thus not through a military fait accompli. A common understanding was also reached on the ultimate form of such a solution  namely through the establishment of an independent  sovereign  peaceful  neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and on the basis of self-determination and national reconciliation. The participants shared the view that the two key and interlinked issues of the Kampuchea problem are  first  the withdrawal of all Vietnamese forces from Kampuchea  to be carried out within the context of an over-all political solution  and  secondly  the prevention of a recurrence of the genocidal policies and practices of the past regime. They also concurred on the need to ensure the cessation of all foreign interference and external arms supplies to the opposing Kampuchean forces  to set definite timetables and to provide for an effective international presence to supervise those processes.The Meeting further agreed to continue discussions through a Marking Group in order to examine specific aspects of a political solution. The Working Group is to complete its work by December 1988 and make recommendations on the convening of another Meeting. In that connection Indonesia is set to act as host for a meeting of the Working Group in the second half of this month.We realize that the Jakarta Informal Meeting cannot and should not be the only valid approach to negotiations and the settlement of the problem. We are aware of  and are in full sympathy with  the initiatives and parallel efforts that are being undertaken by others. In that regard we do appreciate the unremitting efforts of the Secretary-General to find a political solution to the problem and to try to devise a feasible scenario towards that end. In the same vein Indonesia welcomes the initiative of the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to complement and reinforce our regional efforts on Kampuchea  and  of course  Indonesia and ASEAN remain fully supportive of Prince Sihanouk who  because of his pre-eminent stature and prestige  continues to play an indispensable role through his unrelenting guest to bring the sufferings of his tormented people to an early end.We all recognize the complexities of the Kampuchean problem in its many dimensions and aspects and in its regional as well as its international ramifications. In view of that  and considering that wide divergences of view still exist  especially on the modalities of a solution  we believe it to be pertinent and prudent to engage in a preliminary phase of informal discussions before proceeding to formal negotiations in the context of an international conference. That is and has always been the modest goal of the Jakarta Informal Meeting. Indonesia and ASEAN have from the outset worked on the assumption that a comprehensive solution to the Kampuchea question  especially in its extra-regional aspects  can be achieved only through an international conference with the participation of the parties directly concerned and the countries of the region  as well as the major Powers and other interested States. However  it is clear that adequate substantive preparations should precede the convening of such a conference if success is to be obtained. We therefore hope and trust that the international community will continue to lend its support to the regional peace process initiated by the Jakarta Informal Meeting.We are encouraged by the interim agreements that have been reached on the future political status of New Caledonia. The modalities that will be set in motion bolster our hope that the decolonization of the Territory will be carried out in accordance with the aspirations of the indigenous population for self-determination and independence  while taking into account the rights and interests of all of its inhabitants.The situation in the Korean peninsula remains a source of recurrent tensions in East Asia. It is regrettable  therefore  that the recent dialogue between the North and the South did not make much headway. At the same time we realize that after decades of mutual mistrust and suspicion the initiation of efforts towards national reconciliation is indeed a formidable task. It is our sincere hope that the resumption of their talks later this month will lead to tangible results  in conformity with their shared aspiration for peaceful reunification. In Central America  the signing of the Esquipulas agreement last year reflected the determination of its leaders to resolve peacefully and comprehensively the tension and strife that beset the region. It was our expectation that regional harmony and common economic progress could henceforth be fostered in accordance with the principles of sovereignty  common security  non-interference  democracy and development. We note to our dismay  however  that now  one year later  the momentum of the peace process has stalled. Indeed  the progress achieved so far may be in jeopardy unless there is renewed commitment by all the parties directly involved to the full and faithful compliance with the agreement.On the question of the Malvinas  my delegation commends the flexible approach adopted by Argentina and hopes that a climate of trust will be created for the resumption of formal negotiations leading to a peaceful and definitive settlement of the sovereignty dispute.As in the political sphere  the world economy is also going through changes that are fundamentally transforming the shape and substance of international economic relations. Over the past few decades  scientific and technological innovations have progressed at a phenomenal pace and in the process are drastically altering the patterns of production and consumption  of trade and financial exchanges and of comparative advantage. Obviously  these basic shifts in economic patterns will have significant implications for the policy premises and assumptions underpinning present development strategies.Concurrently  other developments of far-reaching implications are emerging and gaining prominence throughout the international economic landscape. The 12 member countries of the European Communities are pursuing the integration of their national economies into a powerful  single market by 1992. The United States and Canada have recently signed an agreement that would eliminate all tariff barriers between them. The centrally planned economies have embarked on paths of economic restructuring that will integrate them further into the mainstream of the world economy. And  as widely predicted  the centre of gravity of world economic activity and development may soon sill ft from the Atlantic to the Pacific bas in. There can be no doubt that these changes will further propel the integration of the world economy  as well as the ever closer inter-linkage of the issues of money  finance  trade and development.What is most regrettable  however  is that these dramatic changes are unfolding while  at the same time  the position and interests of many developing countries are being increasingly marginalized.For the greater part of the 1980s  aptly described as the ""lost decade for development""  developing countries have been caught in a web of cumulative constraints and setbacks. Consequently  their economies remain mired in sluggish growth  their development punctuated by stagnation  reversals and even regression. External indebtedness  often exacerbated by adverse exchange rate fluctuations in the major currencies  has now reached critical levels. Financial flows for development  both official and private  have contracted drastically. Their exports to the developed countries are encountering a plethora of protectionist barriers. Commodity earnings  the economic lifeblood of a majority of developing countries  continue to be in a prolonged slump. Meanwhile  the austere adjustment measures undertaken by most developing countries at the behest of international financial institutions have not only cut deeply into their productive capacities for growth but have also undermined their programmes and projects designed to alleviate the plight of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors of their societies. It is obvious that if no concerted action is taken to reverse their predicament  many developing countries will inevitably remain locked in underdevelopment and risk being side-lined permanently on the periphery of the world economy  thus adding the real and potent threat of social upheaval to national and international peace and stability.In the light of these stark realities in the North-South polarization  there is a clear and urgent need for the United Nations to put the issues of development and international economic relations back on the priority list of the global agenda. It is also clear that in this era of growing interdependence and integration of the world economy the path forward can only be through dialogue and negotiation  based on the premise of mutuality of interests between the North and the South.Indeed  a beginning in this direction has already been made. The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII)  constructively addressed the interrelated issues of resources for development  commodities  international trade and the problems of the least developed countries. The Uruguay Round  if conducted in strict adherence to the Punta del Este understandings and commitments  offers new hope for a more rational and effective multilateral trading system. And the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development adopted in 1986  has joined the international community in a unique partnership of shared responsibility to arrest the continentâs threatened slide into further economic deterioration.We should vigorously pursue and build upon these efforts. A comprehensive  durable and development-oriented solution to the debt crisis  anchored in the shared responsibility of both debtors and creditors  has become imperative. The general principles that should guide us towards such a solution have already been defined in General Assembly resolutions 41/202 and 42/198 and in the Final Act of UNCTAD VII. Urgent action to remedy the commodity situation is required  and we look forward to the Common Fund becoming operational soon. The painful paradox of net transfers of resources from the developing countries to the developed should be reversed and rational perspectives to international development financing should be restored. Central to this objective is the need to convene an international conference on money and finance for development. The recommendations of the recently held Mid-Term Review on the African Recovery and Development Programme should help to intensify international co-operation and mobilize the required financial resources for the Programme's implementation. Additionally  the proposed special session of the General Assembly on .the reactivation of economic growth and development in the developing countries  to be held not later than 1990  will afford us a timely opportunity to adopt a global consensus on concrete action in these interrelated issues. It should also be an occasion to forge greater unity and coherence in our collective responses to the historical opportunities facing us today and in the years ahead.Recently  environmental issues have attracted the heightened attention of the international community. This has resulted from the introduction of two major reports to last year's General Assembly and the intensified concern for such issues as toxic waste  acid rain  climatic change and the ""greenhouse effect""  depletion of the ozone layer  desertification and escalating pollution. The danger of irreversible destruction to the environment is being increasingly recognized. Intense economic activity related to development; as well as conditions of mass poverty and deprivation  ace inextricably linked to the ecological balance of the environment. Essentially  the effective protection of the environment can only be secured through sustainable development and the adoption of stringent international legal instruments. Thus  last year's General Assembly resolutions and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer  ace indeed steps in the right direction. What is new required on this crucial issue of our common survival and common future is that we foster solidarity and partnership among nations for ensuring continued economic growth and development without compromising the well-being of our future generations.  This year the world celebrates the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The principles enshrined in this Declaration have provided the basis for subsequent international and national human rights efforts and have served as a set of guiding principles for our political and social behaviour. In this anniversary year  let us renew our commitment to ensuring recognition of the dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family as the foundation of freedom  justice and peace in the world. In the same spirit  let us not slacken our efforts to eradicate the illicit trafficking in narcotics and to end the tragedy of drug abuse. Nor should we  in the face of the unprecedented numbers of refugees who  fleeing war  natural calamities and the threat of starvation  have sought shelter in neighbouring lands  allow their numbers or the extent of their needs to dissuade us from finding equitable and lasting solutions.As we approach the beginning of a new millennium  there is a resurgent sense of hope that concrete progress is possible in resolving the most intractable global issues that have for so long defied solutions. In this regard  we should indeed pay a tribute to our esteemed Secretary-General  who through his patient and unflagging efforts has considerably brightened the prospects of bringing peace to conflict-ridden regions. But  as he himself pointedly observes in his report on the work of our Organization  the emerging world situation  with major conflicts on the way to solution  is bound to impose additional responsibilities on the Organisation - political  economic and humanitarian. If we are to meet this expectation  it is essential that the financial health of the United Nations be restored and that the process of reform and restructuring to improve its functioning  efficiency and effectiveness be matched by the consistent support  including financial support  of all the Members. Moreover  as we move into what we hope will be a more constructive phase in world developments  it will be incumbent on all Member States  large and small  to utilize the potentials of our Organization in much more rational and purposeful ways. Let us  therefore  seize this opportunity and marshal our collective resolve to strengthen out co-operation and to harmonize out actions in this multilateral forum that is so uniquely qualified to advance our shared aspirations for just peace  common security and equitable prosperity."
"66",3197,"IND",43,1988,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure that a distinguished son and eminent representative of a country with which my country has close and cordial relations is presiding over the General Assembly at its forty-third session. I extend to Ambassador Caputo our warm felicitations on his well-deserved election. We are confident that with his exceptional ability and experience the deliberations of the Assembly have already been assured success. I would like also to place on record our deep appreciation for the effective leadership that his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  provided to the General Assembly during its forty-second session.In his report on the work of the Organization for 1988  the Secretary-General recalled that he was cautiously optimistic that ""the sails of the small boat in which all the people of the Earth were gathered seemed to have caught a light but favourable wind"". (Ð/43/1  p. 2) I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the man who has played no mean role in the careful and patient navigation by which the vessel has come within sight of large sections of the shore. The Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  has earned the admiration of all for his patience  his skill  his understanding touch and his grasp of the larger questions as well as the small details involved in the various issues dealt with by the United Nations. The decision to confer the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding on our Secretary-General was a tribute to his exceptional contribution to the cause of peace.This year  1988  has been the year of the United Nations. In the past few months the patient and persistent diplomacy of the United Nations was capped with the signing of the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan  the entry into force of a cease-fire on the Iran-Iraq border  the renewal of inter-communal talks in Cyprus and the creation of an environment conducive to the resolution of the problem of Western Sahara. Even those who tended to pass judgement on the United Nations purely on the basis of the criteria of the maintenance of international peace and security are happily acknowledging today that this is indeed an impressive record of which the United Nations can be justifiably proud. India welcomes this reaffirmation of faith in the United Nations. For an overwhelming majority of Members  support for the United Nations has always been an article of faith. The universalization of this support during 1988  which we applaud as we always did  will no doubt strengthen the capacity of the Organization  not only with respect to preserving peace but also  equally  to tackling other scourges facing humankind  such as poverty  hunger  ecological degradation  terrorism and narcotics. We trust that the United Nations will be reinvigorated  not only in political terms but also in terms of concrete financial support. Let the coming decades be the decades of the United Nations. Let the all-round support which the United Nations always deserved  but seems to have got this year  be always available to it hereafter.India  along with the rest of the international community  rejoices in the transformation of the international climate during the past year. We are indeed living through historic times. The dramatic improvement in relations between the super-Powers  for which we salute the leadership of the two countries  has had a positive impact throughout the world. History  however  teaches us that good times  like bad times  do not normally last forever. But one may be forgiven on the present occasion for entertaining the belief that the principal players have by now made a realistic assessment of the long-term interests of mankind  along with their respective national interests  and that hence the current thaw may be more lasting than those of the past.The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  since its inception  has worked tirelessly precisely for such a turn in the international climate. By taking principled positions on major issues of our times and by refusing to get entangled in the confrontation of competing military alliances  the non-aligned countries have helped in containing conflict  and have thus contributed to the peace process which has always inhered in the minds of the millions  although it had been rendered dormant and muted by the display of military might. Therefore  we the non-aligned can claim part of the credit for the improved state of affairs. But along with claiming the credit the Movement needs to redouble its efforts to make the peace process irreversible  no longer vulnerable to the braking mechanisms which operated earlier owing to motivations too well known to need recounting.The new air of euphoria is totally understandable as it marks a welcome departure from the intense and often bitter rivalry between the major Powers which at times brought the world to the brink of a catastrophe. It seems to have been replaced now by healthy competition for presenting proposals for strengthening peace  supporting the United Nations  saving the world from ecologic disaster  among others. It is true that this long-awaited spirit of change unfortunately has not extended to the economic field. We would therefore be well-advised to remain watch full and alert  while pursuing determined efforts to make the transformation to peace final and all-pervasive so as to comprehend all facets of human life and activity on our planet. While the primary responsibility would remain with the major Powers  the rest of us and  of course  the United Nations  can and must play a very important role.The ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - by the United States and the Soviet Union was a historic first step which must  within an agreed time-frame and in well-considered stages  lead to successive reductions and eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons. While we are fully aware of the complexities involved in disarmament negotiations  we find that political will has enabled the experts to find satisfactory answers to what were projected as almost un-resolvable difficulties of adequate verification. Similar political will would be needed in solving the whole gamut of disarmament questions  beginning with the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons by 50 per cent  which has already been agreed upon.Those steps  each important in itself  have to be viewed in the perspective of a comprehensive scenario of total disarmament. Only thus do they make sense and become effective and beneficial. At the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament in June this year  my Prime Minister  Rajiv Gandhi  put forward a comprehensive action plan for the total elimination of all nuclear weapons by the year 2010. That action plan has received appreciation in the Non-Aligned Movement  among other Governments as well as non-governmental organizations. We put forward our proposal to give concrete shape to the desire of a large segment of world public opinion for a time-bound action programme to eliminate nuclear weapons. We should also take into account other related aspects including verification.With regard to verification  delegates will recall that the delegations of countries participating in the six-nation initiative for peace and nuclear disarmament presented a concrete proposal at the third special session on disarmament the endorsement  in principle  of an international verification agency within the United Nations. It is the intention of the six countries to revive this initiative at this session of the General Assembly.The linkage between disarmament and development is by now well-recognized. Hardly anyone can dispute the proposition that the resources being spent on armaments could be more profitably employed in peaceful developmental activities. The decisions taken by the United Nations Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  held last year  need to be followed up and acted upon.Regional conflicts have dominated discussions at the current session of the General Assembly. This is perfectly understandable. Success in achieving breakthroughs is most of these conflicts is attributed  and justifiably so  to the patient diplomacy of the United Nations  as well as to the rapprochement between the two super-Powers. There is  perhaps  a lesson for all of us in this  particularly for the non-aligned and developing countries. If the tendency to seek massive external military assistance and to pursue dangerous nuclear weapon policies in the illusory hope of strengthening one's bargaining position with one's neighbours were resisted  there would be fewer regional conflicts and consequently less dependence on outside Powers for the solution of such conflicts.India rejoiced at the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq which came into effect on 20 August 1988. Thanks to the statesmanship of the leaders of the two countries and to the efforts of the Secretary-General  the international community has been spared witnessing the eighth anniversary of the war. The cease-fire is an important first step and must be consolidated. The negotiations between the two countries currently under way  under United Nations auspices  must be pursued. The issues involved are complex and highly emotional for both sides. India has been involved in discussing the issues in detail with the two countries as part of the efforts of the Non-Aligned Movement. That experience makes me feel confident that the issues  though complex  will eventually be solved. India has the closest of ties with Iran and Iraq  and we know that the two countries are anxious to get on with the stupendous task of reconstruction.My country rejoices at the release of the Indian national  Mr. Mithileshwar Singh. We hope that all the other hostages will also be freed and reunited with their families at an early date.India has welcomed the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan. We have had historical ties of deep friendship with the people of Afghanistan. The Geneva Accords have established & framework which would enable the Afghan people to decide on their future free from foreign interference or intervention. While the withdrawal of Soviet troops has proceeded on schedule  we are greatly perturbed at persistent reports of violations of the Geneva Accords and hope that they will be implemented faithfully by all the parties. In addition to restoring peace and stability to the region  the implementation of the Geneva Accords would also remove the ostensible cause for introduction of sophisticated arms into the area.While positive developments have taken place in the Gulf as well as in Afghanistan  the continued great-Power naval presence in the Indian Ocean remains a factor contributing to tension and instability. We reiterate our call for the withdrawal of all military forces of outside Powers from the Indian Ocean so that it can emerge as a zone of peace.There is more than a glimmer of hope for the resolution of the conflict situation in South-East Asia. The horrors suffered by the people of Kampuchea in the 1970s must not be allowed to revisit them ever. The dialogue at the Jakarta Informal Meeting was a welcome beginning  which we appreciate. We also applaud the initiative of the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to explore ways and means in which the Movement can assist the efforts to solve the Kampuchean problem. Given India's historical ties with the peoples of South-East Asia  we are ready and willing to contribute in whatever way we can to this process.In our neighbourhood  we have watched with growing concern the trials and tribulations faced by the people of Burma  with whom the people of India are bound by close ties of history and culture. India has always scrupulously avoided interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. However  we cannot but sympathize with democratic aspirations. We are saddened by the growing number of innocent dead in Burma. We hope that a way will be found to end this tragic conflict as soon as possible.There is renewed belief that the long-delayed solution to the Namibian question is at hand. Responsibility for the delay rests squarely with the South African Government  which has  with impunity  refused to comply with its international commitments and obligations. The world community is committed to the emancipation of the Namibian people engaged in a historic struggle for freedom under the leadership of the South West African People's Organization (SWAPO). Their sole and authentic representative. India was the first country to accord diplomatic recognition to the representative of it. We look forward to welcoming Namibia as the 160th Member of the United Nations at the General Assembly session next year.While there is movement on the question of Namibia  the situation in South Africa itself shows no sign of improvement. The racist Pretoria regime continues its reign of terror  subjecting the people of South Africa to the most inhuman forms of oppression. The evil system of apartheid cannot be reformed  it has to be abolished in total. South Africa must open Ð° dialogue with the genuine representatives of the oppressed people. Nelson Mandela  the universal symbol of courage and fortitude  whose state of health is a cause of concern to all of us  must be released immediately and unconditionally. Effective pressure in the form of comprehensive mandatory sanctions must be applied  without invoking unconvincing arguments regarding their effect on employment of the oppressed people  and so on.The Action for Resisting Invasion  Colonialism and apartheid (AFRICA) Fund  established by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  has received pledges and contributions from a third of the world community. Described at the recent meeting of the non-aligned in Nicosia  Cyprus  as an instance of the Movement's capacity for collective action  the Fund demonstrates an international commitment to the front-line States and liberation movements of southern Africa transcending geographical or political barriers.The international 00tmunity should be opposed to racial discrimination no matter where it is practised. Last year my delegation referred to the unfortunate developments in Fiji  which had distinct racial overtones. He hoped that the groundswell of international public opinion would help restore the spirit of trust  harmony and concord which had prevailed in Fiji since its independence. As a Member of the United Nations and as a member of its Committee on decolonization  India had been in the forefront in the fight for Fiji's independence. It is a matter of great regret to us that the situation in Fiji has considerably deteriorated during the past year. There are clear indications that an attempt is being made to institutionalise racial discrimination in Fiji. We understand that there is to be a process of consultation with the various communities before the draft constitution is finalized. We hope that this process will enable all sections of the people to participate in it in a non-discriminatory manner. There was a time when Fiji used to be described as ""what the world should be like"". The racial harmony  peace and tranquillity in Fiji used to be a model for the world to follow. We hope that Fiji will return soon to those harmonious times.India's support of the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people has its roots in our own struggle against colonial rule. Many changes have taken place in the region. What has remained constant  however  is the determination of the Palestinian people. The message of intifadah to the world is unambiguous  20 years of occupation have utterly failed to suppress the fierce nationalism of the Palestinian people. It should also have made it clear to the world  including Israel  that territories illegally occupied cannot be retained forever. Israel must withdraw from the territories it has occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem. We reiterate the call for the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East  with the participation of all the parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  on an equal footing. Such a conference  we believe  should facilitate the establishment of an independent homeland for the Palestinians and the creation of conditions in which all the States in the region can live within secure and recognized boundaries.India has always supported the aspirations of the people of Cyprus to live together in Ñ independent and non-aligned country  with its territorial integrity intact. We deeply appreciate the resumption of dialogue between the two communities under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General. We urge both sides to spare no effort to find a solution to the problem within the time-limit envisaged by the Secretary-General.Similarly  we ate heartened by the acceptance by the two sides concerned of the Secretary-General's proposals for finding a solution to the problem of Western Sahara. Here again  we hope that this question will be resolved satisfactorily so that the people of the territory  as well as other countries in the Maghreb  can live in peace and co-operation with one another.In the Korean peninsula  which unhappily remains divided  there is an overwhelming sentiment in favour of peace  reconciliation and dialogue. We hops the aspirations of its people to peaceful reunification will find early fulfilment.This year marks the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Declaration  which furnishes the philosophical basis for the human rights work of the United Nations  is of seminal importance. Like the Charter itself  it points to the interdependence of human rights  social and economic progress and international peace and security. Over the past four decades  the concepts embodied in the Declaration have been developed and enriched  particularly with regard to economic  social and cultural rights. It remains our firm belief that the inherent dignity of the human person requires full respect for his civil and political rights and  equally  for his economic  social and cultural rights.While there; have been encouraging developments recently in the political sphere  the outlook in the area of international economic co-operation remains bleak. The low rates of growth of world trade and output in recent years will not suffice to resolve any of the major problems facing the world economy. In the industrialized countries high rates of unemployment persist  making it difficult for them to undertake the structural adjustments that ate necessary in the long term. The major imbalance  with its attendant uncertainties  continues to persist. For the developing countries the outlook is even worse. Inadequate resource flows  deteriorating terms of trade and the heavy burden of external debt have all but halted the development process of these countries. They have retarded attempts to address the fundamental problem of poverty and deprivation. The 1980s are being characterized as the lost decade of development.The policies of the major developed countries constitute the essential determinants of the external environment for the developing countries. There has been no coherent and considered effort to fashion these policies on the basis of co-operative international action  taking into account their impact and consequences for the developing countries. Here it is useful to recall the proposals made by the developing countries for removing the structural deficiencies and fundamental failings of the international monetary  financial and trading systems. The underlying structural and systemic problems of the world economy have to be addressed by deliberate and co-operative international action that gives full recognition to global interdependence. Both the developed and the developing countries need to pursue convergent and mutually reinforcing policies in the interrelated areas of trade  money and finance.The area of international trade is being increasingly characterized by an erosion of the accepted rules and regulations and by reliance on unilateral discriminatory action. Despite repeated affirmation of commitments on standstill and rollback  protectionism continues to grow unabated. Protectionist measures ate imposed in those areas where the developing countries have demonstrated their competitiveness and made investments for structural reforms. There has been little progress so far in the ongoing Uruguay Round on multilateral trade negotiations in areas of direct interest to the developing countries  such as safeguards  textiles  agriculture and tropical products. The Uruguay Round should provide an important opportunity for strengthening and preserving the multilateral trading system. It should also help to reduce the tensions and distortions that characterize the world trade system.The proposals made in the new areas in the Uruguay Round have to be consistent with the right of developing countries to manage their economies in accordance with their national objectives and priorities  to regulate activities of transnational corporations and to channel investment into those desired sectors of their economies. Such proposals should promote the autonomous and self-reliant development of those countries.Another area of concern is the stagnation or decline  in real terms  of resource flows to developing countries. The international financial system has failed to ensure the transfer of adequate resources on proper terms and conditions to developing countries and thus provide adequate financing for development activities. The alleviation of the current development crisis requires Ð· more effective system that will guarantee an increasing flow of resources  in particular official development assistance resources  to developing countries and also guarantee access by international monetary and financial institutions to adequate resources.Let us collectively recognize the need to evolve a more broad-based system for managing the world economy that reflects the interests of all groups of countries and provides an equitable and harmonious basis for the collective management of global interdependence. The seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was a small step in this direction. In the coming days we must make use of other opportunities for building a renewed consensus on development directed against the global problem of hunger and poverty. The formulation and elaboration of an international development strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade provides such opportunity.The virtual paralysis of the North-South dialogue makes it all the more important for the developing countries to redouble their efforts to collective self-reliance through the economic co-operation among developing countries. It has become imperative for developing countries to build on complementary in their economies. In this respect the conclusion in Belgrade earlier this year of the Agreement on the Global System of Trade Preferences was a significant achievement. It laid down for the first time among the signatory developing countries the legal and institutional foundation for trade expansion.In our own region the formation of the South Asian Association of Regional Co-operation has provided a framework for wide-ranging economic and technical co-operation. Specific areas of mutually beneficial co-operation have been identified and practical measures are being implemented by member States.One is  however  constrained to note that economic co-operation among developing countries has developed only partially and its full potential remains unexplored. What is needed is a hard look at concrete programmes to address  in the first instance and in the main  the elementary human needs of a large chunk of humanity. In these areas it is possible to make a better impact than has happened so far.During the current year many developing countries have been hit by natural disasters requiring urgent international relief operations. Large areas in Africa have been afflicted by prolonged drought. Jamaica has been devastated by a hurricane of unprecedented magnitude  and Sudan by floods. Our own region  South Asia  has witnessed widespread havoc caused by floods  above all in Bangladesh  though we too have not been spared the ravages of floods. It was our privilege  as a friendly neighbour  to be the first to go to the assistance of the people of Bangladesh in response to an appeal from the Government of Bangladesh. A task force of experts from Bangladesh and India has been set up to study the Ganga and Brahmaputra waters jointly for flood management and the water flow thereof. Over the past two decades  drug abuse and illicit trafficking in drugs have assumed proportions of a major global problem  not only affecting consumers but also posing serious problems for transit States. We hope that the Plenipotentiary Conference scheduled to convene in Vienna later this year in order to finalize a draft convention on this question will meet with success.The United Nations is dedicated to the pursuit of the twin goals of peace and development. It can claim credit for significant achievements in both these spheres  and in particular in recent months we have seen encouraging progress in the resolution of complex political issues. But in the sphere of economic and social development  its major successes belong to past decades; its achievements recently have been relatively modest. We must renew our commitment to the eradication of the evils of poverty  disease and illiteracy through concerted international action. This is a struggle that must be waged in common by all humankind. As Jawaharlal Nehru told the Assembly in 1963  ""The only war we want is a war against poverty and disease and its brood"".Many centuries ago India's sages gave the calls ""Let us move  together. Let us talk  together. Let us be of single common mind.""The renewed sense of community witnessed in the United Nations today gives hope that over the coming year  in time for its forty-fourth session  the world body can set before itself a viable specific agenda for the 1990s that would help render our planet ready for the century drawing in upon it. Such an agenda must assess and chart the means of fulfilment of the minimum needs of man. The world  as Mahatma Gandhi put it  has enough to fulfil man's need  but not his greed. This distinction between need and greed becomes all the more real and crucial at a time when geo-environmental  geo-economic and geo-political imperatives have to be fully harmonized in the interest of survival. Runaway desires of imprudent humans must be tailored so as to be compatible with the capacity to fulfil them. If we collectively determine to do that  this forum  the United Nations  is the place where we must begin  for the United Nations is as strong  and only as strong  as the will of its Members.And when we talk of Members  let us not forget that behind the Member States represented in this Assembly are the men and women of the world. It is they that give this Organisation its flesh and its blood and should therefore legitimately dictate its aspirations and efforts. Their control over rulers who fall short of or go beyond their mandate is not as palpable as it should be  but that is part of man's constant aspiration  which the United Nations needs to be inspired by in order to give effective voice to the millions who cannot speak for themselves.The United Nations should thus promote the ascendancy of peoples  translating into reality the relationships which the peoples would wish to have among themselves.Invested with a popular dimension  rooted in a time when the process of peace can be rendered irreversible and man's scarce energies given a chance to better his own being  this is the moment for the United Nations which should endure until the mission for humanity is completed.We must not fail."
"67",3243,"IRL",43,1988,"ï»¿I should like first to offer Mr. Dante Caputo my sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. I should also like to pay a tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin who so ably and effectively conducted the affairs of the forty-second session and also those of the special session devoted to disarmament. My friend and colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece  Mr. Karolos Papoulias  has already addressed the Assembly in the name of the Twelve member States of the European Community and Ireland of course associates itself fully with his remarks.As we meet for the forty-third session of the General Assembly and as we survey the world scene  it is pleasing to be able to note that prospects look somewhat brighter than they did at this time last year - indeed  better than they have done for many years now. A series of regional crises which have been the subject of debate in this Assembly for all too many years appear to have been moved from the point of inertia. In the case of others  admittedly  the first step still has to be taken. So our optimism needs to be tempered. Nevertheless we can be encouraged by what has already been achieved.It is even more pleasing for this delegation to note the essential role played by the United Nations in the progress that has so far been made. We have always regarded this Organization as the central forum for the resolution of international conflict. We have not been blind to its weaknesses  which have received much emphasis in recent years. But looking behind weaknesses  we have been convinced that the Organization has retained the ability to achieve the noble aims set out in the Charter.The emphasis placed in more recent years on the flaws of the Organization was not entirely negative. It is not surprising if  after more than 40 years of existence  critical appraisal makes it apparent that some measures of reform are necessary. We therefore welcomed and supported the efforts of the Secretary-General to increase the efficiency of the United Nations and to improve its day-to-day functioning. We salute the progress that has been made towards this end and we can assure the Secretary-General of our support for his continuing endeavour. We believe that a great deal is at stake here.What is at stake is the continued existence of the Organization in the terms set out in the Charter. This established the Organization on the basis of the sovereign equality of all its Members. It went on to impose certain obligations on Members. This principle and these obligations have not of course always sat comfortably with all Members. In the course of the last 43 years first one and then another Member State has found itself irked to some extent. It is notable  however  that they have all come to acknowledge that the Organization plays an indispensable role.A genuine commitment finding its expression in effective operation of the United Nations in accordance with the Charter clearly has a particular attraction for a country such as ray own  whose security depends  not on force of arms but on the establishment of an international order based on the observance of international law. We would like to think  however  that our interest in the United Nations is not selfish. In an era of weapons of mass destruction  whether nuclear  chemical or more conventional  and of ever greater interdependence throughout the world there can be no doubt that the framework provided by the United Nations is in the interest of all States.But the existence of a framework will not of itself achieve that rule of law based on justice and tempered with generosity which is the only basis for permanent peace. There is a need for a clear commitment on the part of Member States  including actual or potential belligerents  to use to the full the mechanisms available under the Charter. Members of the Security Council have  of course  special responsibilities in this regard and we welcome the evidence of their increased willingness to discharge these responsibilities. We must all see what we can do to divert the skills and capabilities of mankind away from war  or the threat of war  and towards economic and social improvement. Such sacrifices as this may entail are small when compared with the horrific cost in human lives and suffering which any war inevitably inflicts.When looking at the record of the past year it is intriguing to wonder why this progress was made over that period rather than  say  during the preceding 10 years. It would be inappropriate in my view to seek any single reason. However  it must be acknowledged that the relationship between the super-Powers is of major importance; this relationship is the prime determinant of the international climate and this climate affects international relations in general. All Members of the United Nations welcome the improvement in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. This improvement has had a twofold effect. It has resulted in a commitment on the part of the super-Powers themselves not only to improve their bilateral relations  but to search for ways to reduce the possibilities of confrontation between them in regional conflicts. The improvement in the international climate which has thus been brought about has induced the participants in regional conflicts themselves to search for ways peacefully to resolve these conflicts.While acknowledging the importance of the super-Power relationship  it is notable that in every case United Nations involvement has been an essential element in the progress made towards resolution of regional conflicts. I should like particularly to congratulate the Secretary-General on the success he has had so far in this respect. He must be able to rely on the full support and on the loyal co-operation of all Members of the Organization  including of course the super-Powers  in his efforts to secure international peace and stability.If a political commitment is a necessary condition for effective action by the United Nations to maintain peace and security and to promote peaceful resolution of conflict  it is  alas  not sufficient in itself. Of no less importance is the assurance of the necessary financial means. Those who will the end must also will the means. If they fail to do so the potential benefits of political consensus in the United Nations will not be realized and the credibility of the Organization will be seriously compromised. It is imperative that United Nations finances be put on a firm and sound footing. All that is required is that all Member States discharge the legal commitment  freely undertaken  to pay their mandatory contribution to the general budget and to the various peace-keeping accounts. It is heartening to note the recent indications that Member States do indeed acknowledge the necessity of this commitment and have taken practical steps to implement it.The peace-keeping function of the Organization has been highlighted only today by the well-deserved award to the United Nations peace-keeping forces of the Nobel Peace Prize. I congratulate the peace-keeping forces of the Organization on this award. It arises at a very appropriate time. An important factor in the Organization's involvement over the past year in the settlement of regional conflicts has been the role of United Nations peace-keeping and observer forces. They have been established most recently to monitor the implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan and the cease-fire in the war between Iran and Iraq. In a number of other areas where we all hope early progress towards a settlement can be made  United Nations peace-keeping or observer forces will be an essential element of the settlement.I should like here to focus in particular on the financial difficulties of peace-keeping operations  including those of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFILÂ·). The burden of financing these forces must not fall disproportionately on a small number of troop-contributing countries. In each case the decision to establish such forces commits the Organization as a whole. It is crucial that there be a secure foundation for financing peace-keeping operations  in order that troop contributors can be reliably assured that the agreed financing provisions will be observed and that they will not face an unfair financial burden because of undertaking this task.Let me say here that my concern is not related solely to money. Indeed  the sums of money involved pale into insignificance when compared to the supreme sacrifice many individual members of peace-keeping and observer forces have made while serving under the United Nations flag. The financial costs must surely be accepted as of small significance when one considers the prevention of death  destruction and human suffering that the operations of such forces usually secure  however  fragile the basis. But even in terms of financial costs United Nations peace-keeping forces are a very economical alternative to the maintenance of unilateral or multilateral forces  which impose massive costs and which  because usually they are seen to be partisan  are less likely to facilitate progress towards a permanent solution.My concern is mainly with the political implications of the failure of all Member States to discharge their financial obligations under the Charter. I am not talking about the temporary difficulties of an economic or financial nature that any State may encounter from time to time. I am referring to decisions made by States to withhold their assessed mandatory contributions for political reasons. Such decisions may be interpreted by parties to a conflict as implying a lack of support for a particular peace-keeping operation. Indeed  it is difficult to conceive of a deliberate decision to withhold due financial contributions as other than an expression of withdrawal of support for an operation. When one considers that  ultimately  political solutions must L-s wound  that if: an unacceptable risk. If some Member States pick and choose those observer or peace-keeping missions concerning which they will make or withhold their mandatory financial contributions  individual operations may be undermined. Worse  the whole concept of United Nations peace-keeping  on which so many hopes are now hanging  would be emptied of any credibility.We celebrate this year the fortieth anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. One could say that the very existence of the United Nations arose from a recognition borne of the bitter experience of war that real and lasting peace and security between nations must be based on universal acknowledgement of the inherent dignity and worth of the individual human being. This is as valid today as when the Declaration was first proclaimed. At its last session the General Assembly unanimously resolved to use the occasion of this anniversary to promote and protect human rights throughout the world  to renew the Organization's commitment to this objective and to encourage Member States to ensure the promotion and protection of the rights enshrined in the Declaration. If we are to build on the tremendous progress that has been made over the last 40 years in the development of international instruments for the protection of human rights  we need a sustained and credible United Nations campaign to promote the universal observance and enjoyment of these rights. At a time when grave abuses continue to occur  and are widely known to occur  there is no room here for complacency.Pride in the achievement of the United Nations in the area of human rights is justified. Paradoxically  perhaps  one important achievement is that awareness of the degree of abuse of these rights world-wide has dramatically increased. Today the world community recognizes the inherent dignity and worth of the individual and accepts that the protection and promotion of his human rights are international obligations. While the United Nations cannot itself enforce the standards it has been instrumental in developing  it must not underestimate the moral authority it can bring to bear for the correction of abuses in this area. An important instrument for bringing pressure to bear on behalf of the victims of oppression is informed public opinion imbued with the values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Organization therefore has a very positive role to play in stimulating public awareness of the need for vigilance and in mobilizing the support of international public opinion for the correction of abuses wherever they occur.Ireland recognizes and honours the tremendous contributions which  inspired by the ideals set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  individuals and national and international organizations have made by mobilizing effective public pressure in the defence of fundamental freedoms for victims of oppression. In many instances this has been accomplished at great personal risk to the individuals concerned. We attach great major importance to the human rights endeavour because we are convinced of the truth of the opening words of the Universal Declaration. Recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom  peace and justice in the world. I have already referred to the improvement in East-West relations which has taken place in the recent past. My Government believes that it is essential to maintain the impetus of the Washington and Moscow summits between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev and to halt and reverse the trend towards an accelerating arms race. The agreed-upon commitment to reduce nuclear forces by 50 per cent has yet to be realized  but at least there is a commitment there.At such an encouraging time in United States-Soviet bilateral arms control and disarmament negotiations it is all the more important that a fresh commitment to the multilateral process emerge and that concrete achievements be recorded  thus reaffirming the interest of all countries in the goal of general and complete disarmament.The first step  and one that we believe can and should be taken without further delay  is the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. At the technical level  this could minimize  although not eliminate  the ability to design new weapons. More important  perhaps  it would be a clear signal of intention to reduce reliance on such dangerous and  in the final analysis  irrational means of defence. My delegation is convinced that the technical problems that appear to be in the way of reaching a test-ban agreement can be surmounted  given the political will.It is  or should be clear that possession of nuclear weapons inevitably leads to a similar response from others  thus greatly increasing the threat to a country's security and even to its prospect of survival. Nevertheless  there is still a number of countries which have not abandoned the nuclear weapons option and remain outside the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It is my Government's belief that no one can secure advantage through a proliferation of nuclear weapons. We hope that in the years ahead the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will be strengthened  that the number of signatories will be further expanded and that it will be an enduring element in an era of greater efforts to promote and achieve nuclear-arms control and disarmament.The international community has been profoundly shocked by recent reports of the use of chemical weapons. We should all be very gravely concerned that what we have for 63 years regarded as progress in this area - the Protocol banning any use of chemical weapons  dating from 1925 - has been reversed. We have to ensure that this reverse will not be regarded as a headline and go further. The participants in the Conference on Disarmament must dedicate themselves to the task of negotiating a convention banning the production of chemical weapons  with a view to its early conclusion  so that this spectre can finally be banished from the Earth.It is the hope of my Government that the improvement in East-West relations and recent developments in the Soviet Union will also be reflected at the Vienna meeting currently taking place of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The mutual trust and confidence so necessary to ensuring lasting peace and security must encompass all dimensions of the relations between the countries of East and West. They cannot be confined to the military area. Hence  we look forward to agreement at Vienna in the very near future on a concluding document which will provide both for new negotiations on conventional forces and for a further advance in the human dimension of the Helsinki Final Act.The need for a speedy and orderly settlement in the Middle East is clear to all who wish well to the people of Israel and to the population of the occupied territories. The present situation  in the words of the statement of the European Council on this matter  ""cannot be sustained"". It will be brought to an end only by means of a comprehensive  just and lasting political settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The twin pillars of principle on which Irish policy on this difficult issue rests are: the right of all States in the region  including Israel  to exist within secure frontiers  and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  with all that that implies. We acknowledge that this right includes the right to an independent State  if the Palestinian people should so decide. The Irish delegation appeals for the setting aside of all obstacles which bar the way to negotiations based on these principles.Any solution will call for basic mutual acceptance and reciprocal recognition of the indomitable human spirit that ensures that a people will not yield  and cannot be put in a position of yielding  to brute force. We believe that the peoples of the region  in accordance with their own best traditions  would wish their leaders to practice the principles of tolerance and good-neighbourliness enshrined in the Charter. It is our hope that the evolution of events inside and outside the region will be such as to permit the peaceful aspirations of the peoples of the region finally to be realized. The way forward requires leadership endowed with courage  wisdom and vision. These are the qualities of statesmanship particularly required in this area.The difficulties in the Lebanon cannot be dissociated from the wider conflict in the Middle East. There has regrettably been a heightening of tension there in recent days. We hope that the search for reconciliation and stability in the Lebanon will be pursued and that forces outside the country will exercise restraint and will respect the territorial integrity  sovereignty and political independence of the Lebanon  which is essential if peace is to be restored to the country. I should like to pay a tribute to UNIFIL  which continues to operate in difficult circumstances in southern Lebanon. UNIFIL has never been permitted to fulfil its mandate  despite its repeated renewal by the Security Council over the past 10 years. The Force must be afforded the full co-operation of all the parties to the conflict. My Government reiterates its call for an end to the harassment of UNIFIL and urges all patties to co-operate fully with the Force.We have welcomed the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and should like to compliment the Secretary-General warmly on his strenuous efforts towards this end. Without in any ay underestimating the difficulties which remain to be overcome  we have been heartened that the leadership in both countries has had the courage and wisdom to take the first steps along the honourable road to peace. We wish the Secretary-General and the parties concerned well in their continuing efforts. We hope that the blessings of peace will be enjoyed by all communities in both countries.The Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan represent an important step towards a solution of the Afghan crisis. They impose obligations on all the parties.Ireland calls upon all concerned to implement fully the peace process set out in these Agreements.We welcome recent contacts between parliamentarians from the North and the South of the Korean peninsula and the efforts which have been made to bring about a resumption of the suspended direct dialogue aimed at reaching a solution by peaceful means. Indeed  on another note  we extend our best wishes for the success of the Olympic Games there as an example of practical international co-operation currently being observed by millions around the globe.When we look at South Africa we can see no progress since last year. On the contrary  the apartheid system has been reinforced by further repression  harsher censorship and a ban on all those organizations which do not follow the Government line to the full. The effective silencing of the black political organizations and trade union movement and the ban on such organizations as the Soweto Civic Association and the National Education Crisis Committee are just unacceptable. They are further heavy blows on the suffering black population. Once again I must appeal to the South African Government to cease its defiance of international opinion and to take the necessary steps to dismantle apartheid  starting with the release of all political prisoners  including Nelson Mandela  and the removal of the ban on the 18 organizations now debarred from carrying on their work of peaceful opposition to apartheid.On Namibia  early action is imperative to enable implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) to go ahead smoothly. While South Africa's recently stated willingness to cease its obstruction of the implementation process is a welcome  if long overdue  development  it is the duty of the international community to ensure that other obstacles do not hamper the country's transition to independence.Lasting peace and stability in Central America will come only through the persistent efforts of the Central American countries themselves  with the whole-hearted support of other members of the international community. We appeal to them to continue along the path which they themselves have marked out  in particular in the Guatemala agreement of August 1987  and to pursue national dialogue and the search for peaceful settlements. In my address to the Assembly last year I referred to the threat to the well-being of millions of people posed by the insecure world economic environment. The interrelated problems of developing-country debt  low commodity prices  barriers in international trade  declining financial flows to developing areas are unfortunately still with us. Those and other problems  environmental as well as economic  still threaten the livelihood and even the lives of millions of our fellow human beings.In recent weeks  for example  massive flooding has caused severe suffering and loss of life in Bangladesh and in Sudan. A major international effort to combat drought in Ethiopia continues. In some African countries development is also  regrettably  hindered by civil unrest  sometimes amounting to civil war. Elsewhere the unrest is wilfully provoked from outside. That is the case of Mozambique  the victim of destabilization efforts by its neighbour South Africa. As for Angola  there are now some encouraging signs that this destabilization process and the destruction of the lives of ordinary people may be coming to an end.Africa's need for external help if it is to develop its potential and raise incomes above subsistence levels has long been recognized by the international community. Both individual donor countries and multilateral institutions have for more than two decades now been giving official development assistance on a large scale  although the results have been disappointing.Let us hope that the outcome of the recent review meeting on Africa and the recent decisions  which I welcome  to increase the capital of the World Bank and to replenish for the eighth time the funds of the International Development Association will be significant steps in dealing with Africa's development problems.The balance sheet I am bringing the Assembly today on the situation in Northern Ireland is  I am afraid  a rather mixed one. I am sure that I speak for the overwhelming majority of people in Ireland  North and South  when I say that we are all saddened beyond measure at the violence which has afflicted Northern Ireland for almost 20 years and which has brought nothing but death  destruction and suffering to the people of the area  both nationalist and unionist. Suffering and pain are  as we all know  non-discriminatory in their impact.It is hardly necessary for me to state again that the Irish Government shares the commitment of all democratic Governments to the fight against terrorism. Indeed  our determination in that regard has been tellingly illustrated over the past year. But the achievement of peace and political progress is inevitably a larger and more complex task than merely combating campaigns of violence. The whole history and experience of the United Nations underline the absolute necessity of responding to the causes of divisions as well as trying to treat their symptoms.In the specific context of Northern Ireland  it is imperative that the rights  identities and ethos of the two traditions be not alone recognize. But comprehensively accommodated and advanced. While the effective pursuit of that objective will impinge on all areas of government  it will have immediate implications for the system of administering justice - with the need to demonstrate absolute impartiality becoming ever more urgent for relations between the security forces and the community and for addressing the very real problems of economic and social discrimination and disadvantage.The Anglo-Irish Agreement of November 1985 seeks to address many of those Problems. The British and Irish Governments remain firmly committed to the Agreement and are implementing it actively - indeed  this year the Intergovernmental Conference  established under the Agreement  has been meeting more frequently than at any period since the Agreement was signed. Much valuable progress has been achieved. I would be misleading the Assembly  however  if I did not state clearly that a large body of sensitive issues remains to be tackled effectively. The review of the working of the Intergovernmental Conference  which is scheduled for later this year  will give both Governments an important opportunity to review progress to date and  in particular  to see how in future we can best use the terms of reference and machinery of the Agreement to achieve real political progress.A further lesson to be drawn from the history of this great Organization is the importance of dialogue in enhancing the understanding of problems and the parameters within which solutions must be found. All of us on the island of Ireland  no matter how our visions of the future may differ  have a common responsibility to work towards solutions in a spirit of mutual understanding and respect. Let us  as political leaders  begin to talk together in an open and generous way; we owe no less to our people  who so desperately yearn for a lasting peace.I know I can count on the support of this Organization in our efforts to move imaginatively and effectively towards a resolution of the problems of Northern Ireland. The achievement of peace through political progress is the objective we have set ourselves - and this is an objective which is thoroughly consistent with the Charter of the United Nations.When one reviews International relations and the prospects for progress in the period ahead  one must of necessity do so with a degree of caution. But this natural reluctance to raise unreal expectations of immediate solutions to problems which require the patient application of reason and compromise should not lead us to ignore one of the most encouraging developments of the past year - the renewed recognition on the part of Member States of the value of the United Nations as the central forum for the resolution of international conflict. It is the forum indeed in which the commitment of all members of the international community to regulate their affairs in accordance with international law should find its proper and appropriate expression. We rejoice at the recognition  even if it is a bit belated  of the unique and central role of our Organization in that respect."
"68",3290,"IRN",43,1988,"ï»¿Allow me at the outset  Sir  to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and as a non-aligned member of tile Security Council Argentina has consistently played a significant and constructive role in the international arena. I therefore sincerely hope that during the present deliberations your leadership will render effective and decisive contributions to international peace and security.During the past year the world has witnessed some new developments which have shown a prospect for a new movement in the international arena. Preceding speakers have all expressed their satisfaction at seeing the course of international relations directed towards mutual understanding and finding peaceful solutions to regional and international conflicts and crises. This fresh atmosphere is imbued with new hopes for the future as well as new and more serious expectations among all nations. As a forum for the international community  virtually embracing all the countries in the world  the United Nations has now become the focus of attention. As such  it is now facing a momentous and valuable litmus test. Given the fresh hopes  however  it is too early now to pass a final judgement on the role of this massive and complex Organization. We are fully aware that political expediency has been and will continue to be a determining and often negative and destructive factor in the activities of the United Nations. Admittedly  these unfortunate considerations cannot be expected to disappear easily from the United Nations.Should internationally recognized norms and principles guide our efforts  the ill effects of political expediency would of themselves subside  facilitating the promotion of understanding and the search for just solutions to complex international problems. Following this very guideline  the Secretary-General has admirably succeeded in providing the global community with a new perspective for substantial achievements by the United Nations. In dealing with complex international crises  such as the questions of Afghanistan  Namibia  Kampuchea  Cyprus and the war imposed by Iraq on the Islamic Republic of Iran  the constructive endeavours of the Secretary-General and his representatives are evident  endeavours inspired by realism  impartiality and integrity. These sincere efforts have deservedly met with global appreciation for the Secretary-General.Given the extensive domain of the Organization's activities and the expectations aroused by its recent achievements in dealing with various international problems  the present session of the General Assembly is Inevitably faced with some momentous tasks. Here  we cannot  and should not  fall back upon past practice and simply remain content with the mere adoption of a few resolutions. A slow  conservative pace at the United Nations will no longer be acceptable to the international community. The means and capabilities required for the shared responsibility oÂ£ conducting international affairs with a view to the enhancement of peace and security are all available to us. Today  it has been demonstrated in practice that the era of a bipolar world  the era of dominance by superâPowers over the destinies of the world and the oppressed nations is very much a closed chapter. A quite new era has been ushered in  an era in which peaceful coexistence and mutual respect for the rights of nations must inevitably replace the old policies of domination. The struggle of oppressed nations and the efforts exercised by non-aligned and neutral countries have significantly contributed to the inculcation of this new trend and attitude.	.What is needed at present to guarantee the success of this new trend is to treat the root causes of regional crises which have distressingly turned into protracted  chronic diseases in many parts of the world  so as to preclude the resurgence of crisis and acts of aggression  or at least render them too costly for the potential perpetrators. This goal may be achieved only through the establishment of justice and the restoration of the principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter in dealing with international problems.Undoubtedly one of the most sensitive crises which has put to the test the United Nations capability in dealing with international problems is the war imposed by Iraq against the Islamic Republic of Iran. The blatant aggression by Iraq on 22 September 1980 against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the newly established government of the Islamic Republic of Iran - in the course of which even the most basic standards of human  decency and universally recognised norms of international law have been violated by Iraq# sparing no one from atrocities ranging from massive bombardment of residential quarters  massacring- innocent women and children to the deployment of chemical weapons against Iraqi civilians - provides international public opinion with a roost obvious case of aggression and war crimes.Unfortunately  the indifferent and unprincipled approach displayed during these eight years by international bodies vis-Ã -vis abhorrent acts of aggression and violations of recognized rules and norms of international law have set a dangerous precedent in political expediency  shaping responses to acts threatening international peace and security.Notwithstanding this approach  the Islamic Republic of Iran  ever since the inception of the imposed war  has sincerely continued its co-operation with the Secretary-General in pursuing a political solution to the conflict. This was recently made quite evident in the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  a resolution in whose adoption we had no role and which was even used as a lever of pressure by certain quarters against the Islamic Republic of Iran. Official acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) by the highest authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran virtually removed the last Iraqi pretexts aimed at obstructing the implementation of the Security Council resolution  thus providing a litmus test for the political will and capability of the international community  and particularly the Security Council  in contributing to the realization of a just  comprehensive and honourable peace.As also confirmed by the high office of our honourable leader the Islamic Republic of Iran has on many occasions declared its solid intention of securing a lasting and honourable peace in the region and has in practice proven its sincere commitment in this respect by displaying flexibility good will and co-operation with the Secretary-General and his representatives. Members are certainly aware that during the interval spanning the acceptance of the resolution by the Islamic Republic of Iran and the official establishment of the cease-fire  the Iraqi regime  despite its past deceitful propaganda paying lip-service to peace  embarked upon a series of attacks against our industrial and economic centres  repeatedly committed acts of aggression deeply penetrating our territories and  in contravention of the letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and the Secretary-General's implementation plan  resorted to raising certain illogical and unacceptable pre-conditions which undoubtedly had a restraining impact on the Secretary-General's activities.During the 10 rounds of official discussions with the Secretary-General in New York during July and August 1988  the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran  explicitly delineating its position and proving its good will  showed a clear perspective for securing a comprehensive and lasting peace  while the other party opted for seeking excuses and negativism in its politics. The precondition for direct talks before the cease-fire so seriously raised by Iraq in the first round of talks was in fact nothing but a ploy to continue the war and prevent implementation of the very resolution which Iraq had verbally accepted a year before. During the two weeks of talks in New York  the Iraqi delegation even refused to hold any substantive meeting with the Secretary-General  who plays the primary role in the implementation of resolution 598 (1987). However  since these Iraqi excuses received widespread international criticism and owing to the International pressure created against Iraq  the latter was finally compelled to give up this precondition.The declaration of 20 August 1988 as the day for the cease-fire was in fact the result of the Iranian delegation's good will and the efforts exerted by the Secretary-General and his aides. As a result of Iraqi-instigated obstacles as well as the absence of a decisive approach by the international community  however  finalization of the timetable for implementing all the provisions of the resolution was postponed to take place in the course of talks in Geneva.Reaffirming its good will by accepting direct talks  the Islamic Republic of Iran  in a letter dated 7 August 1988 addressed to the Secretary-General  statedÂ·. ""It is our understanding that  in the agenda for direct talks  the procedure and items will be set in accordance with the provisions of your implementation plan. In this context  substantive negotiations between Iran and Iraq can only be entered into for the implementation of paragraph 4 of the resolution. The implementation of other paragraphs of the resolution will be carried out as planned by the Secretary-General."" (S/20094  p. 1)This position of the Islamic Republic of Iran fully corresponds with both section 1 in the Secretary-General's implementation plan dated 15 October 1987 and his public official positions taken in the course of discussions held in New York in July and August 1988. This position therefore constitutes the basis for any further endeavours in this regard. In his letter of 8 August 1988  addressed to the Foreign Ministers of Iran and Iraq  the Secretary-General stated that:""In pursuance of the official contact I had with Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  I should like to inform you that both Governments have agreed to direct talks between their Foreign Ministers which shall be held under my auspices  immediately after the establishment of the cease-fire  in order to reach a common understanding of the other provisions of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and the procedures and timings for their implementation.""It was on the basis of this understanding that we entered into direct talks at Geneva  expecting to agree on the time-table for the implementation of the other provisions of the resolution  beginning with the immediate withdrawal of force to the internationally recognized borders.It is not my intention to reveal here the details of the direct talks held at Geneva. It is  however  necessary to express the views of my Government as related to the general aspects of these talks. At Geneva the Iraqi delegation unfortunately resumed its old negative methods from the very first session of the talks  as in New York. By raising certain issues outside the agenda  such as preconditions for the implementation of the remaining provisions of the resolution  it diverted the talks from the course set for them by the Secretary-General  dragging them into irrelevant discussions with no substantive results bearing on the implementation of the resolution.For example  the fallacy involved in raising the argument of enjoying equally the fruits of cease-fire  geographical comparisons of Iran and Iraq and the consequences of the geographical differences between the two countries  was in fact a direct invitation to engage in lengthy economic  political  military and social comparisons  opening the Pandora Box of never-ending obvious inequalities between the two countries. Employing such false logic to achieve rights outside the norms of international law for Iraq in the Persian Gulf and Arvand Rood and extending the same logic to all paragraphs of the resolution has been a dangerous and destructive ploy  which if combined would inevitably direct the process of talks towards virtual futility and indefinite stalemate.In the first round of direct talks in Geneva  the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed its resolute conviction of the need to finalize the time and procedures for the implementation of the other provisions of the resolution  most significant among which are the immediate withdrawal of the forces to internationally recognized borders and the formation of an impartial body for the identification of the aggressor. It further emphasized that raising irrelevant issues would stall the process of the talks on secondary matters.However  the Islamic Republic of Iran  continuing its co-operation with the Secretary-General in his discharge of the most crucial role assigned to him by the resolution and attempting to improve the atmosphere of talks  continued its co-operation with the personal representative of the Secretary-General  Mr. Eliasson  and his colleagues so as to achieve an acceptable principled formula concerning shipping in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. In this context a very positive attitude was displayed  without any attempt to divert the talks from their true objective  and the Iranian delegation considered and evaluated the suggestions made by the Secretary-General and presented its own constructive comments without the least ambiguity.Regrettably  during the course of direct talks it was once again demonstrated that Iraq  rather than following the discussions within the established framework so as to reach an understanding  was attempting to seize the opportunity to use the talks as a means to achieve certain illegitimate political and military objectives  suffering from the illusion that whatever was not gained through the war of aggression and its use of inhuman and illegal resources would be secured through the peace talks. With such a goal in mind  the Iraqi delegation therefore spared no effort in obstructing the Secretary-General's activities and in manoeuvring to change the spirit of his proposals and the resolution.In other words  Iraq's efforts all along the course of the Geneva talks were aimed at distorting the spirit of the resolution and the implementation plan  changing the limit and scope of relevant rules of international law  securing International approval for its expansionist designs and using the cease-fire to weaken its very foundations. Iraq's Insistence on its preconditions and its lack of preparedness to accept the Secretary-General's proposals and to evaluate them constructively all contributed to the failure at the Geneva talks to achieve their objective  which was to finalize the timing and procedures for the implementation of all remaining provisions of the resolution from the withdrawal of forces to internationally recognized boundaries to paragraph 8 of the resolution. Most typical of Iraq's intransigence and obstructionism is its objection to the Secretary-General's proposal for continuation of talks in New York which had already won the approval of all members of the Security Council. It is  however  necessary to point out here that the procrastinate attitudes originating in undue political expediencies  as displayed by certain members of the Security Council  lent encouragement to Iraq in its show of Intransigence all through the talks. That  in effect  is needed for the success of the talks that ate currently under way under the auspices of the Secretary-General is the immediate implementation of the remaining paragraphs of the resolution  which is binding under Articles 39 and 40 of the United Nations Charter. In the same vein  the text of the resolution and the Secretary-General's implementation plan should constitute the basis of talks  and the Council members' understanding of the spirit of the resolution could also contribute to its implementation.Now that  despite Iraq's numerous violations  the cease-fire has been established  it is urgently necessary that the withdrawal of forces to internationally recognized boundaries be begun without further delay and completed within a short period  to be determined solely by technical considerations. A withdrawal of forces should have been effected immediately after the cease-fire  as stipulated in the resolution. It would constitute a significant step towards the decisive consolidation of the cease-fire.Furthermore  in spite of the provisions of the Secretary-General's implementation plan  repeatedly reaffirmed by the Security Council# the formation of an impartial body for the identification of the aggressor has also been delayed. This body should begin its work with no further delay so as to pave the way for the achievement of a just peace.We are fully prepared for the implementation of all the paragraphs in the resolution  within the framework of the Secretary-General's plan. While Iraq continues its obstructionist policies  we have even carried out unilaterally measures aimed at facilitating the implementation of other paragraphs of the resolution  as exemplified by the recent release of 72 Iraqi prisoners of war and 16 Egyptian prisoners  on the other hand  according to reports confirmed by the United Nations observer forces  Iraq  in violation of the cease-fire  has taken captive at least 700 Iranian military personnel and  more recently  it kidnapped two Iranian reporters in the presence of the representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. These cases well suffice as a demonstration of the two countries' real intentions regarding the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987).We stress once again that the achievement of a comprehensive  just and honourable peace will not be possible without scrupulous observance of international law and  in particular  the legal instrument which governs the frontiers between the two countries  namely the 1975 Treaty of State Frontier and Neighbourly Relations between Iran and Iraq. Furthermore  the political will and practical goodwill of the two parties to the conflict is imperative for the achievement of peace. As before  the Islamic Republic of Iran will demonstrate its will for the establishment of lasting peace in the region. It will  however  resist with all its ability and strength any effort aimed at the emasculation of its indisputable  legitimate rights. It will never permit the Iraqi Government to achieve its aggressive designs by resorting to destructive manoeuvres in the peace talks  and as it attempted to do through its acts of aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran and its violations of all the rules of international law during the imposed war. Iraq must have learned its lesson from the eight-year-long heroic resistance of the Iranian Muslims well enough to have second thoughts about repeating whimsical  illegitimate aspirations.It is also necessary to make a few remarks about paragraph 8 of the resolution  whose manner of implementation is to be drawn up by the Secretary-General in consultation with the two parties and other countries in the Persian Gulf region. Because of its strategic location and the possession of almost half the proved oil reserves in this part of the world  the Persian Gulf region is a critical and significant factor in international equations. Therefore developments in the region closely affect international peace and security.The common religious  cultural and economic grounds shared by the countries in the Persian Gulf area constitute a firm basis for their solidarity and their gathering together within a single regional system to guarantee and safeguard their common interests. Nevertheless  the arrogant global Powers  which have fixed their greedy eyes upon the riches in this region a- found a guarantee of their interests in the lack of unity and solidarity among these countries  continually sow the seeds of discord and hostility among them so as to preclude the fulfilment of their long cherished aspirations.We have on many occasions declared our readiness to establish firm  friendly relations with the countries of the region in order to provide long-term strategic security for the area. In this context  the Secretary-General's eight-point plan of 21 March 1985 received our positive response  and on 8 May 1986 we proposed a plan for regional security based on the joint co-operation of all parties in thePersian Gulf region for all-inclusive security.The Islamic Republic of Iran strongly believes that failure to gather within a coherent regional system  and the void created by the absence of such a system  would entail grave consequences for the regional States in terms of their sovereignty and inalienable rights.It is worth emphasizing in this connection that the presence of United States naval forces in the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman  which contravenes the purposes and principles set out in Articles 1 and 2 of the United Nations Charter  concerning respect for sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence and the sovereign equality of States - has seriously jeopardized the peace and security process in the region. The roost vicious consequence of the presence of foreign forces in the Persian Gulf was the criminal shooting down by the United States of the Iranian airliner flying along an internationally recognized air corridor on 3 July 1988  which cost the lives of 290 innocent people  including 100 women and children. That act was a blatant violation not only of the rule about refraining from aggression but also of the territorial integrity of a United Nations Member State.After the acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and the measures undertaken by the Secretary-General towards the attainment of a lasting peace in the region  there remains no further excuse for the continued presence of the United States Navy. Therefore it must leave this region as soon as possible so that peace and tranquillity may be restored to the Persian Gulf nations  with no further foreign intervention.The war waged by Iraq against the Islamic Republic of Iran  the longest conventional war in the twentieth century  has provided some significant and noteworthy experiences that can be used in the further development and codification of international rules on the conduct of war. In the course of this imposed war Iraq not only blatantly violated the norms and principles of the conduct of war on numerous occasions  including the use of chemical weapons and attacks against residential quarters  but also resorted to other measures totally alien to the spirit and objective of such rules of war. These fresh cases include threats to civilian airliners  attacks on commercial shipping in international waters and attacks on oil platforms. Such practices have in the past been condemned by the international community and international organizations.Such attacks  made possible by recent developments in military technology and methods of warfare  would not have been feasible in the past  since these inhumane measures were unheard of and were never raised when past conferences were convened for the codification of laws on the conduct of war. Therefore  no codes of conduct have been provided to deal with suds war crimes as have been committed by Iraq  although those crimes have been explicitly rejected by international forums.In view of its experiences during the imposed war  and in order to preclude any repetition of such crimes in the future  the Islamic Republic of Iran proposes that the United Nations  on behalf of the international community  enact at an appropriate time certain restrictive legal measures to curtail the future commission of such crimes and thus contribute to the codification of a new set of international rules on the conduct of war.Undeniably  the most significant incident deserving the utmost international attention  since it poses the most serious threat to the international community  is the extensive and unsparing deployment of chemical weapons by Iraq against both the Iranians and its own people  in contravention of all humanitarian rules of international law. The use of those evil  dreadful weapons  which sporadically began from 13 January 1931 against our military forces  gradually grew to such extensive and indiscriminate dimensions  mostly owing to the silence of international organizations  that they were not only used against Iranian civilians  but also claimed the lives of thousands of Kurdish women and children in Iraq. The United Nations has on five different occasions dispatched to the area expert missions  which have documented the extensive use of chemical weapons by Iraq.I should like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the everlasting memories of all the innocent victims of those horrific weapons  and to reiterate my proposal that 18 Mardi - the day when Iraqi chemical attacks against the city of Halabja claimed the lives of 5 000 innocent Iraqi civilians and left thousands of others critically injured - be designated the international day of the campaign against chemical weapons.While the Security Council dealt in two different resolutions  612 (1988) and 620 (1988)  with the Iraqi use of chemical weapons  the mild nature of those resolutions in fact encouraged Iraq to continue on a massive scale its horrifying use of chemical weapons.Iraq's audacity in the use of those weapons is such that even after the commencement of the cease-fire between the two countries Iraq used chemical weapons on a large scale against its own Kurds in the northern part of the country. Only the extreme nature of this incident led to the breaking of the long-standing silence observed by many  who now declared the extent of the tragedy of the use of chemical weapons and even demanded an investigation into the matter.In view of the massive international outrage against those horrific crimes by Iraq  as well as the related positions of different countries and international organizations condemning such inhuman acts against the innocent Iraqi Kurds  it is not sufficient now merely to issue statements and pass resolutions reprimanding the perpetrator it is absolutely essential that international organizations take serious preventive measures immediately to halt this trend of genocide and seriously punish the perpetrator.During the current year the international community has witnessed the old scar on the heart of the Middle East  which has created moral and material turbulence and difficulties  once again  as it has hundreds of times before  greatly disturb the very spirit of the Muslim and Arab communities by becoming further infected. The regime occupying Quds has for years been expelling Palestinian residents from the occupied territories  but when the Palestinian people intensified their struggle to free themselves from the oppression of the occupiers  the occupying regime  in an unprecedented manner  enacted the most oppressive and savage measures to curtail the Palestinians. Those measures continue to this day.The savagery of the occupying Zionist regime in repressing the people of the occupied territories  who fight with empty hands and resist the occupiers with no weapons  and the regime's confrontations with the Islamic combatants in southern Lebanon undoubtedly demonstrate its anxiety about the growth and further expansion of such deep-rooted resistance movements.Today the regime occupying Quds  supported by global imperialism and having continued its occupation of the Palestinian homeland and part of the other Islamic and Arab lands  resorts to new acts of savagery at whim. The repeated crimes perpetrated by the regime against southern Lebanon and the massacre of innocent civilians and Palestinian refugees once again prove the claim that the crisis in the Middle East will not be resolved unless this racist regime is eradicated and the rights of Palestinian to self-determination and the establishment of an independent government within their own territory are restored.Dangerous global and reactionary conspiracies consistently attempt to compromise the Palestinian objectives. Ito da y the Palestinian people face another such attempt to confront and undermine their heroic uprising against the regime occupying their territories.The Islamic Republic of Iran  on the basis of historical precedents and experience  is of the opinion that any flexibility and retreat vis-Ã -vis the occupying regime will simply carry within itself the seed for future acts of aggression by the regime. We therefore warn against conspiracies currently in the making  and  while supporting the heroic struggle of the Palestinian people  we ask other Islamic  progressive and non-aligned countries fully to support this epic uprising and thus discharge their responsibilities and duties relating to the sacred goals of this oppressed people.In another part of the Islamic world  Afghanistan  which bears the heavy burden of aggression and occupation  the struggles of its peoples once again prove that struggles against foreign aggression do not fade with time. More particularly  Islamic liberationist ideology lends greater intensity to the struggle against aggression in Afghanistan.The withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghan territories  which commenced in mid-Nay 1988  is an initial step in solving the problems in Afghanistan. The Islamic Republic of Iran  while welcoming the withdrawal of foreign forces from the Islamic territory of Afghanistan  reiterates its long-standing conviction that the right to choose its own destiny and its future government is an inalienable right of the people of that country. We further emphasize that no regime can survive there without the full support of the Afghan people and the Maslira Mujahidin. The only final solution of the problem of Afghanistan lies in non-intervention by foreign forces in the nation domestic affairs and allowing the indigenous population to manage affairs. The substitution of one foreign element by another presents no solution. The Islamic Republic of Iran hopes that  as socio-political conditions in Afghanistan improve  the way will be paved for the voluntary and honourable repatriation of the Afghan refugees who  driven from hearth and home  have for a number of years now been the respected guests of the Islamic Republic of Iran.It is with the utmost chagrin that I have to point once again to an unsolved problem that constitutes a protracted crime against humanity and an insult to its common conscience. The international community still suffers from the disgrace of racism and the ensuing discrimination. Since the Second World War  the most blatant institutionalized racism has been practised by the regime in Pretoria.This regime  in total disregard of the most basic principles of humanity and international law  continues to this day its racist policies and its Illegal occupation of Namibia  and in so doing enjoys the support of Western countries and the full co-operation of the Zionist regime.We have always insisted that support for the righteous struggle of the oppressed people of South Africa  and those of Namibia  led by the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  together with a serious effort by the international community to bring all-round pressure to bear upon the Pretoria regime and its supporters  constitutes the sole means of ridding the world of the very roots of this regime - this shameful product of human failures. In this context  we hope that the efforts of the Secretary-General  which have gained a new momentum recently  will succeed in paving the way for the independence of Namibia and the removal of this dark page of racial supremacy from the history of the contemporary world.With regard to Western Sahara  we have readied a stage at which  by supporting the efforts of the Secretary-General to resolve the question  we may be optimistic about a peaceful future for that region  based on respect for the legitimate rights and desires of the people.The positive developments in the international community  a number of which have been referred to  and the role of the United Nations and its Secretariat in the betterment of the international political atmosphere - which has been acknowledged by the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize for the Organization's activities in the maintenance of peace - have placed United Nations organs in a position to discharge its most crucial and historic duty. This is the duty to prepare the way for securing lasting  not piecemeal  peace and stability by ensuring observance of the principles and roles of international law and of the United Nations Charter  and respect for the rights and wishes of nations in areas where the achievement of such peace has always been sacrificed to the unwholesome expansionist rivalries of imperialist Powers.The Islamic Republic of Iran wishes the Secretary-General and his colleagues the utmost success in discharging their important duties in this critical domain.

"69",3337,"IRQ",43,1988,"ï»¿It gives me pleasure to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election as President of this session of the General Assembly. Our pleasure is all the greater in view of the good relations between our two countries. We are fully confident that he will meet with success in conducting the proceedings of the General Assembly at this session  which faces many vital issues of concern to the international community.I should also like to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation of the efforts of his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic  who so efficiently conducted the proceedings of the previous session with all of its important achievements.Since 1980  our delegation has kept the General Assembly informed of developments with regard to the expansionist war of aggression that the Iranian regime imposed on Iraq. Every time we spoke from this rostrum  we stressed our desire for peace  our readiness forÂ· peace and our resolute determination to achieve peace as strongly as we stressed our determination to continue the legitimate defence of our country's sovereignty  security  dignity and right to live a free and dignified life.Finally  after eight years of imposed war  with all that that has entailed in terms of costly sacrifice in human life and in ruin and destruction  we find ourselves today at the beginning of the road to peace. The international community is no doubt interested in the negotiations that started on 25 August 1988 with a view to achieving peace  it is closely following their progress and their prospects. To do so with any degree of accuracy  however  it is necessary to review the background of recent events. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) was adopted on 20 July 1987. Iraq officially welcomed the resolution just two days after its adoption. We stressed our willingness to implement it in good faith based upon our firm position of principle and desire for peace. The Iranian regime  on the other hand  did not accept the resolution. It followed a policy of manoeuvring  dilatory tactics and procrastination. It devised such means of expressing its position on the solution as had been unprecedented in the history of dealing with Security Council resolutions. The intention was to cover up its actual rejection of the resolution  to justify its insistence on continuing the war against Iraq and on maintaining its policies of aggression against the countries of the region. In spite of the adoption of a resolution which expressed the will of the international community to establish peace  the Iranian regime continued to launch one military attack after another against Iraq. It occupied more Iraqi territory as well as an Iraqi city. Official statements by Iranian leaders confirmed the designs to enshrine the occupation and the insistence on the continuation of war and aggression. The Iranian regime continued to use the term ""liberation"" to describe the occupation. Operations they had conducted  thus confirming their ambitious designs on Iraq. The Iranian regime continued its acts of aggression against the countries of the region by carrying out military attacks on Kuwait  by threatening Saudi Arabia and other countries of the region  and by continuing to threaten freedom of navigation and attack neutral shipping. Then came the turning-point. Our armed forces succeeded in liberating the Fao Peninsula from Iranian occupation in April of this year. This was followed shortly afterwards by the liberation of East Basrah  Shalamja  the Majnoon Islands  and the Zubeidat area. These valiant defensive military operations broke the back of Iranian aggression  and the Iranian regime's scheme against Iraq and the Arab Gulf States was frustrated. The illusions harboured by the Iranian regime to impose hegemony over the region vanished and its leaders reaped with their own hands the bitter harvest of their policies of aggression which were so opposed to the logic of history  to the values of the times and to the principles and rules governing international relations. It was in these circumstances of crushing military defeat that the leaders of Iran announced their acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) on 18 July 1988.In spite of this fact  we dealt with the situation on the basis of our position of principle inspired by a desire for peace  and our actions were prompted by realistic considerations as well as  by considerations of principle. With a view to taking the best course of action to achieve peace  I proposed in my letter of 20 July 1988 to the Secretary-General that direct official talks should be held between authorized representative5>of the two sides under the auspices of the Secretary-General in order to discuss and implement Security Council resolution 598 (1987).This proposal was inspired by good faith and the pragmatic desire to ascertain directly the Iranian understanding of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) once the Iranian regime put forward contradictory interpretations of the resolution which were alien to the letter and spirit of it as well as to the concepts of international law and the rules governing relations between States in modern times.It was Iraq's legitimate right to ascertain directly the true position of Iran. Any impartial observer who has followed the positions taken by the Iranian regime over the 10 years of its existence will have realized that the aims and slogans of the rulers of Iran have their basis in expansionism  aggression and ambitious designs  and will confirm that they do not believe in international law and the rules governing relations between States in our time. That is why the Iranian regime has rejected all resolutions and initiatives with regard to peace  from the very first resolution adopted by the Security Council on 28 July 1980 and for a whole year after the adoption of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  It has even rejected the principle of the peaceful settlement of the conflict and of the jurisdiction of the United Nations and other international organizations in the matter . It was necessary  therefore  to ascertain the true intentions of the Iranian leaders in accepting Security Council resolution 598 (1987) Å£. for in accepting the resolution  Iranian leaders nay not have in mind belief in achieving a comprehensive and durable peace based on mutual respect for sovereignty  non-intervention in internal affairs and observance of the rules of international law in relations with Iraq and with the countries of the region. Serious suspicions with regard to the Iranian position are aroused by statements made by Iranian leaders to explain their decision to accept Security Council resolution 598 (1987).The speeches and statements of the Iranian leaders have been full of references to compelling circumstances and to a predicament; the nature and causes of which they cannot disclose. They have talked with sorrow and disappointment about being forced to accept Security Council resolution 598 (1987). On the other hand  the Iraqi people and other peoples of the region have expressed their joy at the cease-fire because of their belief in peace as a way of life. All these facts  taken together  led Iraq to call for direct negotiations with a view to discussing face to face the steps towards peace and the concept of peace. This position is not intended as a condition  since direct negotiations do not constitute a unilateral advantage for Iraq at the expense of Iran.In any case  in response to the desire of the international community for a speedy end to hostilities  President Saddam Hussein of Iraq announced on 6 August 1988 that Iraq was prepared to accept a cease-fire if Iran officially announced  with unambiguous clarity  its agreement to enter into direct negotiations immediately after the cease-fire so that we might discuss  reach agreement on  and implement Security Council resolution 598 (1987).Following this historic announcement  which expresses the true character of Iraq's position and its sincere wish for peace  intensive contacts were made with the Secretary-General. On 8 August 1988  agreement was readied on the announcing of a date for the cease-fire. Agreement was also reached on the date  the bases and the objectives of the direct negotiations to be held between the two parties under the auspices of the Secretary-General  to that date  the Secretary-General addressed to the permanent representatives of the two countries a letter which I shall quote in full because of its importance for the events which ensued: ""Excellency  ""In pursuance of the official contact I had with Iraq and the Islamic Republic of Iran  I should like to inform you that both Governments have agreed that direct talks between their Foreign Ministers shall be held under ray auspices  immediately after the establishment of the cease-fire  in order to reach a common understanding of the other provisions of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and the procedures and timings for their implementation.""This outline of the sequence of events will make it clear that the two parties readied agreement  through the Secretary-General of the United Nations  on setting a date for the cease-fire before there was full agreement on all provisions pertaining thereto. The cease-fire did actually take effect on 20 August in the form of the cessation of the shooting  and United Nations observers took up their positions before the detailed provisions and legal obligations relating to the cease-fire had been determined through the agreement of the two parties with the United Nations  It was only natural that the question should be taken up in the Geneva negotiations with a view to consolidating the cease-fire through a clear  definite understanding between the two parties under the auspices of the United Nations and then afterwards they would turn to discussing the other provisions of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) Against this factual background  we began the direct negotiations in Geneva. In those negotiations Iraq demanded that the provisions and obligations of the cease-fire measures should be made clear and unambiguous so as to prevent different interpretations of them in the course of their future implementation and to ensure that the cease-fire would be a permanent state and constitute a sure step towards comprehensive and lasting peace. Â·Iraq also demanded that these provisions and obligations  when implemented on land  in the air and at sea  should ensure equal benefits for the two parties since that would provide a guarantee for the enforcement of the cease-fire.On this just and sincere basis  Iraq called for the inclusion of a clear provision on the principle of unobstructed freedom of navigation in international waters in the Arab Gulf and in the Straits of Hormuz for all shipping. This position of ours is based on the text of the Security Council resolution  which demands that a cease-fire be observed and that all military action on land  at sea and in the air be discontinued as a first step towards a negotiated settlement. We also base our position on the rule of balance of benefits. It is inconceivable that the provisions and obligations relating to the two sides should be detailed on land and in the air in such a manner as to ensure a balance of benefits for both parties  while at sea they should be impaired by a defect which tends to realize an advantage for Iran at the expense of Iraq because of Iran's geographic situation in the Arab Gulf and the Hormuz Straits.Iraq also proposed that the United Nations be entrusted with clearing the Shatt-al-Arab and ensuring safe navigation therein  without prejudice to the legal status of the river.The Shatt-al-Arab is Iraq's only outlet to the high seas. On account of the quantity of obstructions to navigation which have accumulated therein over the war years  the clearing operations will take a long time and will require the services of international experts and the availability of international funds. Since negotiations aimed at the achievement of a comprehensive and lasting peace and the solution of all outstanding issues between the two parties may take a not inconsiderable time  it stands to reason that advantage should be taken of that time to render the Shatt-al-Arab navigable.These are the only two demands that Iraq made in the negotiations which took place in Geneva between 25 August and 13 September 1988. The Iranian conduct in the Geneva negotiations  however  has been characterized by evasiveness and has not conformed to what is right and just.With regard to freedom of navigation in international waters in the Arab Gulf and the Hormuz Straits  the Iranian delegation alleged a right to control free navigation there through its claim to a right of search on the basis of interpretations which do not conform in any way to the collective security system as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations  and which disagree with both the letter and the spirit of resolution 598 (1987) and its objective of a comprehensive and lasting peace. It is clear that the interpretation maintained by the Iranian side is conceived in terms of a truce rather than in terms of the cease-fire being only a first step towards settlement  as provided by paragraph 1 of the resolution. This has increased our suspicions with regard to the intentions of the Iranian regime and its true aims in accepting resolution 598 (1987).This suspicious position on the part of the Iranian delegation was followed by its insistence on provisions which impose a de facto arms embargo on Iraq at sea. Then Iran started to spread lies to the effect that Iraq was asking for free navigation in Iranian territorial waters  whereas the Iraqi demand was quite clear in calling for free navigation in international waters and through the Hormuz Straits. Furthermore  the Iranian delegation rejected the proposal that the United Nations undertake clearing operations in the Shatt-al-Arab at this stage and began to impose conditions inspired by a desire to blackmail and manoeuvre.Iraq's demand that provision for free navigation and clearing operations in the Shatt-al-Arab be included in the cease-fire arrangements is nothing new. Iraq has taken this position and confirmed it repeatedly since our acceptance of resolution 598 (1987). We included that demand in our letter of acceptance of the resolution on 22 July 1987  and we confirmed the demand in the letter sent by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq on 6 August 1988  which paved the way for agreement on a cease-fire. We also confirmed it in two letters addressed to the Secretary-General  one on 20 July 1988  following Iran's acceptance of the resolution  and the other on 11 August 1988  after the date for the cease-fire had been set  prior to the Geneva negotiations. Iran's allegation that Iraq has imposed pre-conditions in the Geneva negotiations is a pure lie and deception. What we have demanded is documented in official letters  which have been circulated as part of the records of the Security Council. What we have demanded is just  legitimate and in conformity with the letter and the spirit of resolution 598 (1987) and its objective  namely  a comprehensive  lasting and just peace.The international community and this Organization are called upon to make a true and fair evaluation of the respective positions taken in respect of the Geneva negotiations. Who is presenting legitimate and logical demands and propositions which are in conformity with the objective of peace  and who is engaging in evasiveness and in attempts to manipulate texts  and wants the situation to remain undecided?Iraq's wish to reach a peaceful  comprehensive  just and durable settlement of the conflict with Iran is nothing new. This was our position when the war was imposed on us on 4 September 1980 and during the events which preceded and followed that date. Iraq continued to hold firmly to this position throughout the eight years of the conflict. Iraq dealt with the international Organization seriously and sincerely and accepted its resolutions in all circumstances  regardless of the developments of the military situation  beginning with resolution 479 (1980)  of 28 July 1980  through the latest resolution of the Security Council  namely  resolution 598 (1987) which Iraq accepted immediately after it was adopted.We confirm our desire and determination to implement resolution 598 (1987) in good faith  to move forward on the road to a comprehensive and lasting peace and to abide by the principles which govern peaceful and good-neighbourly relations between the countries of the world  particularly contiguous countries  in our time. While intent on the peace process and the achievement of the objectives sought by the international community in adopting resolution 598 (1987)  we must take into account a number of substantive questions if the peace is to be durable  comprehensive and just and if the region as a whole is to return to a state of peace and stability and continue to play its positive role in the international community.The primary point  which we must always keep in mind  is that the Iranian regime did not accept resolution 598 (1987) willingly and voluntarily as a result of a deep  firm understanding of the necessity for a state of peace with Iraq and the countries of the region. It accepted the resolution only because of a crushing military defeat and in the context of a struggle for power inside Iran. While it is necessary to emphasize the opportunity provided by the cease-fire  all steps towards the implementation of resolution 598 (1987) should be well studied and well balanced so as to form the basis for the attainment of the objective of comprehensive and lasting peace. Any action that might undermine any of these elements would only encourage those who have made war their paramount cause and taken it upon themselves as their sole task to avoid abiding by the requirements of peace.On the basis of this conception of the true meaning of peace  resolution 598 (1937) should not be regarded as merely a string of timings and procedures. Timings and procedures are necessary for the implementation of the resolution: there is no disagreement on that point. But what is more important is to reach common agreement on the meaning of the resolution  which may facilitate the achievement of lasting peace between the two sides  rather than to make of the resolution and the way it is to be implemented a political  as opposed to a Military  battleground. In the light of these facts  the best way to achieve understanding is to allow the two sides the opportunity to engage in direct negotiations  however prolonged such negotiations might be.The role of the Security Council and the Secretariat is necessary and vital  and should be a part of the peace process from beginning to end. That role  however  must never be played at the expense of understanding between the two parties  because it is the two parties which will assume the responsibility of regulating their relations now and in the future.Any pressures  whether created by political means or through the information media  that might disturb the atmosphere in which the negotiations are being conducted would not serve the cause of peace and could only be an expression of either misguided efforts or premeditated designs. We must refer here to the campaign launched against Iraq and timed to coincide with the beginning of the negotiations at Geneva. Zionist circles  which have allied themselves with the Iranian regime throughout the war years and have used all means to ensure continuation of the war  which is considered a gain for Israel - those are the circles that are at the root of the false allegations spread against Iraq. We hope that those peace-loving States that have nothing to do with the motives and aims of those designs will not allow themselves to be lured into the snares of those who have planned that malicious campaign. The aim of such campaigns is to encourage the Iranian regime to refrain from fully abiding by the requirements of peace and peaceful coexistence with Iraq and the countries of the region  as well as to encourage it to reject what is right and rational.Those who have planned the campaigns have imagined that they could impose on Iraq an atmosphere of pressure and isolation that would force it to abandon its firm stand on its just and legitimate demands and to accept feeble solutions under pressure. They are only deluding themselves. Iraq is an independent State and enjoys complete independence in all fields  political  economic  social or military. Iraq cannot accept pressure from any quarter  especially now that its people have defended its cultural heritage  its humanitarian aspirations and its gains in a war that was imposed upon it  a war that has lasted for eight years  doing so through reliance on its own resources and its belief in the justice of its cause - peace.Among the roost important foundations for the building of a just and comprehensive peace are the basing of relations between the countries of the region on equality and mutual respect and abandonment of ambitious designs and illegitimate privileges acquired through the use or threat of force  as well as abandonment of positions  tendencies and policies predicated on expansionism  on the implementation of hegemony  on aggression against others and interference in their affairs. Without those foundations there can be no real peace. Peace will remain a transient  nominal state in which matters stay quiet for a while only to explode into conflicts again.We must state frankly that in the past a number of countries have tried to influence the course of the negotiations  not out of concern for peace  but because of their commercial and strategic interests and aims. They have sent direct and indirect signals to the Iranian regime towards taking certain stands with regard to the negotiations with a view to gaining commercial or strategic benefits in Iran. We knew the secrets of that game and we know who is playing it. We warn them that their game will not serve the cause of peace. We hope that States members of the Security Council and other States interested in peace and stability in the region will make sure that those playing that game will not be allowed to achieve their selfish aims.The eyes of the world are turned towards the international community and the international Organization to see what they will do with regard to the Palestinian question. The just cause it involves has long awaited a solution that will secure the legitimate rights of the struggling Palestinian people. The world is today witnessing a horrible escalation of Zionist aggression against that people in which they are deprived of their rights  their land is occupied and brutal repression is exercised against them.The Palestinian ""intifada has crowned the 40-year struggle of the Palestinian people to attain their inalienable right to self-determination. That uprising constitutes a living  heroic example of the struggle of peoples for freedom and independence. It presents the United Nations with a unique opportunity to take the initiative and prove that it really upholds the principles upon which it was founded and is now ready to assume its responsibilities with a view to putting those principles into force. The United Nations is called upon  at this decisive stage in the history of the Palestinian question  to support the Palestine Liberation Organization  the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  as well as the decisions of the Arab summit meetings on the Palestinian question  especially those adopted at the Fez and Algiers summit meetings  which were based on international decisions.	'	.We urge - nay  we demand - that the United Nations deal responsibly and seriously with the proposal of the Palestine Liberation Organization  included among the decisions of the Arab summit meeting at Fez  that the United Nations assume the administration of the occupied Palestinian territories for a specified period after the complete withdrawal of Israel therefrom and pending the achievement of self-determination by the Palestinian people in their own homeland. I should like to emphasize here that Iraq  with all its resources  is determined to stand beside the Palestine Liberation Organization and the brother Palestinian people to enable them to achieve their legitimate national aim of establishing their own independent State with Jerusalem as its capital.The developments in the situation in Lebanon are causing us great concern. That little Arab country has suffered greatly from Israeli occupation and foreign intervention in its internal affairs. Occupation and intervention have so far prevented- the achievement of the wish of the majority of the Lebanese people to reach agreement on the desired national consensus. The latest result of that situation is the illegitimate and unacceptable outside interference in the presidential elections that has led to the suspension of the election of the President  thus creating an anomalous situation. The Arab countries  in the first place  and the international community  in the second  are called upon to take concrete and urgent stepÂ· to enable the Lebanese people to elect a President without outside interference. Such steps are essential to prevent further deterioration in the situation  to move towards national consensus and to restore security and peace to that sister country. The peoples of the world are contemplating with optimism the atmosphere of dÃ©tente which has started to prevail in relations between the two great Powers since the summit meetings held between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States of America and the agreements readied on limiting the arms race. Iraq has welcomed those encouraging developments. It has also welcomed the indications of improved prospects for the settlement of a number of regional conflicts that have been going on for years  including the situation in Namibia and Angola  the question of Kampuchea and the situation in Afghanistan. Iraq highly appreciates the role of the United Nations and its Secretary-General in resolving those conflicts.Iraq  which has been a victim of aggression  sincerely believes in peace. It believes it is a necessity that the principles of peaceful coexistence  good-neighbourly relations and the negotiated settlement of disputes prevail in our affairs. It believes in strengthening the United Nations system and the sovereignty of the principles of the Charter and international law."
"70",3384,"ISL",43,1988,"ï»¿Mr. President  I should like to begin by congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. The Government of Iceland wishes you every success in carrying out the duties of your important and prestigious office.The signing of the United Nations Charter was viewed by many as the first great victory of peace in the modern world. A system of international security was foreseen whereby peace would be ensured through collective action  and regional enforcement would be rendered largely superfluous. Sadly  the dream has never been realized. Instead  the onset of the cold war stimulated the growth of military alliances and a system of security through the mutual terror of nuclear armaments.I will not say whether the Charter itself was basically at fault in being overly optimistic. That may be so  but I am certain  nevertheless  that the quest for ""one world""  enshrined in the Charter  has never been wholly abandoned. Moreover  one should not underestimate the significant strides mankind has recently made towards removing some of the hurdles that have stood in the way of strict observance of the United Nations Charter.History  of course  will be the final judge. Host of us believe that we now stand at a crossroads in East-West relations. I certainly do not wish to underestimate the role of Western unity and steadfastness in bringing us to the present juncture. There is no denying  however  that credit is due to the East as well  where refreshing winds of change have resulted in a more dynamic and forthcoming approach to foreign policy. Improvements have been particularly notable in arras control and on regional issues. In arms control  we have for the first time started moving beyond mere limitations on nuclear armaments to meaningful reductions. The Treaty for the elimination of intermediate-range nuclear weapons  welcomed by my country as a milestone achievement  has inspired confidence across the whole range of arms control issues and given fresh impetus to talks aimed at cutting strategic nuclear arsenals as well as chemical and conventional weapons. No less significant is the movement we have witnessed towards the peaceful resolution of regional conflicts  many of which have been a thorn in the side of the international body politic for a good many years.Taken as a whole  these developments have created hopes that the United Nations - no longer hobbled by cold war rivalry - might begin to achieve the results hoped for at the time of its founding.There can be no denying that the progress we have made is due in large measure to the improved atmosphere in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. It would be a mistake  however  to view the United Nations simply as an accessory to super-Power diplomacy. For one thing  to do so is to overlook the tremendous work done by the United Nations specialized agencies towards alleviating the causes of human conflict. By seeking to eliminate such causes  be they poverty  disease  ignorance or discrimination  the United Nations has not only rendered valuable service to peace in different areas of the world  but has also prevented regional conflicts from spilling over into cold war battlegrounds.Moreover  one is entitled to ask where we would stand had it not been for the crucial mediating role of the United Nations in many regional conflicts. This in many ways  has been the United Nations finest hour  as has been duly recorded by the well-deserved award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Organisation's peace-keeping forces this year. In a relatively short time the Organization has negotiated the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. Thanks to the United Nations  an end to the war in Western Sahara may now be in sight and progress has been made towards a settlement in Cyprus. If all goes well. United Nations efforts in Angola and Namibia - whose rightful claim to independence can no longer be ignored - may bear fruit in the not-too-distant future.For a nation like Iceland  which has no armed forces of its own  glad tidings like these are particularly welcome. But let us not forget that safeguarding the progress made will require continued dedication and good will on the part of all. Much will certainly depend on the work taking place at the Vienna follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  not least in the humanitarian dimension. By honouring their commitment to fundamental human rights  including the right of men and women to participate fully in all spheres of social and economic life  Governments not only raise the level of well-being among their subjects  but also render service to people. In the current end-game in Vienna  Iceland will work for a substantive outcome  based on a balanced approach to the whole range of Issues covered in the Helsinki Final Act.I find it a curious paradox that at a time of heightened expectations the United Nations should find itself in the throes of a major financial crisis. Iceland applauds plans by the Soviet Union and lately by the United States to pay up arrears  and appeals to other members which have not already done so  to do the same. This is particularly urgent  as it appears that increased United Nations peace-keeping activities will make greater demands on its resources. Emphasis must also continue to be placed on the process of reform and renewal within the Organization itself.As we look ahead there are numerous major challenges that confront us.Recent progress in bilateral arms control notwithstanding  the cost of the arms race is increasing and so are the precision and destructive power of nuclear weapons. Clearly  therefore  nuclear arms control must remain a top priority. As we pursue major reductions in strategic nuclear weaponry  care must be taken that any possible shift of military confrontation to new categories of weapons or regions be firmly resisted. In the view of the Icelandic Government  it is of the utmost importance that a treaty to cut land-based long-range missiles should lead to less military activity at sea. For this reason  Icelanders have welcomed the super-Powers' agreement in principle at the Washington summit meeting to search for ways of limiting long-range  nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles.As is well known  my country does not allow nuclear weapons on its territory and presumes that visiting naval vessels will respect its sovereignty in this regard. One need hardly belabour the point that accidents involving nuclear arms at sea could have disastrous consequences for a nation like Iceland which bases its livelihood on the living resources of the sea.As we move towards significant reductions in nuclear arsenals  the need to correct the current imbalance in the field of conventional forces and equipment in Europe has acquired new urgency. Having participated  along with its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  in negotiations with the Warsaw Pact on a mandate for new conventional stability talks  Iceland hopes for the early adoption of a mandate to ensure that these important talks can get under way this year as envisaged.This year's third special session on disarmament may have been disappointment in that it failed to reach a consensus on a final document. My country was nevertheless encouraged that a number of positive steps were taken. I draw attention in particular to the concrete discussions on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Nordic memorandum on that question  as well as to the discussions on verification issues and chemical weapons. The early conclusion of a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons must remain among our foremost objectives. Iceland is encouraged that negotiations on this issue within the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva have readied a final stage. I also welcome the opportunity here to declare ray country's full support for the proposal of President Reagan in this forum two weeks ago to convene an international conference to bolster the Geneva Protocol of 1925 outlawing the use of chemical weapons.As we chart the course of the multilateral disarmament agenda for the decade ahead  we must build on the paper which nearly became the final document of the third special session and on the commitments we all undertook in the Final Document of the first special session in 1978.I spoke earlier of the progress we have made on regional issues. Regrettably  there have also been exceptions. The thaw in relations between East and West he I failed to advance noticeably the peace process in the Middle East. Any peaceful solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict will depend on mutual restraint and a spirit of compromise. At a minimum  while Israel must recognize the right of the Palestinian people to determine their own future  the Arab world must cease to question the undisputed right of the State of Israel too exist. The tragic events in the occupied Israeli territories over the last year have rightly caused concern among the world community and reawakened interest in an international conference  under United Nations auspices  to discuss a comprehensive peace settlement. Turning to Central America  recent peace efforts have also fallen short of expectations. Iceland  like the rest of the Nordic countries  is firmly of the view that the countries in a given region should themselves be in charge of the building of peace and democracy there.As to the situation in South-East Asia  I should like only to reiterate the continuing relevance of last year's General Assembly resolution on Kampuchea  of which ray country was a co-sponsor  and which will be resubmitted in a slightly amended form this year.If I have dwelt too long on the political and military issues  it is only because I fear that armed conflicts may yet turn our budding optimism into pessimism and despair. At the same time  any listing of the tasks that lie ahead would remain quite incomplete if it failed to mention the challenges facing us in the related areas of environment and development.As was rightly observed in last year's report of the Brundtland Commission  we face a vast and expanding dimension of responsibility in the sphere of ecology. Problems that are transnational in character  be they pollution  the ""greenhouse"" effect or the deterioration of the ozone layer  must be tackled with a global strategy  if they are not seriously to impair the quality of life on this planet.Neglect of the environment is in turn directly related to the gloomy economic situation of many of the developing countries. In Africa  deforestation and desertification are worsening the plight of a number of States in which per capita income levels are even lower today than they were at the beginning of the decade. An enhanced development effort is urgently called for to alleviate poverty and hunger in this hemisphere. But the problem of development  as everyone knows  is not confined to the decaying environment. I want to mention in particular the crushing debt burden of the developing world  which not only stifles necessary economic growth but also places a dangerous strain on the feeble democratic foundations of a number of States. While no one should minimize the manifold and complex aspects of this problem  it is economically unsound and morally indefensible that the industrialized nations should siphon off from the developing world billions of dollars in debt repayments and interests. According to estimates of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  such net transfers from poor countries to rich currently amount to between $US 30 billion and SUS 40 billion per year.To remedy this state of affairs in the long term  increased assistance and debt relief will only be sufficient provided they are linked to a comprehensive plan for structural change in North-South relations. Let us also be mindful that no economic system can be expected to be fully satisfactory or truly effective if it lades the genuine and full participation of all people  men and women alike. In this connection  let me subscribe to the view expressed by Iceland's Minister of Social Affairs at the Nordic Council's Equal Bights Conference in Oslo last August  calling for the establishment of a special United Nations equal rights organization.The link between human rights and development is often close. Iceland feels strongly that the world community must keep up its pressure on the racist regime in Pretoria  whose policies of apartheid and destabilization are among the root causes of the human tragedy taking place in southern Africa.In a year when we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  we should reaffirm our obligation to doing away with human rights abuses  wherever they take place and regardless of colour or political creed. I referred at the outset to the Charter's sanguine vision of universal peace Sid security. The realization of that vision may still be far off in the future. Yet  with peace and freedom on the march around the globe as they have rarely been before over the last 40 years  confidence is reviving in the efficiency of this world Organization.But while some of the critics of the United Nations may have been disarmed  there is need to warn against unrealistic expectations. For one thing  merely to safeguard what has been accomplished will require redoubled effort. In this sense  it would be true to say that we must run simply to stay in place.In conclusion  may I express the hope that this year's Assembly will result in the strengthening of our commitments to the purposes of the Charter. In this endeavour  I can pledge the full and loyal support of my country."
"71",3431,"ISR",43,1988,"ï»¿Mr. President  I should like at the outset to congratulate you on your election to the esteemed post of President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I feel sure that the possibility of restoring to the United Nations the spirit of conciliation and peace for which it was founded will depend  in no small measure  on your wise and experienced guidance.In a discussion of the Middle East  history should precede diplomacy. The region has known epochs of war and golden ages  military conquests and spiritual greatness. It was in the Middle East that an invisible divide saw frustration and promise prevail in an unpredictable  seemingly uncontrollable  cycle. Yet it was man who triggered waves of hope and despair. Thus it was man who determined the course of history.Today  once again  the region faces a moment of human choice.We are preparing for a better tomorrow. We are prepared with a vision of peace. It is the vision of an end to a futile  economically devastating arras race now sliding in the inhumane direction of chemical and biological warfare. Ballistic missiles know no boundaries  chemical warheads do not distinguish young from old. Those senseless enough to employ them must recognize that they are creating a danger to themselves as well.It is a vision of an opportunity to concentrate on scientific and technological breakthroughs on Earth and in space  on civilian requirements rather than military needs where resources wasted on armaments are invested in creative enterprises from the greening of the land to the clearing of the waters  from educating young children to caring for the senior citizen.It is a vision of a region whose stability is inviting  whose dwelling is hospitable  whose creativity is encouraging  whose needs are seriously addressed by those seeking to invest in promoting stability and in expanding economic potential.It is a vision of a region come of age  a region cognizant of global rapprochement  a region ready to tackle the heretofore seemingly insoluble in order to offer a better future for all - Jews and Arabs alike - a region ready to respect differences among peoples without discriminating against any.It is a vision that is a necessity. It is a vision that is within reach.Yet the smoke of old fires is still in the air and new ones threaten to darken the horizon. Unless we take decisive action to change course belligerency will not be overcome. We have to do our utmost to ensure that never again will a young man or woman die in a war we failed to prevent.What should be done to achieve this goal?I shall start with Israel.Three years ago Israel stood before this Assembly and pledged to dedicate its efforts to the pursuit of peace. That pledge rested not only on resolve  but also on a conviction: that in the north  war can be brought to an end; in the south  peace can be salvaged and nourished and  in the east  the ground can be laid to start meaningful negotiations.In all three directions we laboured to fulfil the commitment.In the north  we put an end to our involvement in Lebanon. We are out of Lebanon  its land and politics. Our sole concern is to see that Lebanon no longer serves as the base for hostile activities against us.In the south  we have revived our relations with Egypt  which has since restored full diplomatic representation in Israel. We have witnessed Egypt  under the steady leadership of President Mubarak - dedicated to progress at home and peace in the region - reassume its central role in the Arab world without parting with its peace strategy.In the east  we have experienced hope and frustration. Until less than a year ago  before things went awry  the West Bank turned from the centre of violent debate to the focus of diplomatic efforts. Most significantly  in April 1987  energetic and creative diplomacy produced a framework for negotiations. Known as ""the London Document""  it provided a non-imposing internationally supported setting for direct negotiations. Unfortunately  while still viable  the effort has not yet reached fruition. Sadly  the absence of progress was accompanied by an outbreak of violence. Wrongly  the Palestinians chose to knock on the door of the future with stones in their hands. Knocking with a message of peace would have triggered an entirely different situation.Indeed  the Palestinians must recognize that it is possible to secure their legitimate rights - but not at the expense of Israel's security. Palestinian aspirations and Israeli security are not necessarily incompatible. Peace is an Israeli national interest. While we have confidence in the capacity of the Israeli Defence Forces to defend our country  by deterring any aggression and defeating it if need be  we consider the achievement of peace through diplomacy the greatest victory of all. My country has never surrendered to the pressures of war and will never yield to violence. In peace negotiations we shall stand firm on our security interests. Yet we stand ready for a historic compromise with our neighbours. For 40 years we have built our strength so as not to negotiate out of weakness. Today we are strong enough to negotiate for peace.Israel has no intention of harming the Palestinian people. Israel has no desire to dominate their lives or to hurt their pride. We are prepared to negotiate with them  fairly  freely  as equals  a meeting-ground of needs  where Palestinians can enjoy their identity and Israelis security in peace.We are prepared to conduct negotiations on the basis of the only framework  reaffirmed this week in the trilateral meeting chaired by President Reagan  with the participation of the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs  and accepted by Arab countries as well as by all permanent members of the Security Council - that is. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  calling for a territorial compromise and secure borders. They are the only existing common ground.As we stand ready to live up to these commitments  we shall be as clear in addressing our expectations of our neighbours. For there can be peace  but not unilaterally; there can be accommodation  but only by mutual effort. We expect from the Arab world a clear voice for peace. For how long can a desire for peace be treated as a secret password as though we were living in clandestine surroundings? Commitment to peace must emerge loud and clear  for sceptics to witness  for the hopeful to respond. We expect the Arab world to realize that there is no indirect peace. Peace is meant to reinforce  not to undermine  freedom and security for all involved.We expect the Arab world  including the Palestinians  to do away with the contradiction of sweet promises and bitter violence. A policy of ""no war  no peace""  much like a policy that claims to combine both  is an exercise in evasion. A choice must be made: to pay the price of peace or to be resigned to the costs of war.All of us must recognize changing realities. That which was rejected when offered  that which was doomed by war  that which could have been possible  belongs to the past. In the realities of 1988 the lines of 1947 no longer exist. After the Six-Day War Israel should not be expected to return to the lines from which it attacked. Readiness for a territorial compromise does not include readiness to compromise security.A breakthrough requires the understanding that peace is a matter of choice; it is the outcome of decisions; it is the product of a historic compromise. No vague formulation can replace a clear strategy to part with the past. The turn to a so-called Government-in-exile  the return to General Assembly partition resolution 181 (II)  represents yet another escape to the realm of self-illusion. Any attempt to add to or subtract from the only commonly accepted basis for negotiations is bound to destroy the existing framework without creating a new one. Fuelled by a commitment to no war and no violence  no terrorism and no pressure  we can travel the distance towards accommodation.To the Palestinians I must say with candour that violence does not pay off. By avoiding negotiations they are depriving themselves of their hope. For there is hardly a chance for a compromise to emerge in the absence of  or prior to  a free negotiating process. Although we cannot agree in advance on the outcome of negotiations  we can agree on the process by which to go forward - negotiations as an open-ended effort  free of pressure  imposition or threat. In those negotiations  Jordanians and Palestinians  much like ourselves  may present expectations and demands as they labour to balance contradictory aspirations so as to answer the call of peace. We are ready to enter into negotiations with Jordan and with authentic representatives of the Palestinian people who ate men of peace and not men of violence  in order to solve our differences with Jordan and to resolve the Palestinian problem in all its aspects. We are ready to negotiate with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. Yet  as peace is unlikely to be achieved in one leap  we are prepared to start negotiations without prior conditions with a Jordanian delegation or a Palestinian one. We hope that the Palestinians will not postpone the prospects of peace; and we hope that Jordan  regardless of its relations with them  will not postpone negotiations either.I wish to express the gratitude of my people to the United States  its leaders and its institutions for their firm and consistent support. The United States has enabled us to guarantee our security. It has encouraged us  as it has our neighbours  to enter into political negotiations.The Shultz initiative calling upon the parties to enter into direct negotiations and negotiate a just and fair solution calls also on the permanent members of the Security Council to avoid imposing solutions  refrain from applying pressure and serve as supporters of peace. This initiative  which provides for direct negotiations launched in a non-coercive international setting - remains available for consideration.When we had an opportunity to review the prospects for peace earlier this week we were reassured by the unanimity among the host. President Reagan  and his guests from Egypt and Israel that there is no substitute for an ongoing  uninterrupted effort towards peace  and that all those attending are resolved to fill the next few months with relevant content.I wish to express my hope that the policies adopted by the Soviet Onion under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev will lead to a world of more ploughshares and fewer swords. Moscow has undertaken some steps  which  though partial and limited  are yet of importance. Zionist prisoners have been released. The number of Jewish emigration permits has grown. Consular groups have been stationed in the Soviet Union and Israel respectively. We have taken note of statements from Moscow calling on all sides in the Middle East to adopt realistic positions with the objective of demilitarizing international relations. I wish to express the hope of my people that the cultural autonomy announced by the Soviet leadership will enable our Jewish brethren to pray to our Lord in their own synagogues  to teach their children the history of the Jewish people  to express themselves in the language of their forefathers  and to set sail to the shores of the promised land.As we watch with wonder and respect the People's Republic of China rearrange its own destiny  we hope it will find this the occasion to support a non-coercive setting for Arab-Israeli negotiations  as well as to normalize its relations with the State of Israel.There is nothing in our region's history or in its present that rules out a different future. In an era of peace and co-operation  the industrial dynamics of the Far Fast  the Economic Community of Europe  the free enterprise and the enterprise of freedom of the United States  and the Soviet capacity to introduce an air of glasnost can all apply to the Middle East. We can draw on the experience of others. We can add that which is unique to us and offer our young generation the dawn of prosperity in peace.In order to prepare the ground for the launching of our region on the long road to peace  may we suggest that all relevant parties undertake the following: those interested in the promotion of peace and stability in the Middle East undertake a moratorium on all threats or acts of violence; those interested in promoting Arab-Israeli peace negotiations undertake to encourage and facilitate the early convening of such negotiations in a non-coercive setting  free of a renewed arms race and free of external pressure; and those committed to the cause of peace in the Middle East reaffirm their adherence to  the only commonly accepted basis for such negotiations - Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) - the renunciation of violence and terror and recognition of the right of all peoples and States in the region to freedom  dignity  peace and security.  Before I conclude I wish to refer again to yet another issue that is very close to our hearts. As we have pointed out so often in the past  in Yemen  in Syria  in Iran and elsewhere our brethren are today permitted neither the free pursuit of our common heritage nor free departure to Israel. We call upon the Governments of those countries to respect basic human rights. We also call upon the Governments to reject the shameful assertion that Zionism is racism  a statement that shows no understanding of Zionism and a dangerous misunderstanding of racism.Forty years ago the founder of our State  David Ben-Gurion  against the background of the turmoil of war and revival  introduced our Declaration of Independence  which stated:""We extend our hand in peace and neighbourliness to all the neighbouring States and their peoples  and invite them to co-operate with the independent Jewish nation for the common good of all.""Israel at 40  proud of its accomplishments at home  confident about its future  today reiterates that very call; we extend our hand in peace to all our neighbours  peoples and States  as we stand ready to alter the course of Middle East history. At the all-too-familiar crossroads of hope and despair we are convinced that the choice is ours to make.Most appropriately  this week our people celebrate the holiday of Succoth  the Feast of Tabernacles  as we pray together ""Spread over us the Tabernacle of Thy peace ...""""He who maketh peace in heavens  may He make peace for us ...""We need it; we can help to achieve it. "
"72",3478,"ITA",43,1988,"ï»¿Mr. President  on behalf of the Italian Government I should like to congratulate you most warmly on your election. We are pleased that this honour should have been conferred on the representative of a country to which we ate bound by long-standing ties of friendship  personified by the presence of a large Italian community in Argentina. Your abilities and your experience will guarantee the successful fulfilment of this mandate  a mandate that has been rendered particularly delicate by developments in international affairs which offer hopes that cannot be allowed to die.May I also be allowed to express my appreciation to the outgoing President who  in performing the task entrusted to him by the General Assembly last year  met the challenges posed to our Organization during that period with dedication and skill.Lastly  the Secretary-General has the gratitude of the Italian Government and my personal appreciation. As a worthy heir to the Latin American juridical tradition  he has succeeded in handling with extraordinary political vision  commitment and negotiating skills situations from which others would have emerged the loser. In the efforts he has generously devoted to the pursuit of peace and security  in his quest for negotiated solutions  and in his firm defence of the principles of the Chatter  the Secretary-General has had  and continues to have  the unconditional support of the Italian Government.The winds of history seem  today  to be blowing in the right direction. This is confirmed by the trust and sincerity of the ongoing dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union  and the incisive role assumed by the United Nations in regional crises and conflicts. Italy is contributing to these developments the whole-hearted co-operation of a country fully aware of its international responsibilities. In view of the advances made by the two major Powers in the field of disarmament  we must recognize that many things have changed over the past 12 months. Positive changes have opened up new prospects for stability  particularly in Europe. The Italian Government  acting individually and in the framework of the Atlantic Alliance and the European Community  has made its own contribution to promoting these prospects.The conclusion of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles has particular significance. Above all  it suggests a new way of dealing with disarmament problems because  for the first time in the history of mankind  massive quantities of weapons are being destroyed  not through wartime military operations but  on the contrary   as a consequence of negotiations. And here I should like to emphasize that this Treaty  together with the detailed verification procedures it provides for  should serve as a model to be followed and  accordingly  extended to other agreements as soon as possible.We all cherish the well-founded hope that the agreement on a 50-per-cent cut in the strategic arsenals of the two major Powers will also be formally concluded at an early date. We would call attention both to President Reagan's consistent commitment to promoting the dialogue at the highest level with the Soviet Union and to the dynamic and courageous approach taken by General Secretary Gorbachev  also in his international policies.It is chiefly in the area of disarmament that the community of nations must play a role if bilateral agreements are to be gradually extended to cover all types of weapons existing on Earth.Today  in the light of the results achieved  our objective must be to eliminate the risks of a sudden change of course. This is an endeavour incumbent on all nations  and should be self-evident in the case &1 an Organization that believes in the strength of its universality and the need to take the utmost advantage of all possibilities afforded by a more serene international climate.Unfortunately  the agreements between the two major Powers have not yet been matched by any appreciable results in the various multilateral forums.The proceedings of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament did not produce any specific conclusion. Of course  we do not underestimate the contribution that emerged from these joint deliberations towards more effective mechanisms for the transparency of military budgets  towards a deeper analysis of the principles governing verification of arms control agreements  and particularly towards increased effectiveness for United Nations initiatives in activities directly or indirectly linked to disarmament.These deliberative contributions are by no means minor. But our task does not consist solely in stating and illustrating positions; it requires us to work coherently for the realization of the good intentions and the equally receptive attitudes that exist.At the conference table in Geneva no progress has been recorded for some time in almost any of the areas under discussion  from the cessation of all nuclear-test explosions to the prevention of an arms race in outer space  or from the banning of radiological weapons to the comprehensive programme of disarmament.Only in the field of chemical weapons are negotiations moving ahead  but even these are moving too slowly. At one time we had hoped they might be completed this year. In fact that was the hope that  together with Foreign Minister Genscher  I personally expressed in Geneva last February. That has not happened  although the use of this terrible instrument of mass destruction is again of current concern to Governments and public opinion.We do not  of course  underestimate the technical difficulties of applying adequate verification procedures in this field. For that very reason we sponsored an international symposium last May in Rome  attended by eminent scientists. Information and conclusions emerged regarding the possibility of conducting experiments to verify that there are no diversions for military purposes in industrial production processes. We shall bring the results of the proceedings to the attention of Governments.Regionally  the imbalances in conventional weapons existing in Europe are another dangerous source of insecurity. We must therefore make every effort to secure prompt results that will permit the achievement of greater stability at lower levels of forces and armaments. Here  in the context of the informal Vienna talks on the elaboration of a mandate for future negotiations  there are signs of a significant convergence of views on questions of substance.We intend to continue to work  in every possible way  towards the speediest possible completion of a satisfactory final document.I should like at this point to reaffirm the validity of the Helsinki Final Act  an irreplaceable instrument in international relations which has indissolubly linked the United States and Canada to the future of the countries and peoples of the Old World. In this context let me express the hope that Albania will also play a part in the overall European framework. I would interpret as a positive step in this direction the very recent Albanian decision to resume active participation in the Inter-Parliamentary Union  which will be celebrating its centenary next year.In a final reference to the topic of disarmament in Europe  I would mention that Italy  as part of a drastic reduction in armaments  is giving priority to the elimination of asymmetries in the most destabilizing offensive-weapon categories. This elimination should be followed by a restructuring of military deployments in a defensive posture.It will be recalled that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons itself provides that all the signatories  including the nuclear-weapon Powers  should pursue negotiations for the conclusion  as expressly stipulated in article VI  of ""a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control"". (resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex)The representative of the country currently holding the presidency of the Council of the European Communities has already stated the common position of the member states on the various more delicate aspects of international activities. The statement made by my colleague from Greece has testified to the work done by the Twelve towards harmonizing their respective foreign policies  a harmonization we Italians hope will become increasingly visible and extensive. We are indeed convinced that we must build a more united and mutually supportive Europe capable of progressively asserting  primarily on the basis of the Single European Act  an identity of its own and its own role in shaping a free world responsive to the demands of the various peoples. This identity and this role fully accord with the aims attributed by the Charter of the United Nations to regional arrangements. The United Nations has recently achieved encouraging results in endeavours to resolve some of the most acute and difficult international crises of the past decade. The advances made constitute real successes for the Organization and its Secretary-General  to whose perseverance and skill as a negotiator they ate largely due.I refer  first of all  to the good offices which led to the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan.In the case of Iran and Iraq  a cease-fire was achieved and a direct negotiating process between the parties has finally been launched. We fully support the efforts of the Secretary-General to consolidate  through implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  the results obtained thus far.In the Security Council and at the bilateral level   we shall continue to work for the restoration  between the two countries concerned and in the Gulf  of the conditions of security and stability which are the prerequisite for peace and are indispensable for the commencement of reconstruction.On the question of Cyprus and in the dispute over Western Sahara  the patient quest for points of contact also seems to hold out prospects of change.We are thus at a point in history when the United Nations is offered increasing opportunities  either directly â as in the cases I have just mentioned â or indirectly  to consolidate and bring to fruition the agreements reached at the regional level. This is happening in the case of southern Africa  where in Angola and in Namibia the United Nations may be called upon to facilitate and guarantee the withdrawal of foreign troops  the restoration of domestic peace and the completion of one of the last great decolonization processes in history. The role of our Organization is undoubtedly becoming more incisive. We have seen the increasingly favourable reception accorded to offers of mediation by United Nations bodies and the new opportunities for action that are constantly opening up.The new possibilities and the prospects I have mentioned are  without doubt  due to the changed climate in relations between the two major Powers and the overall improvement in international relations wrought by that change.For the first time since 1945 - that is  since the approval of the Charter at San Francisco - the United Nations now finds itself operating within an international context not unlike the one envisioned by the founding countries  a context in which international collaboration  a tendency to engage in dialogue  the negotiated solution of problems  in short multilateralism and the rule of law  should take precedence over arbitrary approaches and the use of force.The present convergence of positive elements could enable the United Nations to make greater use of all the instruments available under its Charter. Here we have a great opportunity  but also a great question mark. Once the differences between East and West have been reduced and  we hope  eliminated  it remains to be seen whether those uninvolved in that tension  and those who were loud in their denunciation of the inherent threats to international progress and stability  will also shoulder their responsibilities. There must be a broadening of narrow regional outlooks  less rhetoric and a greater focus on action  a feeling of participation in a common design. There is a need for a spirit of dialogue  which we must all patiently seek to make more effective.The successes I have mentioned would not have been possible without the mediation efforts  I say again of the Secretary-General and his associates  with the contribution of the Security Council - an important context for its function and the problems confronting it  but a limited one  and  I would say  certainly inadequate in the light of the great potential of our Organization.The time has come to test the potential of all the organs of the United Nations  including the General Assembly. We must overcome the conflicts between groups  which have been a frequent feature of the past few years. This is a necessary development if the system is to pursue the role assigned to it by the Charter  keep pace with developments in international relations  and thus preserve its credibility. One thing is certain. If the dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union is pursued in depth and results in a strengthening of the cause of peace and the necessary conditions for security  there will no longer be any excuse for those countries or groups of countries that have thus far  more or less deliberately  tried to shirk their historical responsibilities.Special attention should be given to unresolved conflicts.The Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories  which began last December  clearly reflects the distress of a population compelled for decades  and without any political prospects  to live in a state of occupation. The disagreements between Arabs and Israelis and the Palestinian problem are back in the limelight  serving as a dramatic and  indeed  a daily reminder to the international community of the existence in a sensitive area of an open wound that requires healing.We are all aware of the complexity of the problem confronting us. Everyone  including the parties involved  is looking for a way out of the situation  and it is also generally recognized that repressive measures against a movement that is widespread and spontaneous are of no avail. Israel is a member of this Assembly  as it is entitled to be. This must be fully recognized  and so must the corresponding right to security  without offensive charges of racism. Similarly  Palestinians and Israelis  particularly those of the younger generation  must be helped out of the vicious circle of hatred and confrontation and encouraged to enter into dialogue and co-operation that can open up new prospects for development throughout the Middle East.There is a growing conviction  shared by a very broad section of the community of nations  that an international peace conference  subject to rules and procedures that are imaginative and innovative  could help overcome the problems and obstacles in the way of a global  just and lasting solution to the conflict. We welcomed the acceptance in principle by the United States of the idea of an international peace conference and we appreciate the aims underlying the personal and generous commitment demonstrated by Secretary of State Shultz in presenting his peace plan.I am convinced that solution of the problem confronting us - which  in essence  concerns the possibility for all the countries of the area  including Israel  to live within secure and recognized borders  and the right of the Palestinians to a homeland - is not always facilitated by those who take up purely declaratory positions which remain without effect. I believe that a serious  positive effort must be made by all of us to reduce existing differences.In the Middle East context we also view developments in Lebanon with concern  for its institutional difficulties are all the more alarming in that they could jeopardize not only the coexistence of Christians and Muslims  but the very unity of the State.In Central America  after encouraging progress in the dialogue following the Esquipulas agreements  we note with concern disturbing symptoms of intransigence that will make it harder to achieve the general reconciliation we hoped for and  hence  that ""happy peace for all"" to which the Presidents of the Central American countries referred last year when agreeing  inter alia  on the promising idea of a common Central American parliament.Italy is an active participant in the political dialogue instituted between the States of the region and the countries of the European Community. The latter countries are continually and actively following the regional peace efforts and hope that all parties will show that genuine political will necessary to give those efforts a constructive thrust and renewed momentum. The Horn of Africa region also deserves the attention of the Assembly because of the tensions still existing there. These tensions  and some major natural disasters  have unfortunately made living conditions unacceptable for hundreds of thousands of human beings. Realism and a genuine spirit of conciliation are the components needed to consolidate promising agreements and translate into reality the political solutions that would restore peace to that area  as an essential prerequisite for its social and economic progress. For years Italy has been giving the highest priority to its co-operation in the development of this region. We are prepared to strengthen this co-operation further if conditions permit. In this context  Italy is devoting special attention to the situation in Eritrea  where its co-operation and humanitarian assistance efforts are encountering particular obstacles  which are having a negative impact on the normal development of those efforts.Another crisis  that in Kampuchea  shows signs of positive developments  provided that the parties are able to maintain the commitments already undertaken and the conditions are achieved for the formation of the broadest possible domestic coalition.The history of our planet is becoming increasingly a closely shared experience in which peoples  nations and different economic and social systems are participating. This is not  at this juncture  an empty statement. On the contrary  it has a particular meaning for a world that has become more aware of the dangers of collective destruction caused by misguided developments in science and technology and is consequently intent  above all  on rediscovering the values of solidarity and justice. The deliberations of the forty-third session of the General Assembly cannot fail to take account of the new climate of increasing openness to mutual understanding and of willingness to search more actively for common ground.Italy has always been a supporter of the role of the United Nations in the pursuit of international peace and security. Our very presence in the Security Council reflects those concerns and proceeds from the assumption that the role of the Secretary-General should be enhanced and that parties to a dispute should be constantly persuaded to take a peaceful view of their own interests.The successes the United Nations is scoring today confirm the validity of multilateralism and show that we must all have faith in a system of agreements that promotes the rule of law and increasingly restricts recourse to violent means.In this connection we affirm our belief in the principle of universality as a fundamental principle that must be reinforced and extended  where the proper conditions exist  by consistent conduct on the part of United Nations bodies and Member States. We hope  in this context  that contacts between the two Koreas will be resumed and yield positive results  so that the principle of universality may also become a reality for them.We must also ensure that the United Nations is in a position to over time its present budgetary crisis and that there is a sound financial basis for its peace-keeping operations  which we all wish to see extended and consolidated  so as to infuse new life into the purposes and principles of the United Nations.Our Organization cannot confine itself to reacting to events. It must take preventive action and look ahead if it is to understand and satisfy the far-reaching demands of our peoples and redress the glaring imbalances which are still poisoning relations between nations. We must  in other words  take full advantage of the opportunities available for bringing about a world order guaranteed by the rule of law and considerations of justice.The path is now strewn with obstacles  difficulties and burdensome restrictions. The efforts of the entire international community are required to overcome them. Our peoples feel ever more acutely the need for an improved quality of life  a healthier and better protected environment and true freedom from the enemies of society and civilization  such as the heavy indebtedness of some countries  recurrent food crises  pollution of the atmosphere and the oceans  the effects of excessive urbanization and the production and use of drugs. In actual fact little has been done to combat these evils  I am thinking  in particular  of the terrible dimensions of the drug phenomenon  which is undermining the very foundations of our society and destroying our young people  who are our hope for the future.We must attack drug production by carrying out adequate programmes to assist economic and social development and to substitute other crops for drugs in the producing countries. We must attack trafficking by means of increased co-operation between judicial and police authorities and by introducing  through international agreements  financial controls that will make it possible to freeze and confiscate the proceeds of drug traffickers. Lastly  and perhaps above all  we must strike a blow at illicit drug use by putting into effect all appropriate preventive measures  educating and sensitising public opinion  harnessing for this purpose the power of the major communications media  using appropriate school and leisure facilities and instituting programmes for the treatment  recovery and rehabilitation of drug addicts.International co-operation to combat drug use is particularly necessary now that it is affecting all States  albeit to a different extent  so that no country can really consider itself immune. It is a terrible evil which we all share  from East to West  North to South  and we all have a duty to take forceful determined action to combat it.The economic  social  health and environmental effects of urbanization also need careful consideration. It has been estimated that  after the year 2000  some 50 per cent of the world's population will be living in megalopolises  and that this phenomenon will affect the emerging countries particularly.While it is easy to imagine the kind of effects produced by the concentration of populations in cities  it seems more difficult at the present level of our knowledge to identify suitable remedies to reduce - at least partially â the resulting anomalies. Perhaps  in this particular area too  help will come from co-operation between scientists  in a setting in which science is growing more open  rising above ideological barriers to become a vehicle of universal progress and not an instrument of competition.There are certainly many opportunities  even in this area of the quality of life  for encouraging and developing international co-operation. The United Nations  precisely because of its universal character  cannot evade these new ' challenges and  indeed  should be ready to provide convincing and eloquent responses to them.I am not at present in a position to suggest the courses to be taken.Perhaps  and particularly with a view to preparing for or  if possible  preventing major natural disasters - I have in mind disasters of the Sahel type - we might consider setting up a collective emergency force to be placed at the disposal of the Secretary-General. The establishment of such a force would complement certain activities which  to some extent  are already being carried out  and would confirm the universal role of the United Nations  viewed as a catalyst for human solidarity.It would be over-ambitious of me to delineate the exact contours of our future  and predict the structure of our society at the planetary level.However  there is one element in the thinking of the authors of the San Francisco Charter that remains particularly valid - the idea that the United Nations and its machinery should be a profoundly innovative factor in relations between States. Besides  the mere fact of achieving harmony between peoples with such diverse cultures and systems through a process that precludes suspicion and mistrust in the interests of promoting co-operation  must inevitably result in something original and unique. Now is the time to embark on this venture  precisely because we must realize that the principles and purposes set forth in the Charter could not have been properly affirmed in an atmosphere  such as we have experienced in the past  characterized by serious tensions between the two major Powers. Is it possible  then  to attain these objectives in the framework of the process of revision taking place in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union? If we tried to give a definite affirmative answer to that question I think we would be venturing onto the unsafe ground of prophecy. We will merely note that there now exist favourable conditions for change and that the requirements linked to this change ace coming to light  even if they are not always perceived fully and with total clarity.More than any other design  that of a more balanced order  an order that is informed  above all  with the principles of justice  appears the most likely eventuality as we approach the year 2000  if only because  as Plato said  every individual or State that is unjust contains within itself the seeds of its own destruction. And this is still valid for all mankind."
"73",3524,"JAM",43,1988,"ï»¿This forty-third session of the General Assembly takes place against the backdrop of a number of important developments in the international environment. The bipolarity of the world of aggressive confrontation and competing military alliances has begun to attenuate; old assumptions and attitudes have begun to crumble  what has emerged is a new phase of co-operative dialogue between the super-Powers and a new thinking about themselves and their relation to each other. This has encouraged considerable lessening of international tension and a concerted effort to seek urgent negotiated solutions to pressing international problems and areas of regional conflict. The United Nations as an instrument to manage the settlement of disputes is back in fashion.It is therefore our good fortune that Mr. Dante Caputo  Foreign Minister of Argentina  has been elected to conduct the affairs of the General Assembly at this time. As a distinguished representative of our region of Latin America and the Caribbean; he will be able to bring his undoubted skills to the affairs of this body at this important transitional period. We are also indebted to his predecessor. Foreign Minister Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic  who so ably guided the forty-second session of the General Assembly a  well as its several resumed sessions.Last week the Nobel Peace Prize was conferred on the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations  a fitting and worthy tribute. To all of them  including those who have died in the service of peace  Jamaica pays homage  as it does to those Governments that have given such tangible support to the high ideals of the United Nations. As we recall the recent successes of the United Nations we cannot forget the direct involvement  patience and persistence of the Secretary-General and his special Representatives. We wish to commend Secretary-General Javier Peres de Cuellar's dedication and unstinting efforts in the cause of the United Nations. Jamaica  happily outside of regional conflicts  is nevertheless prone to the harsh and unpredictable vicissitudes of nature. Our vulnerability was brutally displayed on the eve of this session when Hurricane Gilbert traversed the island from east to west  leading in its wake massive destruction and loss of life. As requested a separate item entitled ""Emergency assistance to Jamaicaâ will come up in the plenary Assembly  but we wish at this stage to thank all those countries  organizations  agencies and individuals who responded so generously and so rapidly to the tragedy that befell our country. Our empathy goes to the other victims of Gilbert - the Cayman Islands and Mexico - as well as to the floods in Sudan  Bangladesh and India. Natural disaster e humble the rich and poor  the strong and weak alike  and make us all one.Perhaps at no other time in the post-war years has the climate of international relations been so favourable. As we reflect on the changes taking place  we have to acknowledge that they are testimony to the capacity of States to act decisively and meaningfully in critical situations  provided the necessary political will is applied. As Member States of the United Nations we have a collective responsibility to ensure that these achievements are nurtured into sustained co-operation based on mutual respect and realistic understanding of often conflicting interests  for we must be cognisant of the fragile and sometimes tenuous nature of the accommodations we seek.	Initiatives by Member States have contributed significantly to the improved international environment. Special note has to be taken of the greater degree of accommodation among the permanent members of the Security Council  which enhances its effectiveness. We have welcomed the agreements reached on Afghanistan  the agreement between Iran and Iraq on the cessation of hostilities  the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Ethiopia and Somalia  the ongoing issues in South-western Africa and recent contacts between the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and the Vietnamese authorities; the prospective breakthrough on Western Sahara the renewal of talks between representatives of the Greek and Turkish communities on the situation in Cyprus. All these developments seem to signal a new era in relations among Member states of the Organisation. We have also noted that North Korea and South Korea currently Observers within the United Nations  are seeking the support of Member States in the promotion of peace  reconciliation and dialogue in the Korean peninsula. In several of these the role of the United Nations has been  and will continue to be  significant.The United Nations is at its best when States are willing to use it. This is especially true of the major Powers. So it is for this very reason that the present feeling of euphoria must not be overdone. The multilateral system is still subject to changes of mood. Yet there is such on the international agenda that requires our sustained collective effort. Even if we put aside for a moment regional conflicts  we still have before us the problems of the environment and ecology  drug trafficking  refugees  humanitarian and economic assistance  the array of economic problems and human rights.This year we will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  but still the world bears witness to the continued and increasing violation of human rights in different countries and regions. Summary arrests  detentions  mass executions  torture and disappearances have all become deplorable features of life. When the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  it provided international standards for measuring the behaviour of States in their protection and promotion of human rights as a permanent obligation.Al though legal force has been given to the principles so eloquently and so baldly expressed in the Declaration  and despite its remarkable influence on the further development of human rights instruments  we cannot but be saddened by the fact that injustices and prejudices founded on race  colour  political ideology and sex continue to find sustenance in many countries and regions. As we commemorate this year as the fortieth anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  it is our hope that Member States will give full support to the work of the Organisation in this area.Disarmament and arms control is another issue that is always with us. Notwithstanding the Treaty between the two super-Powers on the elimination of their intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles - the INF Treaty - the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament did not turn out as well as was expected  that was particularly disappointing was the marked reluctance of the nuclear-weapon States to contribute to the efforts to enhance the multilateral process and to strengthen the role of the United Nations in this regard. However  it did at least underline the appropriateness of the priorities established in the 1978 Programme of Action in favour of nuclear disarmament and urgent steps for the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction  including chemical weapons and conventional weapons. There continues to be a growing sense of urgency regarding the need to conclude a convention on chemical weapons  an agreement on a verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty and the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts of the world. The arm control process must be broadened from nuclear delivery vehicles to a total resources constraint on nuclear weapons through limitations on fissionable materials for military purposes. For we must emphasise  both the INF Treaty and the proposed 50 per cent cut deal with control of delivery vehicles  not nuclear weapons.The situation in southern Africa admits no relaxation. The persistence of the repugnant apartheid abates and the systematic campaign of violence unleashed by the racist regime against the oppressed majority and also directed against the neighbouring States in the region and the evolution of events that we hopes will lead to the termination of Pretoria's illegal occupation of Namibia and the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) call for continued vigilance to ensure that international pressure on South Africa is maintained to preclude the possibility of any violation on its part of the commitments which it freely entered into under the Accords.We strongly endorse the proposals of the front-line States for the early convening of the Security Council to authorise the timetable for the implementation of its settlement plans for Namibia  and for the emplacement of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG).Despite the renewed hopes for a settlement of the Namibian problem  the pressure of sanctions against South Africa must be maintained and intensified so long as the Pretoria regime refuses to release all political prisoners and engage in real dialogue with the majority population  with a view to terminating the obnoxious apartheid system.In this hemisphere  prospects for a resolution of the Central American crisis were significantly increased by the signing of the Esquipulas Agreement a year ago. Although that agreement sets out the procedures for the establishment of peace in the subregion; repeated truce violationÂ· and the deadlock In negotiationÂ· between the respective parties are causeÂ· for serious concern. The government of Jamaica therefore joinÂ· the International community in urging the parties concerned to settle their differenceÂ· through time proneÂ· of dialogue and negotiations.We support the United Nations Special Plan for Economic Co-operation for Central America  which addresses  on an immediate and long-term basis  the economic and social problems of all the countries of the area. It is our hope that this plan will help in establishing a firm and lasting peace through the promotion of economic and social development throughout the region.Jamaica remains deeply concerned about the effectÂ· of the escalation in illicit trafficking of drugs on international  social and political stability. Drug-related activities  particularly in the Latin American and Caribbean region  demonstrate the inordinate influence of drug traffickerÂ· in destabilizing political and economic establishmentÂ·. The Government of Jamaica pledges its full co-operation to the United NationÂ· in the international campaign against drug abuse and Illicit trafficking.We urge all Member States to implement the recommendations of the first United Nations Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking held last year and to lend full support to the adoption of the new International Convention against the Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances later this year.The Government of Jamaica has always attached great importance to the work of the United Nations end its specialized agenda. We remain fully committed to the principles laid down in the Charter. Unfortunately  the role of the United Nations haÂ· been undermined and weakened over the years aÂ· a result of the violation of its principles  the erosion of multilateral lam and disregard for its resolutionÂ· and recommendations. Although United Nations efforts at resolving problems and conflicts have not always met with the degree of success anticipated  it has consistently served as a centre for harmonising divergent viewpoints on the thorniest of issues. The United Nations has been able to bring warring factions to the negotiating table to facilitate the search for acceptable solutions  and that in itself is a significant achievement.  We are firm in our conviction that there is as yet no alternative to this global system.It is ironic that at a time when the united Nations is playing a more active and constructive role in world affairs  the Organisation is threatened by a desperate financial situation primarily due to the non-payment and the withholding by some Member States of their assessed contributions. The Government of Jamaica strongly rejects attempts to manipulate the United Nations system through the deliberate denial of financial support. We note with satisfaction  however  that some countries have now indicated their intention to reduce outstanding arrears and release funds previously withheld.It is clear that the current cash flow and other problems demand a long-term solution so as to eliminate the risk of recurring short-term financial crises. Jamaica is ready to cooperate in the efforts to achieve a permanent solution to the budgetary problem  facing the Organisation and to seek reform of the united Nations system particularly within the framework of the recommendations of the Group of 18.Only a strong and vibrant United Nations can continue to play a central role in world affairs. The attitude of Member States will  however  be critical to the future role of the Organization and its ability to initiate constructive action for the preservation of international peace and security as well as social and economic progress.And now I turn to the international economic scene in which a number of important issues have engaged our attention over the past year. The grave problem of International debt have been discussed in many forums  and  number of decisions have been announced which are aimed at mitigating various aspects of the problem  we welcome these decisionsÂ¿ and acknowledge them as sincere efforts to deal with a problem that is now clearly recognized by the international community to be a matter of grave global concern. But we are constrained to point out that  despite these decisions  the debt burden of the developing countries still continues to grow. In 1307 developing countries had their debt increased by about 6 per cent and the outflow of resources from developing countries continues.In such circumstances  the developing countries will simply sink deeper under an increasing burden of debt; they will be frustrated in their efforts to raise the level of their economies and improve the well-being of their people; and the international economy will continue to falter because an important segment of potential demand continues to be stifled.This situation is in part caused  and certainly aggravated  by the weakness in commodity markets which seriously affects the export earning capability of practically all developing countries. It is aggravated by protectionist arrangements in many markets  and by threats of protectionist measures which Inevitably Inhibit investment planning.It is therefore a range of problems that must be dealt with if we are to find a real solution. Central to everything  however  is the simply stated proposition that economic growth in developing countries must take place and must be facilitated. It is only by that means that they will be able eventually to cope with the burden of debt that now inhibits all their economic and social planning. This central fact is coming to be increasingly recognized and accepted internationally; but  of course  the question that must be answered is. How is growth to be achieved? An important part of the answer is that developing countries must undertake whatever adjustments and changes are needed within their own economies in order to increase production  widen their productive base and improve their production efficiency. This will probably involve adjustments  and even reforms  in the fiscal and monetary areas  in order to facilitate and encourage the desired developments. The need to achieve efficiency cannot be over-emphasized. It is only by this means that developing countries can be assured of their competitiveness in international markets and thus of their ability to enhance their export earnings.Regardless of the details of adjustment  however  it is of the utmost importance that the adjustment process  though specific to each country  involve the social sectors as well  and that these sectors be an integral part of the adjustment planning. The need for skills training  the need to ensure productive activity for youngsters coming out of the school system and the need to have programmes in place to sustain the needy in the society  including those whose earning capacity may be temporarily disrupted through the adjustment process  are examples of the necessary elements.Another integral issue is critical poverty  which is becoming an increasingly serious scourge in many of our countries. Within the past few years the high rates of inflation  the adverse terms of trade  the problems of the debt crisis and many of the economic adjustments that have had to be made have all contributed to the growing incidence of extreme poverty in many developing countries. This is a matter to which many developing countries are now being obliged to give very serious attention in an effort to cope with the human  social  economic and political problems that are involved. In the carrying out of our structural adjustment programmes  therefore  this issue of critical poverty must also be part of the planning equation in which we seek to ensure the well-being of the most The basic objective of the whole process  therefore  is to achieve economic growth while seeking to protect and to improve the well-being of the most needy and to create a stronger and broader economic base which brings increasing numbers of the population within the mainstream of the national economy.The need for structural adjustment is now widely accepted  and a number of countries are carrying out reform measures. Jamaica's own experience shows that the social well-being of the population and the problem of critical poverty must be seen and dealt with as integral parts of the adjustment process.Consequently  regardless of the menu of options already in place  the overriding principle that must guide all involved in dealing with the problem of developing countries' debt must be that the developing countries are assisted to achieve economic growth within the context of realistic adjustment programmes  and that the  flow of resources to these countries must not be engineered in such a way that they are prevented from achieving real growth in their economies. Failure to do this will simply sink them further into debt  with all the added problems that that implies. In addition  it will deny the international economy a potentially large new demand for goods and services which the developing countries represent.The economic advancement of developing countries is also severely hampered by the many problems emerging from the 1970s  including loss of foreign exchange earnings due to low commodity prices and the deterioration in the terms of trade.This situation has been made worse by the instability and unpredictability of the world economy and the resort to protectionist measures despite professed commitment to open trade.It was against this background that the current Uruguay Round of trade negotiations was launched in September 1986  to liberalize and further expand world trade. Negotiations are proceeding  but it is still too early to predict whether results will place developing countries in a position to participate more fully and on an equitable basis in the world economy. The mid-term review to evaluate progress in the negotiations scheduled for Montreal in December will serve to demonstrate to the international community how far commitment made at Punta del Este are being translated into concrete action.Jamaica  together with other developing countries  hopes that significant progress will be made in the negotiations  particularly in areas of export interest  such as tropical products  cited for special attention in the Ministerial Declaration of the Round. The implications of subsidies on agricultural products and their removal are also of concern and will have to be carefully assessed. In addition  we look forward to parallel advancement in the interrelated issues  such as tariffs and non-tariff Measures  safeguards and respect for the standstill and roll-back commitments to halt and reverse protectionist. At the same time  the principles of non-reciprocity and differentiated treatment must continue to be respected.Jamaica remains convinced that a successful outcome of the negotiations will not only help to create a more viable and predictable trading environment but also add credibility to the multilateral framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.It is encouraging to note that  despite the uncertainty in the world economy  significant developments have been made in two areas in which developing countries have been specifically involved. We welcome the adoption in April this year of the Global System of Trade Preferences among Developing Countries  which is aimed at promoting and sustaining mutual trade among developing countries through the exchange of concessions  with the participation of some 48 countries. The Common Fund for Commodities  after eight years of negotiation  has completed its ratification process and is expected to become fully operational. Recent successes of the United Nations must not obscure the imperative need for similar efforts and progress in the economic arena  where developing countries are being buffeted daily. Jamaica expects that more attention will be focused here so that the goal of the Charter ""to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom will be achievable."
"74",3570,"JOR",43,1988,"ï»¿I am pleased to convey to you  Sir  on behalf of the Government and people of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan  the warmest congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. Your election to that exalted office undoubtedly indicates the high standing of your country  Argentina  and at the same time confirms your well-known ability and experience and your great diplomatic skill  which will certainly be of the greatest assistance to us in ensuring the success of our work and the achievement of the desired results. In like manner I am happy to express thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  for the consummate skill with which he presided over the work of our last session  which had a major impact in terms of the marked successes it achieved.It also gives me pleasure  at the outset of my statement  to convey to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the gratitude and appreciation of the Government and people of my country for his continuing efforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations and for this year's valuable report on the work of the Organization  which in our view will represent an extremely important contribution to the success of our deliberations at the current session. We wish him every success in the tasks before him. The decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 1988 to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is for us a source of the greatest gratification and pride. The award  coming as it does at this precise juncture  transcends any narrow sense of tribute-paying and conveys the widest recognition and strongest intimation of the vital and essential role that the United Nations continues to play in the preservation and maintenance of international peace and security. The decision demonstrates a just evaluation of the significance of the role of the United Nations and is a triumph for the multilateral principle in action. The Norwegian Nobel Committee was correct in pointing out that the United Nations peace-keeping forces represent the manifest will of the community of nations to achieve peace through negotiation  and that the forces  by their presence  have made a decisive contribution to the initiation of real peace negotiations. On this momentous occasion  I extend sincerest congratulations to the Secretary-General  to whom  because of the role he has assumed and the active contribution he has made  must go a great deal of the credit for the award of this most prestigious Prize.We participate in the present session of the General Assembly imbued with the hope of working in co-ordination with Member States with c view to reaching the best possible results  particularly since the problems facing mankind are of a global character and thus require that the international community share in their solution. In so doing  there is no alternative to dialogue  diplomacy and negotiation  which are a moral imperative and a logical prerequisite for the creation of a better world.My country believes that the United Nations  whose Charter was drawn up in the higher interest of all Member States  continues to be indispensable to the world's people  and that the full utilization of its capabilities and States' vigilance in being guided by its Charter in the formulation of their foreign policies will enhance the Organization's effectiveness and strengthen its role in the settlement of conflicts  the solution of regional and international problems and the maintenance of international peace and security.Proceeding from Jordan's commitment to the Charter  we reaffirm that the principles of the United Nations and its authority are two pillars which are indissolubly linked with the implementation of the resolutions adopted by it. We therefore reject partiality and selectivity in the application of its resolutions  particularly those involving such political and moral principles as the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force  the rejection of foreign occupation  the peaceful settlement of disputes and the right of peoples to self-determination  we consider such resolutions  particularly those relating to the questions of Palestine  the Middle East  Lebanon  the Iraq-Iran conflict  Namibia  Cyprus and Kampuchea  to be vital and to be reinforced by the purport of the relevant international instruments..This session of the General Assembly is perhaps distinguished by the fact that it comes in the midst of new developments and positive changes at the international level  as exemplified by the climate of international harmony that has accompanied the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles and made possible substantial breakthroughs with respect to numerous regional problems - in Afghanistan  Central America  Kampuchea  Namibia and Angola - and by the highly positive development in the context of the Iraq-Iran conflict represented by the cease-fire and the trend towards peace. This should encourage Ð¸ and provide us with the incentive to step up the efforts made to address the long-standing issues and problems that currently jeopardize regional and international security and stability  including the Middle East problem  at the core of which is the question of Palestine  and the policy of apartheid in South Africa. We are thus hopeful that all the positive developments and all the indications of detente that we have witnessed in the past year will be channelled towards strengthening the United Nations itself  particularly the Security Council  and will enable it to fulfil the role required of it in the current situation.There can be no doubt that the efforts made by the Secretary-General and his personal assistants highlight in an unequivocal manner the importance of the United Nations in devising solutions to pending issues. We have evidence of that in the long and sustained efforts made under the leadership of the Secretary-General until they were crowned by success in the signing of the Afghanistan Accords  the successful entry into force of the cease-fire arrangements between Iran and Iraq and the subsequent talks embarked upon with a view to terminating the state of war and achieving a comprehensive and just settlement of the conflict between the two neighbouring countriesIn this connection  and at a time when we recognize the urgent need to strengthen the role and effectiveness of the United Nations and give it the thrust it needs to have a new reign in pursuing the tasks  activities and responsibilities entrusted to it  it is also evident that the Organization's financial crisis is becoming increasingly acute  to the point where it dangerously jeopardizes the continuity of the Organization's work and perhaps its very existence  and thus threatens to destroy the hopes placed in it by mankind.We are even more saddened and concerned by the fact that the roots of the crisis do not lie in any inability to pay but stem  rather  from a serious decline in respect for the legal  political and moral commitment to the United Nations and the principles for which it stands. This being the case  the focus must be on addressing the crisis more as a problem arising out of the decisions made by States than as one of tapping resources. This does not absolve us from recalling that the immediate causes of the crisis are default  withholding and procrastination by certain States in the payment of their assessed contributions on time. This constitutes a breach by those States of one of their most important international obligations to the Organization as the focus of mankind's hopes for security and prosperity. Thus  while calling upon those Member States to respond to the appeals of the Secretary-General to pay their overdue contributions now and their future contributions on time  we are hopeful that action will be taken to ensure an effective solution to the Organization's financial crisis over the long term by devising a stable system of financing with a sound organizational structure that will prevent any party from bringing financial pressure to bear to influence the functioning or independence of the Organization.In presenting our view of the major international issues and problems I will begin with the Middle East region in the very midst of whose conflict  at the core of which lies the question of Palestine  my country  Jordan  finds itself. That region has become a living embodiment of the international community's state of decline and one of the most dangerous hotbeds of tension in the world  just as it has come to mirror the attempts made to diminish the role of the United Nations. There  expansionism prevails  the Organization's impotence in the face of events in the region is evident  and competition among the great Powers has found such fertile soil that the legitimate interests of the peoples of the region take second place to theirs.More than 21 years of Israeli occupation of the West Bank  the Gaza Strip and the Syrian Arab Golan Heights have now elapsed. At the outset  Israel claimed that it was prepared to withdraw from those territories as part of a comprehensive settlement that would guarantee its peace and security. The falsity of that claim has become clear so that all are now convinced that Israel has no intention of withdrawing from the territories it has occupied. From the beginning of the occupation it set about annexing Arab Jerusalem and implanting settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and it proceeded to destroy their separate economic structures. At the same time it showed persistent opposition to Arab and international peace moves and initiatives and to the United Nations resolutions relating to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Deluded by its military success in 1967 Israel persisted in endeavouring to go against the logic of history and the Charter of the United Nations by changing the temporary character of its occupation into a permanent reality without regard for the lessons of history and without calculating the consequences. These circumstances  created as they are by Israel and by the practices it has continued to pursue for 21 years circumstances which do not provide a fitting background for the co-existence of peoples and which constitute a grave obstacle to the potential for peace rather than a sound basis for its achievement have begotten and provoked a very major development in the context of the question of Palestine and the Middle East problem as a whole. And that is the uprising of the Palestinian Arab people under occupation in all parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  an event the developments of which are followed by the whole world through political news reports and the international media which have brought out Israelis true character and revealed the horror and abomination of its oppressive practices directed against a defenceless civilian population which rejects occupation. The uprising has underscored the consensus of the Palestinian people on rejecting and resisting the occupation and has conveyed to the conscience of the world a cry for help in bringing that occupation to an end just as it has brought home to Israel that the mere passage of time since the occupation began does not make that a fait accompli has been irrevocably established and that the question is closed. To attribute the uprising to causes other than the sense of frustration and despair at finding a way out of the impasse of occupation that is felt by citizens under occupation is tantamount to an attempt to ignore the true state of affairs. Most unfortunately the negative and savage approach adopted by the Israeli occupation authorities in coping with the uprising indicates that Israeli attitudes are still dominated by ideas of intimidating the inhabitants of the occupied territories and using force and violence as means of settling the conflict. Instead of reconsidering its erroneous posture and responding immediately to Arab or international peace initiatives or even initiatives proposed by its friends Israel has resorted to procrastination and manoeuvre as well as to persistent talk of what is rejected by the Arabs and internationally unacceptable  for the purpose of perpetuating the occupation and implementing its unlawful schemes. In the same way  it has engaged in attempts to impose a blackout on what is happening in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in order to conceal the full extent of the force and violence with which the array of occupation confronts defenceless Palestinian citizens. Jordan  which has lived through the tragedy of the Palestinian people in all its dimensions from the very beginning and which bears the greater part of the burden of its humanitarian  economic  social and political impact  has always called for reason  moderation and the search for a just and durable solution. In adopting that course  its people has identified itself with the hopes and travails of the Palestinian people. In 19S0  Jordan united its destiny with that of the West Bank voluntarily and of free choice in a constitutional unity  achieved through democratic methods  which stipulated that both banks of the Jordan would respect the historical rights of the Palestinian people and preserve their rights in any settlement in keeping with international law. The union of the two banks forms the basis in international law and the principles of international legitimacy on which Jordan relied in its political moves to end the Israeli military occupation of the West Bank begun in 1967  in its turn. Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which was adopted by consensus  also gave concrete expression to the importance and legitimacy of Jordan's legal role in working for  and demanding  an end to the occupation. Jordan nevertheless responded positively to the situation which emerged on the Arab scene in 1374 with the proclamation of the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Despite the fact that our acceptance of that situation created something of a duplication of roles  we coped with it by endeavouring to reconcile our role in Jordan  under the umbrella of constitutional unity between the two peoples and international law  with that of the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We were  accordingly  prompt to lend it our support in international forums  to co-operate with it in order to facilitate its political action and to secure its participation as a key party to international peace initiatives  particularly in the light of the declared positions of the United States and Israel to the effect that they would refuse to deal with the Palestine Liberation Organisation.Just as Jordan responded to the call made to it by the Arab States at the 1974 Rabat Summit to continue to deal with the West Bank through Jordanian institutions in order to support the steadfast resistance of the Palestinian people under occupation  it has also responded  further to the Arab Summit Conference held at Algiers last June  to the desire of the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  and in accordance with the inter-Arab policy on the matter  to stress the Palestinian identity of the land of Palestine both formally and substantively by severing the legal and administrative link between the two Banks. That may perhaps also prompt the States concerned  whether directly Involved or in a position to bring strong influence to bear  to face up more realistically and more seriously to the responsibilities that devolve upon them with respect to the attainment of a just  lasting and comprehensive peace and to enabling the Palestinian people to achieve its legitimate rights and to live in freedom and dignity like all other peoples of the world. For our part  we in Jordan are hopeful that this step will also support the valiant uprising and highlight the role of the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  in its endeavour to establish an independent Palestinian State on the soil of the Palestinian homeland. At the same time  we resolutely assert that Jordan will continue to perform its national role as a major party to the Arab-Israeli conflict and to fulfil its duty in assisting the Palestinian  people and supporting its legitimate struggle to achieve its national goals  and we shall do this on the basis of our special and distinctive relationship with the land and people of Palestine. Palestinian identity has at no time been in conflict with or opposition to Jordanian identity. Bather  when we speak of the question of Palestine and ' Palestinian rights  we are referring to a particular land and a specific people that inhabited that land for many centuries before Israel uprooted it in 1948 and dispersed it in the Diaspora going beyond that in 1967 to occupy the entire territory of historical Palestine and place one and a half million Palestinians under its occupation in what is a horrendous prison. This  then  is the problem  and it will only be solved by Israel's withdrawal from the Palestinian and other Arab territories that it occupied in 1967  by respect for the right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland  by enabling the Palestinian people to exercise its inalienable rights  principally its right to self-determination and to establish an independent State on the soil of its homeland  and by guaranteeing the right of all States of the region  including Israel  to live in peace within secure and recognized borders.In our view  the only way to achieve such a settlement is through Israel's acceptance of and agreement to the holding of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East as the sole means of conducting direct negotiations between all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  within an international framework  under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council  on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and the various United Nations resolutions relating to the question of Palestine  the rights of the Palestinian people and the Arab-Israeli conflict in general. The United Nations  through its Charter and its resolutions  represents the natural and proper framework for the achievement of such a settlement  particularly since it is the forum which gave rise to the Palestinian issue. There is an urgent need for new thinking by the Israeli leadership  since it must accept the International Conference as representing the only way to a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement  thus breaking the vicious circle of violence  oppression and moral decline. The pretexts advanced by Israel  such as its fear of the possibility of bringing upon itself international pressures which would place its security in danger  have no basis in truth since one of the key goals of the Conference is to overcome mutual suspicion by guaranteeing the security of all  a security that neither of the parties can achieve at the expense of the other. Failing that  we see no secure future for Israel until it withdraws from the occupied territories. It cannot have both land and peace  and its security will not come from occupying territory or creating defensible borders. It is genuine peace with the Arabs that will ensure its future and provide it with security. The popular uprising in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has demonstrated the falsity of Israeli claims that those areas are essential to its security  and Israel has created for itself a security impasse by persisting in its occupation and attempting to subject the Palestinian people by force.In this connection  we should like to stress that the Security Council  having been established for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security  is entrusted with a unique mandate and accorded certain privileges and because of its political make-up and its international prestige  it is an effective instrument of pressure and action for the convening of the international peace conference on the Middle East  This should take place as soon as possible  given the gravity of the situation with regard to the popular uprising in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  a situation which also requires the Security Council to remain on the highest state of alert and to face its responsibility by adopting immediate measures to protect the civilian population.With regard to the situation in Lebanon  we in Jordan call for the full and speedy implementation of all the resolutions adopted by the Security Council on the question  particularly those calling for full and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon and the deployment of United Nations forces up to the internationally recognized borders. We call for the restoration of Lebanese sovereignty over all Lebanese territory regardless of any Israeli pretexts for prolonging its occupation of southern Lebanon. This would provide the basis for reconciliation in Lebanon and the restoration of the unity  security and stability of that peaceful country. The constitutional crisis through which Lebanon is currently passing is a grave and momentous development  one that requires the co-operation of all parties concerned if they are to reach an agreement reflecting the consensus of all communities and factions in the country on the principle that democracy should be strengthened  on the election of a new President of the Republic and on adhering to an order that will guarantee the unity of the land and people of Lebanon  thereby preventing the advent of a situation that might constitute a step towards the partition of the country. The international community is fully aware of the formidable risks inherent in any partition of Lebanon and the dismantling of its social and political order. Serious damage would be done to the security and stability of the countries of the Middle East region  with a consequent negative impact on international peace and security in general. We pray God that the times of anguish the people of Lebanon is undergoing today will soon turn to times of glory in which it will triumph over the intricacies of the crisis and  through the support and assistance provided to it  achieve overall national reconciliation in a free and united Lebanon  restore the basic economic and social structures of its homeland and achieve the security and prosperity to which it aspires.Jordan welcomes the recent developments in the Iran-Iraq war in terms of the  cease-fire and the moves for peace through direct negotiations. We view these negotiations as a key mechanism with which the two parties should persevere in their endeavour to discuss all the points at issue and address all the causes and manifestations of the obstinate conflict between the two neighbouring States  with a view to reaching a just  lasting and comprehensive peace ensuring stability  good-neighbourliness and close co-operation between them and all other parties in the region. We call foe efforts to be stepped up to impart to the ongoing negotiations between the two countries the political and moral thrust that will make it possible to discuss the conflict and the pending problems associated with it within a framework of judicious political and diplomatic action. While  in this connection  we call attention to the flexibility and commitment to international responsibility which has characterized the political position of Iraq since the outset of the conflict  and which also continues to guide it in the present negotiations between the two countries  we hope that that will be appreciated and reciprocated in a spirit of goodwill and lead to the signing of the treaty of peace  friendship  co-operation and good-neighbourliness guaranteeing the security  prosperity and progress of the peoples of the region as a whole.The achievement and signing of the Afghanistan Accords has also been a source of gratification to us  and we hope that they will be implemented in letter and spirit in order to enable the people of Afghanistan to exercise its right to self-determination in such a manner as to ensure the unity  integrity  independence and neutrality of Afghanistan within the framework of commitment to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. We are happy  in this context  to commend the important role played by the United Nations  and the role and efforts of the Secretary-General personally  which  with the co-operation of the parties concerned  made it possible to achieve such positive results.Similarly  it is with much hope that we have followed the latest developments towards detente in connection with the problem of Namibia. We therefore endorse the negotiations being conducted by the delegations of Angola  South Africa  Cuba and the United States to pave the way for the independence of Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1976)  in the hope that the Secretary-General of the United Nations will be able to announce a beginning of the implementation of that resolution as early as possible this year with a view to achieving independence for Namibia so that it can take its proper place among nations. In the same spirit of optimism and support  we have been following the positive developments with respect to the situation in Central America and the signing of the agreement at Esquipulas  in Guatemala  and we hope that a common understanding for the settlement of all the problems of the region and the establishment of security and peace there will be reached. This represents the necessary basis for overcoming the economic and financial problems from which the States of the region are suffering and ensures the security and welfare of their peoples.In general  the principles on which ray country's policies are based  particularly those relating to the right of peoples to self-determination  non-interference in the internal affairs of States and rejection of occupation  govern its positions on all other international conflicts. In this context  my country welcomes the dialogue that has begun between the parties to the conflict in Kampuchea  with a view to achieving a just and definitive political settlement ensuring the withdrawal of foreign forces and the right to self-determination of the Kampuchean people. We also welcome  in that connection  the recent efforts of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the States of Eastern Asia to promote dialogue and achieve the desired settlement.In like manner  my country also endorses all the moves made to achieve detente and conciliation in the Korean peninsula. The process of dialogue between the two Korean parties must therefore be encouraged in order to build confidence between them as an important and indispensable foundation for the achievement of peaceful unification of the two countries. We will support and endorse that move on the grounds that a united Korea would  in our view  constitute a guarantee of peace  stability and prosperity in that important region of the world. We welcome the idea of both States becoming Members of the United Nations  especially since that would provide an opportunity for them to meet within the United Nations framework in accordance with its principles and work to bring their points of view closer together.Jordan calls for a speedy peaceful settlement of the Cyprus problem through dialogue between the island's two communities  with a view to achieving a settlement that will ensure the unity and sovereignty of Cyprus and its non-aligned status. The recent meeting between the President of Cyprus  Mr. George Vassilou  with the leader of the Turkish community  Mr. Rauf Denktash  under the patronage of the Secretary-General  was a positive sign and indicated that the two parties to the dispute had the political will and genuine desire for constructive dialogue we hope will continue in an atmosphere of mutual confidence to achieve the desired negotiated settlement. In that connection  we endorse the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General and the good offices he is making available to the parties concerned with that end in view.The situation in South Africa does not differ greatly from that in the Middle East because the African States suffer from the racist and aggressive policies of the Government of South Africa and because of the practices of oppression  repression and violence that this regime continues to pursue against the oppressed majority of the population in a vain attempt to suppress the national resistance and perpetuate the policy of apartheid. The Government of my country reaffirms its support for and solidarity with its brothers on the African continent in their just struggle  in which the entire international community participates in order to persuade or compel the Government of South Africa to abandon its policy of apartheid and transform the State into a democratic  unitary country. Here again we cannot fail to stress the role of the United Nations in meeting the need to monitor and condemn the co-operation that exists between Israel and South Africa in the military and nuclear fields  because of the threat that co-operation poses to the African continent and the peace and security of the world as a whole.To complete my presentation of Jordan's viewpoint on the regional and international issues and problems that threaten the security and peace of our peoples  I must refer to the question of disarmament. In our view  disarmament is a basic element in the restructuring of all areas of international relations to establish a comprehensive order of peace  security and prosperity in a world free of violence  in which priority will be accorded to the preservation of human life and the achievement of cultural  scientific and economic progress for human society. That cannot be achieved without eliminating nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. My country welcomed the conclusion of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles by the two super-Powers with satisfaction. It sees this as the beginning of nuclear disarmament and an important step in preparing the political climate for the continuance of efforts towards comprehensive disarmament. We look forward to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations  to enable it to give the necessary thrust in seizing this historic opportunity and making the process of disarmament and detente permanent and irreversible. In conclusion  we believe that the surmounting of the political problems and international conflicts that deplete human potential and waste financial resources will not be enough to achieve peace in the long term if it is not combined with development. This is particularly true since the world economic situation today is far from reassuring would the slow economic recovery achieved by the industrialized countries has not expanded to a degree that ensures its reaching the developing countries  whose progress is essential for the sound development of the world economy as a whole. These countries continue to face deficits in their balance of payments as a result of the fall in commodity prices and growing protectionist trends on the one hand and the rising prices of their imports of manufactured goods on the other. In combination  these factors have led to a drop in exports and foreign currency earnings and consequently aggravated the debt-servicing burdens of the countries concerned. Accordingly  the industrialized countries and the international institutions must take effective measures to enable the developing countries to overcome their economic crises  and they must do this in a context that takes account of the global nature of the world economy and the need for intensification of the North-South dialogue."
"75",3617,"JPN",43,1988,"ï»¿I should like first to express my sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your election as President of this forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. Given the wealth of your experience and knowledge  I am confident that this will be a most successful session of the General Assembly. I assure you that the Japanese delegation stands ready to offer any assistance you may require in the performance of your important duties.At the same time I should like to express my admiration for the achievements of the forty-second session of the General Assembly under the able leadership of its President  Mr. Peter Florin.The United Nations has been particularly active and successful recently in efforts to resolve a number of international problems in various parts of the world. The world stands in appreciation of  and holds great expectations for  the United Nations as it strives to fulfil its most important task of maintaining international peace. Indeed  this demonstrates a restoration of its prestige which my Government finds most encouraging. The renewal of the authority of the United Nations was kindled by a general improvement in international relations  but at the same time it is thanks to the outstanding abilities and tireless efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and other United Nations personnel that the United Nations is being revitalized. I should like to take this opportunity to express my delegation's sincere gratitude and admiration to the Secretary-General and his staff.I should like to begin my remarks today by outlining the basic thinking of my Government on some of the important developments that are affecting global peace and human prosperity.The first of these is the way East-West relations  and especially illations between the United States and the Soviet Union  have developed over the past year. The two States have concluded the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - and their leaders have exchanged visits. It is hoped that this dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union will stabilize East-West relations and that that will accelerate a global trend towards the resolution of differences through negotiations. This is a significant development and deserves a high tribute.It was against that background that the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan were reached last April  that a cease-fire was achieved in the Iran-Iraq conflict and that renewed efforts are under way for the resolution of problems relating to Angola and Namibia  the Western Sahara  Kampuchea and other areas around the globe. Signs of change are also becoming discernible in the quest for peace in the Middle East. While we realize that these developments are still in their early stages and that it will require considerable effort fully to resolve the various regional conflicts  we find it most encouraging that a start has in fact been made in that direction.In this context we very much hope that the foreign policy of the Soviet Union  based upon its ""new thinking""  will be manifested in more concrete actions that will contribute to peace and stability in Asia and the Pacific  including the resolution of the Northern Territories problem and a scaling back of the Soviet military presence in the Far East. Welcoming the Soviet desire for improved relations with Japan  as expressed by General Secretary Gorbachev in his recent Krasnoyarsk speech  we hope that political dialogue between our two countries will be further promoted  starting with the regular foreign ministers' consultations to be held at the end of this year.The second notable development is a growing recognition of the importance of economic development. Political stability is indispensable to economic development  just as raising the standard of living is vital to political stability and economic development is a prerequisite for raising the standard of living. In order to achieve all of those objectives  a climate of international peace conducive to economic development is essential. The present era - 43 years after the end of the Second World War - is characterized by a general recognition of that axiom.There are still a number of destabilizing factors in the world economy  such as substantial imbalances in international payments  persistent pressures of protectionism and debt problems hampering developing countries. On the other hand it is encouraging  for instance  that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has initiated the Uruguay Round of trade talks  aimed at strengthening the multilateral free-trade system  that Japan and the other industrialized countries have clearly started to rectify their trade imbalances and create new jobs  and that the newly industrialized economies are achieving economic development at remarkable rates. These facts demonstrate that so long as favourable domestic political conditions prevail and appropriate economic policies are pursued in a peaceful international environment developing economies can become newly industrialized economies and the latter can become industrialized countries.The third development concerns population and environmental problems  issues that pose a profound threat to lasting peace and prosperity for all mankind. In July of last year the world population reached five billion. It is reported that on 10 August of this year the population of Asia alone exceeded three billion. Of course  war inflicts tremendous suffering. The population problem spawns different kinds of suffering - those associated with  for example  food shortages  energy problems and environmental deterioration. Moreover  mankind is now faced with a number of grave threats  including the destruction of tropical forests. desertification  the depletion of the ozone layer and even climatic changes. We cannot remain silent in the face of these global threats. I believe it is most important that further efforts be made to resolve these problems  reconciling the need for economic development with the global imperative of environmental preservation.As we approach the twenty-first century it is incumbent upon us to promote further the favourable trends I mentioned earlier and  taking a global perspective  to work together to resolve our many problems. In so doing it is most important that the nations of the world once again make human contacts the starting-point of their efforts and that they increase such meetings of hearts and minds across national boundaries. When people of different cultural heritages engage in a broad-based international exchange  not only do both sides develop greater understanding and tolerance for each other's culture but also peoples everywhere become better able to make assessments in the global context. It is in this way that the foundation for a truly open international community may be laid.From this vantage point Japan recognizes that it is increasingly important that it contribute actively to world peace and prosperity and has launched a new policy of active co-operation for the solution of major global issues. The Government of Prime Minister Takeshita has made the building of a ""Japan contributing to the world"" its top policy priority and has recently begun to implement it through the international co-operation initiative  which consists of three pillars: strengthening co-operation to achieve peace  expanding Japan's official development assistance and promoting international cultural exchange. Those policies  as members may recall  were elucidated by Prime Minister Takeshita in his address on 1 June to the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.I would like next to touch upon the role the United Nations should play and the way in which Japan  with this international perspective and on the basis of the new policies that I have just mentioned  will co-operate in that role. The most important problem before us is that of how to secure world peace. I would like to say a few words about my Government's views on regional problems and conflicts which have had a major impact on this question in recent years.Looking first at Afghanistan  we very much hope that the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan will be completed by 15 February 1989  in keeping with the Geneva Accords. I also believe that it is important that the Afghan refugees resulting from that conflict be able to return voluntarily to their native country as soon as possible. Thus  it is imperative that a broad-based Government representing the will of all the people be established in Afghanistan. The Afghan people recognize that they themselves must solve their country's problems  and my Government strongly appeals to them to join together in even greater unity and co-operation to rebuild their country.Japan heartily welcomes the cease-fire recently achieved in the Iran-Iraq conflict and strongly hopes that Security Council resolution 598 (1987) will be fully implemented as soon as possible  with the withdrawal of forces  the release of prisoners of war and the comprehensive  just and honourable settlement of all outstanding issues. Japan intends to continue to co-operate fully in the Secretary-General's efforts. At the same time  it will contribute as much as possible to the resolution of that conflict.With regard to the situation in the Middle East  Japan maintains the position that peace must be achieved on the basis of the following principles: Israel's withdrawal from all territories occupied since the 1967 war; recognition of the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people  including the right to establish an independent Palestinian State; and recognition of Israel's right to exist. There are new developments emerging in this area  and expectations are higher than ever before for the attainment of a just  lasting and comprehensive peace. Thus  steadfast efforts by all the parties concerned are now more than ever necessary  and Japan intends to do what it can to support those efforts towards peace. Foreign Minister Uno recently visited the four countries directly concerned - Syria  Jordan  Egypt and Israel - and explained these points to their leaders  as well as to prominent members of the Palestinian community in the occupied territories.The racial discrimination in South Africa is intolerable and must be completely eliminated as soon as possible. But the Government of South Africa is not abolishing its policies of apartheid; on the contrary  it is resorting more and more to repression by force. In concert with the rest of the international community  Japan will continue to maintain its various restrictive measures against South Africa  as well as its active support for the black population there and for the countries in southern Africa.On the issues of Angola and Namibia  Japan is encouraged that discussions among the countries concerned are now under way and hopes that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) will be implemented and a new Namibian State established as soon as possible.As for the question of Western Sahara  my Government sincerely hopes that progress will be made in the dialogue among the parties concerned  in accordance with the Secretary-General's proposal  and that a solution will be found before long.Regarding the situation in Central America  it is most regrettable that the negotiations on a genuine cease-fire in Nicaragua have encountered difficulties  but Japan continues to hope that true peace will be achieved through the steadfast efforts of all concerned.Turning now to the question of Kampuchea  Foreign Minister Uno attended the post-ministerial conference of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) with the dialogue partners this July  where he suggested that any real settlement must include a complete withdrawal of Vietnamese forces  the establishment of a truly independent  neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea and international guarantees regarding the eventual political settlement. At the same time  he reaffirmed Japan's continued support for the efforts of Prince Sihanouk and the ASEAN countries to that end. We hope that the peace process will be further advanced through discussions among the parties concerned.The Government of Japan believes that the problems on the Korean peninsula should be peacefully resolved  primarily through direct dialogue between the south and the north. Japan thus welcomes and supports the flexible and constructive posture demonstrated by the Republic of Korea in President Roh Tae Woo's special declaration on 7 July. Just prior to the start of the Seoul Olympics  Japan lifted the sanctions it had imposed against North Korea last January as an expression of its firm opposition to terrorist activity. This decision was made from a broad perspective with a view to contributing to a more relaxed climate. Japan hopes that the Seoul Olympics  now under way  will be concluded in an atmosphere appropriate to a festival of peace and that they will contribute to the relaxation of tensions in the area. My Government is pleased that arrangements have been made to enable the representatives of both the Republic of Korea and North Korea to address this session of the General Assembly. Moreover  if the south and the north would consider joining the United Nations as a transitional step towards the unification of the peninsula  Japan would welcome and support membership for both as a means of easing tensions and furthering the universality of the Organization.The active and noteworthy efforts of the United Nations towards the resolution of those regional conflicts clearly demonstrate the important role that the Organization has to play in maintaining peace.Looking ahead  I believe it is important that the United Nations  while promoting further moves towards peace and stepping up its peace-keeping efforts  also take measures to prevent the occurrence of disputes. Thus  I very much hope that this session of the General Assembly will adopt the declaration on the prevention of conflicts proposed by Japan and five other countries with the aim of strengthening the ability of the Security Council  the General Assembly and the Secretary-General to prevent conflicts before they occur  to remove threats and to settle conflicts at an early stage. It is important that all Member States co-operate so that the purposes of the declaration may be achieved in a dynamic and effective manner.At the same time my Government would like to stress the need for the Security Council better to fulfil its functions as defined in the Charter. It is crucial that all members of the Security Council take a global perspective and  setting aside prejudices and preconceptions  co-operate as one in discharging the Council's duties and supporting the initiatives of the Secretary-General. Its permanent members  in the light of their special privileges  have an especially important responsibility in that regard. Only then will parties to a conflict heed the counsel of the United Nations; only then will the way be opened to a peaceful settlement. As a non-permanent member  Japan is working assiduously to find solutions to the various issues before the Security Council  and even after its term expires Japan will continue to work with equal diligence to enable the Security Council to realize fully its lofty purpose.Japan will extend its fullest support to the resolution of regional conflicts in various parts of the world and to United Nations efforts to that end. This is consistent with Japan's policy as a nation of peace to spare no effort in the cause of international peace and stability.Specifically  Japan will first of all continue its efforts to provide  to the extent possible  financial support to peace-keeping operations undertaken within the international framework  above all in the framework of the United Nations.Secondly  Japan will strengthen its co-operation not only in terms of financial support but by supplying personnel in fields it deems appropriate. Recently  civilian personnel from Japan have been participating in the United Nations observer teams in Afghanistan and in Iran and Iraq. We are also studying the possibility of co-operating in such fields as election monitoring  transportation  telecommunications and medical care.Thirdly  Japan plans to step up the various types of its assistance to persons who have become refugees as a result of conflicts. I am pleased on this occasion to pledge an initial contribution for assistance to Afghan refugees equivalent to $60 million to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  the World Food Programme and other United Nations agencies. In making that contribution  Japan is also responding to the appeal issued in June by the Secretary-General. Recognizing that  as noted in the Secretary-General's appeal  Afghan refugee operations are extremely costly  Japan will consider a further contribution through  for instance  the United Nations Afghanistan Emergency Fund. In addition it is studying the possibility of providing personnel in medical and other fields to help Afghan refugees return home.Fourthly  Japan intends to do everything it can to help the countries that have been involved in armed conflicts in various parts of the world to recover from the devastation of war  achieve economic recovery and reconstruction  restore stability and improve the living standards of their peoples once the conflicts are over.Another task as we approach the twenty-first century  one that is inseparable from the quest for peace  is that of disarmament.If arms control and disarmament are to contribute to true peace and stability worldwide  it is imperative that all countries work together so that their legitimate security requirements can be met at the lowest possible level of armament. Only when the bilateral arms control and disarmament efforts between the United States and the Soviet Union are synergistically combined with the multilateral efforts of the United Nations  the Conference on Disarmament and other forums will global arms control and disarmament be possible.There is no disputing the imperative of nuclear disarmament. A comprehensive nuclear-test ban should be seen as an important part of that imperative  and efforts should be made to find realistic ways to achieve it. At the recent special session devoted to disarmament. Prime Minister Takeshita announced plans to convene an international conference in Japan on the establishment of an international nuclear-test verification network  and discussions are now under way with a view to holding the conference as early as next spring. Looking ahead to the fourth review conference of the parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  to be held in 1990  I should like on this occasion to stress once again the need to expand and strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime  an urgent task facing us at this time.As reported by the Secretary-General  most recently on 19 August  there have been instances where chemical weapons were used. These are weapons against humanity. They should never under any circumstances be used. In his address before this Assembly on Monday  President Reagan proposed that a conference of the parties to the Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of chemical weapons be convened in order to strengthen the Protocol's effectiveness. My Government welcomes this initiative. At the same time  Japan will work even more vigorously for the earliest possible conclusion of the negotiations now under way in the Conference on Disarmament on a treaty on a total ban on chemical weapons.One of the greatest challenges facing mankind as we approach the twenty-first century is the achievement of economic growth in developing countries. If that goal is to be realized  it is essential that developing and industrialized countries alike co-operate in recognition that the world economy is in fact a single entity. In order to expand systematically its official development assistance  Japan intends within a five-year target period to raise its share of total official development assistance disbursements made by the countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to a level commensurate with the size of its economy in relation to the economies of other countries of the Committee. Japan is therefore working to raise the level of its official development assistance to more than 350 billion over the next five-year period beginning in 1988  which is double the official development assistance it disbursed during the previous half decade. It is further trying steadily to increase the ratio of its official development assistance to its gross national product  and further to expand its grant assistance to least developed countries.At the same time  Japan continues to enhance its assistance to those developing countries which are burdened with heavy external indebtedness and other problems. This is demonstrated  for example  by the fact that more than 70 per cent of the projects under a targeted $20-billion resource-recycling plan announced in 1987 to promote the flow of resources to developing countries have already been implemented. On the issue of debt relief  Japan has decided to broaden the scope and application of traditional measures by extending to least developed countries grant assistance equivalent to the amount repaid on total loan aid of $5.5 billion which was committed to those countries between fiscal year 1978 and 1987.The countries of sub-Saharan Africa have long been afflicted with economic stagnation  and their plight continues to deserve special consideration. Japan has vigorously supported these African nations through a series of measures such as: the extension of approximately $500 million in non-project  untied grant assistance for the three-year period starting from fiscal year 1987; the financial recycling plan and debt-relief measures just described; and co-operation through relevant international agencies.On the other hand  the smooth transfer of capital and technology from industrialized countries is crucial to the development of developing countries. I believe it is important that developing countries make further efforts to create the conditions necessary to attract private-sector investment while trying to avoid the environmental and other problems that have accompanied economic growth in industrialized countries. Determined as a matter of basic policy to contribute to a better world  Japan intends to continue to co-operate with efforts to resolve the problems facing developing countries. The United Nations has made steady progress over the years  for example in extending co-operation to developing countries and in such fields as human rights and humanitarian assistance. Regrettably  however  it must be admitted that the debates on many issues have not always been productive  and that inefficiencies have developed as a result of the excessive expansion and increased complexity of the Organization.  There has also been a tendency to politicise unduly problems that should more rightly be considered as technical problems belonging to economic  social  cultural or other fields. As the United Nations regains its dynamism  I should like to make one comment that may accelerate this welcome momentum. In 1985  Japan proposed the establishment of a group of high-level intergovernmental experts to promote administrative and financial reform in an effort to strengthen the functioning of the United Nations. It did so not merely to restructure the Secretariat and reduce the number of United Nations posts  but also to conduct a review of the United Nations and its operations  so as to maximize the benefits accruing from its activities. The reforms recommended by the Group in its report  which gained wide support among Member States desiring revitalization of the United Nations are being implemented. Let us take these efforts even further in order to create a United Nations that functions more effectively.At the same time  I should like to emphasize the need for further improvements in the organization and functioning of the United Nations in the economic and social fields so that it can truly respond to the needs of the international community. Japan will contribute to the best of its ability towards this end. There is one important point that needs to be made in this connection. The fact is that the United Nations faces a chronic financial crisis. In view of this serious situation in Match of this year Japan made a special contribution of $20 million to support United Nations activities  particularly peacemaking and peace-keeping operations in connection with the situation in Afghanistan and the Iran-Iraq conflict. Today  when financial demands in the field of United Nations peace-keeping operations are sharply increasing  this financial deficit poses a major obstacle to the revitalisation of the United Nations.Clearly  the cause of this deficit is the non-payment by Member states of .their obligatory contributions. Among 159 Member States  it is estimated that nearly 70 of them will be at least partially in arrears in the payment of their dues at the end of this year. This will amount to approximately $450 million. It is thus essential that we move urgently to redress this situation  taking into account the serious implications of the problem. In this connection  Japan welcomes the positive attitude which the United States and other countries have recently demonstrated regarding the payment of their outstanding dues  and strongly hopes that they will pay in full as soon as possible.In the aftermath of the Second World War  the world placed its hopes for peace and prosperity in the United Nations  which has subsequently achieved considerable success in many areas. However  it must be admitted that in some ways the Organization has been unable to live up to the high expectations held of it. Today  almost half a century since the United Nations was founded  its structure must be improved so that it will respond appropriately to the changing needs and realities of the international community. An organization without the capacity to evolve can only wither. With little more than 11 years left until the year 2000  Japan  with a vision of the United Nations as it should be  hopes to work together with other Member States  as well as with non-governmental organizations involved in United Nations affairs  to consider this issue seriously and take concrete actions towards realizing our goal.As the only truly universal international organization  the United Nations will have an increasingly important role to play as it continues  now and in the future  to shoulder for mankind the burdens of maintaining world peace and prosperity and of fostering a rich cultural life. This year marks the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and the world has ever greater expectations of United Nations activities for the protection of human rights. It is thus essential that all Member States support the United Nations and do their best to enhance its activities. Japan is determined to continue to make every effort in accordance with its International Co-operation Initiative  which I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks today  vigorously to support the United Nations as a dedicated Member on which the Organization and the other Member States can truly depend."
"76",3689,"KEN",43,1988,"ï»¿Mr. President  I wish at the outset to convey to you the best wishes of the President of the Republic of Kenya  the Honourable Daniel T. Arap Mai  and his hope for the success of the deliberations at the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I should also like to convey to you my delegation's and ray own warm congratulations on your election to the challenging high office of the presidency of this session. Your well known diplomatic skills and wide experience guarantee the successful outcome of our discussions in this body. I pledge to you the full co-operation and support of my entire delegation in fulfilling these expectations. I also wish to convey to your predecessor  the Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic  Mr. Peter Florin  my delegation's appreciation of the exemplary manner in which he presided over the work of the last session of the Assembly.The fundamental principle underlying the Charter of the United Nations is the maintenance of international peace and security. This principal objective cannot be realized without effective leadership. In the recent past the United Nations has been seen by many as having a marginal influence in solving the critical issues of the day. Indeed  the very existence of the Organization has been critically questioned. However  looking at recent events of the year  the United Nations has made important contributions to resolving regional conflicts. The cease-fire in the war between Iraq and Iran has been realized through United Nations efforts. The withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan has come about as a result of United Nations intervention. The decision by Viet Nam to withdraw its troops from Kampuchea was prompted by repeated calls by the United Nations for Viet Nam to do so. In southern Africa  Angola  Cuba and South Africa are working on an agreement that will start the process towards the independence of Namibia in the framework of United Nations resolution 43 5 (1978). While mindful of the tension between the super-Powers  we can attribute this list of successes by our Organization to the patient  strong and effective leadership given by our Secretary-General. I therefore wish to pay a warm tribute to him and to his staff for these resounding successes.Kenya has always stated its conviction that resolution 435 (1978) remains the only basis for Namibia's independence. Therefore  while we are gratified to see the important understanding reached between Angola and Cuba on the question of the deployment of the latter's troops in Angola  we continue to hold the view that Namibia's independence should not and must not be linked to the issue of Cuba's troops in Angola  The United Nations should now proceed with the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) without any further unnecessary delays.With regard to South Africa itself  we remain gravely concerned that  despite continuous international appeals and pressures  the racist regime in that country has not released Nelson Mandela and all other political detainees  as demanded by the United Nations through its numerous resolutions. Moreover  the decision of the Pretoria regime to place that country under a state of emergency belies its oft-repeated assurances of commitment to real change and democratic rule in South Africa. By now it must be clear to all that the true intention of the minority racist regime in South Africa is the perpetuation of its illegal and oppressive policy of apartheid  which the international community has long declared illegal and a crime against humanity.South Africa must therefore cease and desist from its cunning manoeuvres aimed at delaying the eradication of apartheid by instituting cosmetic changes in the name of so-called reform. Kenya calls on this body and peoples of goodwill everywhereÂ· to continue to exert pressure on the Pretoria regime to abandon apartheid. Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners and detainees in South Africa must be released unconditionally and immediately so that they can participate fully in the democratic process of their country. South Africa should also immediately lift the state of emergency and its ban on liberation movements operating both inside and outside the country  and refrain from its acts of destabilization against its neighbours and other African countries in the subregion.The large system of apartheid has made many South Africans suffer. A large number have left their homes to seek refuge in neighbouring States. South Africa continues its threats to destabilize neighbouring countries  causing mass movements of displaced persons within those States and outside and therefore further increasing the volume of refugees.In order to alleviate the plight of the refugees and the burden imposed on the States hosting them  the Member States of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) agreed on the need for burden sharing in resettling the refugees. They did this in consonance with the international community  which resolved after the Second World War to contribute to the cost of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees. However  in recognition of the deteriorating refugee situation in southern Africa  the OAU Council of Ministers  at its fortieth meeting  in 1987  called for a conference on the problem. One of the main aims of the Conference was to formulate ideas on how to assist front-line States. The co-operation received from the international community  and particularly the Government of Norway  which made the Conference possible  has been encouraging. The implementation of the agreed programme and plan of action will require the co-operation of all Member States. The international community is also urged to look into the plight of these refugees  because their needs  which are unique  have to be scrutinized  appraised and well understood in order to provide them with the appropriate forms of assistance.The war between the two fraternal States of Iran and Iraq resulted in the loss of numerous lives and untold suffering for many families in both countries. Kenya hailed the two countries agreement to a cease-fire with effect from 20 August 1988. While commending the leaders of the two nations for their courage and statesmanship in agreeing to halt the bloody conflict  our deepest gratitude goes to our Secretary-General  under whose auspices the two countries were able to come to the negotiating table in a bid to resolve their differences. Kenya is proud of its modest contribution  in connection with a United Nations observer team  to the quest for a lasting peace between the two countries  with which it enjoys cordial relations.While we observe some signs of relaxation of tension in various parts of the world  in the Middle East the signs are in a different direction. The uprising of the Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territories clearly demonstrates the frustration of those people  who have lived under military occupation for more than 20 years. Israel  in its mistaken belief  has resorted to excessive use of force to suppress demonstrations. The use of force cannot be the answer. Kenya has said time and again that no lasting peace in the area can be achieved until the legitimate rights of the Palestinians are recognized  including their right to self-determination and to a State of their own. We recognize the rights of all States in the region  including Israel  to exist within internationally recognized boundaries. We therefore call upon Israel to withdraw from all the Arab land occupied since 1967  as this is the only path to the achievement of a durable and lasting peace.In Central America  unlike other regions where the peace process is gathering momentum  we note with concern that very little progress has been realized despite the efforts of the Contadora and Support Groups. We therefore call upon all the States of the region to redouble their efforts in the search for peace in the light of the current favourable international political climate.In the Korean peninsula  we are encouraged by the recent developments in favour of a dialogue between the two parties. We therefore call for continued constructive dialogue between the two Koreas towards a peaceful settlement of the problem.The continuing arms race remains a major threat to the survival of mankind. More clearly than at any other stage in history  the entire international community is now in agreement regarding the serious danger posed on our planet by enormous arsenals of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. It was against this background that we had hoped that the fifteenth special session of the General Assembly - the third special session devoted to disarmament - held in June this year  would provide an opportunity to agree on a course of action that could give further momentum to the disarmament process. Unfortunately  the session ended without reaching agreement on a concluding document  in spite of the international climate provided by the signing of a Treaty between the two super-Powers. However  although no agreement was achieved by the special session  we must look ahead and use the little that was accomplished as a basis for future efforts. Good proposals were made at that session and should be examined for future adoption.In the recent months we have observed some very encouraging signs of easing of tensions in most parts of the world. The ongoing negotiations on arms reduction between the two super-powers have demonstrated that significant process in disarmament can be attained if there is genuine trust. In this regard  we welcome the recently concluded Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles.The continent of Africa has undergone  in the course of its history  a series of unforgivable and humiliating experiences  such as slavery  balkanization  colonization  economic plundering and exploitation  to mention but a few in this sad catalogue. However  as if this were not enough punishment of Mother Africa  another scourge has been inflicted on Africa during the last few months. I am referring to the recent sordid revelations that toxic and radioactive wastes have been callously dumped in some African countries by certain companies from industrialized countries. This was and still is an outrageous criminal act. This ""garbage imperialism"" poses a serious and very harmful threat not only to mankind but also to the global environment. It is quite ironic that while billions of dollars are currently being spent on the cleaning of the environment all over the world  some immoral companies have the temerity to dump toxic wastes  knowing full well the end result of this despicable action. The international community should condemn this callous action and take decisive measures at the subregional and regional levels to enact laws to punish severely the perpetrators of this vicious action.As the 1980s come to an end  the global economy continues to be in a sorry state  despite some growth rates in the industrialized countries and in South and East Asia. Large international payment imbalances persist and there is a risk of instability in stock markets  exchange rates and interest rates. This deteriorating situation is a direct consequence of continuing divergences in the macro-economic policies of the industrialized countries. Unless there are significant changes in these policies  this may lead to a world-wide economic recession.The economic conditions in the developing countries  particularly those with heavy debt problems and those in Sub-Saharan Africa continue to worsen  despite their stabilization  adjustment efforts and fiscal austerity measures. There are no prospects of improvement and the outlook for the future remains quite uncertain. These countries are likely to be plunged into a prolonged period of declining per capita income leading to severe poverty and socio-political unrest.International economic relations continue to be characterized by inequalities in the share of global wealth between the developed and the developing countries. This has been made worse by the unilateral and inequitable economic policies of many of the industrialized countries. In the past it was taken for granted that once recovery in economic growth in the industrialized countries was on stream  it would be rapid enough to sustain development in developing countries  and that the transformation of financial and productive structures by the industrialized countries would not be disruptive to development efforts elsewhere  particularly in developing countries.This approach does not seem to work at all. The slow-down in the world economy in the 1980s has demonstrated that the imbalances among industrial market economies constitute a serious threat to developing countries. The debt crisis  which was precipitated by the slow-down in world trade  deteriorating terms of trade in commodities  the decline in imports from developing countries  the unanticipated sharp and persistent increases in interest rates  and the swing to a net negative transfer of resources serve as a clear warning that in order for the global economy to recover and be on a sustainable growth trend  the benefits of interdependence must be mutual and self-reinforcing. The current vicious circle of poverty and waste in the third world - where over two thirds of the human population and abundant natural resources are to be found - must be broken in order to release the potential for generating global wealth for the benefit of all.Despite the slow-down in growth  many developing ' entries are continuing their efforts to improve social conditions under drastic fiscal austerity. There are however limits to such efforts under the present unfair international trading system  the negative transfer of resources and the burden of debt. The cost in terms of environmental degradation  waste in human and natural resources  and declining incomes threatens human well-being and the very survival of life on our planet Earth. As the United Nations Children's Fund has observed with regard to the possible nature of a new international development strategy for the 1990s  the prospects for slow growth or stagnation in developing countriesÂ·. ""... present a major challenge to the world community as it prepares for the 1990s. This is especially so if our objective for the years 2000 is to overcome the worst aspects of mass poverty: widespread malnutrition  hunger  ignorance and the deaths of nearly 40 000 small children daily ... . If these trends continue  per capita income levels in the least developed countries in the year 2000 will still be well below that of 1980 and  for many African countries  even below that of 1970  30 years earlier.""According to the World Bank  in .con teas t to other developing regions  sub-Saharan Africa has shown consistently weak economic performance over an entire generation. To make matters worse  during the 1980s per capita income has fallen to about three quarters of the level reached by the end of the 1970s. Africaâs poor economic performance has now begun to erode the region's productive base. By the mid-1980s  gross investment levels in many countries were too low to maintain the capital stock. Consequently  healthcare and education  among other things  have deteriorated.African Governments  individually and collectively  ace committed and have undertaken comprehensive reform measures to improve the economic performance of their countries. However  the severe structural economic imbalances and the vulnerability of African economies to worsening external environment have had  and continue to have  a serious negative effect on those efforts.It was in consideration of this reality that at the special session of the General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa held in 1986  African Governments submitted a Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990  which was adopted with the international community making a commitment to respond to Africa's efforts. At the conclusion of the recently concluded mid-term review of the implementation of the Programme  it was acknowledged that  under severe austerity measures  the majority of African countries had undertaken reform and structural adjustment measures aimed at improving economic performance to bring about accelerated recovery and lay the foundations for sustained development. It was also recognized that the reform efforts of the African countries had not been matched by international measures to sustain them and that the African economic performance had deteriorated further.Although the international community has taken some commendable initiatives in support of Africa's efforts with regard to debt relief and resource flows  the magnitude and nature of the African economic crisis calls for increased support and immediate vigorous translation of commitments into concrete action in order to produce the desired results. On their part  the African countries have renewed their commitment to these reforms and structural adjustments in order to improve their economic performance and the well-being of their people. Kenya appeals to all concerned  individually and collectively  to take all necessary initiatives and to make every effort to carry out the recommendations made in order to accelerate the full and timely implementation of the Programme.Finally  Kenya would like to join other Member States in congratulating the United Nations p-ace-keeping forces on winning the Nobel Peace Prize this year in recognition of their services in the maintenance of peace and security. With the lowering of tensions between the super-Powers  the United Nations is entering a new phase that is ideal for revival of the multilateralism for which all of us have been yearning. We have come to realize and equally appreciate the indispensability of the United Nations in our world of today. In this regard  we must have a strong United Nations to which all Member States are committed. Kenya  a staunch believer in the United Nations  will not be found wanting in rendering its unflinching support to our Organization."
"77",3760,"KHM",43,1988,"ï»¿Sir  it is a pleasant duty for me to address to you  on behalf of the  people and the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and on my own behalf  our sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-third session. Your political and diplomatic experience and your personal abilities constitute pledge for the successful outcome of our work.I also wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  for the skilful manner in which he carried out his important duties in presiding over the General Assembly at the forty-second session.Lastly  I take special pleasure in paying a warn tribute to our very distinguished Secretary-General  Mr. Peres de Cuellar  who my people and Government continue to held in the highest esteem. I am pleased to have this opportunity to pay a tribute to the tireless and meritorious efforts he has unceasingly made for peace throughout the world  which have helped to strengthen the confidence we have always had in him. His faith in the Charter and his dedication to the fulfilment of his mandate  which is complex  arduous and often thankless  have done much to strengthen the role of the world Organization in the maintenance of international peace and security.Some 10 years ago  on 25 December 1978  the Vietnamese troops of aggression occupied by country  Cambodia. Since 1982  the date of the formation of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  Prince Norodom Sihanouk  as President of Democratic Kampuchea  has emphatically denounced the acts of coercion committed by the Vietnamese occupation troops against the unfortunate Khmer people.There can be no political solution for the Cambodian situation unless Viet Nam  sincerely wishes to reach a negotiated settlement with the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and desists from delaying tactics. In order to block the  process of a political settlement of the Cambodian situation  Viet Nam has sought to link the withdrawal of its troops from Cambodia to the non-return of the Khmers Rouges to power and the cessation of all aid to the armed forces of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea.The present situation in Cambodia was brought about by the invasion and occupation of that country by Vietnamese troops  who are still there today. Our- top priority  which is also of the United Nations resolutions on Kampuchea  continues to be the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops from Cambodia  whether their presence is officially acknowledged or disguised. As for the other problems  they are internal matters which will have to be resolved among the Cambodian parties. The solution has already been implicitly mentioned In the resolutions adopted annually since 1979 at the United Nations: self-determination of the Cambodian people  through the organization of free general elections without pressure or coercion.A genuine peaceful solution can be arrived at only in the following conditions} first  withdrawal of all Vietnamese occupation forces from Cambodian territory  which roust be carried out not unilaterally but within the framework of a general negotiated agreement  under international supervision and in keeping with a precise time-tableÂ·  secondly  the dismantling of the Phnom Penh regime installed by Viet Nam and the State of Democratic Kampuchea} thirdly  the formation of a Quadripartite Provisional Government of National Reconciliation} fourthly  the establishment of machinery for international supervision in the form of a United Nations commission or any other international commission or whatever other measure may be necessary  such as an international force for the maintenance of peace and security  and  fifthly  the organization of authentically free general elections under international supervision. Peace in Cambodia depends on national reconciliation based on equality among all the political parties of the coalition and on respect for human rights and fundamental freedom  within the framework of a liberal democratic government. Thus  it is not a question of trying to isolate  still less  e1ininate  anyone. We are talking about a government of national reconciliation  that is  the Quadripartite Provisional Government of National Reconciliation  whose task it would to prepare and organise general and free elections under international supervision.After the general agreement on the total withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia  an international conference will be convened with the participation of all the countries concerned  the five permanent members of the Security Council and the United Nations Secretary-General. That conference will adopt all necessary measures to guarantee the agreement  as well as the independence and neutrality of Cambodia and prevent any possible return of Vietnamese forces and the illegal and violent seizure of power by one of the Cambodian parties.The Jakarta informal Meeting  which was held from 25 to 28 July 1988  was the first of Its kind to bring together the three Cambodian parties of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  that of Phnom Penh and Viet Nam  and also the other parties in the region concerned with the Cambodian conflict  who were able to exchange views  we hope that the Working Group  which is to met soon in Jakarta  will prove able to achieve concrete results.The Khmer people was deeply affected by the words of compassion towards them spoken by the President of the United States  Mr. Ronald Reagan  and also the words of solicitude spoken by Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China  and other heads of delegations of friendly countries.To return to a normal situation and restore peace  security and justice in any country  the total withdrawal of the Vietnamese occupation troops has become an imperative necessity. However  for greater credibility  I have proposed that this withdrawal be negotiated and internationally monitored. National reconciliation will have to take the form of the establishment of a quadripartite provisional government. This Quadripartite Provisional Government of National Reconciliation must be formed on a new basis  because the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea cannot agree to take as a basis the pro-Vietnamese communist regime of Phnom Penh.In order to facilitate the formation of the Quadripartite Provisional Government of National Reconciliation I have proposed to the two other parties in my Government the changing of the name of Democratic Kampuchea and its flag and national anthem. His Royal Highness Sawdeoh Norodom Sihanouk has already given his agreement in principle to these changes. I believe that these changes - or rather this return to the national names and symbols adopted by the whole Cambodian people - are going to be a prelude to national reconciliation  a prelude to the new national unity that is needed for the restoration of peace in Cambodia and for the establishment of a some of peace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia  in keeping with the wishes of the member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and  in particular  to the ending of the sufferings of our people. I take this opportunity to reiterate on behalf of the Khmer people  my respectful gratitude to His Majesty the King of Thailand for the kind compassion he has shown our refugee compatriots and to His Majesty's Government for the hospitality accorded to then in border camps.We are grateful also to all the friendly countries that have given constant  valuable support in all spheres to the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and all the Khmer people in their national liberation struggle against the Vietnamese invaders and occupying forces.Ws are grateful to the Secretary-General for the personal interest he has taken in the Cambodian question  and for his tireless quest  in the framework of his mandate and assisted by his Special Representative  Mr. Rafeeuddin Ahmed  for a just and lasting solution to the problem of Kampuchea in conformity with the Charter and relevant resolutions of the United Nations.I must say again how grateful we are for the important role being played by the United Nations and the Secretary-General  and extend our gratitude also to his Special Representative  Mr. S.A.M. S. Kibria and the Director of the United Nations Border Relief Operation (UHBRO)  Mr. Y. Y  Kim  and all the staff  who have proved so able in helping those of our unfortunate compatriots who are considered to be displaced persons.If Cambodian society is too be truly democratised  if human and individual tights are to be respected  it is essential to promote the education of Khmer children at all levels  both in border camps and within the country.The thrust of sustained  common efforts by the entire international community  with the United Nations as catalyst  to prevent a nuclear holocaust has led to recognition of the fact that a nuclear war can never be won and must never be fought. The world has welcomed the ratification by the two super-Powers of the  Treaty on the elimination of their intermediate-range and short-rangÂ· land-based missiles and the improvement in East-West relations. The withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan under United Nations supervision and within the framework of a signed agreement the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq after eight years of war  the withdrawal of South African forces from Angola and the prospect of the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  on Namibia  and the acceptanceÂ· by the parties to the Western Sahara conflict of a peace plan submitted by the United Nations have led to some relaxation of regional tension and strengthened the hopes that world tension will gradually ease.However  the genuine  persistent political will of all and the constant vigilance of all countries and people which push peace and justice are necessary if further progress towards the implementation of international peace and security is to be made.International peace and security continue to be threatened by numerous local and regional conflicts generated by policies of power  domination and expansion that put under foot the purposes and principles of the Charter  including the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States  respect for the right of peoples to self-determination  and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Until conflicts are resolved on the basis of respect for the principles of the united Nations Charter  it is illusory to hope for a climate of international trust conducive to the elimination or reduction of armaments.In Afghanistan  the heroic struggle of the Afghan people and its mujahidin  combined with international pressure and the tireless efforts of Pakistan and the United Nations and its Secretary-General  finally collapsed Soviet forces to withdraw from that country. But that doe  not mean the war is over. By continuing  through its military assistance  and advisers  to keep alive the regime it has installed in Kabul  the Soviet Union persists in its interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan  prevents the Afghan people from exercising its right of self-determination  and continues to fuel tension in that region of southern Asia. The Afghan people and its mujahidin are being compelled to pursue their just struggle to restore Afghanistan's independence  sovereignty  non-aligned status and territorial integrity. The international community must continue its assistance and support in that struggle.We who are fighting for the same cause reaffirm our complete solidarity with and strong support for the Afghan people and its mujahidin in their valiant struggle until the attainment of their noble objectives. We wish also to pay a heartfelt tribute to the Government and people of Pakistan for their great compassion for and generous assistance to the Afghan refugees  and for their important contribution to the efforts that led to the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan.In Asia  the mounting tension in Korea makes clear the increasing urgency of adopting practical measures that will make possible the independent  peaceful reunification of the country. In this connection  it is important to prevent a military confrontation and reduce the tension between the two parts of the country by the adoption of a declaration of non-aggression. We welcomed the negotiations last August at Panmunjon between parliamentary delegations from the North and the South  and are pleased that these will be required soon.Still in Asia  we assure our dose neighbours to the north  our Lao brothers and sisters  who for years have endured and struggled against repression and coercion under the Vietnamese yoke of our unswerving support and fraternal solidarity. In the  MiddleÂ· East the situation has deteriorated everywhere Â·. In the occupied Arab territories  the violence and high passions that have been growing for months are clear proof that it is vitally necessary for a negotiated settlement of the entire Middle East and Palestinian problem to be pursued within the framework of an international conference  under United Nations auspices  and with the participation of the representative of the Palestinian people  the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). Peace can be restored only through the exercise by the Palestinian people of its inalienable national rights  with strict respect for the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of foreign territory by force and for the right of all States of the region to live and coexist in peace and security.In Lebanon  despite the presence of United Nations forces  foreign armed intervention continues to fan the flames of discord. It is of the highest importance that all foreign troops be withdrawn from Lebanon and that the Lebanese people finally regain the cohesion and national unity that will enable it to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its country  restore peace  and rebuild the economy.The cease-fire between Iran and Iraq has permitted a relaxation of tension in the region. Without underestimating the considerable and numerous problems that remain unresolved  it may be said that the cease-fire  which was achieved thanks to the praiseworthy  dedicated efforts off the Security Council and the Secretary-General  opens the way for the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We hope that with political will on all sides it will be possible to move towards a settlement of that painful fratricidal conflict. In Africa  the economic situation remains a source of great concern. We reaffirm to all brother African countries and people our complete solidarity and assure them of our war warmest congratulations and deep admiration for their courageous and noble efforts to implement Africaâs Priority Programme for Economic Recovery 1986-1990. But those efforts are hampered by the problem of external debt and the excessive debt-servicing burden. Moreover  Sudan in particular Khartoum  has been stricken by unprecedented floods which have caused widespread devastation  and sub-Saharan countries continue to face drought  flood  plagues of locustÂ· and conflicts  with the consequent millions of refugees  malnutrition and famine.We call upon the international community  especially developed creditor countries  to support and adopt the measureÂ· advocated by the Organisation of African Unity to resolve Africa's external-debt crisis  including the convening of an international conference on this problem. We should emphasize that the economic and social crisis of the African countries has been further aggravated by the rising tension in southern Africa which has had harmful consequences throughout the continent. The aggravation of tensions is due to the policy of apartheid and the illegal occupation of Namibia by the Pretoria regime  which utterly disregarding universal condemnation of its actions  has not only refused to release Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners  but is also even further intensifying its bloody repression  prolonging the state of emergency  condemning to death and threatening to execute anti-apartheid blacks in South Africa - in particular the Sharpeville Six - mistreating religious figures and banning all the political activity of anti-apartheid organisations  having representatives of South African anti-apartheid movements abroad assassinated  and committing an increasing number of acts of aggression and destabilization against front-line countries. Southern Africa will know peace and stability only when apartheid is eradicated as that will make possible the establishment of a non-racial  democratic government in South Africa and the advent of the independent of Namibia within its territorial integrity.In this respect we believe that the development of the anti-apartheid struggle has amply demonstrated the need for global mandatory-emotions against the Pretoria regime accompanied by a plan of assistance to the front-line States. We ardently trust that the quadripartite negotiations to restore peace in Angola and to eliminate obstacles to the decolonization and independence of Namibia will succeed in compelling South Africa to give effect to Security Council resolution 435 (1973$.Lastly  we whole-heartedly welcome the successes scored by the Government and people of Chad under the guidance of President Hussein Habre in their attempts to consolidate the independence and sovereignty of Chad  to restore their territorial integrity and to embark upon their reconstruction of their country in peace stability and harmony with all its neighbours. We renew our fraternal solidarity to them.In Central America the situation continues to be grave notwithstanding the progress achieved in the field of verification of the obligations arising from the Esquipulas II agreements. This progress highlights the real possibilities of establishing peace and democracy in the region through dialogue and negotiation  Ð¨ wish to pay a tribute to the five Presidents of the Central American States who declared in San Jose their political willingness to press ahead with dialogue and negotiations in order to fulfil the Guatemala commitment and we welcome the work done by the Contadora Group and the Support Group  which decided to continue to co-operate in this process of peace and democracy in this region. This is the only road to peace and stability and the only way to preserve the interests of the region as a  hole.Now that the Organisation is preparing to celebrate at the end of this year the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  now that the hope of better times is burgeoning with the approach of the new year and the dawn of a new century  and with the award of the Nobel Peace Prise to the United Nations peace-keeping forces  an award that was very well merited  let us hope that the millions of our human brothers who are seeking change and renewal in their lives will see their dreams come true thanks to the efforts of the United Nations and its Secretary-General in what the Gitanjali  the lyrical offering of the Bengali poet  described so aptly in the following words:""In this paradise of freedom  ay fattier  let ay homeland awake."""
"78",3801,"KNA",43,1988,"ï»¿I warmly welcome this opportunity to extend to you. Sir  the congratulations of the delegation of St. Kitts and Nevis on your election to the eminent post of President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. For the Government and peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean it is always a source of immense satisfaction to witness the presidency entrusted to one chosen from among us - and all the more to one as able as you. My delegation places absolute confidence in your abilities successfully to guide the deliberations of this body and pledges its full co-operation.May I also heartily congratulate the outgoing President  Mr. Peter Florin  on his skilful guidance of the work of the General Assembly during the past year. The task was undoubtedly challenging  but he met every challenge with competence  renewed spirit and dexterity.It is with a profound sense of admiration that  at this point  I pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his untiring efforts exerted in the pursuit of peaceful resolutions of the persistent and sometimes escalating conflicts that continue to beset the world community.We have listened year after year as increasing numbers of disputes between nations and aggravating world problems have been brought to the attention of this body. Indeed  over the past 43 years of its existence the United Nations has had its lofty principles challenged by intense local  regional and international disputes that have increased sorrow to mankind and threatened to annihilate whole peoplesÂ·  by deep-seated ideological differences that have compartmentalized the world and vitiated against international co-operation in solving international problems  by persistent underdevelopment  abject poverty and acts of inhumanity that have made a mockery of human dignity  the right to freedom and a better standard of life. Often Member States express disappointment in the United Nations when solutions to our problems appear unattainable. But perhaps such disappointment results from unrealistic expectations from the Organization. For it can achieve only as much as its Member States permit it to achieve. The success of our concerted efforts to resolve global disputes is highly dependent on international dialogue and conciliation. It is the role of this body to foster such dialogue and such conciliation. However  the responsibility for good-neighbourliness and international peace and security remains that of each nation State.My delegation is particularly encouraged by the noticeably improved international political climate  which has provided a favourable ambiance for the conduct of fruitful negotiations this year. Certain recent developments identify 1988 as a diplomatic and political watershed year  heralding long-awaited compliance with United Nations resolutions on prolonged conflicts.Within the category of world events that respond to dialogue fits the recent agreement on arms limitation and disarmament. The ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  which calls for a 50 per cent reduction of the strategic nuclear arsenals of the United States and the USSR signifies a major achievement for the entire world in the process of arms limitation and disarmament. We are all aware that divergent positions plagued the agreement  but we are heartened by the display of political will between the two major military Powers to reach an agreement. This movement in disarmament could augur well for the long-range goal of comprehensive disarmament called for by the General Assembly. Its prospects no longer seem as remote as they were a few years ago. My delegation continues to agitate for comprehensive disarmament  which includes not only nuclear weapons but conventional and chemical weapons as well. Let us be conscious that the survival and well-being of future generations is the responsibility of us all - nuclear and non-nuclear States alike.Similarly  the situation in the Persian Gulf gives us cause to be optimistic about the prospects for peace in that troubled region. Just a few months ago the Islamic Republic of Iran announced its formal acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). That decision was welcomed by Member States as it signified that a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq could now be affected and negotiations to bring about lasting peace in the region could be set in motion. My delegation reflects sadly on the thousands of lives lost and the millions of dollars worth of damage that resulted from the nine-year conflict  and remains grieved at the fact that the suffering and loss were allowed to escalate to such proportions. I trust that the decision of both Iraq and Iran to abide by the Security Council resolution is now reflective of a desire to coexist peacefully.The role of the Secretary-General in this initiative must be lauded. He drew on his vast and proved diplomatic skills and displayed tenacity and endurance while mediating the complex negotiations that led to acceptance by both nations. My delegation would like to encourage him in his efforts to pursue this initiative to the desired goal of a stable and lasting peace.The situation in Afghanistan also shows signs of responding to international dialogue. For some eight years the General Assembly and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights adopted strongly worded resolutions condemning the foreign occupation of Afghanistan. For eight years the international community kept the pressure on the occupying country by calling for the withdrawal from Afghanistan of all foreign troops. Those actions were supplemented by the efforts of former Under-Secretary-General Diego Cordovez. At last  this year  the Geneva accord was signed by all parties involved  and today troops are being withdrawn from Afghanistan. My delegation is only too aware that the real settlement of the problem lies in the hands of the Afghan people. Theirs is the task of establishing the Government of their choice and undertaking the restructuring of their country.We regard with optimism the prospects for resolution of the status of Western Sahara. St. Kitts and Nevis notes with satisfaction the manifestation by both POLIS AR 10 and the Kingdom of Morocco of the political will and co-operation required in order to bring a peaceful end to this conflict which has persisted for more than a decade. The combined efforts of the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations must be recognized as practical arrangements for a referendum by the Sahraoui people are formulated. My delegation urges both parties to intensify the negotiation process and bring a speedy settlement to the conflict. By the same token  my delegation regards with cautious optimism the talks between the Governments concerned to bring an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia by South African troops. We have always supported the United Nations Flan for the Independence of Namibia under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization and take this opportunity to reaffirm that support. We must remain firm in our resolve to bring about a liberated and an independent Namibia and take bold initiatives to make it a reality.We renew our call for the United Nations to play a positive role in bringing about reconciliation between South Korea and North Korea. We support member ship in the United Nations for both countries on the Korean peninsula as a positive step to enhancing their dialogue towards reunification within this Organization's structured and sympathetic framework.While we can see rays of hope in several of the areas of conflict  that is not at present the case in the Middle East. Hope for an end to the conflict can lie only in solutions which recognize the rights of the Palestinian people to a well-defined homeland must co-exist with the tight of the people of Israel to live within secure borders. A first step to peace would be for all parties to adhere to the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly on the issue.Â·My Government also shares the view that the convening of the international peace conference on the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations and at the invitation of the Secretary-General and all parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict  would be another appropriate step towards achieving a peaceful  comprehensive and just settlement of the conflict. The Secretary-General is therefore urged to continue his attempts to make the convening of this conference a reality. Another area of continued concern to the international community is the situation in Kampuchea. Hostilities have entered a tenth year and there seems to be no foreseeable end. My delegation stands firmly behind the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly on this question since its thirty-fourth session and awaits their implementation. The restoration and preservation of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kampuchean people as well as their right to determine their own destiny  should continue to be the goal  supported most assuredly by the international community.In our own region  conflicts in Central America have set back the process of economic development. It is commendable that the Governments of Central America have mapped out a plan of action to restore peace and stability to their countries. We applaud the persistent efforts of the Contadora Group. We believe its efforts and those of others in the region deserve the full support of the international community  so that the United Nations objective of turning swords into ploughshares may be achieved.We are deeply concerned about the unstable situation which exists in Haiti. Clearly  political events have made it difficult for meaningful economic development to proceed. We in the region stand ready to assist the people of Haiti as far as is practically possible  and we also invite the attention of the international community.We must recognize the basic truth that social and economic problems have become both a cause and an effect of aggravated political tensions. Peace and development are inextricably intertwined objectives and we cannot achieve the one without the other. In May this year the United Nations approved a special economic plan for Central America which will assist the peoples of that region in restructuring and stabilizing their economies. This is clearly a step in the right direction.My delegation notes the willingness of Belize and Guatemala to enter into dialogue. We call for early ratification of the Cartegena Protocol as a contribution to the lowering of tensions.International political issues constitute but a fraction of our common preoccupations. Continued human rights violations and worsening economic conditions provide equal cause for perplexity and consternation. Chief among our human rights concerns is the total eradication of the evil system of apartheid perpetuated in South Africa. My delegation reiterates its abhorrence of that inhumane system and continues to support the call for comprehensive sanctions to be taken against South Africa.With the many sanctions already imposed  and with the perpetuation of apartheid in the face of them all  countries are prone to question the effectiveness of those measures. We are assured that comprehensive sanctions are working. According to an analysis done by the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers  trade and financial sanctions ate having a debilitating impact on South Africa's economy and this impact would be even more far-reaching were the sanctions themselves more widely adopted and their application tightened and intensified. Further disinvestment programmes must be pursued.On a more positive note  however  in preparation for a free and democratic South Africa the international community needs to address the stabilization and security needs of the front-line States and to offer training to the black people of South Africa so that they may be adequately equipped to accept the task of rebuilding their country. The world's economic situation is another problem of enormous proportions for developing countries. We appear to be caught in a quagmire. A total restructuring of the world economic order is imperative if our goal of world development is to be achieved. We in the developing countries continue to experience relatively slow or negative growth in our economies. Sharp commodity-price declines  unavailability of external sources of finance  adverse terms of trade  debt-re-servicing problems - all still frustrate our economic ambitions. Clearly there is a pressing need to reassess the present international economic order to create greater opportunities for the developing countries to share equally in the world's resources. We must concede that the international achievement of development strategies for the First  Second and Third United Nations Development Decades have been limited. We can only hopes that the development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade will be more fruitful.In the developing countries  however  we must do more than hope. We must seize the opportunity of the current wave of peace initiatives  first  to divert our own energies and resources away from areas of conflict to confront the challenges of development on our own terms and on the basis of our own realities. Then we must challenge the developed countries to engage immediately in meaningful dialogue with us so that significant resources can be diverted from the battlefields and from the silos to improve the housing  the education  the employment opportunities  the infrastructure and the social and economic fabric of the developing countries.Peace must not become an international vacuum signifying only the absence of war. Peace must be a well-spring of opportunity and hope for the young  the elderly  the sick  the handicapped and the poor. Peace must be a powerful force that moves us forward  upward and onward. Peace must inspire us to achieve the greatest heights of humanitarian excellence of which we are capable. I send out a clarion call for peace between East and West to become a harbinger of a new era of co-operation between North and South.In this context  I must issue an appeal for special consideration to be given to the unique problems of island developing countries  a number of highly reputable studies have shown that island developing countries have characteristics distinct from those of developing countries in general. It is essential  therefore  that there be flexibility in designing and supporting development strategies which are appropriate for addressing our special needs. One of our major handicaps is vulnerability to natural disasters  such as hurricanes  from which islands in the Caribbean are especially at risk. Jamaica's devastation by hurricane Gilbert is graphic testimony to this fact. Other problems include: small internal markets  lack of natural resources  heavy dependence on imports and the high per capita cost of building and maintaining economic and social infrastructure. Snail islands lack the critical mass to provide basic services economically for their populations. However  if island people are to enjoy an acceptable quality of life  these services must be provided. Certainly this community of nations cannot accept that the right to basic amenities  to life  to liberty and to the pursuit of happiness is to be enjoyed only by people in large metropolitan societies.Many resolutions have been passed in the General Assembly on island developing countries in the last decade. Let us seize the opportunity of the day and translate these laudable resolutions into effective action.While we have temporised and failed to address seriously the grave economic problems of developing countries  new crises have arisen which threaten to destroy the social and economic fabric of our societies and take a heavy toll on human lives. I refer to the problems of drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking  and the dumping of hazardous waste in third-world countries.The widespread increase in drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking has created a world awareness that the problem transcends national and regional boundaries. It menaces the fabric of all our societies and destroys our young people. Countries of the Caribbean are particularly vulnerable as by the nature of our geography we are used as transit points for drug trafficking  with the possibility of also becoming points of consumption. It is time for a co-ordinated global effort aimed at eliminating production  interdicting trafficking and eradicating consumption  especially where the market is greatest.Similarly  the increasing reported incidents of dumping of hazardous waste in third-world countries indicate that a matter has arisen that requires urgent international attention. Recent investigations carried out by governmental and non-governmental environmental groups reveal that in the past few months there has been a proliferation of proposals and actual attempts to ship hazardous industrial and nuclear waste from industrialized countries to third-world countries. The developed countries must keep their waste. They have the resources to devote to its safe disposal.Caribbean countries are among the targeted dump sites. For us  this phenomenon has serious implications. First  we lack the adequate legislative and administrative mechanisms to control the management and proper disposal of the waste. Exposure to the environment will result in irreversible damage to ecosystems and human lives. Secondly  conditions in the Caribbean  and indeed in many third-world countries  are almost perfect for the spread of the harmful heavy metals and toxic chemicals found in the waste -Â· for example  porous soils  wind and water erosion and tropical temperatures. Dependent as we are on our environment  our marine life and our human resources for development  this trend is a very serious threat to our survival  a menace to relations between States and a threat to international peace.My delegation supports the request that an item addressing the problem be placed on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. It is a problem that demands international co-operation and immediate attention. It seems to be true that the world is weary of war. The world has decided  in the words of a famous song  to ""give peace a chance"". However  we must return to war. Indeed I am calling for a new declaration of war  a war to be fought with an intensity hitherto unknown  on the most violent of battlefields a war to be fought to the finish; a war on poverty; a was: on drug production  drug trafficking and drug consumption; a war against the destruction of the world's resources; a war on economic slavery. This must be a true world war  fought with the present resources and the creative ingenuity of all mankind; a war in which the North fights alongside the South  the East alongside the West; a war that is waged till all mankind is truly free to realize its vast potential and to live with dignity and an uplifting quality of life."
"79",3873,"KWT",43,1988,"ï»¿When we Moslems open our statements by saying  ""In the name of God  the Compassionate  the Merciful "" we in fact renew a pledge before Allah  the Lord  to state the truth and to uphold justice  to advocate compassion within the framework of human relations - for mercy is the linchpin of brotherhood  human rights and co-operation towards progress.It is on the premise of such a pledge by man before his Lord and by man to his Fellow human brothers that I address you now.It gives me pleasure to express to you  Mr. President  on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)  of which I have the honour to be the chairman during its fifth session  and in the name of the State of Kuwait  as well as on my own personal behalf  sincere congratulations on your election to preside over the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly.Your election represents a responsibility entrusted to you at the outset of an era of global understanding when the world has made some genuine steps towards peace and co-operation. Yet further major breakthroughs are still required in order to address major long-standing universal problems. It is our hope that  by virtue of your personal skills  experience and the confidence we have all placed in you  further progress will he made.You  Mr. President  belong to a friendly and beautiful country  Argentina  with whom my country  Kuwait  has amicable relations of co-operation and mutual respect. We do look forward to stronger ties between our two nations in larger and more diverse areas of co-operation  and we hope that you personally may perhaps be able to visit us in Kuwait sometime in the future as a dear guest.I should also like to put on record our appreciation for the efforts made by the President of the forty-second session of the General Assembly  His Excellency Mr. Peter Florin  who demonstrated his deep commitment to the issues of international peace and co-operation as well as his outstanding capabilities and wealth of experience. I should like to recall here the close ties  based on mutual trust and respect  that exist between the German Democratic Republic and Kuwait in several expanding spheres.The addition  we in Kuwait - along with those throughout the Arab and Islamic worlds - pay a tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his constructive and sincere efforts in the causes of peace  as well as for his positive and forthcoming approach represented by his personal participation in international and regional meetings. His prudence and patience have been crucial to ensuring fruitful co-operation and reconciliation. We thus express to him and to his aides and representatives our deep appreciation.This year  as the result of a tragic accident  the Organization of the Islamic Conference lost a staunch advocate of the Organization  our brother and friend the late General Modammad Zia Al-Haa  former President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Tributes to his memory were paid and condolences were expressed in this Hall over the loss of General Sia Al-Haa and his companions. The late General  may his soul rest in peace  demonstrated remarkable leadership in steering his country  and in that framework he served as Chairman of the second session of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and presided over its Science and Technology Committee from its inception. General Zia Al-Haa tirelessly strived to close the ranks of the Moslem world and to defend the cause of Islam. On behalf of the OIC  I should like to take this opportunity to express our thanks for your noble expressions of sympathy for the late General  his family and his nation  and to extend once again our condolences to the families of all those who lost their lives in the tragic aircraft crash.Mankind has attached high hopes to the United Nations ever since its creation  for it represents the supreme forum in which all the peoples of the world voice their aspirations and concerns about their problems. Within the framework of the United Nations system the wealthiest  most powerful and most advanced nations meet with the poorest  the weakest and the most vulnerable countries. The United Nations presence has been a major factor in preventing a third world war. We view the world Organization as a larger workshop for moulding and refining human brotherhood and international co-operation and as an instrument for dialogue and peaceful coexistence in lieu of confrontation.That should prompt us all to enhance our support for the United Nations and its various organizations and agencies. However  although a multilateral system of this scale and with such a magnitude of responsibility may be in need of some review from time to time  such exercises of reform must not preclude sustained support and help for the United Nations system in order to ensure its ability to fulfil its obligations. We believe that the enhancement of the efficiency of the United Nations should go hand in hand with efforts to ensure its existence. Co-operation between the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference is based on a shared vision of goals and means  as well as on a common approach in addressing global and regional problems. We all believe in overall human unity  in human rights and in the dignity of the human person; we believe in the fact that the individual human being is at the centre of the human pursuit of advancement. All of us believe in common action towards peace and in respect for every people's right to self-determination  to establish its State on its national territory  and to choose its life-style without any external interference. The Organization of the Islamic Conference was established in 1969  following the criminal action committed against the Al-Aqsa mosque in Al-Quds Al-Sharif  the holy Arab city of Jerusalem; it reflected the modern Islamic awakening; it manifested the rejection of aggression and terrorism; and it expressed the wish to join a world march towards civilized progress.The fifth Islamic summit  to which Kuwait  as honoured to act as host in January 1987  adopted a set of resolutions that both reaffirmed earlier resolutions and responded to the most recent world-wide developments with international and regional implications.States members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference are ever seeking co-ordinated action both within the organization and outside it on the basis of respect for the sovereignty of nations and regional co-operation. Two examples are the Co-operation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf and broader co-operation within the framework of the League of Arab States. We also maintain ties of co-operation with the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  the Organization of African Unity  the European Community  the big Powers and  indeed  the entire world community in the United Nations and its agencies.These are bridges we should like to see widened and made more effective  and in all our endeavours in this connection we recognize that we live in a world of ever-changing international relations whose diverse cultural Focal points vary in their scope and impact. Given that diversity  coexistence and co-operation on the basis of mutual respect is imperative. It has therefore become essential that each and every civilization view other cultures through a more tolerant and objective pr ism.Among the most significant trends in today's international life is the recent move by the two super-Powers towards mutual understanding; this has resulted in agreement on a reduction in the arsenal of nuclear weapons. That agreement is all the more significant in the light of its having been proven that the use of nuclear weapons could lead to massive loss of human life. Moreover  the super-Power accord coincided with the defusing of several complex international crises. I wish here to pay tribute to the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union for the breakthroughs achieved by the United States President  Mr. Ronald Reagan  and the Soviet leader  Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev.Smaller nations view this rapprochement with great optimism and now cherish fresh hope that the new understanding will in time have a positive effect on the long-awaited just solution of their own problems with a view to attaining their legitimate rights. I turn now from East-West relations to North-South issues. The single most important question here is foreign debt and the mounting debt-servicing burden. This problem  in its current magnitude  has come to impede and severely restrict development. It is also being used as a tool to exert pressure on the South in an attempt to secure its raw materials at depressed prices while selling to the countries of the South the North's manufactured goods and cereals at constantly rising prices. This results in an ever-widening gap between the two groups.Furthermore  by exporting the vulnerability of the poor - and in some cases by tendering up-front payments without due regard for the value of the human being of the South - some industrial enterprises of certain countries of the North have maliciously used places within the national territory of a number of poor nations of the South as dumping grounds for nuclear and toxic wastes without taking effective precautions. In certain cases  in fact  dumping took place without the knowledge of the Governments concerned and without any regard for the most fundamental human rights  including that of the physical safety of present and future generation.This whole problem can be pondered in the form of single question: Why is all this tremendous pursuit necessary? It is hard enough for us in the South to cope with natural disasters  including long droughts  devastating floods and epidemics that dominate the world news. But unfortunately our friends in the North choose to aggravate our problems by creating additional plagues that destroy our ecological system and our human resources and undermine our ability to move forward towards a better future.In this connection  I should like to take this opportunity to outline a three-point plan of action:First  we call upon creditor nations to meet to examine the question of writing off the interest due on their loans to the debtor countries. This should be coupled with giving up a portion of the loan principal due from the poorest group of debtor nations. Kuwait  as a creditor country  stands ready to attend such a meeting and is willing to comply with whatever resolutions might be adopted in this respect. In our view  such an initiative represents a far better approach to addressing the matter in a more practical and effective way than leaving it to be resolved on the basis of the demands of the debtors. It also has merit in view of the divergent views of the creditors themselves. We believe that  if carried out  this proposal would benefit the debtor countries by helping them implement their development projects  and would have a broad positive impact on economic and social activities in both creditor and debtor countries.Secondly  we call on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to reconsider their stringent conditions affecting States seeking development assistance from them. We call for amendments introducing greater flexibility and taking the humanitarian factor more into account  both to reflect differences among States and to suit the conditions prevailing in debtor nations. Ultimately  this would strengthen their development efforts. Therefore  we call for expansion and regulation of North-South scientific and technical assistance. Human resource development in this context is extremely important  for without it mathematical statistics lose much of their significance. Eventually  this will lead to concerted efforts at short-term and long-term conservation of natural and human resources. It will reinforce action to combat pollution and promote and expand development plans. Thus  science will be used once more as a tool for rehabilitation  construction and progress rather than as an instrument of destruction and decadence.The inhabitants of the North and of the South are in fact brothers who just happen to live in different places; they all live within the framework of a single human family. Civilized co-operation is a most desirable -convergence of North and South and should presage the dawn of a new era of genuine universal brotherhood.If some of us continue to speak of the natural resources of some countries in the South and to the world's oil producing areas  we must remember these basic facts; that oil is a non-renewable natural resource; that scientific research for alternatives to oil continues unabated; and that the use of oil is but one phase in the long history of energy. Therefore  the most promising hope for the oil-producing countries lies in the constant improvement of the scientific and technical capabilities of present and future generations  for true wealth is found in the human intellect  which lends itself to infinite expansion and refinement.Through science and co-operation in the framework of a new international economic and humanitarian order  we all hope that with help from Allah the Almighty we shall be able to defeat poverty and starvation and shall be better prepared to confront changes in the physical world and to make increasing contributions towards global intellectual innovation. That is the real insurance policy for generations to come. As we look forward to the establishment of a new economic and humanitarian order  it is the duty of us all to co-operate in combating the terrorism that has mushroomed in various places  regardless of its causes  methods or goals. Vie should work together to enforce proper effective legislation against terrorism so innocent human lives do not become a commodity subject to bargaining under threat or blackmail or in the context of unjust commercial transactions.We in Kuwait are in the forefront of the community of nations when it corner to condemning terrorism. We have suffered from that plague and have managed  with the help of Allah the Almighty and with the solidarity of the Kuwaiti people  to withstand its evils. When a Kuwaiti civilian jetliner was hijacked last April  the international community rendered its support to us  which strengthened oar will and determination to weather the storm. We acknowledge that help with deep gratitude and appreciation.But we must draw a clear line between oppressive terrorism carried out openly or covertly by individuals  groups and States on the one hand  and  on the other hand  the legitimate right to self-defence and national defence and resistance against suppression and oppression  as provided for in universal covenants and international law.That brings me to the issue of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the most remarkable achievement of the United Nations system. But it is too often tarnished by acts of aggression. Therefore  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights must be scrupulously preserved and protected by the double power of conscience and the force of law.Despite all the efforts of the international community and the elaborate covenants adopted by the United Nations in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and despite the universal consensus on the need to promote human dignity  we still feel the presence in certain places of a force coming against the tide of history. This takes the form of attempts to usurp the rights of others and to commit unjust acts against them.This has created problems that we hope will be justly resolved so human energy can be mobilized for co-operation and building rather than for waste and conflict.It has been the lot of the Islamic world to see within its lands a number of burning crises  most recently the Iran-Iraq war  the question of Palestine  the internal strife within Lebanon and acts of aggression against it  and the problem of Afghanistan.The world has welcomed the acceptance by the Islamic Republic of Iran of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  which had been accepted earlier by sisterly Iraq  and the declaration of a cease-fire are the start of negotiations  which we hope will remain on course until all obstacles are cleared and the desired goals achieved. Resolution 598 (1987)  in its paragraph 8  requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to examine  in consultation with the States of the region  measures to enhance the security and stability of the region. The Co-operation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf always welcomes co-operation with the United Nations  as well as with Iraq and Iran  to restore security and a just peace to the Gulf region and to ensure freedom of navigation for all. The Council is in constant touch with the Secretary-General of the United Nations  as well as with the patties concerned.The eight-year war  with all its sacrifices  has provided yet another proof that no matter how long hostilities might last  the belligerents will eventually have no option but coexistence  good-neighbourliness and co-operation in promoting life  while showing respect for the national sovereignty and independence of every State  and for the system of government it has chosen for itself. The peace sought warrants sincere efforts  free of any side issues that cannot be substantiated by concrete evidence  for to raise such side issues would be to create obstacles that would impede the long-awaited peace for which we have all been yearning and divert attention from the acts of aggression committed against a defenceless people by the Israeli entity in utter disregard of human rights and international norms and instruments.The Palestinian uprising  with all the suffering involved and its noble goals  is a subject of daily discussion in the international mass media. The Palestinians are defending their land right there on their own soil: they did not leave their homes to fight against anyone. The Palestinian uprising represents the 40-yeat-long pursuit of a legitimate right.I now address peoples and friends represented in this Hall  and ask them: did you not fight for your independence and drive invading armies out of your  territory? Did you not engage in secret and open resistance and attain your independence by virtue of your valour? Is it then surprising that youth  women and children with virtually nothing at their disposal but the mere stones of their land should use them to demand their legitimate rights and to reject life in their homeland under Israeli oppression and brutalities?All the Palestinian people is demanding is its independent state on its own land  with its capital in Jerusalem  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  its sole legitimate representative.All sitting in this Hall have a homeland and a house to live in. We all carry passports and know where to be safe following our meetings here; we all look forward to being happy with our families at the end of the day. The Palestinian people demands nothing more than we all have.I should like to put on record our appreciation for the position taken by the European Community on the Middle East problem. The Community's approach is based on dialogue with all the peace-seeking parties. Accordingly  the socialist group within the European Community invited brother Yasser Arafat  Chairman of the Executive Committee of the PLO  to address the European Parliament early this month. It also provided him with an opportunity to meet and deliberate with senior Community officials.It is our hope that  similarly  fresh and favourable winds will blow across the Atlantic Ocean and reach the New World  which we hope will be able to pay more heed to the righteous Palestinian voice and to demonstrate open-mindedness and tolerance in dialogue with Palestinian intellectuals and legitimate representatives  and to express in stronger terms its condemnation of the Israeli atrocities against the Palestinians. We look forward to the time when fie issue of human rights is raised to its proper status  when human rights are a haven built on solved cock and not subject to election campaigns and promises made in pursuit of victory in an election year - promises made even at the expense of justice for other peoples and their right to self-determination.France gave as a gift to the New World the Statue of Liberty  which stands as a symbol of hope for newcomers  We hope the torch atop that statue will continue to burn in the minds and hearts of men and women and not lose its lustre by becoming a mere historic site lacking real meaning as a source of inspiration.With regard to Lebanon  one of the bitter results of the Israeli invasion of that land is the current turbulent situation there  which has fuelled violent religious  factional and regional conflicts.The wholesome life of our brothers and sisters in Lebanon stands no chance of continuity without national unity and coexistence among all Lebanese factions. Lebanon's future must be determined entirely by the Lebanese themselves. The occupation forces of the Israeli entity must withdraw from the Lebanese territory they occupy under the pretext of security invoked to justify any act of aggression and expansion.If some positive steps have been taken towards resolution of the Afghanistan issue  the compliance by all parties concerned with the terms and conditions of the agreement reached represents the right approach and will guarantee a safer and more secure future in which the people of Afghanistan will determine their way of life and the nature of their relations with their neighbours  of their own free will and without pressure from outside.In the same spirit we welcome the recent steps taken in Namibia and Angola  We hope that the efforts being made will be sustained until Namibia attains free and independent statehood under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  The Pretoria Government  however  continues to live under the illusion of racial superiority that has been unanimously condemned by the scientific and religious communities  as well as by international organizations that defend freedom of conscience against injustices and gross violations of human rights of the kind committed by Pretoria.The repulsive racial discrimination laws currently enforced by the Government of South Africa flout the dignity of the African person in his native homeland and deny him his historic and de facto rights. The body of apartheid laws must be annulled. We maintain that legitimate rights must sooner or later be attained.At this point we should like to join all those throughout the world calling for the freedom of the African national Leader Nelson Mandela  who valiantly struggles for the right of his fellow countrymen to achieve national dignity  and for that reason suffers oppression and the harshness of gaol.From this rostrum  we salute that hero and other freedom fighters everywhere in the worldâ. We want to reassure them and to tell them of our confidence that there will be a better tomorrow and the sun of freedom will shine  and vicious oppressors will never stop that from happening.It is our hope that stability will prevail in South-East Asia and between the two Koreas  as well as in the Caribbean region  and that East and West  North and South will work together to build the desired economic and humanitarian system.Regardless of the origins of the regional conflicts I have mentioned  it is the human being who ignites the spark of war. It is also the human being who is the fuel of war. In the final analysis  war represents the ultimate violation of human rights. Thus  ending any war represents a major victory for the cause of those rights. I have come here to convey to the Assembly greetings of peace from over 1 000 million Moslems living in all corners of the globe. We come extending a hand of brotherhood in the hope that present and future generations of mankind will enjoy increased prosperity  harmony  co-operation and peace.Each and every large human community  Muslim or otherwise  has its own problems and its awn aspirations. We have come here to co-operate with members in addressing our common problems and in seeking fulfilment of our common aspirations.In conclusion  I should like to pay tribute to the General Assembly and the Security Council for all the resolutions and decisions they have adopted in order to reaffirm legitimate rights and to open doors to reconciliation and peace.To you  Mr. President  and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his staff  we should like to express our thanks and appreciation for all the efforts that have been made and continue to be made in the interest of peace and for the settlement of conflicts and disputes by means of wisdom and dialogue.Tribute is also due to the world mass media for focusing attention on human-rights issues. Special mention should be made of the media's live coverage of the Palestinian uprising and the resistance to racial discrimination in South Africa.To all distinguished representatives and guests present here  I should like to extend thanks on behalf of the Islamic world and in the name of Kuwait and in my own name for their kind attention.May I ask all members to convey to their respective Governments and peoples our sincere greetings and appreciation.I  for my part  shall convey to my people in the Islamic and Arab world  as well as in Kuwait  the sentiments of friendship and welcome I have received from you. God bless you and may He bring peace  mercy and grace upon all of you."
"80",3919,"LAO",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  I extend to Mr. Dante Caputo sincere congratulations on his election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I know that his wisdom and competence will enable him to guide the present session to a fruitful conclusion. My delegation also pays a tribute to his predecessor  Comrade Peter Florin whose talents as a diplomat and dedication to peace and disarmament contributed to the success of the work of the General Assembly during a particularly difficult period. We should also like to take advantage of this opportunity to reaffirm our confidence in the Secretary-General in carrying out his outstanding role in strengthening peace and co-operation among people and his efforts to resolve the very sensitive international problems that have arisen during the past years.The international situation as a whole has shown signs of improvement. Since the four Soviet-United States Summit Meetings which made it possible to ratify the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - signed in Washington  a new era has opened in the history of international relations. The period of the extended cold war between East and West  characterized by mutual distrust  confrontation and the use of force in the settlement of conflicts is drawing to a close and seem gradually to be giving way to a new era in which the primacy of the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter  namely  those of dialogue and the settlement of disputes by peaceful means  is reaffirmed. In the context of the implementation of the provisions of the INF Treaty  a control and verification commission has been established by the two parties  and it is encouraging to note that so far its work has been extremely satisfactory. Our delegation sees in this a commendable effort by all concerned gradually to achieve nuclear disarmament  which  if it is to be effective  requires other more energetic measures which can make a significant contribution to halting the nuclear arms race. In this context  the Lao delegation hopes for a speedy conclusion by the two great Powers of another treaty on a 50 per cent reduction in strategic offensive weapons  thus opening the way to the creation of a new  safer  non-nuclear world  as proposed by the Soviet Union on 15 January 1986 in its programme for the progressive elimination of all nuclear weapons by the end of the century. The disarmament process is extremely complex. While the danger of nuclear war continues to be the most serious threat to mankind  other categories of weapons of mass destruction also threaten the security of peoples. We are thinking of chemical weapons and  in particular  binary  neutron and radiological weapons. In this regard  it is urgently necessary that greater progress be made in the Conference on Disarmament in working out a convention prohibiting the production and use of such weapons.It is true that the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  held in New York last June  did not achieve the expected results  because of the lack of political will on the pact of certain imperialist Powers. Nevertheless  it provided an opportunity for the international community to become more aware of certain new  positive developments in the world situation and  consequently  to agree to devote greater efforts to achieving the desired objective  namely  general and complete disarmament under effective international control.The world of today  whether we like it or not  is becoming increasingly interdependent. In the nuclear and space age  security can be conceived only comprehensively  and must be equal for all countries and peoples regardless of their size  their social and economic system and their level of development. It is therefore essential for the international common to contribute actively to exchanges of views and frank and constructive discussions on ways and means to achieve the formulation and establishment of a general system of peace and international security designed to cover the political-military sphere as well as the economic  humanitarian and ecological spheres. The Lao Government reaffirms its full support for both the concept and the effective implementation of that system. The favourable international atmosphere created by the Soviet-American summit meetings has undoubtedly made a positive contribution to the search for solutions to certain regional conflicts  including some of the roost complex of our century. However  obstacles to the equitable settlement of certain other conflicts continue to exist.In southern Africa  following serious military setbacks in Angola since the beginning of the year  the myth of the military invincibility of the Pretoria Government has become untenable. Faced with such a situation and given the strong pressure being exerted by the international community. South Africa has had to beat a retreat with regard to its criminal policy of apartheid  without  however  renouncing its fundamental desire to persecute the black majority of the South African population  its continued illegal occupation of Namibia  or its acts of aggression and destabilization against independent  sovereign front-line States. The racist regime has had to agree recently to a series of negotiations with the representatives of Cuba  Angola and the United states aimed at reaching a lasting political solution to the Angolan and Namibian problems. The Lao Government reaffirms its full solidarity with the oppressed peoples of South Africa and Namibia in their heroic struggle under the leader chip of their respective national liberation movements to regain their right to self-determination and independence in accordance with the spirit and letter of the relevant United Nations resolutions.In the Maghreb  a climate of understanding has been established recently  thus opening the way to the settlement of the conflicts in the region. In this context  our delegation welcomes the efforts made by the United Nations Secretary-General  in carrying out his mission of good offices  to achieve a just and final solution to the problem of Western Sahara. We favour a speedy settlement of this problem  that guarantees the exercise by the people of Western Sahara of its inalienable right to self-determination and independence  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.In the Indian Ocean region  the imperialist Powers continue to maintain their military presence  thus causing a permanent threat to the independence and security of the coastal and hinterland States. It is essential that in the interest of peace and international co-operation  the International Conference on the Indian Ocean be convened in Colombo at an early date  and in any event not later than 1990  in consultation  as proposed by the General Assembly  with the host country. In the Middle East given the policy of oppression and barbaric Zionist aggression the heroic Palestinian people  both in the occupied territories and outside Palestine continues to struggle for recognition and the recovery of its fundamental inalienable rights including that of founding its own State in Palestine. The international community can only welcome the resolutions of the Arab summit meeting held last June in Algiers and its insistence on the need urgently to convene an international conference peace in the Middle East  with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on an equal footing with the other parties involved.There has been an important new positive development in the situation in the Persian Gulf following the establishment of the cease-fire concluded under the aegis of the United Nations between Iran and Iraq. Mow that prospects for peace seem to be emerging in the region everything possible should be done to ensure integral implementation of the provisions of Security Council resolution 598 (1988).	The Lao Government and people are gratified by this and consider it an important step towards the definitive cessation of this terrible conflict. They support the sincere and tireless efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General in the search for a just and honourable conclusion to this war which has lasted too long. Moreover the Lao delegation calls on the great Powers immediately to put an end to their military presence in the region a presence which up to now has served only to' aggravate the situation. The withdrawal from the Gulf of foreign military force would in our view create favourable conditions for the integral implementation of Security Council resolution 5S8 (1988). In Central America and the Caribbean the peoples of Nicaragua  Panama  Argentina and other countries are continuing to wage their determined struggle to preserve their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and to recover their inalienable rights to self-determination and genuine independence. The Lao Government deems it its duty to support that struggle in order to thwart and stop in time any manoeuvres based on aggression  intimidation  destabilization and sabotage undertaken by the imperialist circles of a certain great Power regarding the regional peace process.The Lao Government and people welcome and firmly support the tireless efforts of the coastal countries of the Mediterranean to transform this strategic region into a zone of peace  security and co-operation. Thus they are following the development of the situation in Cyprus with concern and sympathy and express their full solidarity with the people and Government of the Republic of Cyprus in the struggle they are waging to preserve their independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and the non-aligned status of their country  by demanding the immediate cessation of all separatist actions and by actively encouraging the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his mission of good offices in order to achieve a just and lasting solution to the grievous problem of Cyprus.The international community welcomed with satisfaction and hope the agreements concluded in Geneva on the Afghan problem but for the time being it would seem that its greatest concern is focused on their sincere application by all signatory States. While up to now the Soviet Union and the Republic of Afghanistan have correctly and rigorously applied them  it is regrettable to note that other parties to the agreements have not fully honoured the commitments they have undertaken. The international community must therefore encourage and urge them scrupulously and sincerely to carry out those agreements.A situation of tension still prevails in the region of Asia and the Pacific because of the neo-globalist policy pursued by an imperialist super-Power. The Lao People's Democratic Republic reaffirms its support for the constructive proposal of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea regarding the gradual reduction of armed forces of the two parts of Korea and opposes any attempt to push through the admission of the two parts of Korea to the United Nations  which would hamper efforts aimed at the peaceful and independent reunification of that country.Another highly relevant proposal  advocated by the People's Republic of Mongolia  the goal of which is to promote a climate of peace and co-operation in the region  provides for the establishment of a regime of non-use of force in relations among the countries of the region. My Government firmly supports that proposal.The situation in South-East Asia has developed in accordance with general world trend towards the search for the settlement of conflicts through negotiation. Following the proclamation last year by the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea of its policy of national reconciliation  the President of the Council of Ministers  Mr. Hun Sen  and Prince Sihanouk held two series of important talks in Paris. In addition to the informal meeting in Jakarta  Indonesia  Mr. Hun Sen once again put forward on behalf of his Government a seven-point proposal to find a political solution to the Kampuchean problem. That proposal attests to the growing development  maturity and political wisdom of the Government of the Peopled Republic of Kampuchea. The Lao People's Democratic Republic greatly appreciates the results of that meeting and firmly supports the joint position adopted by the latter  namely  that the. problem of Kampuchea must be resolved by political means leading to the building of an independent Kampuchea  a sovereign  neutral and non-aligned country  on the basis of national reconciliation and respect for the right to self-determination of the Kampuchean - people  and that the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea must proceed  together  with the non-return to power in Kampuchea of the Pol Pot clique  which practises a policy of genocide and with a guarantee of the cessation of foreign interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea as well as of military assistance to the opposing Kampuchean forces. Ito move forward the encouraging results of their Informal meeting  Mr. Hun Sen and Prince Sihanouk have taken the wise decision to meet again in Paris at the end of this year. We also welcome the positive initiative recently taken by the current Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement for a technical meeting in Heir are to discuss the question of Kampuchea and to establish for that purpose an ad hoc committee of the non-aligned.The Lao Government is firmly dedicated to the fundamental principle of settling all disputes between States by negotiation. We believe that on the basis of the Bandung Principles  the 1971 Kuala Lumpur Declaration of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the seven-point proposal that the Lao delegation put forward at the Jakarta Informal Meeting in July  the countries of the region will be able to consult regularly to bring their points of view closer together and to strengthen mutual understanding in order to transform South-East Asia into a zone of peace friendship and co-operation thus meeting the legitimate aspirations and interests of their respective peoples.In this context it is regrettable that the border dispute between my country and Thailand has not yet been resolved. The two rounds of negotiations which took piece last March in Bangkok and Vientiane have not yet yielded concrete results. The third round of negotiations could not be held in Thailand because of the recent political crisis in that country. Following general elections a new Thai Government has been established and since then exchange visits of delegations at different levels between the two countries have been carried out in a genuine search for better mutual understanding. Given that atmosphere we believe it is high time for the two countries to open new negotiations as the Lao side has proposed. The Government of the Lao people's Democratic Republic is ready to do everything in its power to settle the border dispute between it and Thailand immediately and finally. Since the forty-second session of the Assembly the lot of the peoples of the third world has not notably improved. Poverty  hunger  sickness and backwardness are still the daily plight of the great majority of them.The restrictive macro-economic policy pursued by certain market-economy developed countries has only aggravated the effects of the world economic crisis  and it is the developing countries  particularly the least developed  that have suffered the most. The resurgence of protectionist measures  high interest rates  the deterioration of the terms of trade and the crushing burden of the external debt  which has continued to grow over the years  are all major reasons for the gravity of the situation.My Government believes that in the struggle to establish a more just and equitable new international economic order the strengthening of collective autonomy must take pride of place. The Lao Government sincerely welcomes the first results of the implementation of the process of co-ordination and harmonization of programmes of action for economic co-operation between the non-aligned countries and the other developing countries. In the light of its growing Interest in International co-operation for development  and in order to make its participation in the struggle to establish a new international economic order more effective  the Lao Government recently announced its new economic policy  which includes a law on foreign investments  under which it intends to develop and expand its economic and trade relations with all other countries.The present session of the General Assembly is taking place in a climate that is both encouraging and alarming. Numerous challenges continue to emerge on the way to a new era of a non-violent world free of nuclear weapons. However  it is encouraging that there is unanimity in the Assembly in favour of peace  thus attesting to the unquestionable desire of Member States to live in universal understanding and full security  lb achieve that objective and thus meet the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of the world  our Organization must undertake enormous  complex task which requires of us all a sense of responsibility and common political will. The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic reaffirms its unswerving dedication to the cause of peace  peaceful coexistence and international co-operation and will associate itself with the efforts of theinternational community to attain that common goal."
"81",3963,"LBN",43,1988,"ï»¿It gives me pleasure  on behalf of the delegation of Lebanon  to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. The relations between his country  Argentina  and mine  Lebanon  are firmly established  deeply rooted and characterized by friendship  co-operation and mutual respect. Since his appointment as Foreign Minister of Argentina  Mr. Caputo has contributed to the consolidation of these relations. We are fully confident  therefore  that his qualifications  experience and wisdom will make him an exemplary President and will ensure the success of the work of this session.The delegation of Lebanon wishes also to extend its thanks and appreciation to Mr. Caputo's predecessor  the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic  Mr. Peter Florin  whose wise leadership and great efforts enabled the General Assembly to achieve such good results at its forty-second session.In expressing the thanks of the delegation of Lebanon I must not forget to thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his good offices and efforts in the settlement of a number of regional crises and in making the Secretariat more efficient  in difficult financial circumstances. Indeed  the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organisation is clear proof of the success of his sustained efforts.The agenda of the current session of the General Assembly is replete with important items - political  economic  social and legal. Some of these have been on the agenda for years  some for dozens of years  awaiting solution. However  we are still hopeful that just solutions will be found. The recent developments on the questions of Afghanistan  Namibia  Western Sahara  the Iran-Iraq conflict  Kampuchea and Cyprus are encouraging and make us very hopeful that efforts will be intensified to reach genuine solutions to the question of southern Lebanon  the Israeli occupation of a part of Lebanon  the Middle East question  and  in particular  the question of the Palestinian people.Large numbers of Palestinians have been expelled from their homeland and dispersed in various parts of the world. Others live in camps in Arab countries that have taken them in  while the remainder continue to live under Israeli occupation in the West Bank  the Gaza Strip and Holy Al Quds. The Palestinian people has a legitimate and inalienable right to self-determination  to return to its homeland and to establish an independent State on its own soil. This people  which has expressed its free national will through its blessed uprising inside its homeland  has indicated at every opportunity its complete rejection of all settlement projects  which have also been categorically rejected by Lebanon and other sister Arab countries.Despite the ordeal by which it has been afflicted for approximately 14 years  Lebanon has not failed to meet its membership obligations to the United Nations. Lebanon has adhered to the Charter  which it signed as a founding member  and is committed to its provisions and to implementation of the resolutions of the Organization. Lebanon believes that the United Nations plays an important role in various fields  with the aim of improving man's condition and protecting peoples against the forces of oppression and tyranny. In return for those duties and obligations  however  Lebanon has rights. It requires of the Organization that it secure its sovereignty and territorial integrity and ensure the safety of its people. It expects the world community to lend it full support in its efforts to liberate its land and revitalize its institutions  in order to enable it to resume its role at all levels - regional and international.If I confine my statement to the question of southern Lebanon  it is because I believe that the question is extremely critical  since it threatens security and peace not only in the Middle East region  but in the whole world. One of the main causes of the continued ordeal afflicting the Lebanese people for about 14 years has been the continued Israeli aggression against Lebanon and the continued occupation by Israel of parts of our land. This ordeal is today increasing in gravity and complexity  and is reaching alarming dimensions  to the extent that it is now threatening the very unity and existence of Lebanon.Paced with this situation  Lebanon is right to concentrate on a question relating to its very future and existence. But in no way does this mean that Lebanon pays no attention to the other questions on the agenda. Lebanon's ordeal has not prevented it from participating in and contributing to the discussion of those questions over the years and striving to find the necessary solutions to them. Lebanon will not hesitate to continue to do so. It declares that it is ready and willing to do its utmost and to co-operate  within its possibilities  with other members of the international community to achieve the desired objectives of the Charter  for the benefit of all mankind.Since the creation of Israel in the Middle East region  Lebanon has suffered from invasions of its territory and from practices against its people. During one five-year period alone Lebanon was invaded twice by Israel - in 1978 and in 1982. Previous heads of the Lebanese delegation have spoken at great length about those two invasions and their consequences. Suffice it to mention now that since 1978 Israel has preserved for itself inside Lebanese territory a so-called security zone. Moreover  it has gone much further by continuing to launch repeated acts of aggression and raids against peaceful villages deep inside Lebanese territory - from the sea  by land and by air. I need not go into the details of this question  because the abundant complaints lodged by Lebanon  which have been distributed as official documents of the General Assembly and the Security Council to the members of the Organization  are quite sufficient. They prove that Israel is continuing to violate the rules of the United Nations Charter and the provisions of international law and agreements  and that it is still challenging General Assembly and the Security Council resolutions  particularly Security Council resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978) and other subsequent resolutions. Those resolutions call for the complete and unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli forces from Lebanese territory  the deployment of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to the internationally recognized borders  and support for Lebanon in order to restore its sovereignty and authority over all its territory.Consequently  Israel's responsibility is clearly established. Lebanon therefore calls an the United Nations and its Security Council to take a courageous and decisive stand to check Israel's behaviour and to compel it to respect the Charter and to abide by United Nations resolutions. Only full implementation of those resolutions can save Lebanon and the Middle East region from risks that might in turn jeopardize international peace and security. That is the only way to help Lebanon overcome this crisis  achieve territorial integrity  contribute to unifying its population and regain its constructive role within the international community. Lebanon is yearning for the return of peace and stability  which will enable it to carry out the reconstruction and rehabilitation programmes that would put it back on the track to a normal life. The Lebanese crisis after so many years has created a deteriorating economic and financial situation. Lebanon's needs are estimated to be billions of dollars  and Lebanon expects to receive the necessary support and help from the international community.This year's initiative by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  to collect 85 million for immediate urgent aid to Lebanon was crowned with success. Although the amount collected  $76 million  is  compared with the help needed  symbolic  we are all grateful to the Secretary-General for that important initiative. The delegation of Lebanon would like to place on record its gratitude to the Secretary-General  to all officials of the United Nations organs  and to all specialized agencies  as well as to the States that contributed to meeting this urgent need. It expresses the hope that the Secretary-General will continue his endeavours to provide the necessary aid for Lebanon's reconstruction and rehabilitation.The delegation of Lebanon would like to add its voice to that of the Secretary-General in calling for the provision of the necessary funds for the international peace-keeping forces  particularly the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  which is today considered the most important international peace-keeping force. Lebanon is grateful to UNIFIL for the services it has rendered and is still rendering in southern Lebanon. We should like to express our thanks and appreciation to the leadership  the soldiers and the countries contributing to UNIFIL. We therefore call upon the Security Council to adopt the necessary measures to enable UNIFIL to carry out the basic task entrusted to it and to help Lebanon transform its southern region into a region of security and peace. While talking about peace  we cannot omit to mention how gratified we felt upon hearing the news that the Nobel Peace Prize had been awarded this year to the United Nations peace-keeping forces.Lebanon looks forward to the establishment of a new era following the election of the new President of the Republic  which we hope will take place soon.Lebanon's national crisis  entrenched for over 14 years now  undoubtedly has its own deep-seated internal causes. Consequently  it can be solved only through a formula of national entente among the Lebanese people themselves. However  this crisis has most certainly had clear regional and International dimensions. The situation in Lebanon has therefore directly and strongly affected  and has in turn been affected by  developments in the situation both inside and outside the Middle East region. For that reason Lebanon will always need positive initiatives on the part of its Arab brethren and of all friendly nations in order to help it overcome the crisis.In conclusion I should like to convey to the members of the General Assembly the hope of my people that they will do their utmost to help Lebanon liberate its territory and also to convey their determination to begin reconstruction and rehabilitation within the framework of a solid national unity  which has been and always will be the best guarantee for a Lebanon of harmony  love and tolerance  an oasis of coexistence and a bridge between East and West.

"82",4009,"LBR",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of the President  the Government and the people of Liberia  I warmly congratulate the President on his election to preside over this forty-third session of the General Assembly. His wide experience and well-known diplomatic skills fully assure us that this session  under his leadership  will achieve very positive results. We can count on the usual co-operation and support of the delegation of Liberia in the months ahead. Permit me also to extend well-deserved thanks and appreciation to the President's predecessor  Ambassador Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic who conducted the affairs of the forty-second session with great aplomb and distinction.Special commendation is likewise due our illustrious Secretary-General for the skill and courage with which he has been serving the international community  my Government will continue to do everything to assist him in upholding the credibility of the United Nations and ensuring that its mandates are fulfilled.Finally  allow me to take special note of the opportunities which the annual sessions of the General Assembly offer us for fruitful bilateral and multilateral consultations on issues of mutual interest.The tragic experiences of two world wars and the imminent danger of nuclear catastrophe have made the search for peace and development the paramount concern of our time. The principles and ideals by which peace is to be achieved and development attained have been fully set out in the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions of the Assembly.For 43 years  guided by those principles and ideals  we have come here with various problems  disputes and ideas. Here we have debated the issues  grappled with the problems and their possible solutions  and expressed both our frustrations and our aspirations.In spite of our varying dispositions and our cultural  economic and ideological differences  we have always acknowledged and professed the continuing relevance of the United Nations in the search for peace  security and development. It is against this background that my delegation  in addressing the specific issues before the Assembly  will give renewed emphasis to the need for strengthening the role of dialogue and solidarity for the betterment of the human condition. My delegation welcomes the stirrings of peace that have greeted this forty-third session and given the international common new hope for the efficacy of multilateralism in the resolution of conflict.In this connection  we note with satisfaction the Peace Accords with regard to Afghanistan  signed last April  which are facilitating the withdrawal of foreign troops from that country. We also applaud the acceptance by Iran of the provisions of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  which has brought about the cessation of hostilities in the Persian Gulf and made possible the on-going peace talks between Iraq and Iran under the auspices of the United Nations. We are also pleased that  through the mediation of the Secretary-General and the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity  Morocco and the POLISAR10 Front have consented to the holding of a referendum  which constitutes an important step towards resolving the question of Western Sahara. Moreover  we note that negotiations between the two communities in Cyprus are progressing satisfactorily  also under the auspices of the United Nations.It is in this context that we must highly commend the Nobel Prize Committee for being so thoughtful as to award its 1983 Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. And we congratulate the Secretary-General on this achievement. At the same time  ray delegation appeals to all the parties involved to continue to work co-operatively for the final resolution of these problems.But we must resist every temptation to be lulled into a state of complacency by these recent successes  as our present agenda still contains a number of unresolved issues which must claim the Assembly's urgent attention.Despite the best efforts of the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  a just and lasting settlement to the Kampuchea dispute has remained elusive. We therefore support the Jakarta Informal Meeting  which seeks to bring together all the parties concerned in an effort to resolve the problem of Kampuchea. A comprehensive settlement of the dispute roust take into account the exercise by the Kampuchean people of their inalienable right to self-determination  free from foreign interference.With regard to the Korean question  my delegation urges acceleration of efforts to bring about a constructive and fruitful dialogue in the peninsula. The special declaration  by President Roh Tae Woo of July 1988  in the interest of national self-esteem and prosperity  constitutes a positive step towards easing tension and leading to the peaceful unification of the two Koreas.We congratulate the Governments and peoples of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the commemoration of their fortieth anniversary of nationhood. We wish them a prosperous and bright future and the attainment of unity  peace and stability as soon as possible. In Central America various peace plans proposed by the countries of the region have not yielded the desired results. My delegation would therefore hope that the people of Central America could be left alone to chart their own course on the path of restoring peace  fostering democracy and strengthening regional unity and economic co-operation.A sad episode in the Middle East crisis is the tragedy of Lebanon  a country with which Liberia has enjoyed close ties of friendship over the years. Once a prosperous nation  Lebanon is today ravaged by years of incessant civil strife  aggravated by unwarranted external interference. We therefore urge respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon the safeguarding of its independence  an end to violence  and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from its territory.Since the last session of the General Assembly a year ago the crisis in the Middle East has escalated significantly despite the various peace initiatives undertaken. In this connection  we call on Israel to exercise restraint in its enforcement of law and order in the occupied territories. It continues to be the view of my Government that a just and lasting settlement of the Middle East conflict must take into account the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people  as well as the right of all States in the region  including Israel  to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.In this regard we reiterate the call for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East  with the participation on a basis of equality of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the authentic representative of the Palestinian people. Such a conference should certainly enhance the peace process in the region. A few days ago General Moussa Traore  President of Mali and current Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity  eloquently outlined to the Assembly Africa's position on a number of important issues  including the vexed question of southern Africa.My delegation therefore wishes only to stress Liberia's grave concern that the racist minority regime in Pretoria  aided and abetted by its collaborators  has continued to defy with impunity the collective will of the international community by its flagrant disregard of the fundamental rights of the black majority in their own land. Furthermore  there can be no denying the fact that the extremity of the cruel and degrading treatment meted out to black South Africans bears a disturbing and chilling resemblance to Nazi practices. To date  the brutal and remorseless Pretoria regime has kept hundreds  if not thousands  of children in detention  subjecting them to systematic torture and even genocide. Reports of such horrors perpetrated by the regime' leave my Government in no doubt that the international community has not done enough to destroy apartheid.So entrenched is the racist minority regime's policy of apartheid that no other peaceful means short of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter can eradicate that system and save the country from an eventual bloodbath. Those who argue that sanctions will only bring hardships to the blacks of South Africa and to the front-line States are either simply against the aspirations of black people or interested only in their investments and profits. For the persistent rejection of apartheid by the black South Africans themselves has surely  demonstrated that they at least would prefer hardship in freedom to prosperity under apartheid.My delegation holds the view that  if the racist regime in South Africa truly desires genuine peace  it must  in good faith and without pre-conditions  immediately release Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners as a first step towards reconciliation and the institution of a non-racial democratic society based on universal franchise. In this context  Liberia wishes to associate itself with those delegations that have called for the convening of a special session of the General Assembly in 1989 to consider the overall situation in southern Africa  including the question of Namibia.A clear demonstration of South Africa's arrogance is its illegal occupation of Namibia  in utter contempt of the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations  and its continued use of that Territory to launch subversive  aggressive and destabilizing policies against neighbouring States.While we take note of the recent quadripartite discussions on the Namibian question  there is nothing in the negotiating record of the racist regime to justify any reliance on its commitments. The Security Council should therefore proceed to take such measures as may be necessary to carry out its mandate  as set forth in its resolution 435 (1978)  As we observe the tenth anniversary of that resolution  we reaffirm Namibia's right to self-determination and independence within a united territory  including Walvis Bay  the Penguin Islands and all other offshore islands  and under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole and legitimate representative of the Namibian people. It is our fervent hope that  when the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly convenes  a free and independent Namibia will be able to take its rightful place as a full Member of the United Nations.I wish to turn now to the question of disarmament  which for my delegation at least has real implications not only for peace and security but for development as well. Liberia maintains its position that if peace and development are to be fully achieved the international community simply cannot continue to spend so many billions of dollars each year on armaments and related activities. In seeking to ensure security we have somehow unleashed a costly arms race  which has diverted resources from development needs  thereby exacerbating social problems in developing countries. This point was well articulated by a number of speakers at the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  held last year.The recent ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - by the United States and the Soviet union marks a new and encouraging beginning in bilateral disarmament efforts. On the other hand  the failure of the third special session devoted to disarmament to arrive at a consensus represents a serious setback to multilateral disarmament initiatives. My Government continues to believe that bilateral and multilateral efforts complement each other am d that the United Nations remains the central forum for disarmament issues.Liberia considers the Non-Proliferation Treaty an important international instrument and its ratification a vital first step towards nuclear disarmament. In this connection  we are particularly concerned that South Africa's nuclear capability has continued to frustrate the attainment of the objective of the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa  to make it a zone of peace. Indeed  the credibility of the Treaty will remain doubtful as long as measures are not taken to ensure the subjection of the nuclear capability of South Africa and other countries to safeguards and inspection under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency.Thus we favour the convening of the Fourth Review Conference of States Patties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1990 to consider suds matters  among others.My delegation joins previous speakers who have condemned the use of chemical weapons in contravention of the 1925 Geneva Treaty banning the use of such weapons. Similarly  we are gravely concerned about the dumping of toxic and other hazardous waste on African soil  an act which is tantamount to a declaration of chemical war on our people. This multifarious environmental abuse endangers the well-being and lives of all our peoples. Such waste not only poisons the air we breathe but also pollutes our water resources and contaminates the very soil upon which we depend for the cultivation of food. But is there not an ethical question also? At the close of the twentieth century  should Africa still be facing such a threat to its survival? Was slavery not enough? Was colonial exploitation not enough? Is the present critical economic situation made worse by various natural disasters not enough? Must we now be exposed also to poisonous and radioactive substances that threaten our very survival as a people?So serious is this problem of toxic waste disposal that we must urge the Economic and Social Council to expedite the adoption and implementation of its draft convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes  we also welcome the call for the Conference on Disarmament to draft a convention on the prohibition of the dumping of radioactive and toxic wastes for hostile purposes.Unlike the political environment in which significant progress towards the relaxation of tension has been observed  it is regrettable that no comparable development in the economic sphere was attained during the year. Since the last session of this Assembly  the international economic environment experienced further decline and disequilibrium. The fall in commodity prices  the decrease in the flow of official development assistance and the crushing debt burden have continued to be the most serious factors responsible for the net outflow of capital from developing to developed countries.It was this very serious predicament that led to the convening of the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly  on the critical economic situation in Africa  a little over two years ago. In this connection  the mid-term review and appraisal exercise undertaken last month has confirmed that the international community has not fulfilled its commitment under the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development.In the meantime  African countries themselves  in spite of the unfavourable international economic climate  have endeavoured to pursue structural adjustment programmes  institutionalized or otherwise. Liberia  for instance  has undertaken certain measures within its own capabilities  to establish conditions for economic recovery. I refer  to attempts being made  through a green revolution programme  to expand agricultural production with a view to attaining food self-sufficiency. Moreover  steps have been taken  not only towards efficient management of the public sector  but also towards the encouragement and promotion of private initiative and enterprise in economic growth and development.In view of the foregoing  ray delegation joins previous speakers who have called on the international community to live up to its commitment under the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  and in particular to accelerate the flow of resources to the continent. Our common heritage and interdependence demand the concerted effort of all for the attainment of the conditions that will ensure a higher standard of living for the peoples of the developing countries.This planet on which we live may have its imperfections  but until scientific exploration can confirm otherwise  it remains the only homo we have. It is therefore our sacred obligation to create in it a wholesome environment: for ourselves and for posterity.In this connection  we must strive for a political environment free from conflicts and warÂ·  we must strive for an economic environment that provides for a just  equitable and efficient production and distribution of goods and services  and we must pursue sustainable development policies that will ensure the protection of our eco-system.When we pollute the oceans  the rivers and streams  when we denude our forests  when we violate the human rights of our fellow man  and engage in various forms of warfare without neighbours  when we exploit the poor and the weak  we do great harm to the human environment and thereby undermine the peace and security of our world.The task of facing the future and safeguarding the interest of succeeding generations requires our collective moral commitment and co-ordinated political will and action.In the view of my Government  the United Nations is still the best instrument at our disposal for the attainment of that wholesome environment envisaged and desired by all  and we thus reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the principles and purposes enshrined in its Charter. "
"83",4055,"LBY",43,1988,"ï»¿At the outset  I should like to convey to you. Sir  on behalf of my delegation  my most sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of this session. I am confident that your experience and competence will enable us to achieve the best possible results. Our pleasure at your election is all the greater because you belong to a friendly country which maintains strong relations with ours. In wishing you every success in your difficult task I reassure you that my delegation intends to co-operate closely with you in order to contribute to the success of the session.I take this opportunity to express also our appreciation and gratitude to Mr. Peter Florin for his competent  indeed superb  handling of the work of the forty-second session.We wish  too  to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who has made strenuous efforts to strengthen the role of the Organization and played a prominent part in the international efforts which led to the solution of some of the most complex political questions. The forty-third session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the world is beset with crises and new conflicts are added to the old ones. Thanks to the work of our Organization  we are witnessing some positive indications and developments which make us hope for true detente in international relations.In spite of this optimism  we have  as an international gathering  to admit that the actual capability of the Organization suffers from numerous limitations because of the pressures exerted by certain States. Accordingly  it is incumbent on us strongly to support the existence and continuation of the Organization. We should all support its noble purposes  because we believe that it is still the only forum through which the hopes of peace-loving peoples and international peace and security can be realized.We live in an era in which anxiety about our destiny combines with hope for the future. The continuation and viability of the Organization  in spite of difficulties and conspiracies throughout its existence  together with its success in maintaining some level of efficiency and independence  augur well and justify our optimism. On the other hand  the persistence of colonialism and apartheid in Palestine and South Africa  exploitation  oppression  dominance  hegemony and occupation are causes foe anxiety and trepidation. Worse still  poverty  hunger  backwardness and illiteracy have been sources of suffering for roost human beings. The cries of the oppressed  tortured and displaced ring out on high  showering curses on imperialists  racists  opportunists and warmongers. That some regimes based on occupation  usurpation  genocide and apartheid have their place in the world community today and enjoy support clearly proves that some Powers treat the Charter of the Organization with contempt. However  these regimes are given political support and unlimited material support by certain super-Powers. There is no doubt that during the life of the Organisation great historic achievements have been accomplished in the fields of decolonization and resisting fascism and racism but hotbeds of tension still abound in many parts of the world} as new wars and conflicts have broken out the freedom and sovereignty of many States have been threatened  and many peoples have suffered from the scourge of occupation  injustice  hegemony and dependence.A quick look at the current international situation and the agenda for this session shows that what has been accomplished so far is not enough  and that what has to be done requires a collective international will to address vigorously the prejudices of the few who refuse to uphold the principles of justice and peace  those imperialists who adopt a policy of force  threats  hegemony and terrorism to achieve their own ends  using all unlawful means  such as war  terrorism  interference in the internal affairs of States  invasion  aggression  occupation and economic blockade.A large number of States represented here have been subjected to these practices. I remind the Assembly of the flagrant barbaric aggression perpetrated by the United States of America against my country in the spring of 1986. That aggression was condemned by world public opinion at the time and by the Assembly unanimously in its resolution 41/38 of 20 November 1986  which recognized the right of our people to receive appropriate compensation for the great losses incurred.It gives me pleasure to commend all those States which sponsored or supported that resolution  we take it that their positive and honourable stand not only strengthens our valid position  but also represents a victory for the principles of justice  righteousness and peace enshrined in the Charter of our Organization. As the American attack against Libya is one of the items on the agenda this session  we call upon all peace-loving States to reiterate their condemnation of that aggression and to support the lawful demands of our people to receive immediate and appropriate compensation for the human and material losses incurred.In this connection  we emphasize that the attack should not be regarded as a purely Libyan affair  for it affects the entire international community  inasmuch as it encroaches upon the spirit and principles of the Charter. If Libya fell victim to the aggression then  it was not the first victim  and it will not be the last. That aggression is a link in the chain of persistent American practices against peoples fighting for their freedom  independence and sovereignty. It is also a component of the imperialist scheme that I have just mentioned. It is even a component of the approach of the foreign policy of the United States of America. What is happening in Central America  where the peoples of Panama and Nicaragua are subjected to the vilest kinds of blackmail and threats  provides irrefutable evidence of what I am saying.The Organization's role can be truly strengthened only by a review of provisions of the Charter which have crippled some of the main organs responsible for maintaining international peace and security. Some of those provisions have not kept pace with the profound global changes which have taken place since 1945. The international situation in 1945 was completely different from today. The Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization should be aware of this fact. Its recommendations should be bold with regard to those provisions whose application has hampered the most important role of the Organization. I refer  in particular  to the right of veto enjoyed by a few States  which some of them have exploited to foster aggression  occupation  invasion and terrorism. My country took the initiative in calling for a thorough review of that privilege. It reaffirms its position and calls upon all Member States to consider the issue in an objective manner.The question of Palestine - of the Arab people of Palestine - has absolute priority among my country's concerns. It is the question of an entire people who have been displaced  from their homeland  whose land has been usurped and who are subjected to the worst forms of discrimination  oppression  torture and genocide by a clique that has been assembled  financed armed and supported for that purpose. We share the belief of the Palestinian people  and all peace-loving nations  that the main question in the world today is that of progress and peace - but this cannot be achieved without freedom and justice. There can be no progress without freedom  and no peace without justice.How can we think of progress and peace in a world where the largest State does not hesitate to finance the steady extermination of a tiny people in order to implant an alien in its land  its fields and houses?In the past 40 years this distinguished Assembly  the Security Council and other organs of the United Nations have adopted hundreds of resolutions recognizing the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to return to their country  and to achieve self-determination. In spite of this confirmed international recognition  the Arab Palestinian people are still deprived of all their human and political rights because of the obduracy and arrogance of the occupying racist Zionist entity and these who created and foster it  disregarding all values and treating all instruments with blatant contempt.The persistence of the United States  in particular  in providing unlimited support to this racist regime is the main reason for the continued plight of the Palestinian people.The United States  which is a permanent member of the Security Council and is thus presumed to take the lead in establishing and maintaining international peace and security  is the Power that protects the Zionist entity and defends its membership of the United Nations  in the knowledge that that entity is defending aggression  occupation and falsehood. Accordingly  from our point of view  it remains the main indeed the only  obstacle in the way of all international efforts to find a just solution to the question of Palestine. The great patience of the Palestinian people should not be regarded as gradual recognition of a fait accompli or of submission to it  or as a sign that they have forgotten four decades of injustice and oppression. People have good memories  and falsehood is destined to vanish  however long it may last. Allah  the Almighty  says  in the Glorious Koran:""And Allah will wipe out the lie and vindicate the truth by his words ""and""Nay  but we hurl the true against the false  and it doth break its head and it vanishes."" (The Holy Koran  Ð¥XI24 and XXI 118)We have lived to see falsehood armed to the teeth with the most up-to-date and devastating weapons  staggering under the blows of the unarmed Palestinian people  who have nothing with which to fight except the stones of their land  covered with their blood and mixed with the bones of their women and children. It looks as if solid stones long subjected to the injustice of the usurper have risen to acquire the power of bombs and rockets  and the atoms of these stones have come to life. Thus  the uprising of this brave people has shown that deeds speak louder than words. It has stressed to us all that right endows the weak with strength  that the technology of injustice cannot subdue. The Arab poet says:""Right at the hands of the just is elevated.As a sword acts when brandished.Whatever lies are used to tarnish right.It must one day be seen shining bright.""This uprising has stunned the occupying Power and its supporters. It has reminded everyone of the human tragedy and the grave injustice. It has also underlined the fact that all deals up to now - peace initiatives as well as unilateral agreements - have been unable to provide any basis either for peace or for a just solution. We applaud our Arab people in Palestine for their heroic and honourable stand and their magnificent struggle. We reiterate our complete support for their blessed uprising and place all our capabilities at their disposal. The United Nations  which  nearly 40 years ago  was manipulated by imperialists in an attempt to confer legality on the racist Zionist entity  is called upon today to take concrete measures to remedy its historic blunder.What is taking place in occupied Palestine cannot be considered in isolation from what is happening in southern Africa   he Powers that firmly implanted the racist entity in Palestine are the same ones that created the racist regime in southern Africa. The daily racist practices from which the peoples of South Africa and Namibia suffer are the same as those experienced by the Palestinian people. The two regimes are identical. Could it be said. Indeed  that they differ in any way? The establishment of the apartheid regime in South Africa is yet another example of the historical hardships and tragedies to which peoples have been subjected by the colonialist and imperialist movement. The United Nations should shoulder the historic responsibility of combating the evils of apartheid.The problems of Namibia cannot be resolved except by enabling the Namibian people to exercise self-determination and achieve complete independence under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  pursuant to United Nations resolutions  especially Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which represents the legal basis of international consensus on Namibian independence.The- Pretoria regime has colonized South Africa and Namibia  oppressed the black majority and striven to exterminate it. It also threatens the security and Integrity of neighbouring African States. It is emulated by its twin regime in occupied Palestine  but it cannot be compelled to yield to the will of the international community except through the application of immediate and comprehensive sanctions. We regard the refusal of certain Powers  and the reluctance of others  to apply sanctions as the main obstacle facing international efforts to put an end to the most abhorrent racist regime in modern history.We in Libya support the just struggle of the peoples of South Africa and Namibia for independence and human dignity. We commend the brave steadfastness of the front-line African States and declare our complete solidarity with them in their efforts to achieve the common goal of putting an end to the apartheid regime in Pretoria.The collaboration between the colonial regimes in Palestine and Pretoria is an undeniable fact of great significance. As this international Assembly condemned the apartheid policy in South Africa as the most odious form of racial discrimination  so it condemned Zionism  regarding it as a form of racism and racial discrimination. This condemnation and this judgement are embodied in the historic General Assembly resolution 3379 (XXX)  which has been a prominent landmark and an honourable and brave utterance by the United Nations in combating racism and racial discrimination. I refer to that resolution in order to refresh memories in this international assemblage  appeal to its conscience  and urge it to be wide awake so that it may address attempts to obscure the truth and confer justice and goodness on falsehood.Strengthening security and co-operation in the Mediterranean Sea zone ranks high among the concerns of my country  which has always supported all regional and international efforts to this end. Our interest in this issue is based on our conviction that the security oÂ£ the region is related not only to peace  security and co-operation in Europe and Africa  but also to international peace and security. This region has become one of the most dangerous areas of tension in the world# owing to its occupation by certain imperialist Powers which are determined to change it into a permanent base for foreign naval fleets  an arena for provocative military manoeuvres  acts of naval and air piracy and a launching pad for direct aggression against some States bordering on the Mediterranean Sea.True security and co-operation in the Mediterranean region can be brought about only through the intensification and co-ordination of the efforts by all States bordering on the Sea  through collective measures on their part to call for the immediate withdrawal of foreign fleets and the dismantling of military bases  and through the promotion of dialogue and understanding among all the parties with a view to achieving this end. In this context  we should like to endorse the final communiquÃ© of the Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries at their special meeting held in Havana in May 1988. We welcome anew the agreements at Beriouni on the continuation of contacts between the non-aligned countries bordering on the Mediterranean Sea and the European States in that region.The Organization of African Unity (OAU)  to which we are proud to belong and which is considered one of the largest and most important regional entities in the world  plays an active part in strengthening international peace and security. The peoples of that organization have long-standing historical links to one another and have also been subjected to long and continuous suffering from imperialism  occupation and foreign interference. My country has played a leading role in defending the unity and cohesion of that organization  and has championed the slogan ""Africa for Africans"". Some imperialist Powers  however  were not happy about this  and worked constantly to cripple the organization and disrupt the ranks of its members. But the African peoples have risen above these manoeuvres  which ultimately failed despite their occasional limited and ephemeral successes.Out of this spirit  and from the belief of Libya and its Revolutionary Command that all the problems of the African continent should be solved within it and through its own organization  and out of his awareness of its responsibility for solving internal African problems. Colonel Mu'Ammar Qaddafi  the leader of the Revolution  took the initiative of declaring  on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the OAU  Libya's recognition of the present Government of Chad  and expressed Libya's readiness to offer all aid and support to the Chadian people and the restoration of full diplomatic relations between the two countries. This was an indication of our good will and firm determination to forestall all imperialist attempts to escalate the crisis.We would like to assure the General Assembly  and our African brothers in particular  that we abide by what we have already communicated and that a joint communiquÃ© was issued yesterday to restore diplomatic relations with Chad  confirming our willingness to restore peace and co-operation and to settle disputes by peaceful means.For a long time  my country was subjected to abhorrent fascist invasion  occupation and colonization  which cost hundreds of thousands of our inhabitants their lives. It was also an arena for major military operations in the Second World War  during which Libya lost large numbers of innocent civilians. My country still faces the problems of the aftermath of this war as a result of the surplus materiel and mines left by the warring parties on Libyan soil. My country took the initiative of raising this question at the international level a few years ago. Many resolutions were adopted concerning this problem  in which States responsible for deploying this debris were called upon to provide necessary information  help in its removal  and pay for the material and human losses inflicted. Nevertheless  the States concerned have not co-operated in any positive way and are still reluctant to implement the relevant decisions of international forums. We therefore renew our appeal to the international community to take appropriate measures to ensure that an urgent solution to this problem will be found.We are aware of the international community's growing concern at terrorist acts that result in loss of life  and we share its conviction that specific international criteria must be developed to ensure a clear distinction between outright terrorism  which must be eradicated  and the lawful and just struggles of peoples fighting against imperialism  racism and foreign domination and for self-determination and the defence of their freedom  their sovereignty  and their very existence.Certain Powers prefer to see legitimate struggle as terrorism  whereas those same Powers are the sources of terrorism unleashed upon peoples as a main ingredient in the imperialistic policies and designs of these Powers. My country  which has constantly and as a matter of principle supported the cause of national liberation throughout the world  has itself fallen victim to State terrorism. Accordingly  we reaffirm our support for the convening of an international conference  under the auspices of the United Nations  to define the concept of terrorism.Within the framework of our concern for human rights  and out of our belief in the importance of human freedom and dignity as the main ingredients of progress and development in any society  my country took historic and concrete steps in this field. These steps were crowned by the principal popular conferences in the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya with the proclamation of the Human Rights Document legalizing the true enjoyment of all civil  economic social and cultural rights in the Jamahiriya community.We sincerely hope that these actions will contribute to the strengthening of human rights at the international level  especially as we shall be celebrating during this session of the General Assembly  here in this Hall  the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  an enormous international assemblage encompassing the great majority of the members of the international community  is still a prominent and influential component in international relations. This Movement plays a prominent part in reducing tension and strengthening international peace and security. It is also a symbol of resistance on the part of peoples to their polarization by the super-Powers and their policies of hegemony  dominance and dependence. As a member of that movement and one which has great faith in its role and objectives  Libya commends anew the approach and achievements of the Movement and asserts its adherence to its principles. Libya hopes that the spirit of solidarity and integration will flourish among the members of the Movement  helping them to confront all expansionist  imperialist schemes.Having followed the recent developments in the Gulf region with great concern  ray country welcomes the cease-fire and the agreement readied between the two war-weary Muslim States  Iraq and Iran  for the peaceful settlement of their problems. Libya  which has sincerely striven to stop this war ever since it began  is pleased to witness its imminent end and to see the Gulf area turn into a tranquil lake enjoying peace  security and stability  with the potential strengths of these two States channelled to face the real enemy that threatens our entire Arab and Muslim peoples  the Zionist enemy. We believe that true peace and security can be achieved in the area only with die withdrawal of all foreign military fleets from the Arabian Gulf.In this connection  I should like to commend the sincere efforts made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to put an end to that war.My country  which has actively contributed to the efforts to solve the Cyprus question  would like to stress that a just  lasting and peaceful settlement of this problem must be based on the unity  sovereignty and non-aligned status of Cyprus  and must guarantee the rights of both the Greek and the Turkish communities.In supporting the endeavours of the United Nations in this respect we stress the need to dismantle foreign imperialistic bases in the area for they threaten the security and integrity not only of the island but also of the entire Mediterranean Sea basin.My country also expresses its satisfaction at the conclusion in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations of the agreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan to settle the question of the brother people of Afghanistan.My country reiterates its support for the hopes and aspirations of the Korean people to reunify the two parts of Korea and calls for the creation of a favourable climate for this reunification without any foreign interference.The situation in Central America and the Caribbean has become more volatile and dangerous as the peoples of Nicaragua Cuba El Salvador Grenada and Panama have been subjected to a series of blatant imperialist provocations and interventions. In emphasizing our support for the efforts of the Contadora Group and the Guatemala agreement as the appropriate basis for the solution of the problems in the area we proclaim our solidarity with those peoples in their honourable struggle for freedom and sovereignty.This session is being held less than three months after the conclusion of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. Although that session was held at a time of international detente  especially in the area of negotiations on complex and intricate disarmament issues and coincided with the Moscow summit meeting between the two super-Powers it failed to achieve any tangible results  in spite of the world-wide interest shown and the hopes that mankind placed in it. We believe  however  that the convening of the discussion at that session can be regarded as one more moderate step on the thorny path to disarmament.It seems that the whole world agrees that nuclear  chemical and other weapons of mass destruction represent the main threat to mankind. The complexity of this issue is increased by the determination of certain nuclear super-Powers to engage in the abhorrent race to develop new types of these weapons  devoting vast material resources to finance research and other programmes related to them. While mankind welcomes some aspects of detente and looks forward to more and better agreements on the reduction of stockpiles devastating nuclear weapons on our planet  it sees at the same time the development of terrifying programmes and plans to militarise outer space. In this context  we should like to refer in particular to the so-called Star Wars programme - the strategic defence initiative. The American Administration is determined to pursue this and to persuade the largest possible number of States to adopt it.As a signatory of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  my country supports all regional and international efforts to curb the nuclear-arms race. As we welcome the recent agreement between the two super-Powers on the elimination of intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles  despite its serious limitations  we hope that the results of the Moscow summit will lead to enhanced detente  to further reductions of nuclear weapons and  ultimately  to their destruction. Until this goal is reached  we stress the need  pending attainment of this goal  for guarantees for non-nuclear States against the use or threat of use of these weapons. In this context  we affirm the right of these States to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Nevertheless  the fact that the two racist regimes in occupied Palestine and South Africa have acquired nuclear capability confirms the belief in Africa and the Arab region in general that imbalance and Instability will continue in these two important regions.We support the principle of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones anywhere in the world  including Africa  the Mediterranean and the Middle East  although we believe that this goal will remain out of reach because circumstances favourable to its attainment have not been created.As for Africa  the racist regime in Pretoria  with collaboration with certain major Western States  represents a stumbling-block to relieving the continent from the threat of the proliferation and use of nuclear weapons  which is the nightmare of African countries.In the Middle East  the presence of the racist Zionist entity in the occupied territories of Palestine  its involvement in the Star Wars programme and its strategic collaboration with the United States represent a constant threat not only to the States of the region  but also to the States of the Mediterranean end African regions  especially if one takes into account the continuous nuclear collaboration between that entity and the racist regime in Pretoria. We reiterate in this respect that the persistence of certain Powers in supporting these two racist regimes intensifies tensions in both regions and represents a threat to international peace and security.Another phenomenon that causes grave concern in Africa  in particular  and merits high priority today is the marked increase in the dumping of nuclear and toxic wastes in Africa by certain States  industrial concerns and transnational corporations. In strongly condemning these immoral practices  which are a crime against Africa and its peoples  we endorse the relevant resolution adopted by the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity at its forty-eighth session. My country will always reaffirm the central role and major responsibility of the United Nations in the field of disarmament and the great importance of the World Disarmament Campaign and other United Nations initiatives to sensitise world public opinion and keep it informed about disarmament issues and the relationship between disarmament and development.The current international economic situation is another important issue that could threaten international peace and security. The worsening of the economic crisis is shown by  inter alia  the sharp decline in the prices of commodities  the doubling of the external debt-burden of developing countries and the depletion of their financial resources  the prevalence of poverty  disease and famine as a result of drought and conflict and the policies of economic coercion adopted by certain developed countries which apply economic blockades and embargoes and impose unfair terms of trade.There is no doubt that the main reason for this crisis is the imbalance inherent in the existing international economic order. All efforts to reform this unjust order have failed because they have been mere formalities with the aim of alleviating the crisis  but not at improving the order. The only way to reform it is by restructuring it in line with the realities of the current international economic and political circumstances  which are completely different from those at its inception.The present economic order has become a major obstacle to developing countries  which did not take part in determining its nature  since most of them were subjected to imperialistic hegemony in its economic and political forms. The dilemma facing these countries following independence arises from the fact that the economic order does not respond to their just demand for equality and participation in international economic decision-making. The international community has recognized the need to change the international economic order. This was stated clearly in the resolution on the new international economic order adopted at the seventh special session of the General Assembly. Regrettably  it is clear now that recognizing reality is one thing  but having the will to change it is an entirely different matter. Many years have passed since the adoption of that resolution  but the intransigence of developed countries has hampered efforts aimed at changing the international economic order and implementing the United Nations resolutions on the new international economic order.The developing countries are convinced that their economic and social development cannot be attained under the old order  so they are determined to change it. They have made strenuous efforts to this end since 'the late l960s. To these efforts we owe the establishment of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  the holding of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly and the adoption of the proposals for the global round of negotiations and on the International Development Strategy.Despite all these efforts  the hopes of the developing countries have not been fulfilled  because of the failure of developed countries to honour their commitments in the field of development assistance. The developing countries have realized that co-operation among themselves is the right way to bring about political and economic solidarity. This co-operation is also an important means of attaining economic and social development in those States. This co-operation acquired greater significance when the dialogue with developed States floundered  for the developed States wanted the dialogue to further their own interests  regardless of the critical needs of developing countries. Co-operation among developing countries has made considerable progress. My country  which has consistently supported this co-operation as a sound basis for the achievement of its development objectives  strives to consolidate this co-operation. It has concluded economic and technical co-operation agreements with a large number of developing countries  and has also provided them with long-term loans and assistance. We believe that the developing countries should not be over-optimistic concerning the outcome of the North-South dialogue  but should begin laying a sound foundation of co-operation among themselves  so as to enter upon these talks from a position of strength.In conclusion  we express the hope that the results of this session will measure up to the aspirations of mankind for a better world in which peace  prosperity and justice prevail."
"84",4087,"LCA",43,1988,"ï»¿I ask the President to accept our congratulations on his election and elevation to his most illustrious and profoundly important position. We are not unaware of his formidable credentials  and I am as confident as we all are that this session will be as fruitful as any.After several years of being shunted into the shadows  of having its moral authority undermined  and consequently driven into decline  the United Nations is again on the ascendancy  though still threatened by the ultimate modern Damoclean sword of financial strangulation. Once again  the phoenix rises from the ashes  as it rose some 43 years ago from the burning heat and debris of conventional and nuclear conflagration  man's greatest folly.Four and a half decades ago we fought the war to end all wars. But the result left us angry and bitter  locked in a new cold war and frightened  because the result of that war was the birth of a new weapons system that in itself had the power to end all wars. But to end all wars - indeed to end it all - we should have to use the new weapons system  whose use would end everything  would end us all. But the solution had itself created a new problem. So we created the United Nations to do for us what we could not do for ourselves: stop the ridiculous carnage.But the Organization quickly got in the way of ambitious men  men of power> so we sidestepped it  emasculated it  asked it not to interfere  and turned to it only when convenient to seek maximum propaganda value for our cause. We thus created a vast dichotomy between what we say within the Organization and what we do without. That is a fact.Thirty years ago  while still standing in the rubble of the Second World War  we joined  with alacrity  in adopting a General Assembly resolution calling for general and complete disarmament and charged this Organization to oversee it. Yet  since that time we have more than quadrupled our military expenditure in real terms to over $1 trillion a year  all the time adopting more resolutions  now almost 1 000  calling for serious measures towards disarmament. That is also a fact.The paramount raison d'Ãªtre of the United Nations really must be that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. We all share this view. Nevertheless  we have stockpiled over 13 000 megatons of them  just in case. And since a nuclear war cannot be won  those whose ambition it is to win wars roust fight conventional ones  and so we have had more than 150 in the last 40 years  killing more people than those that died in the last great war. That is yet another fact.Upon the Organization we piled indignity upon indignity  and allowed it to become nothing more than our best excuse. When we looked into the mirror of the United Nations we saw not ourselves  but a giant piece of machinery  infused with energy to do work. So the United Nations should keep the peace  we said; and our citizens believed it. It is no wonder that they began to lose hope not in their Government  but in the United Nations ~ faith misguided. I am proud to say that Saint Lucia was not among those who had lost hope  and we will never lose hope in the importance  effectiveness  or continued viability of this Organization.From the initial use of the term ""United Nations"" by the American President Franklin Roosevelt  through the San Francisco Charter  to the official dawn of this Organization on 24 October 1945  the United Nations as an organization has been locked in a battle for supremacy of will over the always parochial  often bellicose  actions and intentions of nation States. We are often reminded by our Secretary-General that the United Nations is not a supranational authority. It cannot  without the combined will of all the members of the Security Council  impose its own will upon its Members. It is an Organization made up of independent and sovereign nations. But the Organization has no sovereignty of its own  so it can only initiate  harmonize and encourage its Members to take effective actions which are in keeping with the spirit of the Charter.In many respects  then  this remarkable Organization  despite the machinations of Member States  has proven to be exceedingly resourceful in meeting the challenges that daily confront it. So  once again  exhausted by the international tribulations of our own creation  we turn to it in a desperate search for respite.We have always looked to the Organization in the social and economic spheres  but now it seems that we have returned to it in attempting to solve our political problems. For the past eight years Saint Lucia has been among those countries that have called for the preservation of the sovereignty  territorial integrity  political independence and non-aligned character of Afghanistan. We have also repeatedly reaffirmed the right of the Afghan people to determine their own form of and to choose their economic  political and social system free from outside intervention  subversion  coercion or constraint of any kind whatsoever. We also called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan  and urged all parties concerned to work for the urgent achievement of a political solution in accordance with the spirit of the Charter  and the creation of the necessary conditions that would enable the Afghan refugees to return voluntarily to their homes in safety and honour.Thanks to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General  and his representative  Mr. Diego Cordovez  we witnessed the conclusion of the Geneva Accords last April as a major point of departure in the long effort to find a peaceful solution to the situation in Afghanistan. We therefore urge all parties to live up to the letter and spirit of the Geneva Accords so that we may soon realize the outcome which we all desire.The fratricidal eight-year-long armed conflict between Iraq and Iran has been among the bloodiest in this century. From the start of the war in 1980  the United Nations has been active through various channels in trying to get the parties to compose their differences. Saint Lucia is gratified by the cease-fire that was finally secured on 20 August this year. We urge both parties to bring the necessary political will and flexibility to the table to assure the effectuation of a just and lasting peace in the region.The question of Cyprus  too  has for long been a troubling one. We have dealt with this question  in one aspect or another  for the past 25 years. The decision by the leaders of the two sides  upon an initiative of the Secretary-General  to meet without any pre-conditions and to attempt to achieve by 1 June 1989 a negotiated settlement of all aspects of the Cyprus problem is particularly welcome at this time. Also in South-East Asia there has been positive movement. Nine years ago  the General Assembly called upon all States to refrain from any interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea and resolved that the people of Kampuchea should be enabled to choose democratically their own government without outside interference  subversion or coercion. Saint Lucia has actively supported this principle every year since then. We are therefore heartened that  encouraged by indications that all parties concerned are now interested in achieving a political solution to the problem  the Secretary-General has presented to the parties a number of specific ideas intended to facilitate the elaboration of a framework for a comprehensive political settlement. We urge them to consider those ideas seriously.Since 1946 we have dealt with the question of Namibia at 42 successive sessions  at three special sessions  and at one emergency special session of the General Assembly. We have repeatedly demanded that the apartheid regime of South Africa immediately and unconditionally withdraw its illegal administration  occupation army and police force from Namibia  but the racist regime has persisted in its refusal to comply with the resolutions and decisions of the Security Council  thus violating the principles of the Charter and defying the authority of the United Nations.After more than four decades of intransigence on the part of South Africa  there are now some signs of movement in the right direction. Saint Lucia fervently hopes that the Brazzaville agreements will be successful.The South African regime has thumbed its nose at the international community for so long. We hope  however  that these first steps in the right direction ate merely the beginning of a journey which will lead soon to the release of Nelson Mandela and the dismantling of the heinous apartheid system.Saint Lucia is encouraged by the atmosphere of conciliation which seems to surround the peace plan of the Secretary-General and the head of the Organization of African Unity that was submitted to the concerned parties in Western Sahara. We hope that this spirit of conciliation will lead to a speedy  just and lasting negotiated solution to this problem. The situation in the Middle East remains our most intractable problem. Saint Lucia wishes to reiterate its view that the question of Palestine is at the core of the conflict in the Middle East and that no comprehensive  just and lasting peace in the region can be achieved without the full exercise by the Palestinian people of its inalienable national rights and the immediate withdrawal of Israel to internationally recognized and secure boundaries.In the Korean peninsula  the problem of a divided Korea is also still with us  and Saint Lucia looks forward to the peaceful reunification of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Saint Lucia therefore welcomes the continuation of dialogue among all parties concerned with a view to achieving this objective  and we believe that  in the interim  membership of the United Nations for both Koreas will not hinder the attainment of that goal.Saint Lucia is concerned that there seems to be a reduction in momentum of the Esquipulas II agreement of the five Central American Presidents signed on 7 August last year. We continue to support a peaceful  negotiated solution to the conflicts in Central America.In the Caribbean itself  we have been concerned at the developments that have occurred in our sister country of Haiti. Over the past year  Saint Lucia has repeatedly called for a return to the democratic process  for selection by election  and not by dictation  for the fulfilment of the provisions of the new Haitian Constitution  and for the creation of an opportunity for the re-flowering and rebirth of the spirit of a people whose forefathers pioneered the path to freedom in this hemisphere. It is not too late. We urge the new leaders in Haiti to seize the time to launch their country firmly on the path of democratic process  as so many other dictatorships in the hemisphere have recently done. Those who first lit the revolutionary torch so many decades ago should not now be lagging behind in the wake of change. The region awaits a new and democratic Haiti. The people of Haiti desire it. The moment is in their hands.We approach the end of the third United Nations Development Decade with many of the developing countries poorer now than they were 10 years ago. International political gains cannot be sustained without concomitant international economic development. With decreasing per capita gross national product in many countries  deteriorating terms of trade in others  and still others staggering under Tolstoyan debt burdens  the developing countries face an uncertain future. These problems are compounded by an alarmingly high level of net transfers of resources from the developing to the developed countries  and a sharp fall in resource flows to the developing countries. In Latin America and the Caribbean  chronic poverty still plagues more than 130 million people  or over one third of the aggregate population. And the debt burden hovers at $400 billion.We need to deal with these problems quickly and effectively. My delegation therefore strongly supports both the convening of an international conference on money and finance for development  with universal participation  and the convening of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the reactivation of economic growth in the developing countries.We are all in sympathy with the peoples of Jamaica and Mexico who suffered so terribly from the devastation of hurricane Gilbert. We in Saint Lucia consider ourselves fortunate by comparison  having escaped with only a few million dollars' worth of damage  caused by flooding and landslides. We urge the international community to support the resolution on emergency assistance to Jamaica to be introduced later this year. In the past 20 years  natural disasters have claimed the lives of over 3 million people and caused more than 323 billion in damage. We in the small island developing countries are particularly prone since natural disasters show a marked concentration in tropical and sub-tropical climates. Hurricanes  tropical cyclones and typhoons are essentially a feature of warm oceans and coastal regions. Over larger land masses and temperate seas their violence decreases rapidly.In this century alone  in my own sub-region  hurricanes have struck Barbados  Cuba  Dominica  the Dominican Republic  Haiti  Jamaica and my own country. Many of these Islands have been hit several times. Volcanic eruptions have devastated Guadeloupe  Martinique and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Earthquakes have caused damage in Antigua and Barbuda  the Dominican Republic  Jamaica and Puerto Rico.The effects of any disaster are more pronounced for a small island than for a larger country with a wide variety of products  back-up facilities and resources for recovery. We therefore eagerly lend our support to the adoption of General Assembly resolution 42/169. Last year  the 1990s were designated as the international decade for natural disaster reduction  a decade in which the international community  under the auspices of the United Nations  will pay special attention to fostering international co-operation in the field of natural disaster reduction. We commend the Secretary-General for his efficiency in establishing an international ad hoc experts group for the international decade.But  as if natural disasters such as Hurricane Gilbert were not enough trouble for the island developing countries of the Caribbean  we in this region are being threatened with man-made catastrophes  potentially more devastating. Over the past year  Caribbean countries have been alarmed at reports that a number of companies  particularly in the United States  were making arrangements to dump tons of hazardous industrial and nuclear waste in the Caribbean. In fact  in one recent particularly callous incident  a ship dumped such waste on a beach in Haiti after Haitian authorities had denied it permission to enter its territory. A few months later  the Caribbean was placed on the alert for another such ship which seemed headed for our waters with another shipment of that horrible cargo.The dangers of toxic waste for the Caribbean are enormous  even more so than for those countries of affluence which refuse to accept their own industrial effluence. Given the porous nature of the soils in the tropical Caribbean  the toxins contained in the waste can spread rapidly through the food chain. The threat therefore is not merely to our tourism industry from the damage to our beadles  but to life itself - to marine life  the environment  to human life. In the small islands of the Caribbean  life as we know it can therefore easily disappear.We call upon those countries whose companies are engaged in this nefarious activity to take action to halt this trend. We are particularly concerned where secret deals and arrangements are worked out between some companies and Government officials  where waste is shipped under false labels  and we urge our sister Caribbean countries to be vigilant In this regard and to preserve the integrity and purity of our environment. We are encouraged that the United Nations In the spirit of General Assembly resolution 42/183 (1987) which condemned waste trafficking  is attempting to regulate the trade  and we hope that the international community will adopt the proposed global Convention on the control of trans-boundary movements of hazardous waste when it becomes ready for signature in 1989. In general  as we approach a thirteenth-year review  as it were  of the special needs of island developing States  we are pleased that there is a growing recognition of the special problems and needs of island developing countries as reflected in the resolutions passed unanimously in the General Assembly over the past decade on island developing countries  and in the Declaration of the twelfth Annual Meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of Seventy-Seven.Since the early 1970s the work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has contributed to a better understanding of island developing countries and has been a determining factor in assisting the international community to recognize their specific problems. Numerous analytical and descriptive studies have shown that small island developing countries have characteristics distinct from those of developing countries in general. As a result  the type of development strategy regarded as appropriate in general is  in many respects  inappropriate for those countries in particular.As we undertake the long-overdue review of the question of island developing countries this year  my delegation hopes that we can move from the stage of the purely academic to one of putting in place specific mechanisms to assist those countries in particular and effective ways.We now have  so to speak  a second chance to make this Organization what it was supposed to be  In 1969  U Thant  then Secretary-General  warned us that we had little time left in which to subordinate our ancient quarrels and launch a global partnership to curb the arms race  to improve the human environment  to defuse the population explosion and to give the required momentum to development efforts. And  to be sure  it is a truism  as laid down in the principles of the Inter-Allied Declaration of 12 June 1941 that: ""The only true basis of enduring peace is the willing co-operation of free peoples in a world in which  relieved of the menace of aggression  all may enjoy economic and social security. It is up to us.""Î second dawn has broken and a new opportunity arisen to take a truly global approach to solving hat  in the final analysis  are all global problems. Let us not waste this second chance.   "
"85",4160,"LKA",43,1988,"ï»¿Let me at the outset  on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka  extend to Mr. Caputo of Argentina  our sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-third session. My delegation would like to assure him of our support and full co-operation in the tasks ahead.Our appreciation is also due to Mr. Peter Florin  who discharged his duties as President of the forty-second session with skill  devotion and responsibility.We applaud the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces as richly deserved recognition of the impressive record of the United Nations in keeping peace throughout the world. We congratulate the Secretary-General and his dedicated team on this fitting tribute. Three years ago  with considerable enthusiasm  we commemorated the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. A year later  hardly had the euphoria of that celebration evaporated than we were confronted with the prospect that the United Nations might not even be able to survive  because of budgetary constraints. International diplomacy  never at a loss for words  diagnosed this situation and described it as a crisis for multilateralism  a crisis brought about by unilateralism. Unilateralism seemed to be prevailing over multilateralism.Most dramatically  bilateralism  involving principally the Soviet Union and the United States  led to the conclusion of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - widely accepted as the first real measure of disarmament  as distinct from the mere control or limitation of arms. The Moscow summit meeting also brought forth agreement that further bilateral efforts would be exerted towards the reduction by half of the super-Power strategic nuclear arsenals and towards a step-by-step halting of nuclear testing. The international community has welcomed these developments with enthusiasm.The third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  a few months ago  offered the first major international forum for an assessment of international security and disarmament issues in the light of these new developments. Despite a greatly improved context of international relations in comparison with the first and second special sessions on disarmament  the third special session belied our expectations. The nexus between bilateral progress and multilateral advance did not prove to be automatic. The third special session's failure to produce a consensus final document seemed contrary to the hopeful developments of the time. In a sense  we have witnessed an encounter between bilateral approaches and multilateral demands  but the encounter has not been as discouraging as in the past. Nevertheless  the session recognized  but failed to document  the interdependent nature of the broad spectrum of global issues and the need for multilateral co-operation in their solution. If time ran out before a consensus document could be finalized  it must only mean that the exercise must continue on the basis of the many valuable proposals and ideas presented during the session.In the Conference on Disarmament  the sole multilateral negotiating body of which Sri Lanka is a member  the hope of multilateral negotiations on a range of nuclear items has been frustrated. No progress is recorded in the report of the Conference  for example  on the priority issue of negotiating a total ban on nuclear testing. The purpose envisaged in the 1963 Partial Test-Ban Treaty is not to regulate and thereby condone testing below a certain threshold but to eliminate decisively all testing. As a parallel measure to discussions in the Conference on Disarmament Indonesia  Mexico  Peru  Sri Lanka  Venezuela and Yugoslavia have requested an amendment conference of States parties to the 1963 Treaty to consider its conversion into a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The Foreign Ministers of the countries members of the Non-Aligned Movement who met at Nicosia last month have endorsed that initiative.A collective approach has been sought in the Conference on the Prevention of an Arms race in Outer Space  the common heritage of mankind  which should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. The existing legal regime now applicable to outer space has played a significant role  but  given the rapidity of technological and strategic developments  it is insufficient to prevent the emplacement of weapons in outer space. My delegation will make every effort at this session of the General Assembly to continue with our initiatives to build the necessary consensus and move forward in this vital area. The recent use of chemicals weapons has been universally condemned  sustained negotiations have been pursued in the Conference on Disarmament towards the conclusion of a treaty banning the development  production  stockpiling and use of all chemical weapons. Some important issues remain unresolved  while the settlement of others has been delayed unduly. Considerable achievements have also been made in work between the two major chemical-weapons possessors  and we have noted the initiatives announced in this forum last week.This session of the General Assembly will consider the question of preparing for the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons scheduled for 1990. As a State party to the Treaty  Sri Lanka naturally has a keen interest in facilitating a successful review of the obligations under that Treaty in all their aspects. We hope that agreement could be reached at this session to formulate a smooth preparatory process.A disarmament exercise that began as a Sri Lankan initiative with the support of non-aligned countries has long since acquired both regional and international dimensions. Following the 1971 Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  States of the region held a conference in 1979 that adopted seven principles of agreement for the implementation of the Declaration. Those included the non-use of force  non-interference in the internal affairs of States  the peaceful settlement of disputes and the freedom of peaceful navigation. Considerable work on issues of substance relating to the conference has already been accomplished by the Ad Hoc Committee. A consensus has been patiently built up now for the conference to be convened at Colombo at a date not later than 1990. Sri Lanka  particularly given the vastly improved international climate  expects that the concerned States will abide by the consensus. Since we last met the United Nations has succeeded in its negotiations in respect of Afghanistan  with the conclusion in April of this year of the Geneva Agreement. Sri Lanka congratulates the statesmanship displayed by all parties that made the agreement possible and hopes that that will remain in evidence during the implementation. We look forward to the conclusion of a comprehensive settlement of all issues to the satisfaction of all the people of the Afghan nation. Similarly  in the Gulf conflict too the conciliatory mechanisms of the United Nations  particularly the Security Council  have proved their efficacy. It has been Sri Lanka's consistent position that that wasteful war should be ended  and a solution acceptable to both parties must be found. Therefore  Sri Lanka welcomes the decision of the Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Iraq to co-operate with the Secretary-General's representative to reach a comprehensive  honourable and enduring solution to that tragic conflict.There are positive indications to be seen in the question of Cyprus as well  for which the United Nations once more can claim some credit. An essentially domestic inter-communal issue in Cyprus has been aggravated by the foreign occupation of part of its territory and by illegal unilateral actions towards separatism. However  under the auspices of the Secretary-General  talks have been resumed between the President of the Republic of Cyprus and the representative of the Turkish Cypriot community with a view to resolving the Cyprus problem in all its aspects.In respect of Kampuchea  direct negotiations have brought hopes for an abatement of tensions infecting the entire region. The Djakarta meeting held in July this year brought together all parties concerned.. Sri Lanka is pledged to support and reinforce the Djakarta initiative.In the Middle East the continued denial of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people persists as the root cause of the unrest in the region. The uprising in Israeli-occupied territory has acquired heroic proportions  and brutal attempts to suppress it have only strengthened the resistance to the occupation. A just  durable peace that guarantees security for all States and peoples in the region  including the Palestinians  can only be ensured by the withdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied Palestinian and Arab territories. It is Sri Lanka's position that settlements illegally established must be dismantled and demographic changes thrust upon the occupied territories must be rendered null and void. Sri Lanka supports the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East called by the General Assembly in resolution 35/58 C as Ð° means of a achieving a just and comprehensive solution to the complex of issues that is called the Middle East question.  It is essential that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  participate in the Conference on an equal footing with all other parties directly concerned in the Israeli-Arab conflict.The path to Namibian independence has long since been charted by Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Sri Lanka salutes the Namibian people's struggle for self-determination and national independence in a united and undivided Namibia. It is our sincere hope that independent Namibia will occupy its seat in the community of nations in the near future. The recent developments  which have led to talks involving Angola  Cuba  South Africa and the United States are welcome in that they seek a negotiated and peaceful settlement of some issues of conflict in the region.As in Namibia  so also in the entire southern African region  the apartheid policies of the Government of South Africa foster violence and conflict. Within South Africa the situation has deteriorated  with inhuman racist laws continuing to violate all norms of civilized behaviour  and with the ruthless security forces indulging in mass arrests and detention and causing injury and death to innocent civilians. Outside its borders  South African forces have committed acts of aggression against independent neighbouring African States whose only offence has been the defence of their sovereignty and freedom and the championing of the anti-apartheid cause. International pressure on the apartheid regime must continue to be increased. Comprehensive mandatory sanctions  to be imposed by the Security Council  have been declared the most effective peaceful means of dismantling apartheid.Let me now turn to the international economic scene. Global economic co-operation in real terms has been in a state of virtual atrophy. In roost developing countries the development process has been seriously handicapped  and in some even reversed. Real interest rates have swung upwards. Exchange rates have been fluctuating. The prices of primary commodities have drastically slumped and protectionist measures in certain import markets have aggravated their overall impact in developing countries. Development assistance has been reduced. The debt burden has had a debilitating impact on the economies of developing countries.Only a rational concerted effort on the part of the entire global community can help re-order the prevailing insecure economic situation.In respect of the debt issue  furthering the consensus achieved at the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  it was proposed in the Conference's trade and development report that the current inadequate strategy of domestic adjustment and new lending be complemented by a wider recourse to consensual  orderly and systematic reduction of interest charges as stock of debt  in particular by debt forgiveness. The assumption behind those proposals is that countries benefiting from debt reduction could strengthen policies to improve efficiency of investment and achieve a substantial improvement in the export performance of indebted countries.Allied to this  and assuming great significance  are the complex trade negotiations of the Uruguay Round  which concern a variety of issues of crucial importance  particularly to developing countries. These include tropical and natural-resource-based products  tariffs  non-tariff barriers  and textiles andclothing. Unfortunately  the pursuit of unilateral trading gains has led to some trading entities callously bypassing the regulations and principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In sectors most crucial to developing countries seeking export markets  for example in the field of textiles and clothing  deviations from GATT principles are clearly evident.  The commitment of major import markets to promoting easier access for the exports of developing countries is one which needs to be fulfilled with greater devotion and sincerity. Specifically  a measure oÂ£ true understanding would be a rollback of current non-tariff barriers coupled with other measures to improve market access. Strict compliance with the standstill and rollback commitments reaffirmed at Punta del Este is vital to the success of the Uruguay Round. Developing countries should also be given credit in the Uruguay Round for unilateral measures of trade liberalization taken under programmes of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. A challenge for international economic co-operation is before us at the mid-term review of the Uruguay Round in Montreal this December by the ministerial session of the GATT's Trade Negotiations Committee.Concomitant with economic co-operation between developed and developing countries  economic co-operation among developing countries is also vital. The agreement on a global system of trade preferences reached recently is a step in the right direction  and could not only strengthen the base for economic development but also help reduce the existing over dependence on developed countries. The adoption of the agreement on the global system  signed by 48 countries  was a historic step  and it is important that those that have not yet signed and ratified the Belgrade agreement do so soon.Permit me at this stage to refer to two initiatives in the area of development co-operation in which Sri Lanka is deeply involved. Sri Lanka took an initiative in the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee in 1981 which called for a study of marine resources and their development potential in the Indian Ocean region. In January 1987  following careful study and preparation at expert level  the Indian Ocean Marine Affairs Conference was held at ministerial level in Sri Lanka to formulate a broad co-operative framework for developing the marine-affairs capabilities of the Indian Ocean States. A standing committee has since been established to guide its programme. We see this as an essential step in consolidating the benefits of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. We believe that this venture could benefit further from the infusion of material and technical support from all sources.Last year the international community participated in observing the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless  declared by the United Nations on the initiative of the Honourable R. Premadasa  Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. The proposal by the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat) for a global strategy for shelter to the year 2000  formulated in response to a consensus call by this Assembly in resolution 42/191  is the next logical step in our collective endeavours to meet the shelter needs of deprived millions. The widespread support enjoyed at the Economic and Social Council this summer is indicative of the political will to forge ahead with necessary material support. We look forward to the transformation of this political will into concrete action through a genuinely global venture as an exemplary exercise in multilateral co-operation.In Sri Lanka where we have over the past few years had to withstand and overcome grave threats to our sovereignty and territorial integrity and face violent challenges to our cherished democratic institutions  we have still to banish the ugly phenomenon of violence and terrorism. The 13th Constitutional Amendment devolving a substantial measure of power from the centre to the provincial councils will have been fully implemented when elections to the North-Eastern Provinces take place in November. Thus  the fundamental restructuring of our post-colonial policy to accommodate the aspirations of all sections of our people for direct and active participation in the governing of our multi-ethnic  multi-lingual  multi-religious nation will have been completed.In the last few months  we have  in the tradition of our parliamentary democracy  held elections to seven of the eight Provincial Councils  In July four by-elections to Parliament were held  and this month another; and in December of this year a new President will be elected to succeed His Excellency President J. R. Jayewardene  who completes his constitutionally stipulated two terms of office. The democratic process is therefore as active in our small country as it has been since 1931  57 years ago  when universal adult franchise was introduced in Sri Lanka.I am confident that with the innate wisdom of the people of Sri Lanka  enriched by a unique historical tradition of over 2 000 years and drawing on the religious philosophies flourishing in the country  Sri Lanka will press forward with the irreversible process of the healing of past wounds and the rehabilitation of the injury inflicted on our nation in human  political  social and economic terms. A period of peace and stability in which development can be accelerated is what our people richly deserve. And they will secure it for themselves through our democratic process  rejecting violence and anarchy.The imperative of international co-operation  which is really what multilateralism is all about  applies to political and security issues  to economic and environmental issues and to social and humanitarian issues. Arguments and appeals based on justice  equity and human compassion have been advanced in this forum to bring peace where there is violence and conflict  security where there is tension and fear  development where there is deprivation and want. If then these arguments  backed as they are by the injunctions of the United Nations Charter  need further justification  there is the pragmatic logic of necessity - the compulsion of mutual interest. We are all links in a chain of human and national interdependence. The prospect for human survival and development will be only as strong as the weakest link in that chain.When we speak of the United Nations or multilateral approaches  we must project our vision beyond this building  beyond the delegates' desks and national name plates  beyond the microphones and earphones and beyond the resolutions and speeches  and focus on the impact of our work on the millions of people we represent. The fact is that the fate of each nation is intrinsically fused with the fate of the entire planet. This is not so merely in the negative sense in that a common nuclear threat hangs over all of us. In a positive sense  the political  economic and ecological well-being and development of each nation has to be pursued in co-operation  rather than at variance  with others. Our planet's resources are finite and even the most economically developed State cannot pursue unilateral policies in isolation from the rest of the world."
"86",4202,"LSO",43,1988,"ï»¿On the auspicious occasion of the forty-third session of the General Assembly  I bring the Assembly fraternal greetings from His Majesty King Moshoeshoe II and the Government and people of the Kingdom of Lesotho.We are confident that under the wise leadership and guidance of the President the deliberations of this session of the Assembly will come to a fruitful conclusion.At this early juncture I wish also to avail myself of this opportunity to pay a special tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic  for the noble task accomplished during the hectic forty-second session.It is also worth noting that most of the positive achievements of the United Nations system during recent years are attributable to our ever-indefatigable Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  to whom we are ever grateful. The catalogue of his outstanding achievements is second to none; indeed  he continues to acquit himself with flourishing distinction.There is barely a decade to go before the turn of the century. This should be  for all of us  a moment of reflection as we seek to examine the future of mankind in the years that lie ahead. The pursuit of peace  as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  remains one of the loftiest challenges to humanity. Recent developments in international relations have signalled a definitive shift from a world characterized by confrontation to a world of reconciliation  mutual accommodation and tolerance. Increasingly the futility of war is dawning upon nations  as is the tenability of aggression and foreign domination.The emerging spirit of dialogue and co-operation has aroused great hope that the preservation of human civilization can be ensured. Moshoeshoe I  the founder of the Basotho nation  an eminent thinker of his time and a man of immense diplomatic skills  used to liken peace to his sister. We visualized peace as the mother of the community of nations  and hence the basis for the collective survival and security of nations large and small. Never before In contemporary history has the conscience of Mankind been so elevated with respect to full regard and respect for fundamental human rights. The inalienable right of peoples to national self-determination and independence the sanctity of human life and its dignity and the irrelevance of racism as a determinant factor in human interaction are now universally accepted as basic tenets of humanity  we have to rededicate ourselves and live up to the noble principles of human rights to ensure c better future for posterity.My country has great faith in the role of the United Nations system in promoting respect for international law. The quest for justice entails a commitment to the principle of equal rights for all peoples of the world. The founding fathers of the United Nations envisaged in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Statute of the International Court of Justice legal instruments to guarantee for future generations conditions of just peace  freedom and security for all.We applaud the initiatives now under way world-wide to resolve regional conflicts through peaceful means. We welcome the international community's growing awareness of the perils inherent in resorting to belligerency to settle disputes. We have reason to believe that the remaining hotbeds of tension in the world are on the verge of resolution given the current mood of reconciliation and goodwill among the nations of the world.It is a sad reality of our times that in spite of the heightened world-wide appreciation of the worth of human life poverty in the third world remains the most serious affront to human dignity. Poverty with its squalor the pangs of hunger the misery of disease and the despair resulting from unfulfilled dreams of the promise that cane with political independence remains a stark reminder of the blatant inequalities that characterise our modern world. There can never be hope for peace and stability in a world in which the abject poverty endured by the any  coexistence with the abundance and wastefulness enjoyed and practised by the few.Southern Africa continues to be a hotbed of tension and the situation in South Africa continues to be ever volatile. The problematic socio-political vicissitudes continue to come pouring in  not one by one but in sky-rocketing  astronomical figures. Black to blade conflict  bordering on ethnicity and ideological-political adherences and convictions  continues to soar. Racial tension and social imbalances are increasing. Should the world just sit bade and watch? I think not.The root cause of this uneasy malaise is the policy of apartheid. It is my considered opinion that peaceful pressure exerted on the Government of the Republic of South Africa regarding the dismantling of apartheid and the resolution of the conflict in Angola and Namibia is an effective tool that should be used to persuade the Republic of South Africa to come to terms with inescapable realities and initiate round-table negotiations with all the parties concerned in South Africa  without any discrimination.On less and until all men and women in South Africa participate in the political process and collectively determine their own destiny  lasting peace and harmony will not reign in South Africa. It is therefore imperative for all those countries in a position to do so to act promptly  before it is too late.Inextricably linked to the conflict in the Republic of South Africa is the question of refugees and displaced persons. The nexus is not difficult to identify. Most of the persons fleeing from the repercussions of the South African situation make Lesotho their first port of call. Because of its geographical location within the heart of South Africa Lesotho is easily accessible from South Africa. As a signatory to international instruments on refugees  Lesotho continues to abide by its obligations. We are a country that was founded on the fragmented pieces of ethnic groupings at a time when people were suffering and fleeing from the scourge of vicious and violent subregional strife. Therefore  it is only fitting that we should reaffirm our unswerving and steadfast commitment to provide sanctuary to all genuine refugees  without discrimination based upon race  creed or colour. This reaffirmation of our commitment was also made by my country during the recent Oslo Conference on the plight of refugees  returnees and displaced persons.The current diplomatic initiatives intended to lay the basis for the return of peace to Angola  independence for Namibia and the withdrawal of all foreign troops have given us great hope. It is to the credit and thanks to the foresightedness of the United Nations Security Council that  10 years after it adopted the celebrated resolution 435 (1978)  that resolution now appears to be receiving endorsement by all the parties concerned as the key to the long overdue attainment of independence by Namibia.The General Assembly has served the cause of decolonising Namibia with distinction. Hence  it is our conviction that it will accomplish with even greater distinction the tasks it will be called upon to shoulder in the period leading to Namibian independence. The world is awaiting with profound anxiety the carrying out of the stated intention of the Republic of South Africa to the implementation of resolution 435 (1978) by pulling out its administrative machinery from Namibia by the beginning of November this year. We are also hopeful that South Africa's gesture of withdrawing its forces  from Angola signifies the beginning of the end of hostilities in Angola.We are gratified to note the constructive role of the two super-Powers  the Soviet Union and the united States of America  in bringing their influence and prestige to bear in ensuring that a just and durable solution of this regional problem is arrived at.One other issue that has featured prominently on the United Nations General Assembly agenda for the past eight years is the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq  two Islamic countries bound together by commonality of cultures  traditions and beliefs and both member a of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United nations. We all stood and watched with horror and disbelief as those two sister countries rampantly expended their resources and energies on the destruction of each other's economic infrastructures and the disruption of shipping in the Gulf region.The United Nations took the lead in Making unsparing efforts towards the resolution of this conflict  and we are quite gratified to acknowledge that these efforts have not been in vain. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) has finally been accepted and earned its rightful place in the minds of those who are in a position to order the cessation of the hostilities. It is regrettable that this war  in which neither party has emerged as victor or vanquished  has resulted in the loss of so many human lives. We strongly believe that the war should not have been fought in the first instance. As we have already stated  many regional and subregional conflicts continue to be unresolved because of the lack of political will of the parties to the conflicts to adhere to guidelines enshrined in the United Nations Charter  such as non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  peaceful settlement of disputes and non-use of force  to mention only Ð° few.	Having regard to the foregoing  my delegation is of the opinion that the Palestinian issue would be resolved if an international conference were to be convened under the auspices of the United Nations  at which conference the issue would be thoroughly discussed and concrete proposals and plans for the resolution of the dispute drawn up so as to bring to an end this problem which has been on the agenda of this Organisation for such a long time.Acknowledgement of the right of Israel as a sovereign state within recognised and secure borders and the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland of their own and ultimately to independence and sovereignty is a sine qua non for a durable and pacific settlement of the Middle East crisis. In the meantime we appeal to all the parties Involved to exercise restraint and to desist from resorting to the use of force as an instrument for the settlement of the conflict.Despite numerous efforts by the United Nations to bring about lasting peace in Cyprus  the situation there remains contentious. We are  however  gratified to note that the Turkish and Greek Cypriots are now headed along a promising path towards resolution of the dispute. May the recent talks held between President Vasiliou and the Turkish Cypriot leader  Mr. Denktash  under the auspices of the. Secretary-General of the united Nations  Mr. Peres de Cuellar  herald the beginning of a new era in the politics of that troubled island  so that in the not too distant future Cyprus may once again enjoy its unity  which it has so long awaited. Lesotho continues to support all genuine efforts to resolve the  Central American problems and we support and fully endorse the Arias peace plan and the Contadora initiative which in our view constitute Ð° pragmatic framework through which the pain and suffering in Central America may be brought to an end.Thanks to the highly commendable mediation efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General and of the Organisation of African Unity  we are beginning to see a ray of hope on the horizon of the Western Sahara problem. The intended referendum  which we hope will be fair  should give the people of the Western Sahara an opportunity to exercise freely their right to determine their political destiny. No doubt the road to peace will also be greatly facilitated if the two parties to the dispute agree to open the channels of direct communication.The sons and daughters of Kampuchea rightly yearning for peace and a permanent resolution of the present political stalemate. For almost a decade the people of Kampuchea have experienced untold suffering  involving massive loss of life and destruction of property.The political and economic effects consequent upon the Kampuchean problem have not been felt in Asia alone they have been a daunting problem for the international community. We support the barrage of resolutions passed by our Organisation consistently calling for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea. Lesotho steadfastly continues to support the intent and spirit of those United Nations resolutions and will do so until they are fully and unconditionally observed and implemented.By the same token  Lesotho fully supports all the current moves and initiatives aimed at the reunification of the two Koreas and the return of true and lasting peace to the Korean peninsula.   We are hopeful that the economic recovery of the North will create conditions conducive to the uplifting of the South  with particular attention being paid to the special needs of the least developed countries. It is also our fervent hope that the recommendations relating to the developing countries made at the 1988 Toronto summit  especially those concerning debt relief  will be faithfully implemented.The mid-term review of the United Nations programme of action for Africa's economic recovery and development  conducted here at United Nations Headquarters just before the convening of the present session  revealed that Africa is in no better economic situation than it was when the programme was adopted in 1986. Africa's needs remain more acute than ever.It would be remiss of me to conclude my statement without expressing our heartfelt congratulations to the United Nations peace-keeping forces for the well-deserved Nobel Peace Prize awarded to them in recognition of the meritorious service they continue to render to the international common in the maintenance of international peace and security."
"87",4272,"LUX",43,1988,"ï»¿This General Assembly is meeting at a very auspicious time indeed. While last year we were talking about some improvement in international relations  we have to note that the movement begun  in particular by the United States and the USSR  is now opening up new prospects for peace in many conflicts and hotbeds of tension throughout the world.Actions by the United Nations and  above all  by the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  have been exemplary. The tireless work of our Secretary-General and of the distinguished colleagues surrounding him have given our Organization new prestige. Since the founding of the United Nations we have seldom found so many reasons to celebrate the events that have occurred in the course of the year.In disarmament the agreement on medium-range nuclear missiles is  for the first time  leading us towards the destruction of an entire category of weapons and in its wake the negotiations between the two super-Powers are continuing with a view to reducing strategic weapons by 50 per cent.There are now new prospects for a whole series of conflicts that are too often described as regional: in Afghanistan  between Iraq and Iran  in southern Africa  in Cyprus  in the Western Sahara and in Cambodia.In other zones of conflict or tension  the time is now one of detente or of rapprochement of parties which only yesterday were pitted one against the other. This is what is happening in the Horn of Africa  in the Maghreb and in Korea.In general terms these achievements and this progress have been the concrete manifestation of a substantial improvement in international relations. Every day we see new signs of a greater community of interests and of a growing convergence of views.But let us beware of euphoria.Let us make sure first of all that the agreements signed are respected and implemented in good faith. An agreement in principle  even a signature  does not always lead us to peace.For example  in Central America the Esquipulas II agreement  although signed  has not yet put an end to tension in the region.In the Middle East and in South Africa the situation has worsened. Other armed and bloody conflicts - and  alas  too little is said of them - ate also continuing. There is still a long and difficult road to travel as regards disarmament. Terrorism continues to wreak havoc and threatens the lives of innocent civilians. Unemployment  failure to respect minorities  the emergence of new inequalities  intolerance in the most varied forms  violations of human rights all daily feed tension  frustration and violence.The world economic and social situation also remains a disturbing one. Ecological challenges are increasingly disturbing also.As Europeans  we follow with particular interest developments now under way within the Soviet Union and in other countries in Eastern Europe. The changes that have been announced should lead to a thorough reform in those States through democratization of political bodies based on true transparency in public affairs and decentralization of the economic structures.The new Soviet foreign policy is characterized by a less dogmatic  more realistic and more pragmatic assessment of international events.There is no doubt that this development in the Soviet Union has contributed to a substantial improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.A perception of limits  even for super-Powers  in the field of military power and in the field of commitments to weapons abroad has promoted this change. The constraints of internal economic development and growing interdependence in a multipolar world no longer allows one State to dictate its will to another. And so it turns out that a solution to problems can more reliably be found through peaceful means  through dialogue  negotiation and co-operation.Who could fail to hail the rapprochement between the two super-Powers confirmed by the Washington and Moscow summit meetings?This logic has been applied also in Europe  where a new phase of dÃ©tente and co-operation has begun. Recognition of the European Community by various countries in Eastern Europe has now been achieved. Following the agreement signed at Luxembourg between our Community and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA)  negotiations are now under way with the countries of Eastern Europe with a view to the conclusion of agreements that can strengthen economic co-operation.At the follow-up Conference in Vienna  the 35 signatories of the Helsinki Final Act are about to agree on new orientations which deal  in particular  with respect for human rights and human contacts among all European citizens. I trust that its work will finish soon and that this will be followed by the opening of negotiations on conventional stability in Europe. The goal sought is twofold; first  to establish  through asymmetrical reductions  a stable  secure and verifiable balance of conventional forces in Europe at a lower level; and  secondly  to find new measures that can also help to consolidate trust and security in the wake of the Stockholm agreement.On the question of Afghanistan  the Government of Luxembourg supports respect for the Geneva Agreements by all the parties. We expect  inter alia  that the Soviet Union will soon conclude the complete withdrawal of its forces in accordance with the scheduled timetable. Unfortunately  however  we must note that fighting continues in that country  which prolongs the suffering of the Afghan people and delays the return of some 5 million refugees.It is only the establishment in Kabul of a truly independent and representative Government within the framework of a genuine process of self-determination - in other words  with the participation of all Afghans  including the resistance forces - that can make true peace possible  along with the reconstruction of the country  which has been devastated by eight years of occupation. My Government is willing to participate in the efforts based on international solidarity in support of the Afghan people. The world public welcomed with relief and tremendous satisfaction the halting of the murderous war between Iran and Iraq. That conflict lasted eight years  causing the death of more than 1 million young soldiers and civilians  the mutilation of hundreds of thousands of others and the destruction of entire towns. What senseless and absurd sacrifices at the altar of the delusions of grandeur of States  religious fanaticism and unbridled nationalism! We unreservedly support the efforts of the Secretary-General in the negotiations under way to bring about a just  comprehensive and lasting settlement in accordance with resolution 598 (1987).The systematic mining of the international waters of the Persian Gulf and the repeated acts of violence deliberately unleashed by the two belligerents against the ships of third countries sailing in the region elicited unanimous condemnation in my country. Similarly  we deplore the destruction of an Iranian air bus  with the death of 300 civilians. We trust that the situation in the Gulf is now returning to normal and that freedom of navigation can be ensured in accordance with international law.In Cyprus  the representatives of the two communities of the island agreed a few days ago to resume negotiations in Nicosia under the auspices of the Secretary-General. I hope most sincerely that this will happen within the scheduled time-frame. An overall settlement of the conflict must lead to the withdrawal of the Turkish troops occupying part of the Republic of Cyprus and to reconciliation between the two communities  so that 14 years of division can be ended. In the Western Sahara conflict  the conditions for the implementation of the peace plan accepted by the two parties seem to have been met in principle. The proclamation of a cease-fire and the organization of a referendum  under the auspices of this Organization  should enable the Sahraoui people to exercise their right to self-determination freely and without constraint.I also welcome the significant progress made by South Korea towards democratization. The youth of the entire world is now meeting in that country to participate in the Olympic Games. Is it not by virtue of that same principle of universality that we should now consider admitting the Republic of Korea to membership of the United Nations?On the question of Cambodia  we have followed with interest and hope the various diplomatic initiatives that have been undertaken in the last few months. They demonstrate for the first time since the conflict erupted a growing political will on the part of all the parties concerned to arrive at a negotiated solution.At the informal meeting in Jakarta  which for the first time brought together the different political forces in Cambodia  Viet Nam and the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  various peace proposals were put forward and discussed and a working procedure was agreed upon. As the General Assembly has clearly reaffirmed year after year  the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops is the central element of any settlement  which must enable the Cambodian people to decide freely on their own future. Any possibility of returning to the atrocities committed under the Pol Pot regime must be completely avoided. The United Nations and the international community could well find themselves entrusted with a decisive responsibility for the implementation of such a settlement.Will our Organization soon be able to welcome Namibia as the 160th Member  which would be the successful crowning of the actions taken by the United Nations almost since the beginning to end an illegal occupation and complete the historic task of decolonization? The question would seem to be justified in view of the results achieved so far during the negotiations that have been going on for some years now between South Africa  Cuba and Angola  thanks to the mediation of Mr. Chester Crocker  the United States Deputy Secretary for African Affairs. Those countries have reached agreement on a set of principles for a political settlement of the conflict.We hope that the negotiations will provide without further delay a precise time-frame for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. Hostilities have already ceased. South African troops have left Angola. The parties to the conflict have agreed to propose to the Secretary-General the date of 1 November next for the implementation of resolution 435 (1978)  which was adopted 10 years ago by the Security Council. That resolution provides for the withdrawal of South Africa's illegal administration from Namibia  the transfer of power to the Namibian people and preparations for the accession to independence of Namibia through free elections under the supervision and monitoring of the United Nations.The situation in South Africa is still a matter of serious concern. No progress towards the abolition of the intolerable system of apartheid has been achieved; quite the contrary. Instead of entering into a national dialogue  the South African Government has prolonged and renewed the state of emergency and the accompanying legislation. It has made the system of repression even harsher and increased censorship.Nelson Mandela has just had his seventieth birthday in prison. A symbol for millions of oppressed people inside and outside South Africa  Mandela represents the unquenchable hope for a united  democratic South Africa free of racial discrimination. I repeat once again the appeal made by my Government  as by many others  for his release and for the release of other political prisoners and of the many children and adolescents who have been unjustly imprisoned. We feel directly concerned and involved in the fate of the condemned Sharpeville Six. The Government of South Africa has recognized the merits of a negotiated settlement in the case of Namibia. I venture to hope that it will reach the conclusion that the time has come to find a negotiated solution that will eliminate apartheid once and for all. In the meantime  my Government will remain faithful to the decisions taken by the European Community  under the presidency of Luxembourg  whether it be a question of sanctions or of positive measures of support for the victims of apartheid and for the front-line States. Luxembourg will also continue its action at the national level  particularly in the financial sphere  in support of the organizations struggling peacefully against apartheid.I turn now to Central America. The tremendous hopes raised a year ago by the Esquipulas II agreement have been dashed. The negotiations have become dangerously bogged down. While military activities seem to have dropped off  the process of national reconciliation has not led to results in any of the countries concerned. Injustices in the social and economic structures - the fundamental cause of the upheavals in the region - have not been remedied so far. I appeal to the Governments concerned to relaunch the peace process and courageously shoulder the obligations arising from the Esquipulas II agreement. Peace in the region results from the establishment in each of these countries of true democratic pluralism  respect for human rights and the promotion of social justice. It is incumbent on us  in turn  to respect the principles of international law  and in particular the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of any of the countries.In the Middle East  the uprising by the Palestinians in the occupied territories has demonstrated  by its spontaneous and lasting nature  the extent of the frustration and disappointment of those who  despite their precarious living conditions  refuse to accept the humiliating situation of a people deprived of its legitimate rights. My country has always defended Israel's right to exist as a State  and we shall continue to do so. We therefore regret all the more that Israel has in the past few months had recourse to measures of repression that have often been brutal. Far from solving the problem  such measures have only increased the Palestinians' distrust and their determination to refuse to accept occupation.Through his tireless  constant contacts  the United States Secretary of State  Mr. Shultz  has tried to achieve a renewal of the dialogue and the beginning of a peace process on the basis of a consistent and comprehensive plan.Events in the past few months have demonstrated that the status quo is unacceptable. They have emphasized the urgent need for a negotiated solution. A growing majority of Member States already accept the idea of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations. Such a conference could serve as a framework for direct negotiations between the parties concerned. It would also be called upon to define the transitional measures and the security guarantees required. It is for us - each and every one of us - to encourage this process of negotiation and to ask the Secretary-General to continue his consultations.Any comprehensive  just and lasting settlement must be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 {1973) on recognition of the State of Israel within secure and recognized borders  and on recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including its right to self-determination.The decision by the King of Jordan to break the legal and administrative ties between his country and the West Bank is an act of great significance. It should lead the Palestinians to shoulder new responsibilities  and it opens new prospects. Forty years ago  on 10 December 1948  the General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That was indeed an event of historic significance. Despite some progress made since then  we have to say that throughout the world violations of human rights continue at an alarming rate. Torture is still a quasi-institutionalised practice in many States. Racial discrimination and xenophobia persist and reappear with new faces - including in Europe. New forms of violence threaten individual security and safety. A large part of mankind that lives in intolerable conditions is still deprived of the most elementary rights. Let us take advantage of the opportunities offered by the present atmosphere to give a new dimension to international action in this area  in co-operation with the non-governmental organizations. Less selective criticism of violations of human rights  a merciless struggle against torture and all forms of racism  new attention to the protection of the rights of minorities  of women and children: those would seem to me to be the areas for priority action. I feel also that the establishment of an office of a high commissioner for human rights - something which has long been advocated - could considerably strengthen our means of action and the Organization's authority.The third special session devoted to disarmament  held last June  ended without a consensus. I hope that the Assembly will be able to consolidate and finalize the rapprochements that were nevertheless achieved at that session on a number of important questions. I shall confine myself to recalling that  in my Government's opinion  a solution to the problem of the trading in arms should have priority. Since tine Second World War  such trading has provided weapons for 150 regional conflicts and wars  killed about 20 million human beings and consumed vast sums.The shocking use of chemical weapons was noted on several occasions during the war between Iraq and Iran  and has been noted more recently against the Kurdish minority in the northern part of Iraq. My Government strongly condemns the use of such terrifying weapons  which must be banned once and for all. In that regard  President Reagan proposed from this very rostrum the convening of an international conference to consider this important problem. My Government supports that proposal. The international community is indeed called upon urgently to define measures and effective sanctions to prevent any future use of such weapons.The peace and security of peoples do not depend only on doing away with conflicts and threats of a military nature. The economic  social and ecological balance of the world determines equally  if not more  the stability and well-being of mankind.The various ways in which the environment is being degraded have reached alarming proportions. There is a risk that the ecosystems will undergo irreversible changes. Acid rain is attacking and destroying our forests. Tropical forests are being destroyed at a disturbing rate. The area that is deforested each year is equal to that of a country as large as Austria. Only about one tenth of that area has been reforested. Significant climatic changes have resulted from that. Soil erosion is taking on tragic proportions. There is a risk that it will increase natural disasters  as happened recently in Bangladesh. It disrupts the water flow and reduces agricultural output-The misuse of pesticides is a major cause of the pollution of the soil and the agricultural imbalance. The rapid consumption of fossil fuels is changing the composition of the atmosphere and affecting the climate. It may be one of the causes of the warming of the planet.In Africa desertification is progressing swiftly. It is now recognized as a major obstacle to development. A solution is also urgently required to the problem of the disposal  processing and export of toxic industrial waste. One thing is quite clear-: environmental problems cannot be handled by States individually. The problems are often global  requiring collective solutions.The Chernobyl disaster showed that nuclear pollution goes beyond national borders  that nuclear power plants do not offer a complete answer to energy problems and that their safety is not the concern only of the producing countries.The climate  the atmosphere and the seas are the property of all mankind.The rapid population growth in the countries of the south is aggravating social tensions and harming the environment. In 1987 the world's population reached 5 billion  double what it was in 1950. By the end of the century it could be more than 6 billion. Therefore  family planning programmes are necessary  however unpleasant that may be to those who defend the right to life  who too often forget the wretched existence of millions of children who are abandoned and have no future.Faced with all those problems of concern to mankind as a whole  the United Nations  the only truly universal forum  must shoulder a new responsibility in the global village in which we all live together.In 1987 the international community signed a protocol in Montreal  a protocol that my country has since ratified  designed to protect the ozone layer. So far that way of dealing with problems has been the exception. It must become the rule.There must be growing awareness at the national and international levels  when considering the report of the Brundtland Commission last year  our Assembly recognized that present needs must be met without jeopardizing the satisfaction of the needs of future generations  and that the planet's resources and ecosystems must be managed prudently  that areas that have already been degraded or destroyed must be restored  and that dangers must be anticipated and prevented. The state of the world's economy is still a matter of grave concern  even if there is a slight difference from the early 1980s. The whole decade has been marked globally by slower growth. Admittedly  remarkable progress has been made in Asia - particularly in China and the newly industrialized countries - but stagnation and even serious reverses have occurred in Africa and Latin America. The gap between the richest and the poorest countries has become wider.The debt problem is still at the heart of the difficulties of the developing countries. Servicing the debt paralyses their economies by absorbing an excessive portion of export earnings. Those earnings in turn ate affected by the drastic reduction in the price of many raw materials. Finally  international capital flows to those countries have lessened since 1982. The solutions proposed by the recent Toronto summit  particularly for the least well-off countries  must now be implemented urgently.Policies for restructuring and adjustment often entail tremendous sacrifices. In many countries food crises  the exodus from the countryside and uncontrolled urbanization are getting worse. Poverty  malnutrition and sickness are increasing instead of decreasing.In Africa  as elsewhere  it is fundamentally important that economic growth begin again. National Governments must courageously shoulder the primary responsibility for their own development and follow policies of essential restructuring and adaptation. As the participants in the Khartoum Conference emphasized  economic and social strategies must give equal attention to the human factors of development; they must strengthen education and make it more widely available  promote health  increase employment  encourage greater participation by citizens and seek a more just distribution of income  so as to ensure a better quality of environment and life. I would add that a stricter and more open management of public affairs would help to combat corruption and increase people's trust. Increasing growth rates must go hand in hand with an improvement in the living conditions of the majority  not a worsening of those conditions. I trust that all the international institutions will give their support to such policies with a human face.It is also essential that the multilateral trade negotiations of the Uruguay Bound  aimed at further liberalizing trade in goods and services  arrive at initial results that give a new impetus to world trade.Special attention should be given to agriculture and the specific conditions in which it is developing in both the North and the South. We cannot overlook the fact that the price of agricultural products largely determines the export earnings of many developing countries. Greater stability in such prices would help to promote food security in each country and improve the world balance of agricultural output.We must arm ourselves against the uncertainty which is a characteristic of the world economic climate  with a view to strengthening the confidence of those who make economic decisions and promoting the necessary productive investments. In this context  special importance attaches to the regional economic organizations that are springing up  of which the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a good example.The European Economic Community  of which my country was a founding member  has more than 30 years' experience of this valuable integration. Military conflict between the 12 member countries is no longer conceivable  although for centuries they were regularly caught up in terrible confrontations.Today the Community is working to complete the creation of its great domestic market by 1992. Significant progress has already been made. That market of 320 million citizens and consumers offers new prospects of growth and employment within it. That will open up possibilities of increased exports to its trading partners.We are only a few years from the end of the twentieth century  which has been rent by so many upheavals. As we near the end of the century we have new prospects in an atmosphere of detente  realism and co-operation. Our Organization is at the centre of this development. Often treated with indifference  sometimes even with contempt  it is now in an era full of promise. For the first time in its history the United Nations is recognized by all as a special and effective instrument for the resolution of conflicts.My Government which has always attached great importance to the United Nations  views this progress with great satisfaction. We extend to our Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  our gratitude for his work in support of peace  at the head of our Organization.Luxembourg's devotion to peace  non-violence and respect for human rights will be evidenced tomorrow by the unveiling at the Delegates Entrance of a work of art that is powerfully symbolic.United Nations peace-keeping forces  which have been honoured today  are to be found throughout the world  today in the Middle East in Lebanon and Cyprus  in Afghanistan  in Iran and Iraq  and tomorrow perhaps in Namibia  Western Sahara and elsewhere. This tremendous task in the service of the peace that is in the interests of every Member State has major financial implications. Accordingly  the Government of Luxembourg will support any proposal to guarantee the financing of the peace-keeping forces. It is intolerable that the smooth functioning of our Organization should be hampered by inadequate resources at a time when  incidentally  major reforms and real savings have been achieved to enhance its effectiveness.The recent achievements of the United Nations are due to one decisive factor: entente and the great Powers' will to co-operate. Thus we find ourselves in the conditions that existed when the Organization was founded. It was that consensus that inspired the drafting of the Charter. It must lead now to the reinforcement of the primacy of law and its universal application. Let us act together to make this development irreversible. "
"88",4345,"MAR",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco  I am particularly happy to express our most heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.His outstanding personal Qualities and deep knowledge of international issues augur well for the success of his work in discharge of the important responsibilities entrusted to him by the General Assembly. We may be assured of the complete readiness of our delegation to co-operate with him for the success of our deliberations.I would also wish to extend to his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  all our thanks and appreciation for the dedication he brought to his mandate in the course of the last session during a difficult period in the history of the United NationsOur Organization has reached the years of full maturity  strengthened by the experience acquired over its 43 years of existence and tempered by the tests it has undergone in the midst of profound upheaval on the international scene since its establishment. The United Nations  which began a process of reform over two years ago  may well be proud today of the decisive and significant results achieved.In this respect I should like to pay a warm tribute to the Secretary-General  who has spared neither his time nor his energy to ensure the continuity of the work of the United Nations in spite of the financial crisis  while making it perform more efficiently and effectively. Of course any social entity must be ready to respond at all times to the demands of its environment  and in this respect reform will remain an ongoing concern. But it is also up to us  as Member States  to abide by the rules of the game we agreed to and the decisions arising therefrom. This attitude is necessary more than ever now that a climate of harmony  dÃ©tente and openness is emerging and real prospects are taking shape for the settlement of many international crises in respect of which the United Nations   already involved  will necessarily be called upon to play an increasingly important role in the finding of solutions  guaranteeing and implementing them in such a context  characterized by agreement and dialogue  with respect for the fundamental principles of the Charter  everyone is becoming aware of the irreplaceable role of the United Nations as a centre for harmonizing efforts towards shared goals. The Kingdom of Morocco  which  throughout the sessions of the General Assembly and the work of the United Nations  has always demonstrated a pragmatic and responsible approach  strongly supports the Secretary-General's appeal  in his report of 14 September 1988  for avoidance of rhetorical inflation in General Assembly debates and the adoption of ineffective  stock resolutions  and for the strengthening of the essential effectiveness of the Security Council through the- unreserved support of all Member States for its decisions on given disputes  by simply accepting a text but supporting it resolutely at the diplomatic level.We must not lose sight of the fact that all these mechanisms which have to reconcile diverging interests  must be based on the ethical foundation that is the guarantee of the durability of the Organization - that is  the upholding and safeguarding of dignity and the fundamental rights of the human person.It is our duty  as we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the universal Declaration of Human Rights  to work together in all international bodies to guarantee the development of man's full potential  eliminate all discrimination  condemn unreservedly the odious crime of apartheid  and denounce violations of human dignity of any kind.The remarkable contribution of the United Nations to the establishment of the conventional and institutional framework for the definition of  and respect for  human rights must be accompanied by the widest possible support for international covenants  so that there may be full observance of the universal humanist values that are the foremost prerequisite for and the objective of peace.The unbridled arms race and the continued development of weapons of mass destruction constitute a danger to international peace and security and threaten the very survival of mankind. This is why the international community  which noted with satisfaction the conclusion by the two major Powers  in December 1987  of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - is justified in expecting that other agreements will be reached  especially in connection with strategic weapons and denuclearisation  in order to preserve whole regions from the danger of nuclear confrontation.We regret that the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament held last June did not achieve the expected results. We hope that none the less it contributed to enabling the big Powers to reduce strategic weapons and promoting the early adoption of appropriate rules and mechanisms for the prohibition of the production and use of chemical weapons  and the destruction of existing stockpiles.The building of a peaceful and just society undoubtedly depends on the efforts of all countries  regardless of size or strength  and on the commitment of all concerned to take additional measures  in a spirit of solidarity  to prevent conflicts  extinguish hotbeds of tension rapidly and establish relations of good-neighbourliness on a stable and mutually advantageous basis. My country  which works unceasingly for the peaceful settlement of disputes and the development of co-operation at the bilateral  regional and international levels  welcomes the new spirit that inspires this session and the favourable atmosphere in which it is taking place.The well-deserved award of the Noble Peace Prize to the United Nations forces and observers is timely confirmation of the expanding role of the Organization and the recognition of its efforts towards the establishment of peaceful  just international relations. We commend the sacrifices made and the courage shown by the missionaries of peace  and we hope that  as their field of activity widens  they will be given the unanimous support of the international community so they may discharge their noble task in the best possible conditions. For the past eight years a conflict of exceptional violence has left two brother Muslim countries - Iraq and Iran - in mourning. Throughout these years we have appealed from this rostrum  and in other international forums for a cessation of hostilities so that the conditions may be created for a constructive dialogue and a final settlement of this crisis. My country therefore welcomed with great satisfaction and relief the Secretary-General's announcement  on 20 August  of the cease-fire and its acceptance by the two parties. With the unanimous and sustained support of the Security Council  Mr. Perez de Cuellar was succeeded  through his intensive mediation efforts  in bringing to an end one of the most devastating conflicts since the Second World War  thus paving the way for appropriate discussion of all outstanding problems and to the working out of a just  honourable and lasting settlement.The withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan was the prerequisite for genuine national reconciliation and for the assumption by that country of control over its own future. Thanks to the patient work and constant readiness of the Secretary-General  that is  day by day  becoming a reality. The process of good offices set in motion  and the political will shown by the parties  made possible the conclusion of the Geneva Accords  on 14 April 1988  guaranteed by the two big Powers. We are convinced that the implementation of that agreement in good faith and under the supervision of the United Nations will be the prelude to a new era in Afghanistan  in which that suffering country will be able to heal its wounds and begin the crucial work of reconstruction and development  to the benefit of its entire population. We hope  therefore  that in the near future Afghanistan will be able to resume the place it had always held in the Islamic community. There are some glimmers of hope in other regions of the world. These must be encouraged and supported to make possible the beginning of the peace process and the removal of all obstacles to the self-determination of the peoples concerned.This is the case with regard to the Brazzaville talks  the aim of which is the creation of conditions conducive to the prompt implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1987)  which concerns the peace plan for Namibia. Pending the successful conclusion of these talks  we shall continue to give our full support to the Namibian people in seeking the fulfilment of its legitimate aspiration to independence and unity.We are also pleased that there has been substantial progress towards ensuring the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Angola. But the stability and security of that brother country can be definitively guaranteed only through true national reconciliation. Morocco  which has spared no effort to that end  will continue to work side by side with other brother African countries towards a settlement  through dialogue  of the problems that remain between the parties to the conflict in Angola.In Asia  the Jakarta meeting last July  convened at the initiative of the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations  for the first time  tabled all the parties directly involved in the question of Kampuchea to meet. It is important that these efforts be continued to get under way a comprehensive political solution by organizing the withdrawal of foreign troops and  thereby ensuring that the Kampuchean people has control of its own destiny. In Cyprus  the mission of good offices gave both parties the framework for the constructive dialogue that began in Nicosia last month  the purpose of which was to smooth out the difficulties that were still pending and to arrive at a global and mutually acceptable settlement plan. This new breakthrough in favour of peace will  we hope  be the first step towards harmonious relations between the two Cypriot communities.With regard to Central America  the Kingdom of Morocco reiterates its support for the action taken by the Contadora Group and the plan proposed by President Arias of Costa Rica to enable the region at last to enjoy peace and stability  free from any foreign interference.Unfortunately  these happy breakthroughs towards peace did not benefit the Middle East  a region which for more than 40 years has been shaken by a cycle of violence and war though it is of crucial importance to the balance and stability of the world.While the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories is essential  no lasting peace will come about in that region of the world without the recognition of the Palestinian people's right to an independent State. That people is experiencing the tragedy of occupation  exile and deprivation of its most fundamental rights. To the poignant appeal of the Palestinians for justice  Israel has responded so far only by increasing repression  imprisonment  expulsion and assassination. Now that all energies are focused on the peaceful solution of conflicts and the safeguarding of the rights of the human communities concerned  it is unacceptable that the tragic fate of the Palestinian people should be ignored and the future of its children be at Ð° total impasse.It is no wonder therefore that this generation of despair has no alternative but daily to face danger  unarmed  in order to affirm in the eyes of the world its right to freedom and to an independent homeland. The intifada  which has lasted almost a year now in the occupied Palestinian territories  should awaken us to the urgent need for a solution to this crisis  which is gaining in intensity and cruelty with each passing day. Every effort should be made to hold an international conference on the Middle East as soon as possible  under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and of all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole and authentic representative of the Palestinian people.The tragic situation prevailing in the Middle East did not spare Lebanon  which  because of foreign interference  was plunged into disarray  instability and the horrors of civil war. The Kingdom of Morocco reiterates its solidarity with the Lebanese people  for the safeguarding of its territorial integrity  national unity and sovereignty. My country calls for the cessation of all foreign interference which represents a real threat of partition for this Arab land  once a model of tolerance and coexistence among communities and religions.Because of its geopolitical location the Kingdom of Morocco attaches great importance to the stability and security of the Mediterranean. Our constant concern to see this area freed from the nuclear threat by the elimination of missiles on naval fleets in the Mediterranean is therefore understandable. We remain convinced however that the development of harmonious relations between the two shores is a necessary element in the establishment of genuine regional peace and security. For that reason the Mediterranean policy of my country stresses co-operation with Europe and so last April Morocco signed agreements with  the European Economic Community (EEC) following its expansion to include Spain and Portugal. It is undeniable  however  that this relationship  which we should like to be an exemplary one  will not come to fruition without an abatement in some of the sources of tension remaining in the Mediterranean.Thus it is important to resolve the dispute concerning the enclaves of Sebta and Mellilia and other Moroccan islands and islets under Spanish occupation  in order to prevent this anachronistic situation - remnant of a past era - from affecting the harmony that should preside over the relations between the two shores of the Straits of Gibraltar. We are convinced that the recent agreements  signed at bilateral and EEC levels  will facilitate the settlement of these territorial disputes in the mutual interest of the two countries. We in Morocco would like to preserve the manifold ties which throughout history have existed between the Moroccan and Spanish peoples.Security and development are indivisible. Unfortunately  in the field of development this decade has been one of disenchantment an   the failure of the North-South dialogue. Global negotiations to counter the crisis and bring about balanced economic growth did not go beyond statements and declarations.In this regard  even though political stability in Africa hinges on real development and in particular on the settlement of the crucial debt problem  the special session devoted to that continent did not measure up to expectations. Standing as we are on the threshold of a new century  it is essential that we meet the unavoidable challenges facing us and focus all our energies on the establishment of global patterns of development that take account of existing complementary factors and fundamental needs in order to guarantee for all a decent quality of life based on respect for socio-cultural differences. While pursuing this great ambition we should  at the same time  seek urgent solutions to the most pressing problems. Therefore it is important to deal as soon as possible with the external debt crisis in its political  economic and social dimensions. This calls for an innovative strategy since the conventional approach based on annual rescheduling alone is proving to be ineffective.While acknowledging the merits of bilateral and multilateral initiatives taken in favour of low-income debtor countries  it is time to recognize the importance of reducing the outstanding debt and the debt servicing of medium-income debtor countries and of resolutely tackling the commercial debt of heavily indebted countries. In this context  ray country supports the recent additional proposals made by His Highness Arair Jaber Al-Sabah of Kuwait  by President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand and by Prime Minister Takeshita  aimed at alleviating the public and commercial debt burden.At the same time  we must take advantage of the forthcoming multilateral talks  especially the Uruguay Round  to improve the international economic environment in the spheres of the flow of .net resources  trade and the stabilization and rising of commodity prices. My country intends to shoulder its -share of the responsibility and make its contribution to the solution of problems at the regional and international levels. Thus  Morocco recently hosted the conferences of the Non-Aligned Movement on food and agriculture arid on the foreign debt crisis  as well as the first meeting of African experts on geophysical threats in Africa. In order to mobilize allresources and involve the countries concerned in the struggle against the danger of locust infestation. His Majesty King Hassan II has taken the initiative in 'convening an international conference at a high level  which will be held in Morocco on 25 October. It is also on Morocco's initiative that the first ministerial conference on co-operation with regard to fisheries between African countries bordering on the Atlantic Ocean will be held at Rabat next March. We hope that these meetings  in addition to creating a spirit of solidarity  will make it possible to establish complete and lasting co-operation  especially in Africa.Given the impasse in the North-South dialogue  co-operation and regional integration are increasingly felt to be a vital necessity. In the Maghreb  the building of a unified area is not a new idea; it is something that from the outset has been part of the struggle of our country for national liberation. Thus  in his statement in Tangiers in 1947  His Majesty Mohammed V appealed for the independence of Morocco within the framework of the unification of the Maghreb. Since its independence Morocco has worked unceasingly  with faith and determination  for the construction of a Maghreb whose peoples are united by ties of brotherhood  that stem naturally from their history  culture and shared religion and from their united struggle for liberation. We are pleased to be able to say that the Maghreb project is now gaining ground. Strengthened by our respective experiences  we are now making realistic  considered progress towards a regional integration that can be a source of co-operation and development and Î± factor of stability and peace for the peoples of the Maghreb.Thus  in June of 1988  for the first time since my country's independence  a summit meeting of five Maghreb! Reads of State was held in Algiers and agreed on the establishment of a Maghreb High Commission  which during its inaugural meeting distributed responsibilities equitably among the five countries of our region  each being responsible for a commission on the economic  financial  socio-cultural  institutional and human aspects of regional integration.A second session of the Maghreb High Commission will be held in Rabat at the end of this month in order to continue the already well advanced work of integrating the Maghreb.Morocco solemnly reaffirms its complete readiness to do all in its power to fashion at a steady pace a peaceful  united Maghreb that responds to the profound aspiration of our peoples.My country is especially pleased by the climate of peace that has characterized inter-Maghreb relations over the past few months  in that the beneficial impact of this now is apparent with regard to the final settlement of the question of Western Sahara. I would remind members that as soon as Mr. Perez de Cuellar took the initiative of extending his good offices for the settlement of this question  we expressed our complete confidence in him and our determination to co-operate fully for the success of the process that he was preparing to undertake. This process has now made decisive progress. Thus  a technical Mission of the United Nations visited the region in November 1987 to gather at first hand all the necessary data for the establishment of a cease-fire and the organization of a referendum on self-determination.A decisive step was taken on 30 August last when the parties accepted the proposals made by the Secretary-General  in co-operation with the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). These proposals  which are based on the principles and the practice of the United Nations in this field  constitute a final settlement plan for the problem of the Sahara.The plan provides for the appointment of a representative of the Secretary-General  the proclamation by the Secretary-General of a cease-fire  under the guarantee and supervision of United Nations Observers and verification by means of impartial and objective procedures of the persons entitled to participate in the referendum. Lastly  under the terms of this plan the referendum will be prepared and organized under the authority of the representative appointed by the Secretary-General for that purpose.When presenting his peace plan to the Security Council  on 20 September  the Secretary-General indicated that the progress achieved towards a settlement of the question of Western Sahara constituted""a preliminary ... result  which it is extremely important to consolidate in order to preserve the momentum of the process."" (S/PV.2S26  p. 8)Morocco  which attaches great importance to the establishment of a genuine climate of peace and trust in the region  welcomes the support given by the Security Council to the good offices mission by its adoption  on 20 September 1988  of resolution 621 (1988)  in which the Security Council ""1. Decides to authorize the Secretary-General to appoint a special representative for Western Sahara;""2. Requests the Secretary-General to transmit to it as soon as possible ' a report on the holding of a referendum for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara and on ways and means to ensure the organisation and supervision of such a referendum by the United Nations in co-operation with the Organization of African Unity.""The unanimous support of the Security Council for the proposals made by the Secretary-General in co-operation with the Chairman of the OAU is of great Importance. The good offices process has now entered its last and practical stage  leading in the near future to the establishment of the cease-fire and the organization of the referendum on self-determination. We were particularly pleased by the unanimity in the Security Council in adopting resolution 621 (1988). That unanimity is reflected in the extremely favourable way in which the entire International community has welcomed the Secretary-General's peace plan. Since the various regions of the world  through un unprecedented progress in cooperation  are well tuned to each other and simultaneously share the same emotions  it is time to emphasize the positive factors of unity and harmony. The United Nations provides us with a unique forum for the harmonization of views and the establishment of universal consensus  so long as unity of purpose prevails over the outdated reflexes of sterile distrust.The current situation inevitably invites us to the dialogue and mutual understanding that led to the noble ideals which inspired the drafters of our Charter and which must now guide our approach to the evermore complex realities of our present world"
"89",4439,"MDG",43,1988,"ï»¿The Democratic Republic of Madagascar would like to express to Mr. Dante Caputo its felicitations on his election to the presidency of this session. In him we congratulate the representative of a country that has consistently proclaimed its dedication to the principles of non-alignment. I am confident that once again he will devote to the service of our Organization the distinguished qualities which have characterized his brilliant career.To Mr  Peter Florin  Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic  we convey our thanks for the able way in which he guided our work  and we lay special emphasis on his perseverance  impartiality  detachment and sense of political responsibility. We would say to the Secretary-General that this year will have been for him and his chief co-workers a challenging and exciting one. The Assembly had given him the task of disentangling the political  financial and administrative crisis of our Organization. At the same time we expected him to pursue his missions of peace  mediation and conciliation in Western Sahara  Central America  Western Sahara  Afghanistan and Cyprus  among other places. We pay a tribute to his diplomatic initiative  the results of which speak for themselves  and for the efforts he has constantly devoted to restoring to multilateralism and to our Organization the role to which they are entitled.During this decade two words  ""global"" and ""interdependent""  have been spoken so frequently that there hardly seems to be any need to define them any longer. Development is global  as are peace and security  and the three words are interdependent. The axiomatic character and the linear development of this argument may seem troublesome  but no statement can escape that fact  and this demonstrates that despite our differences we are moving towards a universal way of speaking.I hope I shall be forgiven for these haphazard reflections  but I have the impression that we are choosing the same topics  expressing the same ideas and arriving at the same conclusions  although the words may change in connotation depending on the ideology  the commitment or the degree of economic development and the social situation of the country in question. I take  for example  the question of security  a question that worries us all and erne on which we cannot afford to have substantial differences. But that is not so. The most idealistic among us still dream of a system of collective security as provided by the Charter while at the same time we realize that this structure rests on the will of the great Powers and on their ability to go beyond the constraints of national interests and their willingness to accept an end to the status quo that has paralysed us for two generations.Occasionally it happens that we support initiatives regarding the establishment of a general system of peace  the strengthening of international security and the redefinition of that system by making it better adapted to the realities of a changing society. On each such occasion we are told about the sacrosanct character of the Charter or the grim prospects of an Organization that would be dominated by propaganda or a false ideology. Must we for much longer accept this theory that the only security is military security  with its recurring pattern of cold war  retrenchment  detente  confrontation and balance of deterrence? May we now hope that the great thaw between East and West will indirectly have some effects on the political-economic situation of the South? To a degree  the events of the last nine months seem optimistic in that regard  especially for those who hold to a geocentricism not necessarily justified by a healthy grasp of the world situation. Indeed  there are still stubborn hotbeds of insecurity in the political  economic and social spheres  as well as at the regional level. The arguments we are hearing in the present debate do not allow us fully to face those challenges  particularly since some of them have an urgent if not immediate tone. Thus we have no alternative but to fall back on some arguments we have often used in the past.The promoting and safeguarding of security cannot be dealt with exclusively by reference to a past that has not always been glorious. If new prospects are opening before us  which should lead us to recognise far-reaching changes in our society  then let us have the generosity and courage to admit that such an endeavour requires the involvement and participation of all that the interests of some must yield to the common interest and the interests of the international community; and that spheres of influence  interference  dependence domination and exploitation are now obsolete. In short  let us have security for all  and in all spheres. There can be no security without development  nor development without security. We shall be told that this is merely one more slogan. But the immediate and complex problems posed by development could  if left unresolved  undermine political and military security  which  we must acknowledge  for the moment benefits only the North.There has often been discussion of a clash between North and South  because poverty and wretchedness know no borders  nor do they disappear merely because of logic or debate. And what would it be like  a world one half of which enjoyed the benefits of security while the other half continued to struggle with countless economic difficulties?Conversely  so long as international security is not secured  the efforts and resources that could be devoted to development will be diverted to other goals; politics will prevail over economics  and the rivalry of the great Powers will continue to have repercussions on choices of nodes of development.Ideally  on both fronts - security and development - initiatives should be taken concurrently and simultaneously. Gut the realities are otherwise. The struggle against underdevelopment is momentarily being left aside and we are being led to believe that the North must organize itself and ensure its security before the South can benefit.But let us suppose that the industrialized North  cutting across all lines  has resolved its problems of stability  confidence  security  restructuring  liberalisation  inflation  growth  unemployment  interest and exchange rates  budgetary balances and integration. Could we then conclude that the dispossessed South would automatically benefit? We still remember with bitterness the promises of the 1970s  when we were advised to wait until inflation was brought under control before we called for any increase in development aid. As for the ""trickle-down effect"" and the laws of the market  the length of time necessary and the precariousness of their results are matched only by our patience. The policy of laissez-faire has entrenched itself in international economic relations  and it is the debt question that finally has aroused some awareness of responsibilities and disparities. We recognize that the impasse faced by national and international financial institutions has led them no longer to address the question of debt in financial and accounting terms to seek means that were formerly thought of as legally dangerous to accept that structural adjustment should take into account human  social and political elements. There are  of course  risks in such an exercise  but an accumulation of bad debts cannot serve the cause of international monetary and financial stability  and even lees the cause of an equitable  just and sustained development.In this respect  let those who hold the initiative concede that the burden of debt is paralysing development efforts and that this is not the key to the problem. Development has many aspects and one cannot always put all the factors on an equal footing. This is the case  for example  with commodity prices  which we are told should depend on the laws of the market  and are not protected by protectionism. We may well wonder whether it is decent that the survival of a country should be subject to the clash of different schools of thought  degree of teamwork is called for here  even if some of the most valid rules occasionally need to be bent.We did not abandon our spirit of teamwork and solidarity when some presented to use the notion that structural adjustment would be our contribution to improving the international economic environment. Its price remains enormous  increased unemployment  deterioration of social indicators  a decline in productivity  inadequate basic social services  under-utilization of human resources and so on. On the side of our partners  we find it hard to see the existence of a real will to tackle the problem of development  to give up the notion that growth can remain the reserve of the few  or to ensure that national policies and practices favour the e emergence of an economic order of benefit to everyone. Teamwork not followed by concrete action or supported by specific commitments is not real.It may be objected that so long as uncertainties deriving from the constraints of file world economy have not been removed  it will be difficult to restructure priorities  to redefine certain preferences and to alter objectives. If that is so  then we must give up on that global vision of the world that has always been held out to us  especially at difficult times. So division is the rule  wait and see"" remains the byword  and let each draw his own conclusions. As for us  we shall continue to argue  from the standpoint of a true development  code of ethics  that development is concerned above all with improving  the human condition that it calls for a consistent collective reaction in the form of a long-term programme with objectives  commitments and the availability of adequate resources that in the establishing of world economic security the United Nations has a primary political role to play  in the clear formulation of principles  the definition of priorities and co-ordination of the various organizations and institutions concerned with development  whose approach and ends are not necessarily harmonised or convergent.We shall continue to discover new problems  obstacles and disappointments on the way to security and development. Even if the advent of a golden age is not on the horizon  it would be wrong to abandon all hope  because we must examine the problems of security  development and peace from a global perspective  without any preconceived order of priorities  without pre-judging their interaction and without claiming a monopoly regarding initiatives or means of implementation. Such an approach  if adopted  would constitute a guarantee of the establishment of a true peace that would be shared by all  whether from East or West  from North or South. Nevertheless  we should recognize that progress has been made  in the quest for peace and in creating a climate favourable to its attainment  thanks to the convergence of unilateral initiatives  bilateral consultations and recourse to multilateral diplomacy. We should therefore pay our tribute to and congratulate all those who have made the prospects for this session less negative than they might have been.These include  first  the Organization  whose peace-keeping forces have just received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their contribution to achieving the fundamental purposes of the Charter and to bringing about the negotiations now under way  lb the United States and the Soviet Union  for concluding the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles for undertaking negotiations with a view  to reducing their strategic nuclear arsenals  and for their determination to explore those spheres in which significant progress can be envisagedÂ·  Iran and Iraq  for accepting the cease-fire recommended in Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and carrying on direct talks on the establishment of a true peace  in a spirit of trust and understandings all those that  like Prance  decided  when the cease-fire was announced  to withdraw their naval contingents from the Gulf  thus reducing the dangers that a foreign military presence might represent for the independence  sovereignty and security of the States of the region the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the countries of Indo-China  which  despite the complexity and difficulty of their exchanges of view  especially on Kampuchea  are gradually moving towards the creation of a zone of security and co-operation in South-East Asia the Soviet Union and Viet Nam for  respectively  the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan  in the framework of the Geneva Agreement and the establishment of a timetable for the withdrawal from Kampuchea; the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  which recently took initiative to bring about unification  conciliation and harmony and to eliminate confrontation  mistrust and tension  with a view to bringing about the reunification of the peninsula the Republic of Cyprus and other Cypriot representatives  who decided to attempt to achieve  through resumption of inter-communal talks  a negotiated settlement of all aspects of the problem  in a spirit of Independence  sovereignty and the unity of Cyprus  the Organization of African Unity for pursuing its mediation efforts to bring about a negotiated political solution to the dispute between Libya and Chad  which have just re-established their diplomatic relations  Ethiopia and Somalia  which  after so many years of confrontation  have succeeded in normalizing their relations in a spirit of good-neighbourliness  Morocco and the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic  whose acceptance of the Secretary-General's proposals on Western Sahara constitute a positive step towards the implementation  in letter and spirit  of the relevant United Nations and Organisation of African Unity resolutions on initiating direct negotiations and the holding of the referendum on self-determination of the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO)  the sole and legitimate representative oÂ£ the Namibian people  for having  at the beginning of the quadripartite talks  unilaterally announced the cessation of its military operations; and the countries of Latin America  which  despite the existence of internal and external problems  insist that the only way of solving the region's problems  without external interference or the injection of ideological considerations  remains the faithful implementation of the Guatemala agreement  the reaffirmation of which is urgently necessary.After this summary of the disputes that have arisen between States  what can we conclude and what lesson can we draw  if not that the sense of responsibility of the countries of any region and their support for the settlement of conflicts in their geographic area have peeved more positive and effective than interference and intervention prompted by external interests.Having presented this somewhat optimistic view of the world  I am constrained to return to the painful realities affecting southern Africa and the Middle East  where conflict of interests is the order of the day. On 1 November this year the Secretary-General will begin to take the steps necessary for the deployment of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia. We all hope that this first deadline will be respected and will not be made unduly dependent upon the results of the quadripartite talks on South West Africa. We maintain that only the immediate and definitive application of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) will make it possible for the Namibian people to regain their independence  sovereignty and dignity  until this happens  the political  legal and moral  responsibility of the Organization will be at stake. In South Africa we are still seeing a clash between two worlds. On the one side we see the illegitimate and illegal regime of apartheid  with all the ' tyranny  oppression  discrimination  inequality and monopoly that it involves. On the other side  we see a people suffering in body and soul  but a people which  through the voice and through the initiatives of its liberation movement  the - African National Congress (ANC)  is crying out for the right to participation  to freedom and to democracy. We are  still wondering when we  will find the resolve to apply concrete and comprehensive solutions to defeat the apartheid regime. Nothing can be built on immorality and compromise. One cannot expect anything from apartheid; reformed or not.	  As for the Middle East  it is time we stopped trying to find some form of balance at any cost  which is of advantage only  to one side  "" The Palestinian people  a victim of injustice  oppressed  condemned to wandering and despair  has the right to demand more consideration and more sympathy. Reasoning politically and legally  after the adoption of resolution 181 (IT) who can question the existence of a Palestinian State distinct from Jordan? Sooner or later  the independence of that State will be formally proclaimed. As an Organization  we must take an unambiguous stand.Â· That act will not suffice to end the conflicts between Israel and the PLO  but it would have the advantage of enabling the more hesitant to consider the International Peace Conference in new terms. This year  we are going to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and everyone will proclaim full and unqualified dedication to it  although no country is really free of allegations of violations of these rights. Is it not ironic to note that at the end of the twentieth century those who dedicate themselves to preaching and to the-systematic use of human rights for political purposes  are sometimes the last to accept the consequences of respect for  and' the promotion of  human rights in southern Africa  the Middle East  Asia and Latin America?That the flowers of human rights are blooming in a field of injustice  misery and poverty is something that is being accepted through a grim form of formalism.As I listen to the statements of my colleagues  or reread them  I have the impression that the quarrel between bilateralism and multilateralism  for which some other systems have been sought  is now a thing of the past. The key point for us now is to invest in the new capital of confidence that has been accorded to our Organization  to build innovatively on the experience of more than 40 years  to put to the test the true potential of the United Nations despite its momentary loss of credibility.If the United Nations is to be the expression of our international political conscience  we cannot continue to enclose it within the narrow framework of a Charter that needs to be revised  if only with respect to the right of veto. We must accept that the concept of security should be enlarged and that the concept of responsibility should be more binding. We must prepare ourselves to codify the guarantees of peace  security and development in a context which reflects the general desire of members of the international community  with especial attention to the priorities dictated  as the Secretary-General has said  by the entry of mankind into a new period of its history  and the imperative of a development which must be balanced and as fair as possible. Only at that cost can we respond to the aspirations of humanity in the midst of a crisis for its very survival  grappling with uncertainty and anxiety. "
"90",4477,"MDV",43,1988,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to extend to Mr. Dante Caputo the warmest greetings of my delegation on his election as the President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I am fully confident that under his wise and able leadership this Assembly will make substantive progress and further consolidate the gains achieved during the past year.May I also take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  for his leadership and the able and exemplary manner in which he discharged his duties as President of the forty-second session.A short time ago the world lost one of its outstanding statesman  General Mohammad Al-Hass  President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan  who not only contributed immensely to the cause of peace and justice in the world  but was also a pioneer of regional co-operation in South Asia# and a great supporter of freedom.We are meeting this year with a note of renewed optimism. This note of optimism is largely due to the constant  tireless and patient efforts of the United Nations in resolving outstanding international disputes and tensions through peaceful means. We have witnessed a positive change in the global political environment.The commendable efforts of the Secretary-General have brought a cease-fire to what seemed to be an unending war between Iran and Iraq; the Geneva Accords have melted away the tension over Afghanistan; there are signs of an early end to the Kampuchean crisis; and  with the Angolan accord  resolution of the Namibian issue appears to be in sight. Equipped with those positive developments  the Secretary-General is continuing his efforts for the resolution of the Cyprus-issue and also the Question of Western Sahara. The United Nations has again asserted itself as the single most important forum  representative of mankind as a whole  capable of tackling and solving major international issues.The General Assembly of the United Nations is the widest representative organ of the international community. The powers of the General Assembly encompass a very wide area and cover the entire gamut of international relations. The decisions of the General Assembly set forth in its recommendations and resolutions over the last 43 years have amply demonstrated the very wide range of subjects that it covers. Members of the United Nations have the obligation to treat resolutions with respect and a sense of commitment. We are disappointed that there are several resolutions on such important issues as human rights  the dismantling of apartheid  disarmament  prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons  the call for a new international economic order  and bridging the gap between the rich and the poor that have still not been implemented.We would reiterate  though it hardly needs emphasis our firm conviction that the United Nations is the only forum that has both the legal and political capacity to address the manifold issues that confront the world today. We reaffirm our stand that all-out efforts must be made to further strengthen this great institution. The weakening of the United Nations would amount to the weakening of world security  peace and stability as a whole. The prime objective of the United Nations today is to devise and sustain mechanisms to preserve world peace and save future generations from the scourge of war. One of the most important steps towards that noble objective is disarmament. At the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament we had the opportunity to review the issues related to disarmament  freely and frankly  from all perspectives. Arms control  especially the prohibition of nuclear arras  must be considered with the utmost seriousness. Similarly  any trends towards developing more conventional weapons  producing chemical and biological weapons and militarising outer space should remain a matter of concern they must be prevented by all possible means. A reduction of arms will greatly reduce tension and promote greater stability and confidence. The ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics shows that comprehensive disarmament is no longer a Utopian concept and that  given the political will and determination required  a better tomorrow in a new world could be built.We have witnessed a breakthrough for the increased use of outer space because of the rapid progress in science and technology. It is therefore essential that strong safeguards be laid down well in advance  so that outer space is used only for peaceful purposes. Agreements and median isms on a global scale should be devised urgently in order effectively to set down the guidelines  formulate the safeguards and regulate the use of outer space for peaceful purposes.We are firmly convinced of the usefulness of the concept of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts of the world. That concept implies regional harmony and peace. Setting up such zones would facilitate the reduction of the tension and mistrust that often exist among countries/of a region. The Republic of Maldives is strongly of the view that the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace would contribute substantially to achieving the objective of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  Maldives has always supported the General Assembly resolutions calling for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in South Asia. We reiterate our stand that participation by all countries of the region and other countries concerned with the issue as well as consultations among them  is essential for the establishment of an effective nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region.Maldives strongly supports the proposal for the establishment of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean r free from outside interference  military activities and influence  Maldives attaches great importance to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  which was adopted by the United Nations in 1971  It is our firm believe that sincere bilateral and multilateral consultations will have a positive result. In that connection  we call for the implementation of the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean# including the call for the early convening of the proposed international conference on the issue While most of the world is advancing towards the objective of sharing the benefits of our common heritage  it is disheartening to note that some people are moving backwards with the remnants of past ages.The pursuit of the policy of apartheid by the white minority regime in power in South Africa is a disgrace to the world community. South Africa's persistent disregard of the world condemnation of its racist policies leads us to believe that it is time to examine and adapt more stringent measures and enforce the United Nations resolutions on South Africa. Some nations' support  direct or indirect  for the racist regime of South Africa  merely to serve their own interests  also deserves criticism. Let us collectively urge the Security Council to resort to enforcement action under Chapter VII of the Charter  if necessary  and put an end to the apartheid regime and the illegal occupation of Namibia.We pledge our support to the front-line States in their difficult efforts to deal with the destabilization caused by South Africa and to cope with the effects of comprehensive sanctions against South Africa. We appeal to the international community generously to support the Action for Resisting Invasion  Colonialism and Apartheid (AERICA) Fund proposed by the Non-Aligned Movement  which reflects the universal battle to achieve the total elimination of the system of apartheid.The situation in Angola and in southern Africa appears to be improving. We welcome the cease-fire declared by the parties concerned and their agreement on a sequence of steps necessary to prepare the way for the independence of Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  and to achieve peace in south-western Africa. It is essential  however  that all parties directly concerned with the issue  and in particular the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  which is the legitimate representative of the people of South West Africa/Namibia  be included in the negotiations. The direct and full involvement of the United Nations in the talks and negotiations is also essential to achieving a lasting solution.One of the most positive developments of this year has been the acceptance by the parties concerned of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  which called for an end to the Iran-Iraq war. Maldives welcomed that new development  and strongly supports the subsequent cease-fire and the direct talks between the two countries which began on 25 August 1988. These developments were particularly significant and commendable since they came at a time when this destructive war had assumed alarming proportions. We earnestly hope that Iran and Iraq will exercise constraint and continue to co-operate with the Secretary-General until a lasting and honourable solution to the conflict is found.The situation in occupied Palestine continues to deteriorate. The Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza has only confirmed the severity and intensity of the situation created by the Israeli aggression. The uprising is a further demonstration of the popular will  another link in the long chain of resistance that began with the very first days of occupation - but it is much more persistent and intense  and people from all walks of life  young and old  are participating in it in a unified effort and a common struggle to achieve freedom and independence.The Government of Maldives strongly condemns the use of brutal force and the abuse of human rights by Israel against the Palestinian people in the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank. We also deplore Israel's continued defiance of United Nations resolutions  against all norms of international law. We reiterate our full support for and solidarity with the people of Palestine in their just struggle for independence and self-determination and the liberation of their homeland from Zionist occupation. We also welcome the overwhelming international support for the uprising  which is being viewed as the just struggle of the Palestinian people for the restoration of their usurped legitimate rights and the attainment of full independence. We also support the proposal for the early convening of an international conference on the Middle East  with the full and independent participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  which remains the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Such a conference would  we believe  constitute a major step towards the solution of the question of Palestine. The situation in Lebanon remains tense and extremely dangerous  Lebanon's legal identity and sovereignty have been reduced to a shambles  with about 13 years of civil and proxy wars and the illegal occupation by Israel of its territory  Lebanon now faces the disaster of a complete breakdown. Every day the toll of victims rises owing to the indiscriminate bombing by Israel and other acts of violence. It is fervently hoped that with the developments taking place in the region the question of Lebanon can be solved in a manner that will restore its sovereignty and alleviate the suffering of its people. With the signing of the Geneva Accords a peaceful solution to the problem of Afghanistan finally seems to be in sight. So far the schedule for the withdrawal of foreign troops is being followed satisfactorily. It is hoped that a political settlement will soon follow. We call upon all parties concerned to abide strictly by the provisions of the Accords in order not to frustrate the present opportunities to achieve a just and lasting solution to that complex problem. We hope that the United Nations Humanitarian and Economic Assistance Programme relating to Afghanistan will respond to the Immediate need for relief and rehabilitation as well as to the long-term requirements for the reconstruction of the country.Similarly  initiatives to bring about peace in Kampuchea are also having positive results. The recent negotiations at Bogor  Indonesia  are a significant breakthrough  and we hope that a peaceful settlement  based on national reconciliation and the withdrawal of foreign troops  will be forthcoming  leading to the restoration and preservation of Kampuchea 's independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and neutral and non-aligned status and to the reaffirmation of the Kampuchean people's right to determine their own destiny.History has revealed unequivocally that the arbitrary division of nations does not preserve peace and stability but that  on the contrary  it acts as a catalyst to continuing tension and agony. The Maldives has been consistently supportive of the efforts of nations separated by war to achieve reunification. The process of reunification should operate through peaceful means and through the creation of conditions for reconciliation  peace and stability among peoples sharing the same aspirations.We are optimistic about the prospects for reunification and national reconciliation in Korea. The Maldives reiterates its firm belief that that can be achieved only through peaceful and direct dialogue and negotiations between the peoples concerned  without outside interference. The good offices of the United Nations can be utilized in such peaceful negotiations.While supporting the independence and national integrity of Cyprus  Maldives considers that inter-communal talks are vital to a lasting solution to the Cyprus problem within the framework of national unity  justice and equal rights for all Cypriots. We are encouraged by the positive attitude displayed by the leaders of the Cypriot communities in their recent meetings in London  and we earnestly hope that a durable solution to that difficult problem will be found. In that regard we once again commend the valuable efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to bring about a peaceful solution to the problem.The question of Western Sahara is yet another that is of concern to us. We hope that the recent initiatives of the Secretary-General with regard to that issue will bring about a lasting solution to the problem.Although Central America is geographically distant from us  the situation there continues to be a cause of concern. We strongly deplore the acts of aggression and intervention that threaten or jeopardize the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political stability of the peoples of that region and their rights to self-determination and freedom. We support the Georgetown Peace Appeal of March 1987  and we also welcome the initiatives of the Central American leaders and their peace agreement signed in August 1987. In that context we urge and appeal to all States to co-operate in the implementation of the Esquipulas II agreement and to refrain from supporting subversive activities and other acts of intervention in the internal affairs of other countries  which only produce destruction and misery for the innocent population. Forty-three years have gone by since the adoption of the United Nations Charter  which  among other things recognized the rights of peoples to self-determination and freedom. With regard to the question of New Caledonia we reiterate our broad support for the rights of the people to self-determination in accordance with international law. It will be recalled that at its forty-second session the General Assembly had noted that progress towards a long-term political solution in New Caledonia required a free and genuine act of self-determination and the Assembly had called for resumption of the dialogue with all sections of the population of the Territory. We welcome the initiatives announced by the French Government and hope that the proposed plans will guarantee fairness and equality to all sectors of the population.The world economic situation continues to be grim. The gap between rich and poor is widening. Some of the industrial countries pursue policies that have a negative impact on the economies of the developing countries. Furthermore  in the past couple of years many of the developing countries have been faced with such serious natural calamities as droughts  floods  torrential rains and earthquakes. Against such a backdrop it is disturbing that there is a decline in official development aid to developing countries. It is also a matter for regret that the official development aid (ODA) target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product called foe in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and the ODA target of the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries remain unfulfilled. It is therefore essential to initiate a rethinking of the international development strategy and to implement the call for the new International economic order. It is regrettable that progress towards the establishment of a new international economic order has been unsatisfactory  owing mainly to the lack of political will on the part of some of the developed countries to implement the decisions. In the mean time  the efforts of the developing countries in their own development processes have been commendable.Most of the developing countries face huge debts  declining commodity prices  reduced flows of development capital and adverse terms of trade. For a healthy global economy it is essential that developing countries be given a fairer opportunity for economic rehabilitation and growth. We are optimistic that technical and economic co-operation among developing countries will show a further upward trend in coming years and will go a long way towards mitigating the adverse economic conditions they face today. The promotion of South-South trade within the broader context of economic co-operation among developing countries  based on principles of collective self-reliance  has been stressed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. We urge the United Nations to take more effective and concrete steps to promote both economic and technical co-operation among developing countries in the course of its programme of action regarding the new international economic order. In that context we welcome the decision taken at the ministerial meeting cm the global system of trade preferences for developing countries at Belgrade in April 1988  which has given new impetus to the ongoing negotiations.May I finally turn to a subject to which Maldives attaches great importance and which is of vital concern to us  namely  the protection and preservation of the environment. With almost blind faith in his ability and power to conquer nature and equipped with ever more sophisticated technology  humans unwittingly and to some extent unknowingly been destroying his basic life-support system. Our planet Earth can be compared to a small spaceship on which we are all travelling together  dependent for survival upon the vulnerable supply of air  water and soil and their balanced exploitation. The delicate equilibrium of air  water and soil is being threatened by increasing pollution by man. Man's action over the years has transmuted the natural order of the environment to the point where the whole world is ensnared in the consequences. As the scale of man's intervention in nature has increased  so have nature's repercussions on man. Today the world is faced with risks of irreversible damage to the environment - land  air and sea - that threatens the very life-support systems of the Earth.Maldives is a small  archipelagic State entirely dependent upon its seas for its livelihood. Any degradation of the marine ecosystem or any rise in the mean sea-level due to the so-called greenhouse effect is a matter for grave concern to us. Last year  it may be recalled  the Maldives witnessed the fury of tidal eruptions three times  and suffered extensive damage. Tidal waves  hurricanes and typhoons are becoming increasingly frequent phenomena. Scientists may attribute such natural havoc as the consequence of man's unscrupulous tampering with the environment. It is already well established that the pollution of the atmosphere by industrial effluents  by gaseous substances and especially by chlorofluorocarbons is damaging the earth's protective ozone layer. Damage to the ozone layer will result in greater heating of the Earth  melting the ice caps in the polar regions and leading to a consequent rise in the global mean sea-level. Such a result can be disastrous to low-lying island States like Maldives.The Maldives is particularly concerned about any damage to the marine environment and the question of the sea-level rise. The immediate effects and the threats of nature on countries like the Maldives may not be as frightful and gloomy as described and dramatized by some newspaper reports. Our tourist attractions and the fishing activities will remain intact and these two vital industries may prosper for many decades to come without the fear of the country being drowned. Nevertheless we have embarked upon a programme of protecting the populated Islands from possible natural calamities. We thank the friendly countries  particularly Japan  for assisting us in this initiative and for their Interest in the problem.Maldives therefore strongly supports the call for environmental preservation and is already a party to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. We urge all States to care lovingly for the environment and we reiterate the old maxim that prevention is better than cure.In conclusion  allow me to express the sincere hope of my delegation that this session of the General Assembly will further contribute to consolidating world peace and maintaining the positive atmosphere and the momentum achieved during the past year towards the noble principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.

"91",4524,"MEX",43,1988,"ï»¿I should like to begin my address by congratulating the United Nations and its Secretary-General upon the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the peace-keeping forces  as announced this morning. We welcome the fact that this award has been made to a body that is essential for the effective functioning of the United Nations. It symbolizes a clear recognition by the international community of the commendable work performed by the United Nations for the genuine security of all States.On behalf of the Mexican Government  I extend my warmest congratulations to you  Mr. Caputo  the Secretary for External Relations of the Republic of Argentina  on your well-deserved election to the post of President of the General Assembly for this session. Sir  your diplomatic experience and ability will contribute to the success of our endeavours. In the performance of your delicate task  you may count upon the support of the Mexican delegation. The solid ties of friendship that unite our peoples and Governments allow us to renew and reaffirm shared aspirations that should ensure the success of this session of the General Assembly.I also wish to express our especial confidence and trust in Mr. Perez de Cuellar. The international community knows that the changes that we are experiencing in international affairs have been made possible to a large degree by his political contribution and his talent for negotiation. The work carried out by our Secretary-General renews our faith in the United Nations system  reinforces the Organization's prestige  and helps to overcome the crisis of multilateralism. We are proud that Mr. Perez de Cuellar  a Latin American politician and diplomat  has so commendably advanced the causes of peace  justice and international law. When President Miguel de la Madrid's Government was initiated in December 1982  the international situation was particularly difficult. Tension had increased among the great Powers  and disarmament negotiations had been suspended. The great Powers had also assumed antagonistic positions with respect to various trouble spots around the world. The East-West confrontation was making the international climate more tense. The United Nations was the target of criticism  because it seemed incapable of responding to the needs for peace and security.The United Nations as a whole  including the specialized agencies  was the target of unfair criticism  which served to distort its true role. A number of countries attached importance to bilateral relations and demanded conduct in accordance with their own short-terra interests and strategic goals.This served to weaken the multilateral system and that was compounded by a financial crisis  deliberately caused by those who sought to gain influence consistent with their foreign policy. The United Nations was the target of mean financial treatment as a result of that short-sightedness which we would all like to see overcome. Mexico never agreed to the unilateral decisions taken by the major contributing Powers  which refused to meet their obligations as a means of bringing pressure to bear upon the Member States and the Organization  breaking the rule of universality in one of the most important specialized agencies. The lesson is clear: without the political will on the part of Member States it is impossible to find a solution to the crisis of multilateralism and of the international Organization.To the political and military confrontations was added the most serious problem in present-day international life  that of the great inequalities between the developing South and the industrialized North. The dialogue to establish a new international economic order was broken off. In the 1980s the aspirations of the South to negotiations that would lead to a better distribution of wealth and the resources so essential for well being and development were frustrated.The results of that crisis afflicted above all the poorest nations. In this paradox of history  the poorest  those in greatest need to promote social development with new resources  became exporters of capital and wealth to the international financial centres - that is  to those that already enjoyed resources in abundance. We are pleased that the Organization and the Secretary-General have played a leading role in these recent changes. We also welcome the progress that President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev have achieved in the field of disarmament. Paramount importance must be attached to the signing and ratifying of the Soviet-American Treaty on the elimination of their intermediate-range and shorter-range nuclear forces - the INF Treaty. We call for the rapid conclusion of other treaties on a significant reduction in strategic weapons and on the elimination of chemical weapons. The agreements prove that even the most difficult natters can be resolved with sufficient political will and determination. They also show that security and balance are not necessarily synonymous with the escalation of armaments and that diplomatic negotiations are essential for the solution of the most difficult problems  solutions that guarantee the legitimate rights and genuine national interests of all parties.It is true that barely the first steps have been taken in the long road to free the world from the threat of nuclear war. It is imperative  therefore  to adhere strictly to the commitments made and to maintain the will to negotiate. Incidentally  the lack of results from the third special session of the United Nations General Assembly on disarmament was not encouraging. In the field of disarmament the participation of the international community is necessary  through the agencies especially created for that purpose  otherwise we shall continue to be governed by the relations between the nuclear Powers - that is  we shall be subjected to criteria  views and interests that do not necessarily coincide with those of other men and countries which earnestly desire the elimination of weapons of destruction that could put an end to their very existence. Peace has been and will continue to be the fundamental goal pursued by Mexico in its foreign policy. Proof of this is to be found in President de la Madrid's participation in the Peace and Disarmament Initiative - referred to as the Group of Six - which contributed to the creation of an appropriate climate for negotiations between the great Powers. I emphasize  as the Group of Six has done/ the need for the complete cessation of nuclear tests and prevention of the extension of the arms race to outer space  and that the limitation of conventional weapons be seriously discussed.Events of recent months prove that the role of the United Nations in achieving peace and development is irreplaceable. Within this climate of dÃ©tente negotiated agreements must be consolidated and the disputes that still affect several regions and countries must be resolved. The Government of Mexico has steadfastly supported the peaceful settlement of international disputes with respect for the principles of self-determination and non-intervention. That is why optimism is aroused by the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and the fact that the exercise of the right to self-determination has been achieved  or by the attainment of a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq so that a war that divided the civilian populations of the two countries for eight years has been brought to an end. We must also welcome the four-party negotiations that led to a cease-fire between South Africa and Angola. The termination of hostilities will enable the Angolan people to advance towards independent economic and social development  free from external threats and interference.The agreements to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  on Namibian independence  are of special importance to us  Mexico  as a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  has always condemned the illegal occupation of that Territory. That is why we re-emphasize our commitment to the people of Namibia and to the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  its clear organization  their right to exercise fully their sovereign rights.We emphasize our rejection of the barbaric practice of apartheid  which has been consistently condemned by the United Nations. Peace in the region and respect for international law would be a utopian dream without an end to apartheid. It is imperative that we to continue to demand that South Africa put an end to its aggressive policies against the front-line States and its policies of regional destabilization.We earnestly hope that the talks on the Kampuchean conflict will result in agreements guaranteeing the Kampuchean people's right to self-determination  free from genocidal factions and with respect for the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity  which clearly necessitates the withdrawal of foreign troops.Lasting peace in the Middle East entails recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. All the States in the region  including Israel  muse be able to live within secure and recognized borders. We roust once again call for the restitution of the territories occupied since 1967  accompanied by prohibition of conquest by military force and the provision of guarantees ensuring respect for the human rights of the Palestinian civilian population in the region. The convening of an international conference  with the participation of all parties and under the auspices of the United Nations  is consequently extremely important. We must foster all such contacts as might lead to the settlement of this  one of the most protracted conflicts of the post-war age. It is also encouraging that the conflict in Western Sahara is nearing a political resolution that will result in independence and self-determination for the Sahraoui people.On the other hand- we are concerned that there has been a stalemate of the negotiations in Central America. To Mexico  respect for the self-determination of the Central American peoples and rejection of any outside interference and of the use of force or coercion continue to be central to the attainment of peace and development in the region.The steps taken by Mexico to help bring about regional peace are well known. The Contadora and Support Groups advocated full respect in the region for the principles of non-intervention and self-determination for all the peoples in the isthmus  to enable these nations to attain the stability and co-operation that would make their economic  political and social development possible.In August 1987  the Central American countries signed the Esquipulas accords. The political connection of these accords to the Contadora and Support Groups is quite clear. They also constitute a valid and practical basis for the restoration of peace in the area. These principles should be observed by the Central American countries and should be respected by all the States in the international community  particularly those which have links with  and interests in  the region.The efforts of the Contadora and the Esquipulas accords deserve to meet with success  and so they will  to the degree that hegemonistic interpretations and a security policy that is not compatible with security or Latin American interests are abandoned. It is true that the peoples of the region desire security  peace and democracy - but peace  security and democracy that mean autonomy and freedom to determine their own destiny  free from external interference  development with no strings or preconditions attached  and co-operation between equals with full respect for sovereignty. Contadora and its Support Group have struggled to avoid the spreading of this conflict  which could dash the hopes of the Central American peoples and spread to other parts of the continent. It was also our desire that democracy should be a genuine product of the peoples. Similarly  we made contacts with other regions and international organizations - I might mention in this respect the European Economic Community (EEC) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) - which could help to eliminate poverty and underdevelopment in the region  which are really the underlying cause of the conflicts.In Central America  peace will prevail over the gloomy prospect of a more protracted war. The rule of law must prevail in this region over military and ideological considerations  so that reason and the long-term interest of all the peoples of the continent may prevail over immediate tactical and military considerations.I am convinced that the most important question of modern life is the need to correct the unjust and unbalanced economic relations in the world. This is one of the great tasks currently facing the community of States and international organizations. This decade  which is of such great political moment  has also been characterized by restraint on development 'and by the difficulties we have encountered in openly and constructively reviewing the economic situation of the non-industrialized countries. Misunderstanding  short-sightedness and selfish considerations have been the rule of the day. It has been said that the 1980s were a lost opportunity for development. Our efforts notwithstanding  we have been unable to achieve a better and more effective role for our countries in the international economy. The lack of response to the debt problem is well known  as are the excessive rise in interest rates  trade restrictions  the fall in commodity prices  and the severe restrictions on financing for the development of our countries.The philosophy pursued by the main industrialized countries notwithstanding  there was a tightening of trade protectionism  and we saw the emergence of what is being called the ""new protectionism"". These practices severely restrict our access to the markets of the industrialized countries and thus our prospects of meeting our internal and external obligations.Unilateral restraints on international trade are all the more deplorable if we consider that in practice they are contrary to the commitments made by the signatories of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on the occasion of the ""Uruguay Round""  and if we consider  furthermore  that they are prejudicial to the development potential of non-industrialized countries  and therefore have an adverse effect upon world economic growth.The scale of debt-servicing among developing nations and the shortage of international financing represent a net transfer of resources to the outside world. This takes up a significant part of our export earnings. It severely restricts imports and makes the internal adjustment process less and less compatible with economic growth and an equitable distribution of social well-being. Restructuring of the debt has had some slight effect on the terms and conditions of payment  but it has not meant a real solution to the problem.The developing world and Latin America in particular  is calling for long-term solutions  through just and reasonable negotiations with the industrialized countries  to resolve the problem of external debt  development financing and the reactivation of the international economy.We have therefore argued that the debt servicing must in all cases be adapted to the real capacity of the debtor countries to pay  with recognition of the principle of shared responsibility and the need for equity in the distribution of costs. It is also necessary to have balanced negotiations to increase the volume and rate of exports from developing countries. Within GATT  there must be strict fulfilment of the commitments to suspend and dismantle trade restrictions that ace in violation of the obligations undertaken by the signatories to the General Agreement.The major issues relate to the need for change in economic relations among States  so that the wealth created by the intelligence and efforts of mankind may no longer be concentrated within a small number of countries and a narrow strip of our planet. This is doubtless the major challenge before the modern community of States and before the United Nations.The struggle for respect for fundamental rights and freedoms is one of the major attainments of the United Nations. Forty years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  life's dynamics have forced us to deepen  modulate and broaden its application and protection. Let us preserve the institutions created to safeguard these basic rights  including respect for groups of society and for matters that were barely understood a few years ago.On the other hand  Mexico will continue to wage a head-on war against the terrible threat of drug trafficking. We support all multilateral steps taken in this area  because drug trafficking is an international phenomenon that can only be effectively confronted through a pooling of our resources. But what we need is effective  constructive international co-operation that takes into account in a balanced way this criminal phenomenon so harmful to society  in all its aspects: production  trafficking and consumption. It should be an expression of world solidarity  not a cause for discord or manipulation. Mexico will continue its steadfast battle against this criminal epidemic  this threat to public health. But it calls upon all those plagued by this international crime to shoulder their responsibilities. The Governments of the major centres of consumption cannot use easy but ineffective solutions to avoid the fundamental burden of what is their problem.Let me reiterate Mexico's deep belief in the irreplaceable role of the United Nations. It is hard to think of a political settlement anywhere in the world without the presence and active co-operation of the Organization. Even where the initial negotiations are carried out by others  the United Nations is of decisive importance because on behalf of the international community it formalizes implements and monitors the fulfilment of agreements; in nearly all cases its organs have a general mandate to define a settlement.No major co-operative project could be carried out without its support and its technical resources. Nor could there be peaceful coexistence among States  based on the rule of law and mutual respect  without the guarantees and political backing of the United Nations.At San Francisco  peace and security among nations were entrusted to the Organization. This splendid project for our civilization  which followed a period of barbarism  continues to be fully valid  but only on one condition: that all States conform in their behaviour to the rules they themselves have imposed and to which they have committed themselves. For developing countries  the multilateral forums have been particularly valuable as a place to air our problems and fight to defend our interests. In a community of more than 160 sovereign countries we must  of course  have international democracy.This does not mean a ""tyranny of the majority""  but rather a joining of problems  expressed in a united manner and considered by the community of States. Disarmament  the eradication of colonialism  respect for the sovereignty of peoples and for human rights  the elimination of apartheid  the settlement of regional conflicts and the goals of international co-operation have never  anywhere  been a senseless expression of tyranny  but a pre-condition for freedom  security and dignity for the majority of the world's population. Some of these purposes  indeed  ate now espoused by those who were once opposed to them.There have been undeniable achievements which must be consolidated. There are also pending matters  such as world economic imbalances and the conflict in Central America. The solution of all these matters depends to a great extent on unified action by developing countries.The international machinery for co-ordination and consultation must therefore be strengthened and made more effective. The Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 are committed to preparing for the future so that succeeding generations may have more and better food  housing  education and clothing. Regional bodies too have much to do here. There must be solidarity and organization  joint efforts and shared goals. In Latin America and the Caribbean  we have strengthened political co-ordination and are making advances in the economic integration of our countries. The united mobilization of the considerable material and human resources of Latin America and the Caribbean will without question lend our countries greater capacity in external negotiations and new opportunities for internal co-operation and development.The work of the group of eight Latin American Presidents is a clear manifestation of our determination to seek solutions to our problems and to redefine our links with the rest of the world  as is faithfully reflected in the Acapulco compromise  the basic charter of a system of political co-ordination in Latin America which opens the way for further regional integration. The crisis has at least had the positive effect of further bringing together the peoples of  Latin America. This has been possible thanks to democratic changes in our societies in recent years. Thus  we are approaching a stage where we shall strengthen our unity  make progress -Ñ the path of economic complementarity  and consolidate our democratic institutions. He shall give fresh impetus to our economies and increase the well-being of our peoples.We are coming to the end of the 1980s with feelings of optimism about the role of diplomacy and negotiation as political tools with a special place in relations among States. The atmosphere of confrontation and intolerance that began the decade has given way to detente. Disarmament  a crucial matter that went through a period of deep lethargy  is new engendering renewed hope  and there is progress in the settlement of regional conflicts. Nevertheless  we are concerned that we may see the return in a new form of the time when the majority of States were fated merely to accept and confirm agreement - or competition - between the Powers. We can have genuine peace and true security only with the active participation of a politically organized community of States acting within the United Nations and under its constitutional authority. The great question in the coming years will inevitably focus on the economic development of the poorest nations. Advances in the solution of international conflicts are not matched by the poor performance with respect to the economic problems of non-industrialized nations. There can be no progress in international stability  peace and security unless effective steps are taken in the context of mechanisms where responsibility is shared by developed and developing countries  which would result in sustained economic growth for the latter. These mechanisms must turn their political attention to three points: new financial flews  debt and foreign trade.Mexico reiterates its conviction that today a civilized international life can be attained only on the basis of respect for law  the sovereign dignity of all nations and the genuine economic and social well-being of their peoples. Only then will peace  development and democracy be possible. "
"92",4619,"MLI",43,1988,"ï»¿I take pleasure in greeting the members of the Assembly on behalf of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and of the Republic of Mall.It is also a pleasure  Sir  to congratulate you warmly on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. Your personal qualities and the wealth of experience that has won the confidence of the Assembly guarantee the success of the work of this session. I take this opportunity to extend my warmest congratulations to your predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  on his effectiveness in guiding the work of the Assembly at its forty-second session.I wish also to express to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our great appreciation of his untiring efforts to promote the ideals of the United Nations and of his bold initiatives designed to improve the performance of the United Nations and find appropriate solutions to some of the political and economic problems that afflict mankind. The recent award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is a confirmation of the relevance of the ideals of our Organization and a recognition of its merits.The United Nations is the embodiment of our common will to unite our forces and harmonize our efforts to fulfil man's profound aspiration to peace  freedom and well-being. The Charter contains the rules of conduct that should enable us to achieve those ideals  namely t the non-use of force  good neighbourliness  the peaceful settlement of disputes  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  respect for fundamental human rights and solidarity and mutual assistance among peoples.A quick look at the international scene shows that we are still far from achieving those ideals. The Charter is continually violated. Hotbeds of tension and wars persist on the planet. Material  moral and intellectual poverty continue to be the lot of millions of persons throughout the world. Fundamental human rights are still flouted as a result of colonialism and racism.The most flagrant violation of the Charter is taking place in the southern part of Africa. In South Africa 21 million blacks  who make up the overwhelming majority of the population  are denied their most basic rights by a white minority. Treated as foreigners in their own country  15 million of them have been shunted off to bantustans  those reservations where the aridity of the soil is matched only by the rigours of the climate. To keep them in a state of subjection  an avalanche of savagely repressive acts assails them every day. That is the meaning of apartheid  a policy of hatred and denial of human dignity.Pushed to the limit by barbaric acts of repression  the black community as a whole has rebelled. It no longer fears death; with bare hands it confronts one of the best equipped police forces and armies in the world. In panic  the racist minority in Pretoria has declared a state of emergency and stepped up acts of repression  torture  arrest  deportation and assassination.Let  in spite of all this  the black population is continuing its struggle. The heroic resistance of the blacks of South Africa to the armed forces of the Pretoria racists is the best proof that a people struggling for its freedom is an invincible people.The crystallization of antagonisms in South Africa is creating a situation that threatens a blood bath of terrifying dimensions  which must be prevented in the interest of all South Africans. In this regard  the minority regime of Pretoria should  on the one hand  refrain from any action likely to exacerbate this explosive situation and  on the other  immediately take the following necessary measures end the state of emergency; liberate all political prisoners  including Nelson MandelaÂ·  and put into effect democratic processes designed to achieve a multiracial  egalitarian society in South Africa.I take this opportunity to urge States which are in a position to bring the Pretoria Government to reason to use their influence to induce it to implement Security Council resolution 615 (1988)  which requests a stay of execution for the Sharpeville Six and the commuting of the death sentence imposed on them.The racist Pretoria Government is carrying out the same inhuman policy of blind repression in Namibia which it has illegally occupied for more than 40 years. Namibia is the only Territory under a mandate to which the relevant provisions of the Charter relating to the freedom of peoples have not been applied. The Security Council and the General Assembly have adopted an impressive number of resolutions and decisions  but their implementation has continually been impeded by the intransigence of the Pretoria Government. The best-known case is that of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The Organization of African Unity is following with particular interest the diplomatic efforts now under way to bring about a definitive solution to the question of Namibia. It supports all sincere efforts whose objective is to enable the Namibian people to regain its independence and to establish peace and security in southern Africa.Last August the international community in the context of the Oslo Conference  devoted attention to one of the tragedies resulting from the policy of apartheid of the South African Government - the situation of refugees  repatriated persons and displaced persons in southern Africa. The Conference adopted a plan of action for the provision of assistance to affected peoples and countries in southern Africa and the establishment of lasting peace in the region. We hope that at this session the General Assembly will endorse that plan of action.We take this opportunity to express our more sincere gratitude to the international community for its demonstration of solidarity with Africa during that international Conference and to appeal to it to commit itself to the implementation of that plan of action. There are other conflicts on the African continent  including those concerning the Western Sahara and the Chad-Libya question.With regard to Western Sahara there have been notable developments. With the normalization of relations between the States of the subregion  we hope that efforts already made and those that will be undertaken by the Secretary-General and the Acting Chairman of the Organization of African Unity will result in the near future in the organization in that Territory of an orderly  free and general referendum on self-determination.Concerning the Chad-Libya dispute  is new dynamism has fortunately been given to the peace process worked out by the ad hoc committee of the Organization of African Unity following the important initiatives announced by Colonel Ma'Ammar Qaddafi on the twenty-fifth anniversary of our continental organization  and by the very positive reaction of President Hussein HabrÃ© to this situation.In the Middle East  the spontaneous and continuing popular uprising of the Palestinians in the occupied territories to put an end to the Israeli occupation is testimony to the indisputable Palestinian reality. No lasting peace can be established in this region without restoring the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people.The Organization of African Unity is convinced that the solution to the Middle East crisis depends on the convening of an international conference  under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation of all interested parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.With respect to the conflict in the Gulf  we welcome the crowning of the efforts of the Secretary-General and all those other efforts of good will which culminated in the acceptance of a cease-fire by Iran and Iraq  thus putting an end to eight years of fratricidal war.It is equally gratifying to note the important progress made in the search for a solution to the Afghan problem  following upon the signing of the Geneva agreements on 14 April last.In Asia  we hope that a lasting  negotiated solution to the problem of Kampuchea will soon be found and that the resumption of talks between the North and South of the Korean peninsula will also achieve positive results. In this connection  the proposal for the convening of a joint North-South peace conference on the peaceful reunification of an independent Korea deserves the attention and support of the international community.In Central America  we invite the Support Group to pursue efforts at establishing an atmosphere of peace and harmony in the region.Given the threat of nuclear destruction hanging over the world  the most urgent task for mankind is to promote nuclear disarmament. No people in the world is unaware of this imperative need. That is why the entire international community welcomed the signing  on 8 December 1987  of the Treaty on the Elimination of Medium-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles. There cannot be genuine progress in the disarmament process as long as the world continues to live in a cold-war atmosphere. This fundamental truth was highlighted by the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  which  owing to the lack of consensus on essential issues  was unable to adopt a final document. Hence  only by translating our sense of common destiny into action will we be able to resolve the paradox of spending $1 000 billion each year in the production of lethal weapons  while only a fraction of that sum would make our planet a land of prosperity for millions of people who today suffer from illness  hunger  thirst and ignorance. For its part  the Organization of African Unity  at its very first regular session  held in Cairo in June 1964  adopted the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa. That decision was reaffirmed in several resolutions of our continental Organization. However  while the States members of the Organization of African Unity have been firmly committed to excluding nuclear weapons from our continent  the racist regime in Pretoria has engaged in a frenzied  effort to acquire nuclear weapons. The acquisition of a nuclear strike force by the champions of apartheid would dangerously jeopardize security on our continent. The Security Council must take effective measures to ensure respect for the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa. Another factor threatening the security of Africa is the flooding of our continent with industrial toxic wastes. This activity  a crime against the peoples of Africa is an outrage to international morality. We hope that this issue  which we have asked to have inscribed as an item on the agenda  will be seriously discussed and that strong measures will be adopted with a view to freeing our young countries of the grave dangers inherent in the dumping of the wastes produced as the result of the development of the industrialized countries. From the time of its birth the Organization of African Unity enshrined in its charter the will of its member States to co-ordinate and harmonize their cultural policies. That decision has been met outstandingly reflected in the adoption of a Cultural Charter for Africa# in which we affirm that  for our peoples  African culture is the surest way to implement harmonious social and economic development and safeguard our great virtues. Indeed  African culture remains an inexhaustible source of our strength and our resistance. Its true significance can be seen in our struggle for political  economic and social liberation  in our struggle for development. The time has come for the international community to grasp the meaning and scope of this concept of development based on values other than simply quantitative and material growth. Several years ago we ardently called for the proclamation of a Decade for Cultural Development. Our request was granted at the forty-first session of the Assembly; and now we need to act so as to ensure that this Decade will not become merely one more decade that does not produce the results expected of it. At the beginning of the 1970s  the objective of ""health for all in the year 2000"" was proclaimed by the general assembly of the World Health Organization. That ambitious goal was both commendable and within the reach of mankind. The results of the actions undertaken by the African States are significant  but a great deal remains to be done. In order to step up the development process for primary health care and to meet that goal in the year 2000  a new approach known as the Bamako Initiative was set at the 37th meeting of the Committee of African Health Ministers  held in Bamako in September 1987  and adopted by the member States of the Organization of African Unity last May. This is an African strategy within the context of a generalized economic crisis; it calls for the effective commitment of peoples to define and administer their own health problems. On behalf of the women and children of Africa  I should like urgently to appeal to the international community for financial  material and technical support for this bold initiative  whose impact will be of the greatest benefit for all mankind. The international economic situation continues to be of concern. The crisis affects the developing countries in particular; and it is the African continent that has been affected the most. Given this situation  the African countries have firmly committed themselves and mobilized in the search the most appropriate ways and means to overcome the crisis. Thus  the Heads of States or Government of the Organization of African Unity adopted Africa's Priority Programme for Economic Recovery of Africa  with the objective of setting the basis for sustained growth and self-maintained and self-based development at the national and continental levels. This Programme was the subject of special consideration by the General Assembly at its thirteenth special session  which culminated in the adoption of the United Nations Programme for African Recovery and Development for the period 1986-1990. The present session provides us with an opportunity to consider the implementation of this Programme during the past two years and to evaluate efforts to be undertaken to ensure its full implementation. In conformity with the commitment they made within the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development  the African countries have worked out important programmes for economic reform and structural adjustment.In their plans for economic and social development  the majority of the African States have given absolute priority to agricultural development  food security  increased levels of agriculture productivity and production and therefore to food self-sufficiency. Tb African countries have also begun reforms in the support sectors of agriculture  namely  agro-industry  trade  finance  transportation and communication.Despite all these considerable efforts  agricultural production has not increased to the extent we expected. The rates of growth during the period 1985-1986 for the entire African continent were for the most part below those for the period 1984-1985  nor did the situation improve in 1987.In particular  regarding transportation and communication  actions dealt especially with projects designed to step up the implementation of the Decade for Transportation and Communication for Africa  1978-1988. Evaluation of this Decade  which has just been completed  showed that the objectives of the physical integration of the continent were not fully achieved because of a lack of resources. In the light of the situation the African Governments  in order to complete those efforts begun during the first decade  have proposed to the international community the launching of a second decade of transportation and communication for Africa for the period 1991-2000. It would be desirable for this proposal to be adopted by all and for the development of Africa to serve as a springboard for a contract of international solidarity.Regarding trade and finances  actions have been taken to provide good prices for agricultural products. A number of African countries are now guaranteeing minimum prices to producers for foodstuffs and for most agricultural exports. Similarly concrete action has been undertaken to identify and eliminate obstacles to an expansion of trade.Another high priority area of the United Nations Programme is the struggle against drought and desertification. To stop these phenomena  which have created a profound imbalance in our continent between man  crops  cattle and the international environment  resort to appropriate technology is indispensable  which none of our countries can manage alone.Moreover  during the last two years  many African countries  already victims of drought  have been stricken by that terrible scourge the invasion of locusts. Various operations  with international assistance  have been carried out to combat these predators. Despite all these factors  in several parts of the continent great swarms of these locusts  whose reproduction was promoted by an exceptionally heavy rainy season  continue to represent a serious threat to future harvests. The international community should pursue and step up its assistance to Africa in its struggle against this scourge.In the context of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development  the international community has committed itself to giving Africa the necessary financial resources for the implementation of this Programme. We are obliged to note that during the period 1936-1988 despite certain efforts on the part of the international community  the financial flows towards Africa were clearly insufficient. There was an unprecedented decline in public assistance. The international economic environment did not improve as expected. Thus  given the lack of concrete and timely measures to support the efforts made by African countries to restore their communities  the results achieved by African foreign trade during the first two years of the implementation of the United Nations Programme had been disappointing.A decline in export earnings has forced the majority of African countries to reduce their imports in particular those production factors which are indispensable for development projects.The problem of external debt is still a topic of the greatest concern. We will recall that at the end of 1987 the Organization of African Unity (OAU) deemed it necessary to convene a special Conference of Heads of State and Government to consider this pressing problem. At the close of that Conference  which was held in Addis Ababa  a declaration was adopted reflecting the joint position of Africa.This document spelt out the development  magnitude  structure and economic consequences of the continent's external debt} it defined a strategy aimed at reducing the burden of the African debt.The Conference expressed the hope that the creditor countries and institutions of Africa would take concrete measures to alleviate the burden of Africa's external debt. In addition  it asked the international community to take into consideration the will clearly expressed by Africa to convene an international conference on the external debt. This international conference should promote the establishment of a constructive dialogue based on the proposals put forward in the joint position on the crisis of Africa's external debt. I should like here to reaffirm that the African countries will honour the commitments undertaken under that debt and to insist that our creditors respond to our wish for concerted action and for more harmonious relations. In the search for solutions to the economic problems of Africa  it is important to be aware of the relationship between factors such as financial flows  the level of commodity rates and the foreign debt. Thus it is imperative that integrated measures be adopted to reverse the present tendency which makes the African continent a net exporter of capital.To allow our country to import an import rate that meets the needs for economic recovery and development  the flow of resources towards Africa must  according to the estimates of the Economic Commission for Africa (EGA)  significantly increase to achieve the level of 3US 29.7 billion in 1990.I should like to take the opportunity provided here to hail the initiatives of the member countries of the Committee for Aid to Development aimed at cancelling part of the debt of the African countries. The international community can and must do better. It must  in particular  demonstrate the necessary political will to implement the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) which deal with alleviating the burden of the external debt and transfer of resources. While recognizing that it bears the main responsibility for its development  Africa is aware that its destiny is closely linked to that of the rest of the world. It is in that spirit of interdependence that I appeal to the international community to provide appropriate  effective support for the efforts now being made by Africa to achieve economic recovery.The year 1988 is the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In a few weeksâ time we shall be celebrating this historic event  which makes a significant stage in our inspiring progress towards that great ideal put forward in the United Nations Charter  proclaiming our faith in fundamental human rights  the dignity and worth of the human person and the equality of rights of men and women  and nations large and small. This fortieth anniversary therefore  will provide a unique opportunity for reaffirming our confidence and faith in this shared ideal and our firm determination to encourage and ensure universal respect for human rights.Forty years after the adoption of the Declaration it is high time for the international community to direct its attention to new prospects of creating an environment favourable to the liberation and development of man. The mission assigned to us by the Charter is that of building a radiant future for all peoples and for all men a future of peace  harmony and co-operation.I assure Members of the total readiness and full commitment of Africa and all African peoples in the march of the United Nations towards that objective."
"93",4660,"MLT",43,1988,"ï»¿Mr. President  I am delivering this statement on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malta Mr. Vincent Tabone. Unfortunately unforeseen circumstances did not permit my Foreign Minister to be in New York at this time and he has requested me to convey his sincere regret for not being able to deliver this address in person as he had intended.Although I am addressing the General Assembly late in the course of the general debate  my congratulations to you on being elected to the presidency of the Assembly are no less warm and genuine than those of all the preceding speakers. Your excellent credentials  your vast experience in the field of international diplomacy as well as your skill and leadership assure us of a fruitful session. Our appreciation and thanks go also to the outgoing President Mr. Peter Florin  the Deputy Foreign Minister of the Ger roan Democratic Republic  for the way he led the Assembly during the past 12 months.A year ago the Prime Minister of Malta  in his first address to this General Assembly  confirmed Malta's confidence ""in the role that the United Nations has to play in the maintenance of peace in the world  the enhancement of security for each and every Member State  the substitution of dialogue and negotiations for armed conflict  and the encouragement of co-operation at all levels and across the barriers of race  ideology  size  power and wealth for the welfare of mankind."" (A/42/PV.32  p. 58)Twelve months later we can look on the intervening period as one in which the United Nations has demonstrated as never before that it is capable of rising to the expectations that its founders placed in it. As we speak of the organization we should not lose sight of the fact that we are  by and large  speaking about its Member States  because the Organization is what we make it. Many things have changed over the recent past and each one  in its own way  may have had an effect on the improved situation. But when all is said and done it is not the Organization or the world around it that has changed but our perception  our values  our confidence  our readiness to stretch out our hands to help each other. There is no reason why we should look back. The more we put into this Organization by way of support and faithfulness  the more we get out of the United Nations.I would be failing in my duty if I were not to underline the indefatigable efforts of our Secretary-General  Me. Javier Perez de Cuellar  to ensure that the efforts of the United Nations for peace bear fruit. We refused to be daunted by the difficulties in front of him  and his perseverance and faith in the goodwill of negotiators succeeded in several instances which had defied solution over very long years. The greatest tribute and thanks that we can render him is to facilitate his task through greater co-operation and trust among each other.It was therefore very apt that the United Nations peace-keeping forces should become the recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize this year. The role of these forces usually remains unsung  but their very silent performance is their very strength. It is well that we should be reminded that there are States and people facing risks in areas of conflict which are not their own - that is  looking from a very narrow geographic point of view  for after all we all live in the same world and there is hardly any conflict that may not engulf other bystanders.Even in moments such as this  when we share our satisfaction at the role of the United Nations and its peace-keeping forces  we cannot but be reminded that there are still many areas where peace does not reign as yet. The military United Nations peace-keeping force has still to be replaced by stronger and more lasting forces forged across the negotiating table in the realization that it is in the common interest of our peoples to arrive at solutions peacefully.My Government does not miss an opportunity to stress the common responsibility in this respect of all States  and to urge that all our actions and public pronouncements should have as their end the drawing together of peoples  the solution to conflicts  the generation of co-operation. We cannot  with a sense of responsibility  concentrate on condemnations  accusations and negative pronouncements which tend to heighten tension and stiffen attitudes rather than bring together the parties that roust live together in peace.The developments in the international situation over the recent past should encourage all of us to have more faith in the process of negotiation. This Assembly has heard over and over again of these positive developments and I need not go into great detail. I shall simply list them because the list is indeed impressive  especially when compared with the failures of the past. We note the Geneva accords on Afghan is tan Å£ the cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq and the start to a negotiated peace the agreement on the implementation of a peace plan for Western Sahara; the renewed inter-communal talks in which the encouraging movements towards the implementation of the independence plan for Namibia; the rapprochement among the parties involved in the Kampuchea question; the positive measures taken by the parties concerned in New Caledonia; the opening of new avenues of peace between Chad and Libya; and the declarations from both sides in favour of the reunification of Korea. Even in southern Africa there seem to be the first indications of a movement towards a change.But  of course  the agreement between the United States of America and the Soviet Union which heralded the first steps in the dismantling of the iv nuclear arsenals  the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - was without a doubt the most significant success which has encouraged all to realize that with goodwill  perseverance and mutual confidence what had been considered impossible becomes possible after all. We note with satisfaction that these two nations have not stopped at that point but  encouraged by what they have achieved  have embarked on further negotiations aimed at more significant reductions in their nuclear arsenal.These positive developments have not been mentioned by the various speakers without a sense of realism that makes us all aware that there are still problems  very serious ones  that still defy solution in spite of efforts from a number of well-meaning sources. The reasons for failure may be several  but if we analyse them we are sure to find that they do not differ essentially from the same reasons that held back progress and solutions on those problems where we are now registering success. It is attitudes that have to change.Earlier this year we had the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament  which held high promise of success - and indeed consensus was readied on some very important issues. However  on other issues  such as the arms race in outer space  disarmament and development  zones of peace and nuclear-weapon-free zones  no agreement could be readied. What was gained during that special session should not be allowed to evaporate; on the contrary  it should be preserved and developed end exploited in the hope that it will lead to agreement on a wider area. Malta made its studied contribution to that session and I need not go over the same ground at length.I would  however  stress that we should not be carried away by slogans and ClichÃ©s but should remember at the same time that since the last world war any number of regional conflicts have been fought with conventional and not nuclear weapons  and that these have wrought havoc and death and caused tidal waves of human refugees  Let- not the awesome fear of a nuclear holocaust make us insensitive to the threat of other weapons. Disarmament must be all-embracing and balanced to ensure the security of all  where zones of peace and nuclear-weapon-free zones become credible and meaningful.As an island State Malta cannot but pay special attention to the seas around us and the weapon systems that proliferate therein. It is with the aim of maintaining a balance that we urge that disarmament and confidence- and security-building measures should not be limited to the land masses only. We are not alone in stressing this point and we expect that due attention will be given to this aspect in international disarmament forums. No statement could possibly do justice to all the issues that are of interest to all Member States of the United Nations  and I shall definitely not try to do so. On the other hand  no statement would be complete without a reference to two problem areas that have been facing us for far too long without any real progress towards their solution. These are the question of apartheid in South Africa and the constant turmoil in the Middle East  where the Palestinians are still without a homeland of their own. Can the world  can the people in these areas  go on living in these conditions of strife  deprivation and death? Do we expect the deprived ones to accept with good grace the conditions imposed on them? Is there anyone who can really believe that in this era of awakened awareness of human rights a solution is possible without due regard to the cries of those who do not enjoy full rights in their own homeland? A change of attitude of the mind is required  a change which needs courage  foresight and faith  change as momentous as that which made the INF Treaty possible.This year this Organization is commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It would therefore be appropriate if we reaffirmed the pledge made 40 years ago  that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights  and worked with greater vigour to put that noble principle into practice for all peoples throughout the world. Life is precious  but the quality of life is of no less importance. When one speaks of the quality of life one's mind may focus on a number of issues  but one which is very likely to be prominent is the degradation of the rational human being through an irrational dependence on dangerous or debilitating drugs. The international community recognized this danger long ago  and we have within the United Nations system the International Narcotics Control Board and a long-standing Convention to control the use of drugs. Regrettably  the abuse of drugs and illicit drug trafficking have become more widespread and are closely linked with international crime. The forthcoming Vienna conference of plenipotentiaries convened to adopt a new Convention against the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances is therefore timely and important.Development leading to better economic performance and an improvement in the way of life are generally acknowledged as valid national aims  which  however  can best be realized through international co-operation. There are still great inequalities between States and  let us admit it  within States. The reasons are numerous and spread in all directions. Any attempt to  reduce the complicated interplay in the world economy to simple stereotyped clichÃ©s is unrealistic; worse still  it is ineffective in offering a solution to those in need. The United Nations can also play a constructive role in this respect  especially through the intergovernmental agencies that deal with specialized economic and social human activity. National interests are bound to feature prominently in negotiations within these bodies  and  since intransigence at such meetings rarely leads to dramatic consequences like those in the field of security. State representatives tend to become less accommodating.Even here a change of mind  a change of attitude  is called for. After the Second World War a far-sighted United States of America realized that a destroyed Europe could only breed strife and discontent. It realized that a healthy Europe could be a partner in economic development  and the Marshall Plan came into being. Everyone knows what a huge success the Plan turned out to be  to the benefit of both the donor and the recipient countries and to the world economy as a whole. Today the same situation can be said to apply with the developed countries on one side and the developing countries on the other. Stagnation in the world economy brings us all down  while the stimulus of actively developing economies presents opportunities to all. On the problem of massive national debts such an awareness is emerging  but there are other spheres where greater and more efficient international co-operation could alleviate the plight of developing States  to the benefit of economic development In general. Restrictions and other protective measures should be used sparingly.The United Nations Development Programme is one very effective vehicle in the promotion of economic and social development. Malta has benefited from the Programme  and we are grateful for this. We urge that the funds at the disposal of the Programme be increased and that the criteria for establishing the national indicative planning figures be less tied to the criterion of gross national product per capita  which can be grossly misleading.Many previous speakers have raised the question  in one way or another  whether economic development is compatible with the maintenance of a good quality of life. The fact that the question is being raised with greater frequency at national and international levels is an indication that development has  at times  led to a degradation in the quality of life. Often this was done without a full realization of the consequences. : As we come to understand the world around us better  and to appreciate nature's precarious balance  we come to realize that not all so-called progress is an unmixed blessing. This is a new challenge to the world community  one which is gaining urgency as we realize that our environment is being adversely affected by human activity. It is unrealistic to expect that the solution lies in returning to the old days which are sometimes described in idyllic but incorrect terms. Many of the problems we face today have grown with us over the past decades. They grew as national policies were evolved either with an imprecise appreciation of the consequences or in a short-sighted assessment that the consequences could be blown away  literally  flushed down the drain  metaphorically  or buried - in someone else's back garden.This is an area where  hopefully   traditional rivalries and groupings will not interfere in international co-operative efforts. The Mediterranean Action Plan  which grew out of the Barcelona Convention drawn up under the aegis of the United Nations Environment Programme; has demonstrated that human awareness can overcome political limitations. The Mediterranean Sea does not belong to any single State or group of countries  or indeed to the Mediterranean people alone. It belongs to all of us  and the onus falls mainly on the coastal States to ensure that it remains a healthy living resource for the benefit of them all. Other States which ply this sea or use it in one way or another  or affect its environment through discharges or activities which may initiate well beyond its shores  have the obligation to respect the concern expressed by the people in the area and to co-operate to the maximum extent possible. I do not speak of the Mediterranean because it is a special area. It happens to be the area where Malta is situated; an area where the countries of the region are more actively involved in co-operative efforts to preserve the environment; an area which is of direct interest to many States outside the region; in short  an area which Illustrates the issues involved and indicates the way of co-operation at the regional level and beyond. Other regions are similarly placed. Sometimes the problem which faces us is of even greater dimensions  where we have to think more in global than regional terms. Climate  or  rather  the way in which human activity can affect changes in the world climate in general  with consequences for the life we lead  the food we grow  the land we inhabit  the air we breathe  the light and warmth we need - all this is the concern of the human race as a whole. The problem itself is too big to be tackled piecemeal by individual nations. It is for this reason that Malta proposed that a new item be put on the agenda for consideration at this session of the General Assembly  and the fact that the proposal was unanimously accepted as a matter of urgency demonstrates that there is an awareness of the problem. In fact  there are already initiatives under way  and one cannot fail to mention the work of the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme within the framework of the United Nations system. There are also other national and international initiatives  especially at the scientific level  and we have had the formidable report of the World Commission on Environment and Development  under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Brundtland of Norway  which has rightly been praised by several speakers as a most important contribution to the issue before us.The title of the new agenda item  ""Declaration proclaiming climate as part of the common heritage of mankind""  reflects the vastness of the problem and its importance to the human race  and indicates the positive action envisaged. Since the item will soon be discussed in detail  this is not the time to elaborate or to propose solutions. My delegation would only underline the need for as broad a study of the problem as is possible  given the resources of the United Nations  the intergovernmental agencies and other international and national specialized institutions  and the need for drawing up a co-ordinated plan of action which will serve as a guide to all of us in a co-operative action which will make national efforts more effective for the benefit of all mankind. This should not be a dream  it should be stark reality for ourselves  but more so for future generations. Past generations and civilizations have grown and died  some literally buried in sands where lushness existed before. Those people may not have realized what was going on and ascribed their fate to unfriendly gods. Today we know more - though we should be humble enough to admit that there is still more to be learned. We know at least that the gods that cause such dislocation as past generations experienced nay well be found not in heaven or Hades but here on Earth amongst us.One cannot speak of future climatic changes that could affect our lives without a reference to the spate of unusual natural disasters that have afflicted so many parts of the world in recent months  with grave consequences to the people who have become victims to these forces that dwarf human efforts. Floods  winds  droughts  storms  earthquakes - all took their toll. The world as a whole is required to help not only to make good the damage and to rehabilitate life  but more effectively to understand the cause of such disasters and to prevent them or to minimize as much as possible the effects of such natural phenomena. We are convinced that efforts in the field of conservation of climate will produce side benefits which will also apply to situations such as these.Our attention is often drawn to problems  conflicts and disasters that make us forget that there are also positive developments that require equal attention and encouragement. Most speakers - and I myself - have made reference to some major positive developments  but permit me to put cm record a few other  perhaps more modest developments with which Malta is more directly concerned.As a participating State in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)  Malta continues to co-operate with all the 34 member States  but more particularly with the participating neutral and non-aligned States on whom falls the unenviable task of trying to reconcile the initial distant views and interests of the other States without forgetting that they themselves have particular interests to safeguard. We are convinced that a positive end to the Vienna follow-up conference is now in sight. That should usher in a substantial programme of action that should consolidate co-operation and security  not only on the continent of Europe and the seas and regions immediately surrounding it  but in an even broader area as tensions and suspicion subside.In the wider area of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries Malta is pleased to note that a wind of change is blowing that takes into account the changing international scene  where the traditional military-bloc confrontation is giving way to a realization that the common will calls for more co-operation than confrontation. The non-aligned countries of the world  whether members of the Movement or not  have a constructive and supportive role to play in this connection. All our efforts  all our pronouncements and our behaviour  should encourage this trend towards detente.The Commonwealth is another group of nations that can - and does - contribute to greater international understanding and peace. Malta is pleased to participate in Commonwealth training programmes for students and refugees from Namibia and South Africa and proudly continues to offer scholarships for that purpose in its educational institutions. Conscious that out main resources are in the human field  we seek ways in which we can exploit them to our benefit and that of the international community. Earlier this year  following up the initiative taken by Malta in the United Nations on the question of aging  we opened in Malta the United Nations International Institute on Aging. We were gratified to welcome the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuelar  on that occasion  thus further strengthening the agreement signed on 9 October 1987 between the Prime Minister of Malta and the United Nations Secretary-General.On Saturday  8 October 1988  the International Maritime law Institute was officially established in Malta. On that occasion we had the honour to receive His Excellency Chandrika P. Srivastava  Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO)  which has given its name and sponsorship to that initiative. The Secretary-General of the IMO  in officially declaring the Institute open  explained that the Institute would fill a void that has long been felt for the training of lawyers from developing countries in international maritime law.In accordance with articles 276 and 277 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  the Government of Malta has taken the initiative of proposing the establishment  in Malta  of a Mediterranean centre for research and development in marine industrial technology  which would strengthen the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Malta already acts as host to the IMO Regional Oil Combating Centre. Both initiatives would bring together the resources of developed and developing countries for the benefit of all in the field of the transfer of science and technology. One of the most important decisions taken by the Heads of Government of the Commonwealth at their October 1987 meeting at Vancouver was the creation of a new Commonwealth institution to promote co-operation in distance education. Malta has offered facilities concentrating on marine studies and the problems of small States  and that offer has been accepted.As a European country  Malta plays a role in that region as well. I have already referred to Malta's role in the region. At this moment it is also offering its services as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe. That task came at a propitious moment when that Council is giving more attention to greater co-operation and dialogue with European States that do not yet meet the criteria set up by the Council of Europe. The concept of a united Europe that stretches to the Urals is one in which Malta believes  and we will not lose any opportunity to explore avenues that could bring it nearer to realization.In the meanwhile the process of closer co-operation and unity cannot be stopped  and Malta seeks to follow the natural course open to its that of strengthening its links with the European Economic Community. Within a few months the Government of Malta has cleared the deck of the accumulated debris that had stood in its way. That is not an end in itself  but a preparatory step for the next logical one namely an application for full membership in the Community. That  in brief is the road of international co-operation that Malta has followed in the last few months. As a small island State in a sea that has seen the rise of one Power after another  Powers both military and cultural  we cannot but be aware of our openness and vulnerability. We believe that only unity and friendship can safeguard the peace that is necessary for development  for ordered development that does not overlook the quality of life. The task ahead is not easy  but we would submit that if the determination effort and sacrifice that most nations are willing to make in time of war  when the threat facing them is more dramatic  were to be directed with equal energy towards the pursuit of peace  we would be able to take the great strides that are required to make the difficult easy and the impossible possible."
"94",4706,"MMR",43,1988,"ï»¿I deem it a privilege and an honour to extend to the President the warm felicitations of the delegation of Burma on his election as the President of the forty-third regular session of the General Assembly  we are confident that his long and brilliant career at the national level in his own country as well as on the international scene will stand him in good stead in guiding our deliberations to a fruitful conclusion.I should also like to refer to the outstanding leadership provided by His Excellency Mr. Peter Florin  the outgoing President  to the international community during the preceding session of the General Assembly. It is with a sense of satisfaction that we wish to join other delegations in paying tribute to the Secretary-General   Mr. Perez de Cuellar for his dedication to the Organization and for his tireless efforts in the cause of peace.The agenda of the General Assembly portrays the diverse and complex nature of the issues that the United Nations faces in dealing with international problems in their global perspective. In the search for solutions  the universal nature of the Organization makes it possible to see and reflect the interest of the world at large although finding consensus to meet the interest of all has not always been easy. While many problems remain to be resolved  the Organization represents the hopes and aspirations of the world community and must therefore continue to serve as the essential instrument for harmonizing the relations between States and upholding the rule of law in international relations. We are encouraged to believe that the present international situation provides favourable opportunities for the United Nations to further its endeavours to preserve peace  increase international security and develop international co-operation.Maintaining international peace and security is at the forefront of the agenda of the United Nations. However  the interdependent nature of the world is such that issues of peace and security cannot be separated from endeavours for the common well-being of the world's population. This in turn would depend much upon finding solutions to the problems of global development and the reduction of the disparities in the conditions of life of peoples.Regional conflicts have been a particular feature of our international life and have constituted major obstacles to the implementation of the provisions of the Charter. They are a feature that is prevalent particularly in the developing areas of the world and have created obstacles to the security and well-being of peoples  exacerbated international tensions and brought about much suffering. There is the force and political will as well as a humanitarian dimension to finding solutions which will enhance the prospects for peace at the regional level.The major Powers can do much in finding solutions to international problems. However the objective of ensuring international security requires the endeavours of all Members through the collective security system of the United Nations. In the final analysis  it is through the willingness of Member States to conduct their relations on the basis of the principles of the Charter that international security can be effectively enhanced.The bilateral agreement between the two militarily most significant States constitutes the first essential step in the process of nuclear disarmament and its significance can be seen from the prospects for achieving further substantial measures.Successful disarmament negotiations are of vital interest to all nations  and agreements between States that have the primary responsibilities should have a significant bearing on the efforts of the international community. The United Nations constitutes the centre stage for all such activities.In Afghanistan  the United Nations  through the good offices of the Secretary-General  has played an important role in the achievement of the Accords  which are highly commendable. We believe that if the Geneva accords are implemented in good faith by all parties  the tragedy in which Afghanistan has been caught for nearly a decade will now come to an end and the Afghans themselves will once again be able to map out their future and reconstruct their land with the help of the international community.The favourable international environment that is conducive to the resolution of  international conflicts is also noticeable in the quest for solutions to the problem of  Kampuchea. Year after year the Assembly has reaffirmed the basic principles of International relations with regard to Kampuchea. It is time that reason and fairness prevailed ever force. We hope that the people of Kampuchea  who have suffered for so long  will have the opportunity to work out a solution that will put them on the path of national reconciliation and reconstruction. It is a source of satisfaction for my delegation to observe the recent emergence of new  positive impulses which may be conducive to what the Assembly has been endeavouring to achieve for so many years - the peaceful and negotiated settlement of the question of Kampuchea.With regard to the situation in Central America  the peace plan signed last year in Guatemala by the five Central American States reflects the desire of the peoples of Central America to live in peace  through a process of conciliation and co-operation  in accordance with the principles of self-determination and non-intervention. The prospects for peace in Central America should not be allowed to falter  and it is incumbent upon the international community to support such regional co-operation.The question of Palestine  which has been recognized as the core of the Middle East problem  has been the focus of international attention as a result of the situation that prevails in the occupied territories. The tragedy of these events is a grim reminder of the urgent need to reach a just  comprehensive and peaceful solution of the Palestinian problem.We feel that an international conference on the Middle East  under United Nations sponsorship  could serve as a useful vehicle in the search for a just and durable solution to the problem  provided all parties to the conflict are allowed to participate on an equal footing. The necessary foundations have already been laid in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).After much perseverance  the collective effort? of the Security Council have now resulted in a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq. The cease-fire constitutes the first essential step towards a negotiated settlement  through implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  that would bring about a durable peace and an end to the suffering and devastation experienced by the peoples of both countries. We continue to place much hope in the efforts of the Security Council and in the important role of the Secretary-General in the peace-keeping efforts of the United Nations and in finding a solution to the conflict.In southern Africa  the Assembly continues to face a situation in which the regime shows no sign of relenting in its efforts in maintaining the policies of apartheid. However  there are now significant developments with regard to the situation in the south-western region of Africa. The agreement on a set of principles for the establishment of peace in the region and recognition of the rights of the people of South West Africa to self-determination and freedom brings nearer the day of independence for Namibia. South Africa's intransigence and refusal to comply with the United Nations plan for Namibia constitute the obstacle to its implementation. It is hoped that the agreement reached will bring about without delay implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which constitutes the framework for the exercise by the Namibian people of their right to freedom and independence.Needless to say  the root cause of South Africa's acts of destabilization  aggression and violation of the territorial integrity of neighbouring States Lies in the regime's racial policy of apartheid. Universal condemnation and the international call for the complete abrogation of the apartheid system have not been heeded by the South African regime. The international community  through efforts in the United Nations and elsewhere  must continue to give steadfast support to the people of South Africa in their struggle against the institutionalised system of racial discrimination practised by the Pretoria regime.United Nations endeavours to foster and promote the economic and social well-being of all peoples are also a priority issue. Such efforts need to be focused on more balanced and equitable international relations and on narrowing the gap between the developed and the developing regions of the world.The developing countries continue to face an increasingly difficult economic environment. The institutions which govern international economic relations and which were created for the purpose of facilitating the smooth functioning of the global economy have not been effective in meeting the needs of the vast transformation that has taken place in the pattern of the global economy. Fundamental to these changes is the growing interdependence of nations  the recognition of which would require a more favourable international economic environment that would help to overcome the imbalances in the world economy. The revival of multilateralism is keenly needed so that the process of meaningful dialogue in areas relating to international economic co-operation may begin.The general debate in the Assembly sets the tone for co-operation between nations on affairs of international importance  for which this Organization was created  and the statements we have heard this year inspire us with confidence. At the same time  we note some remarks that do not contribute to the attainment of the purpose of our discussions  and which encroach upon what can be considered natters of an internal nature in the affairs of States. With these thoughts in mind  the delegation of Burma considers it relevant to mention developments that pertain to our country.  My country chartered the course of their history through crises and experienced situations which gravely affect their national life and result in turmoil and unrest and the occurrence of unavoidable incidents. Burma has recently passed through such a phase  which has deeply touted the hearts and minds of the nation  the Government and the people. In such a time  when there is a need to establish law and order  when there are moments of great danger and the nation is threatened  it is the duty and obligation of the authorities of the State to assume their responsibilities to overcome such difficulties.The situation prevailing today is that our nation is overcoming a period of disruption and has achieved a reasonable measure of stability. No outside Power can prescribe for Burma what its future political destiny should be  for it is the right of peoples to determine their own future. In order that the Burmese people may be able to exercise their rights  the State authorities have announced and are making arrangements for the holding of general elections  which will be free and fair and in which all political parties will be able to participate so that the multi-party system of democracy to which the people have been aspiring may be successfully established.With regard to the conduct of its foreign relations  Burma will continue to pursue its traditional independent and active foreign policy and maintain its relations with other countries on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference.As the twentieth century draws to a close  profound changes that will shape life in the century ahead are taking place on the international scene. The problems that beset the world are many and complex and the destinies of nations have become more intertwined than ever before.An atmosphere of optimism now prevails as nations express renewed faith in the United Nations. Such positive developments should bestow upon the Organization greater vitality and strength  as the universal forum for seeking solutions to the problems arising out of the complexities of our time  problems that affect all "
"95",4763,"MNG",43,1988,"ï»¿I should like to associate  myself with the greetings and congratulations extended to Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina on his election to his high office. The Mongolian delegation wishes hi  great success in discharging his responsible duties.we take this opportunity to express our gratitude to his predecessor  Comrade Peter Florin  for his skilful handling of the work of the forty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly and that of its third special session devoted to disarmament.The present session of the United Nations General Assembly is taking place at a propitious time in history   a time when the growing trend in world political is the recognition of the common destiny of peoples  the interdependence of countries and the need to resolve urgent current problems in the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and on the basis of constructive co-operation and mutual respect for the legitimate interests of the parties concerned.This is borne out by s generally positive development of from events in the world. The development in the political climate and the strengthening of mutual understanding and confidence between East and West are increasingly felt. As Î± result  the threat of a nuclear wet is diminishing. The first steps towards genuine disarmament have been taken. There are promising signs of an end to regional conflicts on the basis of a national reconciliation policy and a realistic approach.The role of the United Nations in resolving international problems is increasing considerably. The tangible results of the peace-making activities of the United Nations and the purposeful efforts of its Secretary-General are evident. The award of the Nobel Peace Prise to the United Nations peacekeeping forces is further evidence of the support which the world community is now listening to the Organisation.The Soviet-American dialogue is assuming new aspects; it is becoming more dynamic and stable. The exceptional importance of this dialogue arises from the role played by theÂ· two Powers in world politics. It might be said that the Soviet-American interaction has generated many positive changes of global dimensions. In this context  the Moscow summit meeting deserves special commendation.The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  as an independent and influential force in today's world  is playing a positive role in the solution of pressing international issues. This is evidenced by the outcome of the Havana and Nicosia meetings of foreign ministers of non-aligned countries.Public demand is making an increasing contribution to the struggle for cassation of the arms race  the elimination of the threat of a nuclear war  and the strengthening of mutual understanding  trust and co-operation among peoples.While duly acknowledging the positive changes that are taking place in the world  we cannot overlook the fact that the situation still remains complex and in many respects contradictory. TheÂ· changing plans for âcompensationâ through the modernization of various types of weapons  both nuclear and conventional  are a sign of the reluctance to give up an obsolete concept of ""nuclear deterrence"". This means that the policy of acting ""from a position of strength"" still remains the main postulate of those who are preparing such plans.One can hardly agree with those who claim that the policy of acting ""from a position of strength"" has brought about the present positive shifts in the world  when it is precisely that policy that at one time gave rise to an unbridled nuclear arms race  holding the world hostage to nuclear intimidation. It is not the policy of acting ""from a position of strength"" but the policy of reason  of realism and of a responsible attitude towards universal human values that is now needed to guide mankind onto the path towards a secure and non-violent future.The inherent danger of continuing work Ñ the ""Star Warsâ programme is that it could thwart the Soviet-American negotiations on deep cuts in strategic offensive armaments and of frustrating the efforts to prevent the militarisation of space. The development of weapons in space would not only signify a qualitatively new stage in the arms race  but would in itself pose a grave threat and contradict the logic of disarmament that has already been set in motion by the realisation of the INF Treaty. Space weapons would hang like the sword of Damocles over every country  regardless of its location  since such weapons would be an omnipresent threat. Outer space should serve peaceful purposes only. Specific guarantees are needed to ensure that life on Earth is not threatened from space. In our view  the realization of the proposal to set up an international organisation on the peaceful uses of outer space would greatly help to promote the attainment of this objective. Universal security should be fully guaranteed on Earth as well. As we see it  the notion of security is made up of a number of interrelated factors - above all  military  political  economic humanitarian and ecological. In other words  the problem calls for a comprehensive approach to collective security  as envisaged by the Charter of file United Nations. This is the main thrust of the proposal by the socialist countries regarding the establishment of a comprehensive system of international peace and security.Disarmament is one of the main roads to a secure world. The most difficult but the most essential step on that road was made by the conclusion of the Soviet-American INF Treaty and the commencement of its implementation. This should be followed by other more significant steps in reducing strategic arms  steps that should not be episodic but that would result in an irreversible and continuous process. In tills regard we look forward to the early attainment of an agreement on the 50 per cent reduction on strategic offensive armaments.It is pertinent in this regard to emphasise the Importance of preventing a situation in which disarmament in one field would lead to an arms race in another. This question is important from both the political and the military technological point of view.The most Important task has been and continues to be a complete ban on nuclear tests  the further strengthening of the non-proliferation regime of nuclear weapons and the establishment of nuclear-free zones and zones of peace in various parts of the world The need for a ban on chemical weapons is of particular urgency at the present time. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic actively supports the early completion of the work on the elaboration of an international convention on the complete prohibition and elimination of these weapons of mass destruction. We shall continue to support measures such as the strict observance of the  GenevaÂ· Protocol of 1925.One of top priority tasks in the field of disarmament is the reduction of conventional armaments and armed forces. In this respect the ongoing active search for ways of reducing the military confrontation in Europe is Ð° matter of satisfaction. The constructive proposal of the States Members of the Warsaw Treaty Organisation to this effect serve  in our view  as a sound basis for the achievement of mutually acceptable agreements.The government of the Mongolian Peopled Republic shares the view that the sale and supply of conventional weapons mist be placed under international control.Although the third special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament was unable to adopt a final document  it has nevertheless provided an impetus to the practical consideration of ways and means of attaining the goals of disarmament.The political settlement of conflicts in the world constitutes one of the crucial prerequisites for the building of a solid foundation for universal peace and security.Tangible progress has been made in resolving some of the conflicts. However  a long and difficult road still lies ahead.The conclusion of the Geneva Agreements on the settlement of the problems relating to Afghanistan has become an extremely important issue. The implementation of these Agreements demonstrates how important it is for all the parties strictly to observe their obligations. My delegation supports the proposals to consider the implementation of the Geneva Agreements and the questions concerning the cessation of their violation. As in the past  the Mongolian Peopleâs Republic is in favour of turning South-East Asia into a zone of peace  stability and co-operation. We welcome the intensification of dialogue between the countries of Indo-China and the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASSAM) with a view to finding a political solution to the Kampuchean problem. We welcome the outcome of the informal meeting held in Jakarta between the representatives of four Kampuchean parties and the countries of South-East Asia. In our view  the proposals put forward at the meeting by the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Lao People's Democratic Republic would serve as a good basis for the settlement of the problem of Kampuchea and for stabilization of the situation in the region.Another positive event is the cessation of the Iran-Iraq war. My Government sincerely welcomes the beginning of talks between the two parties and expresses the hope that they will lead to a final settlement of this conflict.A hotbed of tension persists on the Korean peninsula. The Mongolian People's Republic consistently supports the withdrawal of foreign troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea and the conversion of the peninsula into a zone of peace. We support the proposals by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with a view to laying the foundation for the peaceful reunification of Korea. The obstacles that prevent Korea from occupying its rightful place in the United Nations as a full-fledged Member should be eliminated. As in the past  the Mongolian People's Republic supports the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and its non-aligned status. We welcome the present dialogue between the representatives of the two communities of Cyprus under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.The situation in the Middle East has recently further deteriorated. Such a development emphatically underlines once more the urgent need for a comprehensive solution to the crisis. The road to such a solution lies through the convening of an international conference with the participation of the parties concerned7 including the Palestine Liberation Organization and the permanent members of the Security Council. The right of the Palestinian people to self-determination should be ensured. Israel must relinquish the occupied Arab territories.The unresolved situation in Central America is a cause of grave concern. The open interference of the United States of America in the Internal affairs of the Republic of Nicaragua constitutes the main obstacle to the realisation of the Guatemala agreements and of the national reconciliation policy of the Sandinista Government  we express full support for  and solidarity with  the struggle of the Nicaraguan people for the realization of their inalienable right to follow the path they have decided. No one has a right to encroach upon the freedom of choice of any people.	The current efforts with regard to the granting of independence to Namibia kindle hopes for a speedy solution to this problem. My Government welcomes the quadripartite negotiations of Angola  Cuba  the United States of America and South Africa designed to remove the seat of tension in the south of Africa. We resolutely condemn the apartheid policy of the South African racist regime and advocate the imposition on it of comprehensive and Mandatory sanctions  as provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.The general tendency towards improvement of the political climate did not fail to include the Asian commitment. At the same time  most of the above-mentioned regional conflicts exist there. Apart from that  the Asia-Pacific region is becoming the arena for the increasing military build-up of the United States of America and its allies. These and other factors testify to the complexity of the situation in the region.It is therefore in the interests of the peace and security of the Asia-Pacific region actively to seek ways and means of combining the efforts of all the States situated here. As our leader  Comrade J. Batmunkh  has pointed out the Mongolian Peopleâs Republic consistently advocates the strengthening of confidence and the development of co-operation between the Asian States and endeavours  within its means  to contribute to the achievement of the overall Asian security objectives. This desire has led to the proposal made by Mongolia for the establishment of a mechanism ruling out the use of force in the relations between the States of the Asia-Pacific region. The implementation of this proposal would foster the consolidation of the universal principle of peaceful co-existence in the relations between the States of the region.The recant proposals made by Comrade M.S. Gorbachev in Krasnoyarsk reflect the spirit of the new political thinking. They have further developed the Vladivostok initiatives and are specifically desisted to reduce the military confrontation in the Asia-Pacific region  to broaden good-neighbourly relations among the countries and to consolidate peace and stability in this part of the world. We welcome the further intensification and improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China as a factor the importance of which cannot be overestimated in strengthening confidence and co-operation  peace  and security in Asia and throughout the world.The Mongolian People's Republic stands for the restructuring of international economic relations on a democratic and equitable basis and for the establishment of a new international economic security.The seriousness of problems such as the underdevelopment and external indebtedness of the developing countries and the upsetting of the ecological balance as well as other issues calls for urgent actions designed to solve these problems. In this context the implementation of effective measures in the field of disarmament and the transfer for development purposes of the resources thereby released would be of great significance. The specific ways and means of resolving the problems afflicting world economic relations should be reflected in the United Nations international development strategy for the 19908.The Mongolian People's Republic submits that international problems  including humanitarian Issues  should be resolved In a spirit of cooperation on the basis of full respect for the principles of the national sovereignty of States and non-interference in their Internal affairs.Though 40 years have elapsed mince the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  we are still witnessing mass violations of these rights. The right of whole nations to self determination has not yet been realized. The conflict situations and the arms race impede the implementation of the right of peoples to peace and development. In this connection  the United Nations Declaration on the Right of Peoples to Peace remains topical. Consideration  at this session  of the implementation of the declaration on the Right of Peoples to Peace will once again draw the attention of whole world community to this important question.	Permit me  in conclusion  to express the hope that at the present session the General Assembly will make a specific contribution to the consolidation of positive changes and to the search for ways and means to eliminate negative phenomena from today's international life. "
"96",4805,"MOZ",43,1988,"ï»¿It is with great pleasure and satisfaction that I have the honour of congratulating Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of this session. His vast experience in international relations and diplomacy gives legitimacy to our expectations that our deliberations will be successful. I should like to assure him of my delegation's determination to work closely with him as he discharges the responsibilities unanimously entrusted to him. I take this opportunity to recall the recent visit President Chissano made to his beautiful country  Argentina  during which we had an opportunity to explore ways for strengthening further the friendly bilateral relations of our countries.Similarly  I should like to salute the outgoing President  His Excellency Mr. Peter Florin  Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic  for the efficient and commendable way in which he presided over the deliberations of the forty-second session and the special session devoted to disarmament.I take this opportunity also to congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr  Javier Perez de Cuellar  on his commitment and devotion to the search for solutions to international problems as well as the promotion of better understanding and co-operation among nations. We have learned with great satisfaction tills morning of the decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. That fact represents a singular recognition of the outstanding  indeed unique  role played by the United Nations in promoting peace.The situation in Mozambique continues to be characterized  on the one hand  by war imposed on us from outside and  on the other  by our firm determination to defend our independence and promote peace and progress.When addressing the last session of the General Assembly  in this Hall  His Excellency President Joaquim Alberto Chissano of the People's Republic of Mozambique referred to the massacres  the widespread destruction of social and economic infrastructures and the extremely large number of displaced Mozambicans  both inside and outside the country. In general terms  that situation still prevails today. The criminal acts of the armed terrorists continue to spread sorrow  pain  famine  insecurity and homelessness to many Mozambicans.But that is just one side of the coin. The other gives rise to increased optimism in our people as a result of the victories we have scored on the military  economic and diplomatic fronts. On the military front  our armed forces have been able to restore peace and tranquillity to various parts of our country previously affected by the criminal acts of the armed terrorists. In this endeavour  the support and participation of the front-line States  notably Zimbabwe and Tanzania  continue to be important and greatly appreciated. Equally worth mentioning is the contribution of the Malawian forces in the protection of the Nacala railway.The Mozambican Government is aware that these efforts intended to eliminate terrorism must be complemented by the adoption of other measures designed to integrate into Mozambican society the terrorists who have repented. As a result  our People's Assembly approved in December 1987 an important law - the law of amnesty. This law forgives those who have committed crimes  massacres and other abominable acts perpetrated against our people and the State. As a result of the application of this law  many terrorists have been granted amnesty and have returned to normal life.The birth of the law of amnesty translates the deep-rooted nature of the humanitarian policy of clemency adopted by FRELIMO since the times of the armed liberation struggle for our motherland.At the proclamation of our independence in 1975 a situation arose in which some Mozambicans were found to have committed  at the invitation of colonialism  heinous crimes against their own people or to have been collaborators with the colonial repression system. All these individuals were integrated into our society  and today they are working as valid citizens with other Mozambicans in national reconstruction.The law of amnesty constitutes an integral part of our efforts to bring about reconciliation  unity and the rehabilitation of those Mozambicans who were brutalized through crime and terrorism and were turned into tools of our enemy. We are ready to welcome them in to our midst and to help them regain their dignity  rights and duties as citizens of a free  independent  sovereign  non-aligned and democratic State.This process is taking place at a time when the Mozambican people are engaged in the preparations for the Fifth Congress of the PRELIMO Party and ace involved in the revision of the Constitution. These two processes constitute an example of the exercise of democracy in our country. They will strengthen democracy there and reinforce the fundamental freedoms of our citizens.We are aware that our project and our dream of building a peaceful and happy society are shared by all peoples of the world and that they enjoy the sympathy of the international community at large.One manifestation of such feeling is the visit of His Holiness Pope John Paul II to Mozambique. He was welcomed enthusiastically by the whole people  regardless of their religious belief  in a massive demonstration of national unity. We hope that his message of solidarity with  and wishes of peace to  the Mozambican people will find an echo in every corner of our globe.Those efforts go hand in hand with the economic and social recovery measures we have embarked upon. As we have repeatedly stated in the past  the war of aggression against Mozambique by armed terrorists is responsible for the overall retrogression of our development  not only because it entails the diversion of efforts and means away from other endeavours to the defence of our motherland  but also because economic sabotage and the destruction of socio-economic infrastructures were the most favoured policy of our enemy in such a war.Those who conceived the strategy of destroying our country first set out to destroy our economic base. During the last few years they have embarked upon wanton massacres  which have received widespread international condemnation. As a result of such a strategy  education and health care  which experienced considerable advances during the first seven years of our independence  are now confronted with serious and numerous difficulties  as can be seen from the following figures: 2 269 primary schools destroyed  affecting half a million pupils and 700 teachers; 400 teachers murdered  kidnapped or mutilated; 22 secondary schools destroyed  affecting 80 000 students; and 36 boarding schools and 4 teacher training centres destroyed.As I pointed out earlier  terrorism does not affect only the economy  education and health. It also affects the Mozambican man and woman  the Mozambican child  the Mozambican youth and the Mozambican family  as the following figures illustrate: 1.1 million people have been displaced from their usual places of work and residences  and 800 000 of them are in neighbouring countries; 3.3 million citizens are seriously affected; 5.9 million citizens are in a difficult situation  affected by severe shortages  in both rural and urban areas; and 200 000 children are in a difficult situation - fundamentally they are orphans  abandoned children and children who had been utilized by the terrorists to carry out their criminal acts. In addition  there are a large number of mutilated citizens and citizens with physical disabilities. It was in this dismal scenario of socio-economic conditions that we introduced the economic recovery programme and the emergency programme. As a result of the implementation of the former  it was possible to reverse the downward trend of the economy which had been taking place in the last few years.To illustrate this  the data available for the first six months of 1988 suggest overall economic growth of 5 per cent. This percentage is higher than that registered in 1987  when the gross domestic product experienced a 4 per cent growth. This growth is primarily due to the positive evolution in the agricultural sector.Despite this positive trend  our country's economic and financial situation remains difficult. Foreign debt still constitutes an enormous burden to our economy  negatively conditioning its growth. Although there has been some significant progress in the debt-rescheduling process  there has been no generalised application of the more favourable conditions we have been seeking.This situation leads to a net outflow of resources and thus prevents the allocation of finances required for the development of the productive sectors of the economy. Therefore  we hope that the consensus reached at the Toronto summit meeting regarding the provision of debt relief measures for low-income African countries will be vigorously and expeditiously implemented by all creditors. We call upon our development partners for renewed efforts aimed at an effective reduction of the stock of debt and debt-servicing obligations. In turn  in spite of its difficulties  our country will continue to do its utmost to honour its foreign debt obligations.It is with high expectations that we look forward to the forthcoming second meeting of donor countries in support of our economic recovery programme  to be held in Paris next November. It is our hope that this meeting will mobilize adequate resources that will enable us to move to the second phase of our programme for economic recovery  which contemplates the rehabilitation of infrastructures.In order to cope with the emergency situation  our Government has had to mobilize both internal and external resources. In April this year the Second International Conference on Humanitarian Assistance to Mozambique was held in Maputo  with satisfactory results.We were particularly encouraged by the fact that the international community has recognized that it is imperative to supply the affected people with the means of production and building materials and other means required for the recovery of the infrastructures destroyed or damaged by the criminal acts of the armed terrorists  so as to enable the affected people to resume their normal way of life and production and become self-sustaining. I would like to seize the opportunity to express our gratitude once again to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  to-donor Governments  to organizations and agencies of the United Nations system  to governmental and non-governmental organizations  and to humanitarian and religious institutions  for the support they have been rendering to our people.Let me turn my attention to the situation in southern Africa. Only a few weeks ago the President of the People's Republic of Mozambique  His Excellency Mr. Joaquim Chissano  described the situation in the region as follows;""Southern Africa is experiencing contradictory processes. One such process is the conflict which is rooted in the colonial past  in the persistence of the ambitions of domination  in the survival of apartheid  a political system based on inequalities of man and on racial discrimination. The other is that of solidarity amongst the peoples and States that pool their efforts together and combine their resources to promote social and economic development."" The state of affairs in southern Africa could not be better characterized. Indeed  the front-line States realized at a very early stage that their fate is intertwined by roots which can be traced back to a common history of domination  colonialism and exploitation. Thus  they have found that pooling together their resources and potentials is a definite way out of servitude to alien interests.The moral  political  diplomatic  material and military support that the front-line States are rendering to the People's Republic of Mozambique is a manifestation of this solidarity. When the blood of soldiers from the brotherly countries of Zimbabwe and Tanzania mixes with that of our SOLDIERS to safeguard sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity  this solidarity acquires an historic dimension.Mozambique  in its turn  made its modest contribution to the liberation struggle of other countries and peoples. Although Angola is experiencing difficult conditions  it has offered its territory as a rear base in the struggle for Namibia's independence  as did Tanzania  Zambia and others.The Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) constitutes one manifestation of this common objective  as well as the affirmation of the unanimous will of the countries in our region to free themselves from oppression and economic domination through the integration of their economic potential on the basis of solidarity and co-operation. This solidarity is an important factor in the establishment and preservation of peace  stability and security in the region. The People's Republic of Mozambique is proud to be part of such solidarity. Southern Africa will owe its future of peace and prosperity to this unity  cohesion and solidarity.In such an endeavour  however  we come across negative and destructive factors  which must be urgently eliminated. More specifically  we are referring to the persistence of values that are both as anachronistic and as abominable as only apartheid can be. In South Africa these factors manifest themselves through the institutionalisation of inequality  racial discrimination  injustice  division  depersonalisation  repression  oppression and refusal to recognize the fundamental rights of the majority of the people.In Namibia  colonialism still persists and represents a source of violence and conflict. In other words  colonialism constitutes a serious obstacle to peace and development.Peace initiatives aimed at bringing about a negotiated solution to these problems are now taking place. The quadripartite negotiations involving Angola  Cuba  South Africa and the United States of America are developments in line with the wishes of the region and of the world. It is our duty to encourage the parties concerned to proceed  with seriousness and responsibility  in the negotiation process so as to ensure success and implementation. We also commend the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General in order to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978).In the framework of the peace initiatives in the region  a summit meeting between the People's Republic of Mozambique and South Africa was held in Songo. Its objective is to ensure the implementation  in letter and in spirit  of commitments entered into at Nkomati. These developments cannot  and must not  in any way be used as a pretext for certain members of the international community not to fulfil their duties and responsibilities to contribute to the eradication of the apartheid system.We are aware that these efforts can bring about peace and stability only if South Africa honours its obligations.  for this reason  the international community is called upon to intensify its pressure on South Africa to abolish its policy of apartheid and engage in the process of negotiations leading to the establishment of a democratic society in South Africa.A just and lasting peace in South Africa demands that an end be put to the state of emergency  repression and violence  as well as to other measures adopted by the South African regime with a view to silencing the voice of justice and reason. It also demands the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners  with whom the regime must entertain a dialogue in order to find a just and equitable solution to South Africa's problems. Refusal to have dialogue with the legitimate and genuine representatives of South Africa's majority people can only delay further the solution of the problem and will certainly result in a greater heightening of tension in South Africa and in the region as a whole.The People's Republic of Mozambique reiterates its support for the African National Congress (ANC) and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) - the authentic representatives of the peoples of South Africa and of Namibia respectively.The People's Republic of Mozambique further reiterates its readiness to contribute to the process of negotiations currently under way in southern Africa.As we review the international situation we cannot help but express our satisfaction at the positive trend we have witnessed in the last few years. The climate of dialogue between the two major nuclear Powers undoubtedly brings renewed hope for the future of international relations. We are increasingly witnessing recourse to the provisions envisaged in our Charter in the search for solutions to conflicts. They are peaceful alternatives based on the most elementary norms governing relations between nations.In this context  we can cite such delicate conflicts as the Iran-Iraq war and those in Western Sahara and in south-west Asia as examples of the important role that the United Nations  given the opportunity  can play in the maintenance and the preservation of peace. We hope that the commitment undertaken by the parties concerned will be honoured and that peace  stability and security will prevail in those regions.In South-East Asia  there is a willingness to embark on dialogue. We hope that such willingness will materialize so that  sooner rather than later  it can bear fruits that will contribute to the reduction of tensions in the region. Chad and Libya have given an example of political maturity as they choose to try peaceful means to solve the conflict between them.Central America also aspires to peace and stability - objectives that can be realized only when there is respect for the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of the countries in the region. The dialogue now taking place must be encouraged. We would like to reiterate our appreciation of the efforts being undertaken by the Nicaraguan Government in order to find a peaceful solution to the problems of the region.As I salute this positive trend in international relations  I cannot help but point out that other challenges still await us.The Palestinian question  which is the core of the Middle East problem  must find a rapid and immediate solution so that the Palestinian nation can be established in peace  freedom and independence in its own territory. We consider that an international conference on peace in the Middle East would contribute to the solution of those problems. Therefore  we want to stress that such a conference should be convened with urgency. Similarly  an urgent solution must be found to the conflict in East Timor  where foreign forces have invaded and occupied that territory. We sincerely hope that the Secretary-General will be able to reactivate the process leading to self-determination and independence for the people of East Timor in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly.The reunification of the Korean nation has not yet taken place despite various initiatives and repeated efforts in that direction  which we support. We hope that the day will come when a unified Korea will be admitted to our family of nations.We expect that the consensus reached at the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean establishing 1990 as the date for the convening of the Colombo Conference will be respected. We must therefore start acting now with vigour so as to ensure its success.The sacrifices our people have made in order to defend our freedom and independence are truly enormous. Despite the generalized campaigns of terror and the crimes committed against our people  despite the destruction of social and economic infrastructures  the Mozambican people remain undeterred in the defence of their motherland and in the building of a future of peace  progress and happiness. It is in the search for attaining such goals  which ate much cherished not only by our people but also by the whole world  that we have been treading on such a hard and difficult path for about a quarter of a century.We want peace. It is only with peace that we can rebuild out fatherland  use all available resources in our country  extend education and health care to everyone  eradicate famine  remedy the lack of clothing and overcome misery and underdevelopment.We should like to reiterate our appeal to the international community to continue providing its multifarious assistance and support to our people so that they can as soon as possible ease their suffering and attain a lasting peace.The struggle continues."
"97",4850,"MRT",43,1988,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to associate myself with previous speakers in offering to Ambassador Caputo my warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am confident that  under his guidance the work of the Assembly will be carried out efficiently and with authority.I should also like to extend to his predecessor  the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic  Mr. Peter Florin  our gratitude for the exemplary way in which he conducted the work of the forty-second session Let me also pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr  Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the outstanding way in which he has directed the work of the United Nations and for his tireless efforts to achieve international peace and security. Those tireless efforts have resulted in the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the peace-keeping forces and have greatly contributed to the resolution of certain regional conflicts in the period since the last session of the General Assembly. I refer  in particular  to the Gulf  where the event that has been awaited for so long has come about - the cessation of the hostilities between Iraq and Iran. The acceptance by Iran of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and the opening of negotiations between the two countries augurs well for peace between them.Mauritania has always worked to put an end to this deadly  destructive war between two fraternal Muslim peoples. We sincerely hope that comprehensive  just and lasting peace will be established between them so that they may at last be able to live in harmony and devote their efforts to progress and well-being. This perseverance has also produced results in Afghanistan  with the signing of the Geneva agreements last April. Mauritania welcomes the signing of those agreements and the withdrawal of foreign troops and hopes that the process that has been started under United Nations auspices can speedily restore peace and concord to the people of Afghanistan and an independent and non-aligned State.In Western Sahara  the process of joint good offices started by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity has made an important step forward with the submission by the Secretary-General of a peace plan to the two parties to the conflict. Mauritania supports these efforts and particularly welcomes the agreement in principle brought about in this area as well as the progress made thus far towards a just and lasting political settlement of that fratricidal conflict. The final solution of this problem will contribute greatly towards building the Greater Arab Maghreb  to which all the peoples of the region profoundly aspire. It was to that end that the Heads of State of the region met  for the first time since their independence  in Algiers last June to prepare favourable conditions leading to the Greater Arab Maghreb. This was a historic event which established the main guidelines for the integration and construction of a united Greater Maghreb. At the present time  various meetings are taking place to implement this political will which was clearly expressed by the Heads of State.My country welcomes the relations between Libya and Chad and the good will both countries are showing with a view to normalizing (their relations.In southern Africa the series of negotiations that have been taking place over the last few months opens new prospects for peace and in particular for the end of the illegal occupation of Namibia  Security Council resolution 433 (1978) remains the only acceptable basis for a just and lasting settlement of the Namibian question  for it embodies international legality and enjoys the support of the Namibian people and their legitimate representative  the South West Africa People's Organization.In South Africa itself  the apartheid regime insists in its heinous policy and continues to inflict untold suffering on the black majority. It also continues to carry out acts of aggression against the front-line States.Apartheid  that institutionalized system of racism and racial discrimination  is an affront to human dignity and a threat to international peace and security. It is the duty of all civilized nations to implement the strategy to oppose that system adopted by the United Nations  in particular the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions.Mauritania fully supports that strategy and naturally supports the struggle of the people of South Africa  under the leadership of the African National Congress  to establish an egalitarian  democratic and non-racial society  just as it fully supports the heroic resistance of the front-line countries.It was in that context that my Government was honoured to host  from 16 to 18 June last  the second preparatory meeting for an inquiry into apartheid. That important meeting  which was sponsored by the Heads of State  was attended by eminent personalities of world-wide repute for their devotion to the cause of human rights and democratic principles  and largely contributed to mobilizing international public opinion with respect to the odious system of apartheid and set the stage for entering an active phase to prepare for an international tribunal to be held next year.In the Middle East  the Palestinian people chose the double anniversary of 40 years of partition and 20 years of occupation to remind the world that it cannot disregard the national rights of a people. Because of its scope and duration  the popular uprising in the occupied territories has shown the world the magnitude of the tragedy of the Palestinian people as well as its fierce determination to recover its land  its dignity and its inalienable rights  no matter what means are used by the Israeli war machine and the acts of inhuman repression carried out by the occupying forces.The popular uprising has also shown the world that the Palestinian question is the cote of the Middle East conflict and that as long as the Palestinian people is deprived of its national rights  in particular its right to self-determination and the establishment of its own independent State  peace can never be established in that region. Any just and lasting solution requires the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied Arab territories  including the holy city of Al-Quds. But the regime of Tel Aviv disregards all these facts and obstinately follows its policy of aggression and expansion  in contempt for international law. The convening of an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation on an equal footing of all concerned parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  which is the sole  authentic representative of the Palestinian people  is the proper framework for finding a just and lasting solution to the conflict. The violence and repression that we witness in the occupied territories make the convening of such a conference increasingly urgent and constitute a new challenge for the United Nations  which must assume its full responsibility with respect to the Palestinian tragedy.In Kampuchea  the search for a political settlement continues and the ongoing national dialogue holds much promise. The solution to that problem must be in keeping with the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly  which reaffirm the need for the withdrawal of foreign troops from that territory and the right to self-determination of the Khmer people. In Central America  Mauritania sincerely hopes for the final restoration of peace on the basis of the recommendations of the Contadera Group and the Contact Group  as well as the Guatemala agreements signed last year by the five Heads of State of the region.Turning to the question of Korea  my country has always advocated the peaceful reunification of that peninsula in the interests of the Korean people as a whole. We support all efforts undertaken to that end.The world economic situation is also a major item of profound concern to the international community. The gap between the developing and the developed countries continues to widen. The drop in commodity prices  the increasing debt-servicing burden and the re-emergence of protectionism and restrictions placed on the transfer of technology have had an especially severe impact on the developing countries. The stalemate in the North-South dialogue has prevented us from achieving agreed innovative solutions to ensure the recovery of the world economy and the development of the third-world countries.Aware that they have the primary responsibility for the economic and social development of their peoples  the Governments of the developing countries have adopted important reforms and made large-scale adjustments but  because of the international economic climate  those actions have not led to the achievement of the goals that were set. Action must be co-ordinated at the international level  Africa  the least developed continent of the world  is particularly affected by the economic crisis. In an effort to confront this situation  the Organization of African Unity held an extraordinary summit conference in Addis Ababa  which undertook a clear analysis of the foreign-debt crisis in Africa  Mauritania is in full agreement with the joint African position on the convening of an international conference on the African external debt.Only an overall  integrated strategy will enable us to resolve the African debt crisis and to give concrete form  at the same time  to the commitments undertaken by the international community in the context of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  In that regard  we appreciate the positive decisions taken at the last summit conference of the industrialized countries  particularly in regard to relieving the burden of debt of the developing countries  and we hope that these decisions will be extended and strengthened. In particular  we are deeply grateful to the Federal Republic of Germany  which has agreed to defer repayment of the whole of our large debt. We thank also those countries that are prepared to take similar measures to help our country.The scourges of drought and desertification are still a serious threat to the Sahelian region  of which Mauritania is a part. In October 1978 another disaster occurred. I am speaking of the pilgrim locust  which has great mobility and destroys everything in its paths crops  pastureland  date palms  and so forth. In order to deal with this scourge  which specialists agree will continue to afflict us for several years  various meetings of west African and Maghreb countries have been convened to co-ordinate the policies of the various States and to advocate common action. My country  which is particularly affected by this infestation  has combined its national efforts with the international efforts.	I also thank here the friendly countries and the international organizations for the aid they have already supplied as well as for their sensibility to Mauritania's concerns.These natural disasters and the international economic crisis require exceptional financial efforts by my country  in a particularly difficult economic situation. Since 1985  despite these conditions  my Government has been engaged in a broad programme of economic reforms and structural adjustments. Significant progress has already been made in economic and financial recovery  but these results cannot minimize the scope of the efforts that must still be made to satisfy our countries. That is why the consolidation of the development strategies and programmes implemented in recent years in conformity with the Lagos Plan of Action and priority programme for African recovery is a major concern. Accordingly  my Government has just adopted a three-year programme of consolidation and recovery  which will be submitted soon to our economic partners. But  basically  we ate relying on ourselves.Our development policy is based primarily on mobilizing all our energies. In that context  our national leadership  our national leadership  headed by Colonel Maaouya Quid Sid'Ahmed Taya  President of the Military Committee of National Salvation and Head of State  on 12 December 1984 chose to establish a State of law  in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed to all the citizens. Thus  a process of teal democratization has been undertaken. The communal experience having been extended to all areas of the country  this year municipal councils will be set up at the local and city levels. The purpose of these elections is democratic participation  which will enable the people to take part directly in development activities. In that connection  the rural sector occupies a major place. That is why the Government has given it priority by allocating 36.5 per cent of public investments to it and encouraging the private sector to carry- out hydro-agricultural projects involving the free distribution of land and a guaranteed return from production.The major economic and financial problems facing the international community show the great urgency of releasing additional resources for development. It is only common sense that this should be done at the expense of the arms race  given the flagrant disproportion that now exists between resources allocated for military expenditures and those devoted to development assistance. Indeed  it is intolerable that enormous human  financial  natural and technological resources should continue to be consumed by the arms race at a time when poverty is the daily lot of more than two thirds of mankind. That is why we emphasize the need to link disarmament and development - a link that was established by the international conference on this subject held last year.In that regard  we welcome the conclusion by the United States and the Soviet Union of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  as well as its verification clauses. But it is only a beginning  and international peace and security - that is  the survival of the human race - can be brought about only through general and complete disarmament. Without that  we cannot imagine that mankind can survive on the earth.Today's world is at a crossroads. It has to meet many challenges  in particular the persistence of armed conflicts and hotbeds of tension everywhere  as well as the arms race and the unfair distribution of wealth. Unfortunately  despite great progress in science and technology  the world is still unable to ensure well being and prosperity for all. That is an intolerable situation.We must all understand that nations are interdependent. We must understand the magnitude of the problems facing mankind. The United Nations offers us the only multilateral framework in which to channel all our efforts. It is an instrument that is indispensable to peace and international co-operation. The United Nations has an enormous potential that can be mobilized and used to achieve the noble ideals laid down in the Chatter. This is demonstrated by the progress being made in the political solution of major regional conflicts on which until recently no progress had been made. The Member States  particularly the great Powers  have historical responsibilities in that connection.Mauritania expresses again its faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter and will continue to work to improve and strengthen our Organization's role.

"98",4896,"MUS",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of the people and the Government of Mauritius I am pleased to convey to you  Sir  my sincere congratulations on your election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. Your outstanding personal qualities and your vast experience in the field of diplomacy will be a guarantee of success in the deliberations of the Assembly's session.I also wish to express the appreciation of the Government of Mauritius for the outstanding work performed by Mr. Peter Florin  Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic  the outgoing President of the Assembly.His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar deserves special mention for his devotion in pursuit of the goals and objectives of the United Nations. Despite the many hurdles in his path  he has succeeded in bringing to the negotiating table yesterday's antagonists and adversaries  and they are now talking about finding solutions to intractable problems. May we assure him of our unstinting support in the exacting tasks that confront him.Mr. President  it is with great pleasure that  on behalf of the people and the Government of Mauritius  I congratulate  through you  the United Nations peace-keeping force on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. For decades  the blue helmets of the peace-keeping forces have been seen throughout the world  patrolling the most varied of conflicts. As the Nobel Prize citation states;""The peace-keeping forces of the United Nations have  under extremely difficult conditions  contributed to reducing tension where an armistice has been negotiated but a peace treaty has yet to be established.""The Peace Prise is also a tribute to you  Mr. President  to the Secretary-General  Mr. Peres de Cuellar  and to the United Nations family as a whole.Earlier this year  the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament tackled the problem facing mankind. Although it was not possible to adapt a document in its final form  yet we were unanimous in grasping the major implications of the problem. Everyone agreed that differences in political  military  social  economic and other fields should not stand in the way of closer international co-operation for peace and security. The entire disarmament process would be facilitated through a positive approach and greater openness and transparency in military matters.Nuclear weapons today constitute the greatest menace to the existence of man. Therefore  our main concern is the avoidance of nuclear holocaust. At the special session there was a beginning of consensus on priority issues relating to chemical weapons  to verification and to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We hope that further progress will be made in future discussions of those vital issues.The special session welcomed the existing nuclear-weapon-free zones and debated the creation of new zones. The M Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean concluded its second and last session of 1988 on 22 July. At the conclusion of the ad Hoc Committee's work on the Indian Ocean the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee  Ambassador Daya Perera of Sri Lanka  expressed the view that the members would have the political will to convene the conference at Colombo in 1990  at the latest. We wholeheartedly share that view. I am confident that the members of the Ad Hoc Committee will have meaningful discussions during the two preparatory meetings scheduled in 1989 so that the long-overdue conference is finally convened. My delegation will give its full support to the Ad Hoc Committee in its work  as we in Mauritius are deeply concerned with the demilitarization of the Indian Ocean.We have on previous occasions spoken on the vast amount of resources being spent on armaments  especially on conventional arms and forces. We are strongly in favour of the action programme charted by the international Conference on the Relationship Between Disarmament and Development. A global process of disarmament leading to a substantial reduction in military expenditure is bound to release much-needed resources to promote the prosperity of all nations. Lasting peace is more likely to be established through economic development than through lavish expenditure on armaments.	-I should also like to say that Mauritius supports the stand of His Excellency Shri Rajiv Gandhi  Prime Minister of the Republic of India  enunciated in his address on 9 June 1988 to the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.In clear violation of the principles of the United Nations the island of Diego Garcia  along with the Chagos Archipelago  was detached from Mauritius by Britain prior to our independence in 1968. The island of Diego Garcia was ceded by Britain to the United States of America  which transformed it into a military base. The inhabitants of the island were summarily relocated to Mauritius. The key strategic role now assumed by Diego Garcia has brought the nuclear peril right into the heart of the Indian Ocean. We are determined never to give up our claim over Diego Garcia. With the support of other Indian Ocean States  we shall continue to mobilize international opinion for the restitution of the island to Mauritius. We are thankful to the States members of the Organization of African Unity and the Non-Align movement  as well as other friendly countries  for their continued support of our just claim. It grieves me to refer again to the sad plight of our brothers and sisters in South Africa  who have been denied their fundamental rights and have lived far too long under a regime of murder and terror. Despite the efforts of the United Nations  over four decades  to bring to an end this abominable form of racism  apartheid remains in force. Repeated calls have been made on the South African Government to comply with the resolutions of the United Nations  but to no avail. The resolutions calling for the unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners  the elimination of apartheid  and the establishment of a free  United and democratic society in South Africa based on universal suffrage  continue to be flouted by the racist regime. My Government has systematically condemned the policy of apartheid. We consider that there can be no peace and security in South Africa until apartheid has been dismantled. Let it also be said that the racist regime of South Africa continues  unabated  its policy of external aggression and the destabilization of neighbouring front-line States  in defiance of repeated condemnation and the enforcement of sanctions.The policy of apartheid has affected not only the oppressed people of South Africa but also the Namibian people  who continue to suffer through the illegal occupation of their country. It is now more than 22 years since the General Assembly terminated South Africa's mandate over Namibia and created the United Nations Council for Namibia to administer the Territory and prepare it for independence. The South African Government has used delaying tactics to block the implementation of the United Nations Plan for the Independence of Namibia  contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1973).We have always supported the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in its struggle for the liberation of its homeland. We shall continue to do so until the country is ultimately free. We sincerely hope that the positive talks between South Africa  Angola  Cuba and the United States of America will yield the desired results  so that the United Nations will be able  in the very near future  to welcome to its midst the independent and sovereign State of Namibia.The lessening of tension in southern Africa will enable the international community to tackle another crucial problem of the region  which concerns some six million refugees. In this context we commend the initiative of the recent International Conference on the Plight of Refugees  Returnees and Displaced Persons in South Africa (SARRED) for its plan of action towards reconstruction and rehabilitation measures in a region despoiled by 13 years of war.I wish now to set the record straight regarding the policy of Mauritius towards the racist regime of South Africa. It is indeed with sorrow and much anger that I have to denounce a systematic campaign of disinformation about Mauritius and its links with South Africa. This campaign has been orchestrated by international vested interests  which feel threatened by the economic success of Mauritius  and by jealous rivals unable to emulate the Mauritian miracle. The aim of the campaign has been to equate Mauritius's success to her links with South Africa  and to stick the label ""sanctions buster"" on Mauritius.I would like to take this opportunity to set the picture straight. Under British colonial rule  administrative and economic links tied Mauritius with South  Africa. Geographically  South Africa is the closest mainland to our island. However  since my Government assumed office in 1983  links with South Africa  which in any case were limited  have been diminishing as we have actively been seeking alternative sources and markets.In 1982 Mauritius's domestic exports and re-exports to South Africa amounted to 0.76 per cent of its total world exports  and by 1987 they had dropped to 0.41 per cent. Our imports from South Africa in 1961 represented 9.6 per cent of our total imports world-wide in 1987 they represented only 8.3 per cent. Investment from South Africa in 1987 was 1.27 per cent of total foreign investment. Only 0.7 per cent of total investment in our export processing zone is South African  60 per cent being Mauritian. We have diversified cur sources of tourists so that  from 22.6 per cent in 1984  the South African element fell to 14.7 per cent of total tourist arrivals.Mauritius has a very fragile economy - being a small island State with no mineral resources  and being distant from markets and min sea routes. Despite these constraints  my Government  supported by the people of Mauritius  is  I repeat  actively diversifying away from South Africa  in accordance with our commitment to the United Nations  the Commonwealth and the Organization of African Unity.The question of Palestine has remained on the agenda of the General Assembly since the founding of the United Nations  and still defies a just and equitable solution. Such a solution can only be found within the framework of a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East situation  based on Israel's total withdrawal from all the territories occupied since 1967 and the restoration of all the rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to return to their homeland  the right to self-determination and the right to establish their own independent and sovereign State on their national territory. We therefore support the speedy convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East  with the participation of all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.My Government rejoices that both Iraq and Iran have agreed to go to the negotiating table  thanks to the persevering efforts and diplomatic finesse displayed by the United Nations Secretary-General and his tireless staff. We pray that the efforts of the Secretary-General will pave the way for a peaceful settlement in that war-torn and ravaged area.We also welcome the efforts of the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in their quest for a comprehensive political settlement to the problem of Kampuchea. All foreign intervention and military occupation should be brought to an end without further delay. The incessant flow of refugees from that country has created tensions and security problems in neighbouring states. The recent Jakarta informal meeting  held in the city of Bogor from 25 to 28 July 1988  is no doubt a starting-point for a peace process that can lead to the restoration of the sovereign  independent  and neutral and non-aligned status of Kampuchea. We welcome the recent Geneva Agreements as a major step towards the restoration of peace in Afghanistan  This is an achievement that must be credited to the United Nations and especially to its Secretary-General. I pay a tribute also to the understanding shown by the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.The Korean people are also eagerly awaiting the peaceful reunification of their country. We hope that through dialogue the people of Korea  both North and South  will soon join the rest of the international community in the United Nations On the subject of human rights  my Government views with great concern the instances of violation of human and democratic rights  the enactment of the coercive internal security decree  and above all the systemic harassment of an ethnic group in Fiji. We appeal for the immediate restoration of the process of national reconciliation. Let the Government of Fiji show that it is motivated by a sense of fair play and universal justice and by tolerance and harmony.Similarly  we hope that reason will prevail and that tensions in such troubled areas as Cyprus  Lebanon and Central America will give way to peace and stability. For nearly ten years now the world economy has stagnated  causing the slowing down and reversal of development  high unemployment and gruesome poverty. World trade is dominated by sharp currency fluctuations  trade imbalances between the major market economies and the debt-burdened developing countries. The 1988 World Economic Survey prepared by the United Nations has forecast that growth is expected to fall in 1989  The Survey goes on to say that  while economic growth among developing countries varied greatly last year  affected by foreign debt  decreasing overseas earnings and difficulties in orienting policies towards economic stability  growth slowed down for the developing countries  mostly in Africa and Latin America  where per capita output is continuing to fall. My Government supports the call by the Heads of State or Government of the seven major industrial nations and the President of the Commission  of the European Communities at the recent Toronto economic summit  for relief for developing countries whose economic growth is paralysed by external debt. In 1987  the amount transferred to foreign creditors abroad in interest and repayments outpaced new lending and absorbed resources needed for domestic investments. Several countries have accumulated significant arrears to official creditors. The International Monetary Fund (IMP) alone was owed 32 billion in 1987.The performance of developing countries is important to the world economy. Central to the prospects of the developing countries are a healthy global environment and an open trading system  adequate financial flows and also their commitment to appropriate economic reforms. The problems of many heavily indebted developing countries are a cause of economic and political concern and can be a threat to political stability in the developing countries themselves. Many indebted countries have begun the difficult process of macro-economic adjustment and structural reform necessary for sustained progress. My Government urges an increase in concessional resource flows to help the poorest developing countries resume sustained growth  especially in cases where it is extremely difficult for them to service their debts. Protectionist measures  particularly in large developed countries  should be removed without delay so that a more favourable environment can be built for accelerated growth in international trade.A large number of States of Africa  Latin America and Asia are still burdened with the problem of debt. The recent disorders in the stock exchange  which have resulted in sudden losses much more substantial that the total debt accumulated over the years by African countries  have revealed the vulnerability of even the most powerful economies. It is indeed paradoxical and anomalous that African States  which are endowed with a wealth of human  natural  spiritual and material resources  should  after two or three decades of independence  have turned into an exporter of capital and human technology  into importers of foreign expertise  of inappropriate technology or food they can produce  of goods that are meant to satisfy artificial needs created from abroad  in a word  that they should have turned into importers of catastrophes and frustration.The international community has a great responsibility in contributing to the solution of our debt crisis. The debt-distressed countries that are most severely handicapped should receive special attention and should be the object of special measures of a concessional nature  of an increased flow of resources  and of reduced interest rates. It is also important that the praiseworthy example of donor countries which have written off public loans or converted them into grants should be more widely followed. At the same time  there is a need to ensure that solutions to the debt crisis do not reinforce the political  economic and technological dependence of the affected countries.We support the recommendations in the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development  which was so ably chaired by Gro Harlem Brundtland  Prime Minister of Norway. Threats to the environment recognize no boundaries. International co-operation among all countries is required if we are to return to a healthy environment. Urgent action is needed to save the world from a global climatic change  from air  sea and fresh-water pollution  from acid rain  hazardous substances  deforestation and toxic waste. Mauritius deplores the actions of several unscrupulous companies which have tried to obtain facilities for dumping toxic industrial wastes in various African States. The States involved are for the most part western African States whose Governments have no separate portfolio for environmental affairs.It is a matter of great concern  and not only on humanitarian grounds  it is not a question of a trade-off between growth and development on the one hand and environmental issues on the other. It has to be seen in its true context  that is to say  as being as urgent as problems of chronic indebtedness and food scarcities  if not more so. The presence of radio-active and other toxic wastes on African soil is definitely detrimental to future development programmes and to the future use of natural resources.We unreservedly support the resolution adopted by the Conference of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) held at Addis Ababa  which condemned the use of African States as dumping grounds by the more industrialized countries  under whatever financial terms proposed. We call upon the international community to take vigorous steps to exercise surveillance in order to prevent the recurrence of such reprehensible and irresponsible acts and to assist the affected States in the rehabilitation of their natural environment.The rich developed countries should show greater concern for vulnerable small island States which are saddled with problems of development. In addition to our limited resources and capacity for autonomous development  we are far from international markets and heavily dependent upon them. There is therefore an urgent need to ensure stability in these markets  especially in respect of our commodities and manufactured goods. We therefore appeal to our trading partners in the North to remove all trade barriers and to do away with all protectionist measures which adversely affect the development of our economy. Mauritius is actively beginning to develop regional co-operation with other countries of the Indian Ocean and member States of the Preferential Trade Area with a view to achieving greater collective self-reliance through the improvement of our trade exchanges and the setting up of intra-regional projects. In that context  we appreciate the generous assistance rapidly made available by friendly countries and international organizations so that regional co-operation nay become viable and meaningful.The illegal use of and illicit trafficking in drugs threaten the well-being of mankind. There is an urgent need for improved international co-operation to counter all facets of the illicit drug problem  in particular production  trafficking and the financing of the drug trade. My Government has adopted tough laws to confiscate the proceeds of drug traffickers and to prevent money laundering.Although the great eighteenth-century English philosopher Hobbes said in his Leviathan that man's life is short  nasty and brutish  we  after going through the catalogue of problems and misfortunes besetting the world  have every reason to see the light at the end of the tunnel. There is cause for satisfaction and contentment in the knowledge that recent events in northern Africa  in Afghanistan  in the Gulf region  in the field of disarmament  at the Berlin conference of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  and elsewhere have taken the upward path of sanity. Above all  there is the sudden consciousness that man's destiny is the survival of the species.Our people are peace-loving and are dedicated to the cause of peace at home and an enduring peace in the world. Our people uphold human rights and dignity. Our people uphold democratic values  principles and practices  and freedom of association  of conscience and of speech. Our people also believe in the sanctity of human life  in unity at home and in the world  and in the splendour and richness of diversity. Our people also believe in one world and in man  and believe that we should constantly search for truth and concentrate on all the common good that binds all of us on our planet Earth and that should bind all in our common endeavour to work for a better  safer and happier world. We also believe that we have come - and that all should come - to the United Nations not to save face but to save lives.Armed with that conviction  let me conclude my address on this note of optimism and good cheer that tomorrow a better world will dawn."
"99",4933,"MWI",43,1988,"ï»¿	'It gives me pleasure to join those who have spoken before me in extending to Mr. Dante Caputo  on behalf of the Malawi delegation  heartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. Preceding speakers have eloquently spoken of his long experience of international affairs  his deep commitment to the promotion of: international peace and co-operation and his great diplomatic skills. On our part  we have already observed the effective manner in which he has been conducting the business of the Assembly. Ws are therefore confident that under his leadership and guidance the Assembly's deliberations will come to a successful conclusion. I therefore wish to assure him of my delegation's full co-operation at all times.The forty-second session was perhaps among the busiest sessions in recent years  as the Assembly had to be called back so many times in resumed session. The Assembly was also called upon to deal with many very complex issues  some necessitating late-night sessions of the plenary in search of solutions.Fortunately for us  we had in Mr. Peter Florin  Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic  a President whose outstanding fortitude  exemplary dedication to duty and inexhaustible patience  confidence and good humour made the work that was before the Assembly easier. My delegation extends its best wishes to Mr. Florin  and congratulates him on his successful accomplishment of his duties and responsibilities.The Malawi delegation has pleasure also in expressing its best wishes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. We have noted with much satisfaction the many achievements scored by the United Nations during the past 12 months. Among the most outstanding are the successful negotiations leading to the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan and to the cease-fire in the eight-year war between Iraq and Iran. Those achievements have clearly vindicated those who  despite the doubts expressed by some in recent years about the Organization's relevance to today's international political environment  continued to believe that the United Nations remained the most appropriate forum for the search for solutions to International disputes  and also that  given the opportunity  it could be a very effective instrument for resolving conflicts between States Mr. de Cuellar has never wavered in his belief in the efficacy of the United Nations  nor has he ever doubted the Organization's potential as an instrument for bringing about peace  we thus consider the award of this year's Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces to be a most fitting recognition of Mr. de Cuellar's personal efforts in keeping the United Nations at the centre of international affairs and a long overdue but welcome tribute to the outstanding contribution of the United Nations towards international peace during the past four decades. My delegation joins others in expressing to Mr. Perez de Cuellar and  through him  to the peace-keeping forces  well-deserved congratulations. A writer in one of the local newspapers observed this past summer that ""peace has broken out"". Although his comment was made rather cynically  in fact it aptly designated the extraordinary phenomenon of the past few months. Indeed  throughout the summer we marvelled as almost everywhere came news of breakthroughs in deadlocks long considered intractable. For once it did seem as though peace had  finally  been declared.We in Malawi welcomed the news of the successful conclusion of the Geneva Agreements  under which it was finally possible for foreign troops that had been in Afghanistan for eight years to withdraw from that country. We hope that the withdrawal of those forces will be completed as agreed in the Agreements so that the people of Afghanistan may move on to the important process of determining their country's political future and embark on the urgent tasks of rehabilitation and reconstruction.In the Persian Gulf we note that  following acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) by both Iran and Iraq earlier this summer  a cease-fire came into force on 20 August. We further note that negotiations towards a permanent peace agreement between the two former belligerents are continuing under the auspices of the United Nations. The road towards that goal will not be an easy one  but we believe that the parties concerned understand the high cost of failure.When the Malawi delegation addressed the Assembly last year  we noted with regret that the flurry of diplomatic activity earlier in 1987 centred on the question of Kampuchea appeared to have led to no change. My Government has therefore been encouraged by recent signs of the apparent beginnings of a genuine dialogue between the various parties concerned. We note  for instance  that following the meeting held in July  under the auspices of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  all the parties have indicated their readiness to continue the search for a mutually acceptable solution. Allow me to express my Government's full support for those efforts and its sincere hope for a positive outcome. In the first direct political contact between the two countries in years  parliamentarians of North and South Korea met in August to discuss relations between the two sides of their divided motherland. My Government was pleased to learn that further talks could take place very soon. Malawi supports the decision by the two sides to keep their lines of communication open so as to facilitate the continuing search for a peaceful solution. We remain firmly convinced that throughhonest dialogue between North and South Korea a viable solution can be achieved. Meanwhile  Malawi welcomes South Korea's call for the cessation of hostilities between North and South Korea. Malawi also welcomes the other proposals by the two sides for easing tension between them.Malawi has followed very closely the quadripartite negotiations involving representatives of the United States  South Africa  Angola and Cuba with the ultimate aim of bringing about the independence of Namibia  within the context of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). In this connection  my Government has been greatly encouraged to learn that  if everything goes well  implementation of the transitional process envisaged in resolution 43 5 (1978) could begin as early as next month  with independence elections coming by 1 June 1989.Whilst its optimism is tempered somewhat by the experience of the international community in having come to the well more than once before and drawing no water  my Government would like to look forward to Namibia's independence and to welcoming Namibia as a fully-fledged member of the international community. My Government therefore hopes to join other members in welcoming the new independent State of Namibia as a participant  in its full sovereign right  at the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly next year. In 1986  for the first time in nearly 40 years  and also last year  the Assembly was seized of the question of the dependent territory of New Caledonia  where the indigenous people and the administering Power were deadlocked over the question of the territoryâs political future. We now understand that the administering Power  having reviewed its policy on the Territory  has recently reached agreement with representatives of the indigenous people on a formula for a solution which envisages the early granting of independence to that Territory. My delegation welcomes these developments. We applaud the Government of France for its courage in not only conceding the right of the New Caledonian people to self-determination but also in acknowledging its obligations towards the realization of that right. Malawi looks forward to seeing Kew Caledonia take its rightful place as an independent and sovereign Member of the community of nations  we hope in the very near future.We have followed closely the Secretary-General's continuing efforts to find viable formulas for solutions to the questions of Cyprus and Western Sahara.With regard to Cyprus we have noted that the apparent emergence of a congenial atmosphere in relations between certain parties whose role would be most vital in assuring any solution has seemingly brought about a positive change in the attitudes of the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. In this connection we note that both parties have declared their readiness to co-operate with the Secretary-General in facilitating the resumption of the inter-communal talks and that formal talks have already been scheduled for early in 1909. My Government welcomes these developments  for Malawi remains convinced that only a formula arrived at by or through the participation of the Cypriot people themselves can produce a meaningful and permanent solution to that countryâs political problems. On the question of Western Sahara  my delegation wishes to reiterate Malawi's support for the right of the people of that territory to self-determination  whether as an independent sovereign State of otherwise. We therefore support the Secretary-General's initiatives on this issue and are pleased to note that the proposals which he recently presented to both the Government of Morocco and the Ð® LIS ARID provide for a referendum to enable the Sahraoui people to indicate their preference as to whether they should be part of Morocco or have their own independent sovereign State.We have noted particularly the similarity between the Secretary-General's proposals and the formula adopted en the same question by the Organization of African Unity (0Ð¨) almost 10 years ago. The OAU formula has as a main principle the holding of a referendum supervised by the United Nations. My Government is therefore happy to learn that both the POLIS AR 20 and Morocco have now accepted the Secretary-General's proposals and we hope that this clears the way for the early holding of a referendum OR Western Sahara.At the forty-second session of the General Assembly  the Malawi delegation joined others in welcoming and expressing support for the peace plan for Central America initiated by the Costa Rican leader  President Oscar Arias  and agreed to by all the leaders in the region. Despite the promise held cut by the plan  it would now appear that some parties would have the plan abandoned  seemingly condemning it to the heap of so many other doomed initiatives. Notwithstanding the set-backs which may have been encountered in its implementation  we believe that the Arias plan still represents the best formula for achieving peace in that region. My delegation wishes therefore to express Malawi's support for those leaders who are continuing to seek ways of facilitating the implementation of the plan. Preceding delegations have already observed that if today we can speak of breakthroughs with regard to the various international problems that once seemed insoluble it is because of the positive interventions  direct and indirect  of the two super-Powers  the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Significantly  it has been noted that these positive developments have occurred following the apparent improvement in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.We have always been of the view that whenever the two super-Powers agree to co-operate they can contribute immensely to the common good of the entire international community. That is why Ñ delegation wishes to take the opportunity to express the hope that the two super-Powers will find it equally possible to work together in the search for solutions to the other regional conflicts and areas of tension which continue to threaten international peace and security. The most urgent of these are the situations in South Africa and the Middle East.While developments on the Namibia question have provided the most positive news to come out of the southern African subregion in almost a decade  the news from South Africa is that of a rapidly deteriorating situation  the root cause of the problems of South Africa is apartheid  but we believe that neither the use of force by the South African authorities to maintain the policy of apartheid nor the resort to violence by the opponents of apartheid will resolve this problem. That is why the Malawi delegation would like to reiterate its call to all the parties to the conflict to enter upon a genuine national dialogue. We are convinced that even at this late hour it would still be possible to achieve a peaceful solution if only all the parties concerned would have the courage to place the wider long-term interests of their country above the short-term interests of their respective constituencies. Contrary to expectations of a possible movement forward - raised by the overwhelming support declared during the past two years by the majority of the members of this Assembly - towards the holding of an international conference on the Middle East  the past 12 months have seen the situation in the area deteriorate to perhaps its most precarious level in many years.A sharp escalation of violence in the occupied territories  resulting from a campaign of resistance to Israeli authority  and the Increased use of force in order to reaffirm that authority on the part of the Israeli Government have led to great loss of life as well as a deepening of animosity and suspicion. Meanwhile the decision by the Government of Jordan to withdraw its authority over parts of the occupied territories which It had previously administered has increased the uncertainty and anxiety about future developments.In our view  any solution to the Middle East conflict must necessarily focus on two central issues if it is to be viable  fulfilment of the right of the Palestinian people to an independent homeland on the one hand and a guarantee of the right of the Israelis to live within recognized and secure boundaries on the other. Those elements have been of primary importance in all the main resolutions on the Middle East question since the General Assembly adopted resolution 181 (II) in 1947.Viable solutions to the questions of the Middle East and of South Africa must ultimately come from  or be found with the direct participation of  the respective peoples concerned. However  my delegation is also of the view that there are certain other countries which  through their special relations and influence  could facilitate the early achievement of such solutions. That is why my delegation wants to appeal to these countries  which include the two super-Powers  to use their influence positively with those parties which  because of mistrust or insecurity  have been reluctant to take measures that are necessary in order to move forward. The intervention of these countries on other questions has led to positive results. We are convinced that they could contribute to similar results with regard to the issues of the Middle East and South Africa.last October the Malawi delegation joined others in welcoming the conclusion between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of the Treaty on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Nuclear Missiles - the INF Treaty. The Malawi delegation observed that that Agreement constituted the first major step towards the elimination of all nuclear arms. At the same time we expressed the hope that the Treaty would give an impetus to ongoing negotiations on other classes and types of arms  especially chemical weapons  so as to hasten the achievement of the ultimate goal - complete and comprehensive disarmament. The Malawi delegation  further  drew attention to the fact that international security is of concern to all States  big and small alike. In this connection  the delegation reaffirmed Malawi's belief in the need for a multilateral approach to disarmament and for the United Nations to be associated with all initiatives on disarmament.We thus considered it a happy coincidence that the proposed date for the formal signature of the United States/Soviet Union agreement should have fallen just a month before the start of the General Assembly's third special session on disarmament  which was held here in New York in June this year.However  my delegation regards it as a matter of deep regret that the third special session could not agree on the final document and thus adjourned without a formal conclusion. Nevertheless  we believe that the session was still useful in providing an opportunity to assess progress achieved since the two previous sessions. We are certain that the conclusions that were drawn from the session will prove invaluable as we plot the way forward.My delegation has on several occasions declared the Malawi Government's conviction that international security cannot best be assured by the size or quality of the arsenals that countries may possess. Rather  we believe that genuine international security lies in all States respecting each other's independence and sovereignty  regardless of size or economic and political strength.we have therefore been alarmed by certain developments during the last 12 months which seemed to suggest that some States might want to return the world to that era  long thought to have disappeared for ever  when might was right  and bigger States assumed for the themselves the right callously to intervene in the internal affairs of the small and weaker ones. My delegation wishes to reiterate its appeal for respect among States for each other's sovereignty  strict adherence to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of others  and respect for the principle of the non-use of force. Only in that way can we assure international peace and security.Among the subjects which the General Assembly will consider during the current session is the critical economic situation in Africa. Before it will be the report on the mid-term review on the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. My delegation looks forward to the discussions on this report.I should like  however  to express our disappointment at the fact that despite the solemn undertaking by the international donor community to enhance its assistance to Africa with specific regard to the implementation of the Programme of Action  and in spite of the efforts that African States have exerted in fulfilment of their own obligations  at times with great risk to national political stability  very little international assistance has been forthcoming. In the meantime  unfortunately  the economic crisis in Africa has worsened further  and more aid than was projected in 1986 will now be required to meet the Programme's original goals. It is our sincere hope that the results of the mid-term review will be taken seriously by Africa's partners and that concerted efforts will be made by them to fulfil their obligations during the second half of the Programme's projected five-year span.Meanwhile  we have noted with interest the measures adopted recently by some of the developed countries with a view to helping ease the financial burden facing developing countries  especially the least developed countries. We welcome these moves. However  we would like to join others in reiterating that the economic problems of developing countries need to be addressed in a global manner if lasting solutions ace to be found.Before concluding ray statement  I should like to take this opportunity to express my Government's gratitude to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other agencies of the United Nations foe the invaluable assistance they have provided to enable the Government of Malawi to cater foe our brothers and sisters from Mozambique who have come into Malawi during the past two years. These refugees now number over 600 000  which is equivalent to about 8 per cent of our national population. We are particularly grateful for the Secretary-General's timely initiative in sending last year a multi-agency team to study this problem with a view to determining how best to assist Malawi to deal with both the short-term and the long-term needs arising from this situation. Malawi's economic capacity is very limited and the sudden surge in population has seriously strained the country's socio-economic infrastructure.Malawi is also grateful to the many countries and the other international organizations that have contributed so generously in various ways towards enabling us to provide for our brethren. In this context  I should like to express Malawi's satisfaction at the outcome of the International Conference on the Plight of Refugees  Returnees and Displaced Persons in Southern Africa  held in Oslo  Norway  last August  with the full support of the United Nations. It is our hope that the principles enshrined in the Oslo declaration and plan of action will receive full international support. It is therefore my delegation's hope that the General Assembly will endorse the Oslo declaration and plan of action. "
"100",4979,"MYS",43,1988,"ï»¿It is with much pleasure  Mr. President  that I extend to you my heartiest congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. Your well-known diplomatic skills and outstanding abilities will ensure that the deliberations of this session will be constructive and rewarding.To your predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  we owe a great debt of gratitude for his tireless devotion in presiding with consummate skill and infinite wisdom over the deliberations of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. To the Secretary-General  we offer our sincere felicitations on his outstanding contribution to the cause of world peace and security. My delegation also extends its congratulations  through the Secretary-General  to the United Nations peace-keeping forces on the award of the Nobel Peace Prize so fittingly bestowed upon them. The Nobel Peace Prize speaks eloquently as a tribute to the individuals from various States Members of the United Nations and those within the Organization who have so honourably discharged their duties in upholding the Principles embodied in the United Nations Charter.The General Assembly meets this year at a propitious time indeed  world regard for the United Nations has taken a turn for the better  influenced as everyone is by the return of peace or the promise of peace to many flash-pointsÂ·. Afghanistan  Iran and Iraq  Namibia  Western Sahara  Kampuchea  and perhaps also to the Korean peninsula. In contrast to the cynicism and disillusionment that many had felt in the past about the United Nations  we are now witnessing a clear shift towards a better appreciation of the role of the United Nations and of its relevance to the aspirations of the community of nations. We would like to believe that at long last the United Nations is coming into its own and fulfilling its task of moving conflicts from the battlefield to the conference table.Malaysia's faith and confidence in the United Nations have never wavered  but we were saddened in the past to see the United Nations struggling to retain its relevance and credibility. Multilateralism had become a bad word as the powerful nations resorted to solving problems on their own. We are therefore pleased to welcome this change  this renewal of faith in the United Nations which we hope will mean the birth of a new era in multilateralism.As an international organization  the United Nations must be perceived to be relevant in meeting the needs of its Members as a forum for multilateral diplomacy  an instrument for maintaining international peace and security and a catalyst for promoting international economic growth and development. The United Nations is at its most effective in the discharge of its functions when Member States fully support the course of action that it takes. The most telling example is the unanimous support given by the members of the Security Council to the Secretary-General to bring about an end to the Iran-Iraq war. The collective efforts of the Security Council  permanent and non-permanent members together  have raised clear hopes for the resolution of conflicts. For the first time in decades  we are witnessing a convergence of the interests and wills of Member States to effect solutions on major issues. This development  it is hoped  will fulfil the vision of the pioneers of the United Nations when they conferred upon the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.Malaysia stands for the full and effective discharge of the Council's conciliatory and mandatory powers and for universal compliance with and implementation of the Council's decisions. It is a matter of great reassurance to us all that the Security Council's increased effectiveness has been made possible by the convergences of interest and action of the United States and the Soviet Union. Conversely  it should be instructive to those two countries that they are drawing from the best of themselves when they counsel and collaborate together with the rest of the world on common objectives.When one extols the achievements of the United Nations  one is not refusing to recognize that the steady improvement of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union have helped significantly in bringing about progress on conflict resolutions. Those of us who have lived during periods of unease and uncertainty  when the two Powers stared at each other eyeball to eyeball  are greatly relieved that these two super-Powers are realistically discussing peace and construction between them.. They can make an enormous contribution to the realization of the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. It is our common appeal to both these countries that they seek recourse through all the institutions of the United Nations when attempting to defuse conflicts and in realizing a more equitable world order.	 A United Nations functioning at its best will be in the interest Of all its members and will not simply serve the interests of certain Powers or groups of States. The time for United Nations bashing and the assault on multilateralism is over. If universal responsibility is a creed that this and future generations can believe in  then every country must provide full commitment to the United Nations. A revitalized United Nations  poised to assume even greater responsibility  must not be hampered by a lack financial resources. A sine qua non of its very survival is the timely payment by member countries of their assessed contributions. Malaysia welcomes the signing of the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan. There must be complete and faithful implementation of these Accords by all concerned parties if the sufferings of the people of Afghanistan  after eight years of bloody and brutal war  is to come to a definite conclusion and if Afghanistan is to regain its independence. At this juncture  may I pay tribute to the late President Zia Lil-Haq of Pakistan for his immense contribution towards the successful signing of the Geneva Accords. My country and many others will sadly miss the friendship"" and wise counsel of the last President.The withdrawal of Soviet forces must continue and be completed within the agreed time-frame. It is our hope that the Accords will be fully implemented to enable the Afghan people to freely exercise their right to self-determination through the process of genuine reconciliation.Malaysia hopes that the United Nations humanitarian and economic assistance programmes relating to Afghanistan will be able to meet the immediate needs for relief and rehabilitation as well as the long-term requirements for reconstruction of the country. For full implementation of such assistance can be realized only under conditions of peace and stability in Afghanistan.The acceptance by Iran and Iraq of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) as the framework for the termination of the Iran-Iraq war is a source of satisfaction to us all. The world witnessed in horror and helplessness the terrible toll exacted by the conflict for eight long years. We are therefore thankful that the first crucial steps for a durable solution hove been taken. It is our hope and belief that the resolve of Iran and Iraq to embark on the path of peace is irrevocable and that they will now turn their full attention to making the creative energies and talents of their peoples to the urgent tasks of national reconstruction and development. Despite all efforts  the Middle East is still embroiled in an endless cycle of violence. Israel must beat responsibility for this tragic state of affairs as it remains the main stumbling-block to any peace attempts in the region. The United Nations has not been allowed to play its proper role in the search for a settlement primarily on account of Israel's intransigence. Israel is single-minded in the execution of its policies of aggression and expansion and brutal subjugation of the Palestinian people. It has defied the international community's call for a total withdrawal from all occupied territories. The Palestinian problem  the core of the Middle East conflict  remains unresolved due to the arrogant Israeli hubris and its continued refusal to recognize the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to an independent State.Israel cannot continue to believe that it can ensure its security and survival by adherence to policies which seek to consign the Palestinian people to either permanent diaspora or permanent oppressive Israeli rule. The Holocaust cannot be flaunted by Israel as an excuse for treating Arabs under their rule in like manner.Israel's policy of dictating to the Palestinians as to whom they should choose to speak for them has been an unmitigated failure. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) remains the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The best hope for a durable and comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian problem lies in the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East  with the participation of all parties  including the PLO. Malaysia fully supports the convening of such a conference and calls upon those Powers that have been the strongest supporters of Israel to lend their influence to convince Israel that its vital interests are best served by dialogue and negotiations at a peace conference rather than by the mailed fiat. Indeed these supporters of Israel must share the moral responsibility for the injustice and inhumanity committed by Israel against the Palestinians. In South Africa we are confronted with the challenge of a regime that seeks to dehumanise human beings on the basis of colour. The only response of good men to this crime against humanity and affront to the universal conscience must be to seek the total destruction of the evil system of apartheid. It is a delusion for anyone to believe that we can effect an evolution of the system into something more human and humane. The hideous manifestations of apartheid are seen daily in the atrocities inflicted on black South Africans.Malaysia has never been persuaded by the arguments advanced by some that it is in the interest of the blacks of South Africa that comprehensive sanctions should not be imposed against the Pretoria regime. We therefore reiterate our call for decisive action in the form of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.Consistent with our stand  we have undertaken efforts to provide assistance to black South Africans and the front-line States to assist them in coping with the destabilisation caused by South Africa and to enable them to cope with the effects comprehensive sanctions could have on them. A total of $US 2 million has been pledged as Malaysia's contribution to the Africa Fund established for this purpose by the Non-Aligned Movement  tie wish to appeal for generous support by the international community for the Africa Fund  which must be seen as part of a universal battle to bring about the total elimination of the system of apartheid.The agreement on the comprehensive settlement for South western Africa offers Namibia the promise of realising its freedom and independence. It is our hope that all parties to the agreement will enter into the spirit of the times and bring peace and freedom to the long-suffering people of Namibia. Familiar with the record of the Pretoria regime in exploiting every opportunity to permeate its iron grip on Namibia  we must continue to apply unrelenting international pressure on the equitable to honour its commitments. In the meantime  our support of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) must continue. We have seen how SWAPO's successes on the battlefields of Namibia have forced the hand of the Pretoria regime to agree reluctantly to a negotiated solution of the problem. Pressure must therefore be sustained on the ground to prevent South Africa from reneging on its promises.The question of Kampuchea has been a subject for debate at every United Nations General Assembly session for the last nine years. With the support of a huge majority of its members  this Assembly has repeatedly called for the total withdrawal of Vietnamese forces  restoration and preservation of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kampuchea  and reaffirmation of the right of its people to self-determination.The fundamental issues of the Kampuchean problem have to be clearly addressed. Vietnam's forces in Kampuchea must withdraw. Vietnam should not be allowed to continue to cloud this issue. There cannot be any conditionality. The concerns of the international community and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to prevent the return of the universally condemned policies and practices of a recent past must be addressed. The Kampuchean people must be assured that they will be free from the horrors of the past. National reconciliation under the effective leadership of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk will not only heal divisions between the various Kampuchean partners  but will also regain for that turbulent country its rightful sovereignty and independence. The constant search by the ASEAN countries for a solution yielded a significant measure of success with the convening of the Jakarta Informal Meeting in July. This meeting was a regional initiative constituting an important milestone in the process of finding a comprehensive political solution to the Kampuchean problem. This initiative should be allowed to continue. The present international climate augurs well for allowing the parties concerned to come together in the near future to achieve agreement on the issues. Malaysia welcomes the efforts of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to complement the regional efforts on Kampuchea.Peace in Kampuchea will contribute tremendously to regional peace and security. It will facilitate the achievement of more co-operative relations among the States of South-East and particularly between the members of ASEAN and Viet Nam. It is our hope that the peace that we long for will bring about a climate of regional stability and co-operation which can then make possible the early realization of the regional aspiration for a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia-The Vietnamese invasion and occupation of Kampuchea have resulted in the displacement of a large number of  people. Furthermore  the influx of boat people from Viet Nam seeking better opportunities elsewhere has for several  years brought further serious problems to countries such as Malaysia and Thailand and .others. Recently Malaysia has reached an understanding with the Government of Viet Nam under which the latter will accept the repatriation of those boat people in Malaysia who are not qualified for resettlement in third countries and also prevent fresh bursts. We are happy to note that Viet Nam has agreed to participate in the preparatory meeting which Malaysia hopes to host to prepare for the International Conference on Indochina's Refugees  including the boat people. In Central America the high expectations raised by the regionally initiated Esquipalas peace agreement have not yet been fulfilled. The aspirations of the peoples of Central America for peace  freedom and justice remain in hostage to the dictates of international and external divisions in the region. Coercive measures from outside the area only compound the problems of the region and should not be allowed to continue. It is our hope that the peace process will be given renewed impetus by the very leaders whose vision and statesmanship led to the signing of the Esquipalas agreements.In raising the issue of Antarctica at the United Nations  it was the intention of Malaysia and the other like-minded countries to draw attention to the considerable environmental  climatic and scientific significance of the continent to the world. We also earnestly seek an international instrument having universal validity and serving the interests of and for the benefit of mankind.It is most regrettable that a Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources Activities has been concluded recently in total disregard for United Nations resolutions calling for a moratorium on all negotiations on a minerals regime until such time as all members of the international community can fully participate in such negotiations. We cannot understand the haste  because all the minerals that can possibly be found in Antarctica can be found in plentiful supply elsewhere.We also regret that the General Assembly's appeals for urgent measures to exclude the racist regime of South Africa at the earliest possible date from participating in the meetings of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties have not been acted upon.Antarctica represents to us a touchstone of the constancy of the adherence of the Consultative Parties to fundamental principles and norms which have evolved through common endeavours and have gained universal currency in the course of the democratizing process of international relations and institutions. We remain steadfast in our conviction that a regime for Antarctica built on such foundations will better reflect and respond to the needs of our age than one founded upon circumstances and considerations which are tainted with colonialist adventurism.The issue of disarmament must remain high on the agenda of this Organization and must continue to receive the urgent attention of the international community. Threats to mankind derive not only from the stockpiling and continuous development of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction but also from the growing arsenals of sophisticated conventional weapons. We are now beset also with the problem of nuclear and toxic wastes dumped in the developing countries. Our efforts at arms control and disarmament must proceed on all fronts and a prerequisite for any success in this regard must be a general improvement in the climate of relations among States. An important start has been made with the signing of the Treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces between the United States and the Soviet Union in May this year. This Treaty is an important breakthrough and should generate the necessary mutual confidence and trust to allow the concluding of negotiations on the reduction of strategic weapons and on the additional verification procedures required for a complete test-ban treaty.While the two super-Powers with the largest arsenals of nuclear weapons must carry the primary responsibility for bringing about progress in nuclear disarmament  multilateral approaches should make an important contribution to the attainment of mankind's objective of a safer world through arms control and disarmament.We regret that the outcome of the General Assembly's third special session devoted to disarmament did not fulfil our highest expectations but we remain hopeful that the steady improvement in the international climate will generate the necessary political will for the success of such multilateral initiatives; which provide the best opportunity for a genuine harmonization and reconciliation of all interests. The resources released as a result of the successful achievement of the disarmament process would provide a source of much-needed funds for humanitarian work and productive investments in the economic development of the developing worldOuter space  which  we reaffirm  is the common heritage of mankind  should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes  and we urge that negotiations on the prevention of the militarization of outer space should begin in earnest. Malaysia would also like to lend its strong support to the early conclusion of a convention for the complete prohibition of the development  production  stockpiling and use of all chemical weapons.The economic issues before this Assembly may appear to be stale issues  for they have been debated repeatedly over the years but being stale does not make them any less relevant or less urgent. On the contrary  the resolution of these economic problems  such as the establishment of a fairer and more favourable international trading environment  a re-examination of the role and functions of   the multilateral financial institutions  a review and realignment of the international exchange rate regime and a resolution of the international debt problem would constitute positive beginnings in the United Nations work programme in the economic area. As a primary-commodities producer that is also heavily dependent on exports of manufactured goods  Malaysia attaches great importance to the Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiations. While the objective of the Uruguay Round is to retain an open international trading system and to promote increased trade liberalization  we are also concerned about the opposing trend of increasing integration  which brings about greater exclusion. It is our hope  therefore  that the intention of the European Economic Community to achieve an integrated internal market by 1992 does not obstruct efforts under United Nations auspices aimed at greater trade liberalization. To maintain effectively an open and liberal international trading environment the developed countries in particular must curb domestic pressures for protectionist policies that have historically proved to be myopic  leading to distortions in trade and stifling growth and expansion.Aside from restraints on protectionist tendencies  the world's trading nations must also agree on a more realistic and broad-based action on their currency realignment. Agreements confined only to an exclusive group have proved disastrous to the poorer nations  whose currencies and small trade advantages have been seriously affected. The interests of the smaller nations are best served by their representation at such gatherings when issues that affect them are taken up.The debt crisis is debilitating for the countries affected  diverting attention and energies away from domestic political  economic and social needs. While the crisis has deepened in the past year  we see hope in the initiatives of some commercial banks to write off their loans and of Governments which have converted some of their official loans into outright grants. The proposal by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) for a 30 per cent cut in commercial bad debts owed by the 15 most heavily indebted countries merits serious consideration. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) must engage more actively in the design and creation of a debt-reconstruction facility. Proposals abound  but the international community must quickly study various modalities to relieve those countries that are carrying impossible burdens. The United Nations has provided the forum for detailed discussion on the debt crisis and has participated in the search for solutions. Malaysia fully supports the United Nations efforts in this regard and endorses the recent recommendations by the Africa Recovery Review Committee substantially to increase financial flews to Africa to ensure reform and development.Two years ago  at the forty-first session of the Assembly  I spoke about the initiative of the developing countries to set up an independent South Commission. The Commission has since been set up to complement and supplement other efforts in making a fresh and objective analysis of the formidable economic  social and political challenges confronting the developing countries. It attempts to identify areas for practical and mutually beneficial South-South co-operation. It is heartening to note that since its inception in July last year the Commission has vigorously pursued the responsibilities entrusted to it.The International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking (ICDAIT) held at Vienna in June 1987 brought LomÃ© to the 138 participating countries the extent and seriousness of the international drug problem. The seeming impotence of the international community to combat the drug threat brought the realization that without the manifest political will of nations to act  and to act in concert  to counter the drug problem there can be no effective solution. Thus  the adoption by the Conference of its political declaration and the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline of Future Activities represents a collective struggle to eliminate drug abuse and illicit trafficking. Malaysia congratulates the United Nations and the Secretary-General for that success and important beginning. The momentum created by ICDAIT last year must be maintained.In this connection Malaysia welcomes the convening of the plenipotentiary conference at Vienna from November to December of this year to adopt the new convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances  which will plug an important loophole and provide for further action against illicit-drug traffickers.We are always concerned when there is extreme disparity between rich and poor within any country  but in some countries there is no disparity - everyone is just poor. If asked to imagine what poverty is like in those poor nations  we should find it extremely difficult to visualize it accurately. But we need not imagine. Today  we see in colourful detail  accompanied by sound and motion  the extent and horror of human poverty. We see living children being literally devoured by flies we see skeletons hobbling around. We see people so ill that we wonder how they survive at all.Even if we have to spend billions on weapons  on preserving the beauty of nature  the trees and the forests  the rare insect species and other things that we claim will enhance the quality of our life  we have no excuse in this day and age to permit such misery to befall millions of fellow humans. .The response of millions of ordinary people to the appeals for aid to the suffering poor is laudable. But the task is too big for ad hoc charitable efforts. The answer would lie in a full-time and fully manned authority to fight against the scourge of poverty. This civilization of ours will be condemned by posterity if we can put men on the Moon but we cannot   at only a fraction of the cost  give enough help to the needy on earth. Inequality is the bane oÂ£ human society. Democracy  purportedly cherished by all  is associated with equality and equitability. While Governments are urged to be democratic  in affairs between nations democracy is noticeably absent. In the community of nations  the strongest and the richest take advantage of the weak and the poor. There is no equality there.This does not harm only in the economic sense but also in the political sense. Ideologies and philosophies  as well as value systems  are forced upon weak nations in the name of democracy. Acting like fanatical religious proselytisers  the so-called champions of democracy are not averse to using undemocratic and coercive means to force their particular brand of democracy on the weak and the poor. Refusal to comply results in all kinds of economic and political arm-twisting.Democracy must confer a freedom of choice. No one has a monopoly on the type of democracy that everyone should have. Certainly no one should force his own choice and interpretation on someone else. While harsh and even violent methods may be used to force a dictatorship to yield to democratic forces  it would be ' tragic if a working  prosperous  democratic nation were destroyed because some self-appointed democrat felt it was not democratic enough. This holier-than-thou attitude is out of tune with modern mores. The democracies of the West were hundreds of years in the making. Do not expect colonial territories ruled autocratically for several centuries by Western democracies to become perfect democracies overnight.I have every confidence that this forty-third session of the General Assembly will prove to be deliberative and fruitful. The time and circumstances have never been more propitious. Our multilateral institution is riding a strong wave of credibility. If we can be weary of war and strife and ready to beat our swords into ploughshares then we can devote our collective energies to our economic and social advancement. The next  more formidable  challenge will be to see whether this institution can grapple with the issue of international economic imbalances in the context of the need for equitable resources management. It should be our concerted purpose to ensure that the last decade before we enter into the next millennium will be one of peace and construction for the benefit of all."
"101",5052,"NER",43,1988,"ï»¿I am pleased to convey to Mr. Dante Caputo the heartfelt congratulation of the delegation of Niger on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. His election is a well-deserved tribute to a seasoned politician and a talented  experienced diplomat. It is also testimony to the Assembly's recognition of the positive role played by his country  Argentina  in international affairs.Naturally  we wish also to congratulate the other members of the Bureau. I am confident that under his guidance our work will be successful  and I wish to assure him of the full co-operation of my delegation.The change in world affairs since the previous session of our Assembly is a source of satisfaction because of prospects for the settlement of conflicts. Nevertheless  there are still grounds for concern.In Africa  the racist Pretoria regime continues to defy the international community and to disregard all decisions taken by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) demanding the abolition of apartheid and independence for Namibia. Niger has been closely following efforts being made in southern Africa to set in motion  as of 1 November 1988  the process of independence for the Territory of Namibia  in keeping with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  and to find a comprehensive solution to the conflict between Angola and South Africa that has been going on for so many years. My country is not only very interested in the ongoing talks between the parties concerned but also particularly hopeful that they will lead to a lasting agreement.However  given the fact that South Africa has time and again presented the international community with underhanded manoeuvres  delaying tactics and other repeated about-turns  Niger is suspicious and intends to maintain vigil  iceÂ·  hence it calls upon the Assembly to keep up constant pressure on that country until it heeds reason and complies with its decisions.Within South Africa itself  Niger will continue to demand the dismantlement of the abhorrent policy of apartheid and the unconditional release of all political prisoners  including in particular Nelson Mandela. Finally  my country reiterates its support for the just  legitimate struggle of the freedom fighters of the African National Congress (ANC)  the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO).In the far eastern part of our continent  the Horn of Africa is starting to enjoy a climate of peace and security. We hope that guns will forever be silent in that region and that reconciliation and mutual trust will be strengthened between the fraternal peoples concerned.In Chad  an area of peace is being established. Niger is both relieved and gratified  for it has always called for dialogue and a return to negotiation. My country hopes that the ground swell of peace we are witnessing throughout the world will reach Africa too  and in particular Chad. In this respect  we are very happy to enter the process of normalization of relations between Chad and Libya  which was initiated by the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries. In the far west of Africa  a serious problem still persists: I refer to the conflict in the Western Sahara between peoples whose origin  history  culture and religion have tended to bring them closer towards unity.The Government and the people of Niger have been following with keen interest the diplomatic efforts made in the region to narrow the Moroccan and Algerian positions on the one hand and to have Morocco and the POLISARIO accept  on the other. United Nations proposals on the organization of a referendum on self-determination We invite the opposing parties to avoid any action that might compromise the current peace process and to redouble contacts to narrow their differences.Accordingly  we exhort all parties to continue to trust in our messenger of peace  Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar  and to give him their full co-operation.There is another source of concern in Africa that cannot be ignored. I refer o the 6 million refugees and other displaced persons and to the fact that their number is constantly increasing. The plight of these unfortunate people deserves special attention by the General Assembly; this tragic situation cries out to the conscience of the world. We sincerely hope that recommendations adopted on this question  especially those adopted at the recent Oslo conference  will be implemented as soon as possible in order to end forthwith the untold daily suffering of these throngs of exiles.In the rest of the world  other threats to international peace and security continue to be of concern. Of these  the foremost is the Iran-Iraq war  which is among the most fratricidal since the end of the Second World War and has lasted eight long years. Niger has followed  supported and encouraged the efforts of the United Nations  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and  especially  the Secretary-General  Mr  Javier Perez de Cuellar  towards the conclusion and signature of a cease-fire agreement between the belligerents  followed by the convening of peace negotiations. My country is happy that Iran and Iraq have accepted Security Council resolution 598 (1987) as a basis for preliminary negotiations in Geneva.My country appeals to those two members of the Islamic union to put aside past rancour and continue to show a political will as determined as that which led to the cease-fire  with a view to attaining the ultimate goal  which continues to be peace.Another deadly conflict  that in Afghanistan  is also of concern to us. But the withdrawal of foreign troops from the territory of that country that began a few months ago following the 14 April 1988 Geneva agreement between the super- Â· Powers  reached under the auspices of the Secretary-General  is a sign that peace will soon return to that country. Niger encourages Mr. Perez de Cuellar to continue his efforts to enable the Afghan people freely to exercise their right to self-determination. Turning to the Israel-Palestinian conflict  Niger regrets that peace remains remote. There is a reason for this Israel's continued total disregard for the many United Nations resolutions rejecting and condemning the illegal occupation of Palestinian territories as well as the alteration of their demographic nature and their legal  cultural and religious status.We in Niger are convinced that an overall just and lasting settlement of the Israel-Palestinian problem necessitates scrupulous respect for Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  which recognize  inter alia  the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.It goes without saying that Niger also supports the idea of convening  under United Nations auspices  an international conference on peace in the Middle East with the participation on an equal footing of all parties to the conflict.The situation in Lebanon is worrisome. That country has been ravaged by war for almost It years. Niger believes that an end to outside interference  particularly by Israel  could help end bloody confrontation and enable the Lebanese people to restore their unity.In South-East Asia  the Korean peninsula has been in a state of neither war nor peace since the 1953 armistice. We hope that all countries that  like Niger  have relations of friendship and co-operation both with the Republic of Korea and with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will step up their efforts to help them bring about a peaceful reunification of their country.In that same region  we continue to follow closely the situation in Kampuchea  whose people is struggling for self-determination and liberation from foreign domination. In Kampuchea as in Afghanistan we condemn the illegal occupation of territories by foreign troops in violation of the norms of international law. The national independence and non-aligned status of that country must of necessity he safeguarded and guaranteed by the international community. Let me say a few words about disarmament. Niger is pleased that the two super-Powers were able to conclude an agreement on the dismantling and destruction of a category of missiles. For our part  we hope that all weapons ~ nuclear  biological or chemical - will be covered by a future treaty prohibiting them once and for all. Only this will bring peace and security to mankind.My delegation believes further that it would be pointless to destroy the weapons amassed on our beloved planet Earth if the arms race were to be moved to outer space and pursued there. Disarmament is the concern of all States  so let us mobilise all our efforts and resources to protect the human race.With respect to the economy  we wish to say that the gap between the rich industrialized countries and the countries said to be developing is widening. Recently a conference was held at New York under United Nations auspices to carry out a mid-term review of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990  adopted in 1986. It noted that political measures and initiatives under the Programme have not yet resulted in any economic recovery for African States  which despite the expense have instituted structural adjustment measures and economic reform programmes.To permit economic growth in developing countries in general  and in the poorest countries of Africa in particular  we believe the international community should continue action on the three fronts of debt  trade and raw materials and on the development of human resources.With respect to debt  the crushing burden of debt servicing constitutes a brake on the development of our States. We believe that sustained joint effort involving a comprehensive  honest view of the problem by all is the only way to bring creditor and debtor countries together for a more just and equitable solution in keeping with the spirit and letter of the recommendations set out in resolution 42/198 and the decision of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).Unfortunately  the damaging effects on our countries of the world economic crisis are not the only difficulties our hard-working peoples have had to face. Many disasters - drought  desertification  flooding  infestations of locusts and jerboas  and cyclones - hit us year after year  reducing to naught all our efforts and sacrifices in the name of self-sufficiency.In Niger our rural populations face adversity with dignity and courage. Their efforts alone  unfortunately  are not enough to let them overcome these terrible disasters  and support from the international community is indispensable.Niger cannot remain silent but must highlight the important and very worrying question of the toxic and radioactive industrial waste that is dumped in Africa  secretly and criminally. As members know  this question was thoroughly discussed in June 1988 at the Organization of African Unity  which recommended finding a solution through negotiations with the industrialized nations responsible for exporting these dangerous wastes.Niger intends vigorously to denounce and condemn this reckless behaviour and to demand a halt to all transfers of toxic wastes to our continent. Africa cannot let itself be turned into a dumping ground: the survival of our peoples is at stake. The question of human rights has always been a major concern of this Assembly. The United Nations has spared no sacrifice to promote  defend and guarantee human rights throughout the world. The fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  which we are celebrating at the end of the year  should be an opportunity for us all solemnly to reiterate our unswerving  irreversible commitment to the noble principles and ideals of that Declaration. Niger will do so unreservedly because it is enjoying an era of freedom thanks to our Head of State  General Ali Saibou. Since his accession to the Supreme Court in November 1987  he has taken important steps attesting to his determination to promote and guarantee public rights and freedoms. These include the release of all political detainees; the proclamation of a general amnesty authorizing the return to their homes of all citizens of Niger exiled abroad for political reasons; acceleration of the process of constitutional normalization; and  finally  the establishment of a national movement for society in development which  according to the Head of State  will be ""a special forum for political expression within which citizens of Niger  men and women  will fight to reaffirm and defend their political  economic and social rights"".The United Nations  in addition to being an instrument for promoting and defending human rights  nations and people  is a special  irreplaceable instrument for the guarantee of international peace and security.Niger therefore believes that it is the duty of all Members of this Organization to give it unreserved support. As far as we are concerned  we intend to do so despite the enormous difficulties we have to confront  and we fully intend to respect the commitments we have entered into as a sovereign State.With regard to the recent successes of our Organization under the stewardship of our very competent indefatigable Secretary-General  Niger does not hesitate to issue an urgent appeal to all Member States to meet their financial obligations under the Charter thereby renewing their full confidence in the Organization.This gesture is particularly necessary since the United Nations has quite rightly just been awarded the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize for 1988 thanks to the exemplary devotion of the peace-keeping forces. Peace obviously has a price that is a fact we must all accept.Allow me now to convey to Mr. Perez de Cuellar the admiration of Niger for his diplomatic successes in various delicate missions in the service of peace and international solidarity. They certainly redound to the honour of our Organization. We would simply say to him  ""Thank you"".In conclusion; Niger hopes the United Nations will continue to enjoy the trust and constant support of all Members so that it can better discharge its noble and lofty mission of the promotion of peace  co-operation and international solidarity."
"102",5097,"NGA",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of the Nigerian delegation. Sir  I wish to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly at this session. I am particularly pleased to see you occupying this high office because of the very friendly relations between our two countries. I am sure that this session of the Assembly will benefit from the sterling qualities that you will undoubtedly bring to bear on your duties as President. May I assure you of my co-operation and support and that of Nigeria during your tenure of office.This session is taking place at a time of considerable improvement in the international political climate. The United Nations has proved its value as an effective and indispensable instrument in the painstaking process of negotiating the terms of settlement of most regional problems. This augurs well for the future of the United Nations and of mankind. At this point  may X congratulate the Secretary-General on the leadership role he has played in the cause of world peace and the strengthening of the United Nations.The award a few hours ago of the Nobel Peace Prize for 1988 to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is the greatest tribute that could be paid at this time to our Organization  but it is also a challenge to the United Nations to strive even harder to progress from peace-keeping to peace-making. As Chairman of the United Nations Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations  Nigeria is proud to be associated with the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations.The international economic environment remains extremely unfavourable for the developing countries. The Indices of this situation include the continuing decline in the prices of primary commodities  the general worsening of the terms of trade  the problem of rising protectionism  the increasing debt burden and net capital outflow from these countries. The political will needed to address these issues  in particular the debt problem  has not been sufficiently demonstrated by the developed countries. Indeed  the debt burden has become a major impediment to our economic growth and social development. The North-South colloquy has lost momentum  and with it the desire to look critically at the operations of the international economic system.Nowhere has this worsening economic situation facing the developing countries been exemplified more vividly than in Africa. The economic situation of the continent remains critical. In our determination to improve our economic situation  we have embarked on major reforms of our national economies. Many of us have courageously undertaken fundamental structural adjustments aimed at reviving our economies  stimulating growth and promoting development.The reform measures have included drastic devaluation of our currencies  reduction or elimination of subsidies  privatisation of publicly owned enterprises and the streamlining of our bureaucracies. These measures entail considerable political risks  and social costs arising from the sacrifices which our peoples have been called upon to make. They certainly demonstrate our willingness to do everything possible towards the development of self-reliant economies.The mid-term review and appraisal of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990 has demonstrated that the serious economic difficulties faced by African countries remain largely unsolved and in most cases have worsened. The contributions of the international community to the implementation of the Programme have fallen short of the expectations of African countries. Yet  when the Programme was adopted at the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly  two years ago  it was widely acclaimed as a positive response by the international community to the serious economic problems of the African continent.Nigeria perceives the Programme as a compact between African countries and the international community. We in Africa are fulfilling our own side of the pact; we expect the international community to fulfil its commitment. Jointly  we must find solutions to the roost serious economic problems facing African countries through debt relief  an increase in official development assistance and support for agreements to stabilize the prices of primary commodities:  on which the economies of most African countries depend.The Nigerian Government is facing the challenges of the overall development of our national economy with a courage and dedication unequalled in our history. The focus of the strategy is the modernization and transformation of our national economy. To this end we have adopted a structural adjustment programme designed to improve the performance of our economy. The implementation of this programme has opened up opportunities for our citizens and improved the climate for foreign investment in our country.Two years of its implementation have brought into bold relief the obstacles that hamper our development. These include  principally  the lack of an adequate supply of external financing and the high cost of imported manufactured products and machinery. These problems have been made more acute by our crushing debt burden and debt-service obligations  as well as by huge losses in export earnings as a result of the sharp and continuing decline in the prices of our primary commodities  including oil. Thus the economic development of Nigeria  like that of most other developing countries  continues to be constrained by an adverse international economic environment. We believe that the economic problems of African and other developing countries are issues that can no longer be swept under the carpet. The phenomenon of a world in which one fifth of the population lives in luxury and affluence and four fifths live in abject poverty and squalor cannot guarantee peace and security for mankind. Such a world would have little chance of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war  nor would it promote fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person.We believe that  unless the international community takes more seriously its obligations and commitment to establish conditions in which justice and respect for human dignity prevail  the primary purpose of our Organization  which is the maintenance of international peace and security  will continue to be in jeopardy.In a few weeks we shall be celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the adoption by the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since its adoption the world has witnessed tremendous progress in the field of human rights  globally  regionally and nationally. The one exception to the universal advancement of the rights of the individual is South Africa  where a white minority continues to trample upon the rights of the black majority. When we in Africa discuss the issue of human dignity  we do so with the conviction that our African culture recognizes the sanctity of life and liberty as universal. We believe that when any man's dignity is trampled upon anywhere in the world  all mankind suffers a little. That is why we denounce apartheid as morally outrageous and indefensible and politically unacceptable to the civilized world. The pernicious apartheid system continues to be an affront to the international community. Worse still  the racist regime continues to destabilize the front-line States of southern Africa.It is not only unfortunate but out rightly unacceptable that this evil regime in Pretoria should continue to pursue its obnoxious policies with the active support of important Members of this world Organization. Though we are told with sanctimonious piety that sanctions do not work  the same countries that make the claim are quick to impose sanctions on other States with which they disagree. We call on all Member States to rise above pecuniary considerations and impose comprehensive and mandatory sanctions on that evil regime.The Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on southern Africa  of which Nigeria is a member  has produced incontrovertible evidence to attest that sanctions indeed do work. I know that South Africa has been feeling the effect of the limited sanctions imposed on it by some Members of the United Nations. We ate most disheartened to know not only that a number of countries are continuing unashamedly to trade with South Africa while proclaiming their abhorrence of the evil system of apartheid  but that some of them are benefiting from the limited sanctions imposed on that State. This must stop.We call on all those who give the racists succour and support to join the civilized world in ostracizing that pariah State until a non-racial regime comes to power in South Africa. Nigeria will continue to support progressive forces within and outside South Africa that are committed to the dismantling of apartheid. This is a commitment that is shared by our people and our Government. Nigerians see the denial of basic human rights to black people in South Africa as a slut on mankind. That is why as far back as 1976  for example  individual Nigerians voluntarily contributed 315 million to support the peoples of southern Africa in their just struggle to be free.Africans ate a generous and forgiving people. When right triumphs over wrong in South Africa  when freedom overcomes tyranny  when harmony replaces discord and dissension  the Boers will not be victims of reverse racism  as many of them fear rather they  along with all God's children on the African continent  will march forward in freedom and harmony for the good of the human race. This is the thrust of the Lusaka Manifesto adopted by the Organization of African Unity in 1969.We call on this Assembly to convene a special session in 1989 devoted to apartheid in South Africa and the destructive consequences of South African aggression against the front-line and neighbouring countries. We hope that the special session will formulate new strategies for the early liquidation of the apartheid system.We welcome the ongoing negotiations on Angola and Namibia. We believe Angola should be left to develop along its chosen line. It is also the sovereign prerogative of Angola to secure its independence. The recent withdrawal of South African forces from Angola is only a return to sanity  legality and international decorum. Ten years ago the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 435 (1978). The continued illegal occupation of Namibia constitutes not only an affront to the United Nations but a deliberate challenge to the Security Council. South Africa must withdraw forthwith from Namibia. It is to us an irony of our times that any group of countries  fully aware of the grave dangers posed to lives and the environment  would either condone the dumping of toxic and radioactive waste or actively encourage their export to other countries. The international community must accept  as my Government has actively canvassed  that dumping of toxic and radioactive waste is a moral equivalent of war.The Nigerian Government has made its position clear on this matter  and followed this up with a call on the international community  at the subregional and regional levels  to enact laws to discourage this callous and unacceptable assault on lives and the environment.At the levels of the Organization of African Unity and the Economic Community of West African States  firm resolutions have been adopted to discourage the importation of these hazardous wastes into our continent and to penalize any persons or private organizations which collaborate with outside interests to turn Africa into the garbage dump for toxic and radioactive waste. At the meeting in July  in Rio de Janeiro  of the countries of the South Atlantic  bold new steps were taken to strike back at this menace before it becomes truly unmanageable.Recently also  the Nicosia meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement adopted a Declaration which strongly condemned the dumping of hazardous waste. With the establishment of a ""Dump watch""  my country is currently collaborating with many Members of this Organization in the dissemination of precise information on the extent and location of toxic waste vessels now roaming the high seas. We have co-operated with and will continue to count on the excellent support of non-governmental organizations which have devoted their time and other resources to the protection of the environment. Nigeria was a victim of this despicable practice. Between August 1987 and May 1988  toxic wastes were secretly dumped in the Koko Port area of my country. By this act  the people and the environment of Koko were put at very grave risk. In addition  the economic life of the area was dislocated. The Nigerian Government moved with despatch to have the waste removed. It also enacted appropriate national legislation against the dumping of toxic and radioactive waste. My delegation is gratified to note that several delegations have in the course of this debate and in other forums condemned this act and expressed their willingness to crusade effectively against it. As a starting point  we have called on all Member States to curb the activities of those involved in the Tran boundary movement of waste. We call also on all Member States and non-governmental organizations to adopt the ""Dump Watch"".Just as we are worried about the dangerous effects of toxic and radioactive wastes on the environment  we are also concerned about the possible hostile use of these wastes. We are equally happy that the International Atomic Energy Agency at its thirty-second session  last month  condemned all practices of nuclear-waste dumping and requested the Director General to establish a working group of experts to draw up a code for international transactions involving nuclear wa3te. We call upon the present session of the General Assembly to give the Conference on Disarmament the mandate of commencing negotiations on a draft convention on the prohibition of the dumping of radioactive and toxic waste for hostile purposes.In the Middle East  after four decades of endemic cycles of violence and needless loss of life  the United Nations has finally outlined a peace process which  if faithfully implemented  has a credible chance of bringing durable peace to that area. Nigeria supports a United Nations-sponsored international conference on the Middle East.Another area where a solution compatible with the Charter of the Organization is urgent is Kampuchea. Nigeria will continue to work within the United Nations  particularly through the Committee on Kampuchea  in pursuit of an acceptable solution to this problem. The ongoing withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan has demonstrated what is possible when there is political will. It is our hope that the Geneva accords on Afghanistan will be adhered to by all the parties concerned.Similarly  we commend the peace initiatives of the Latin American and Central American countries. We call- on the entire international community to support the ongoing process for a lasting peace in Central America.I had the opportunity at the fifteenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament  to congratulate the two super-Powers on the conclusion and ratification of the Treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces. That agreement is historic as the first true nuclear disarmament measure eliminating an entire category of nuclear weapons. The joint declaration by President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought has given great relief to a world dangerously threatened by the possibility of self-destruction.My delegation  like others that worked hard for the successful outcome of the special session devoted to disarmament  is naturally disappointed at the failure to agree on a concluding document. However  we believe that the international community cannot afford to be totally discouraged by such periodic reverses. We appeal to the super-Powers to see multilateral involvement by the United Nations in disarmament as a useful and necessary complement to bilateral and regional efforts. An urgent area for multilateral action is the negotiation of a convention on chemical weapons.The achievements of the Organization in the four decades of its existence have been quite impressive. The United Nations has contributed substantially to the decolonization process. But we should ensure that we respect and modernize the instruments and frameworks of  accountability such as the codes  conventions  norms and principles that at present regulate international relations. We are encouraged by the resurgence of hope and faith in our Organization. We are further encouraged by the increasing desire to use it for the primary purpose of advancing international peace and security.The United Nations is indispensable to all the countries of the world. The presence of all of us here is a reaffirmation of that fact. My country  Nigeria  remains firmly committed to the United Nations Charter."
"103",5142,"NIC",43,1988,"ï»¿I should like to begin by congratulating our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  for the Nobel Peace Prise which has been awarded to the United Nations. Ho regard that lofty distinction as recognition of the noble task carried out by the troops in ""blue helmets""  but also  of course  as a gesture of appreciation for the heroic endeavours of the Secretary-General in defence of this Organisation  on behalf of peace and for the successes achieved within this last year.From 1981 to date  we have witnessed the emergence of an extremely powerful campaign against multilateralism  in general  and against the United Nations and the rule of law in international relations  in particular. Armed unilateralism has set aside the United Nations Charter and sought to have itself recognized as lord and master of the universe. Such is the extreme reached by the self-deification of the United States and the pretensions of its leaders A loss of identity end delusions of grandeur are not unknown phenomena. Psychiatric hospitals are full of patients who believe they are Napoleon or Superman and demand to be treated accordingly. It is difficult to deal with such people; it is impossible to please them.Nothing  however  can compare with the difficulty involved in dealing with a powerful State that believes itself to be God and requires all of us to burn incense at its altar and acknowledge its right - its non-existing right - to do whatever it may please regardless of all divine  ethical and legal precepts. We know what we are talking about  because we have experienced it directly. That is why we applaud the way our Secretary-General has succeeded in keeping the United Nations afloat amid the storm of economic pressure and campaigns to undermine the effectiveness of the Organisation. The results achieved by the United Nations in promoting peace this year have finally forced these senseless circles to modify their attitude somewhat and to agree to face up to their economic obligations to the Organisation. We applaud this development as a victory for common sense. We should like to see this extend also to respect for the sacred principles of the Charter; otherwise  it would be futile to spend money to keep the Organisation alive. The Charter is the soul of the United Nations. The very reason for its existence lies in respect for the Charter and in making sure that others respect it.We wish also to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of this important forty-third session of the General Assembly. As a representative of our Latin American and Caribbean region  as Foreign Minister of a country that belongs to the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and to the Contadora Support Group  and as a tireless champion of international peace on both the political and economic fronts  you. Sir  are particularly well qualified to help us take the fullest possible advantage of the opportunities offered by the progress that has been made towards solving a number of regional conflicts and in negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union.Nicaragua has followed the development of this general debate most attentively. Manifest throughout the debate has been the optimism inspired by the new atmosphere of understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union  the most tangible evidence of which has been the agreement on the elimination of intermediate nuclear forces. Beyond any doubt  we share the belief that this understanding has had a positive effect on international relations. Nevertheless  the optimism and expectations created by this new age of detente should not make us lose sight of the very  rave problems that continue to confront mankind. As the Secretary-General acknowledges in his report on the work of the Organisation: ""The international situation is still  of course  marked by points of strain and danger  visible or lurking. Complacency about the resolution of complex problems that still face us is impermissible."" fA/43/l. p. 2>These new circumstances should be the starting point for a substantive change in international relations. We aspire to genuine international democracy  based on strict adherence to the principles and norms of the United Nations Charter  which is the only way to guarantee that just solutions will be found to the central problems of peace and development.In pursuing this goal  the poor and the non-aligned countries must be more united than ever and must act judiciously and resolutely in terms of an agenda of our own making. The agenda for an international peace which can only be achieved through the development of peoples and the recognition of the sovereign and legal equality of all States.The role of the United Nations is fundamental in the process of democratizing international relations. Here we must pay a tribute to the patience and determination shown by the Secretary-General  Javier Peres de Cuellar  who  over the years  has been able to cope with very serious difficulties and who  at this very moment  is playing an increasingly active and key role in the solution of a number of regional conflicts.An essential ingredient in the strengthening of the United Nations Is an unflagging political will on the part of the permanent members of the Security Council as well. Genuine support  by which I mean the kind of support that is really needed to strengthen our Organization  is not the kind that arises from political propaganda interests of the moment  but the kind that comes from a profound conviction that the United Nations is the key to carrying forward the changes needed to guarantee peace. The pressing problems of disarmament cannot be resolved outside the framework of this Organisation. To prevent a nuclear catastrophe is a responsibility shared by us all. The Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (the INF Treaty} signed by the United States and the Soviet Union is of tremendous importance  but we must not forget that it involves the elimination of only 4 per cent of current nuclear arsenals.Bilateral negotiations between the two super-Powers should continue with a view to reducing strategic nuclear weapons and at no time should those talks be allowed to become an obstacle to multilateral negotiations. Unfortunately  this is what has been happening up to now. There are aspects of disarmament which are of vital importance to all States  such as the urgent need for a treaty on the comprehensive banning of nuclear testing  the prohibition of the production and use of chemical weapons  the prevention of the arms race in outer space and the reduction of conventional weapons. Nor must the priority of nuclear disarmament be allowed to be an obstacle to progress in reducing conventional weapons. This is an area of the utmost interest to the developing countries. Reduction of the third world's military expenditure  which would help us to deal with the grave economic problems of the present time  nevertheless strict adherence to the principles and norms of international law and a climate in which hostility  force and intervention are replaced by respect for international pluralism  peaceful coexistence  co-operation and friendship among peoples.	.The main responsibility for disarmament in all its aspects continues to lie with the militarily significant Powers  which must reduce their military expenditure and increase the amount of their official development assistance. The idea of establishing a United Nations fund for disarmament and development remains valid. It is significant that the total debt of the developing world  which now exceeds $1 trillion  is equivalent to the current level of world-wide military spending. The outgoing capital transfers from Latin America and the Caribbean in 1987 amounted to 45 per cent of the defence spending of the United States and 66 per cent of its fiscal deficit. The price of financing  promoting and developing the arms race has been the poverty and hunger of our peoples.One consequence of today's unjust economic order  the problem of debt  which affects the vast majority of the world's peoples  is today an insurmountable obstacle in the way of development. The starting-point for solving this problem is the recognition that our peoples have a right to development. Partial solutions by means of bilateral negotiations have been exhausted. The debt problem simply cannot be solved by means of more debt. Adjustment policies have been taken to their limit. The strategy of buying time and waiting for an economic miracle is not merely evasive but also suicidal. The consequences of a world-wide economic collapse would be suffered by all  debtors and creditors alike. Global solutions and consensus are therefore imperative.An extremely important step in this direction is the decision recently taken in Caracas Venezuela by the countries that make up the Latin American Economic System (SELA) to hold the first Latin American conference on foreign debt next year. We believe that the conference should be held as soon as possible and that the participants should include representatives of other regions that also suffer the consequences of this grave problem.But it is not enough to recognise the gravity of the debt problem and arrive at a just solution on the basis of recognising the shared responsibilities of debtor and creditor. The new international economic order must also become a reality. If it does not  little or nothing will be gained by resolving the debt problem temporarily  because problems are resolved not by addressing their effects but by attacking their causes.The wealth of the few must not continue to grow in an unrestrained manner at the cost of the impoverishment of the vast majority. To the extent that we are capable of finding a just and comprehensive solution to this pressing problem we shall be laying the foundations for a reorganisation of the current system of world economic relations. A now international economic order continues to be one of our most important objectives and priorities  and the pragmatism called for by some should not be allowed to become a pretext for abandoning the struggle and irresponsibly giving way to the immoral logic of extreme mercantilism that today prevails. The new momentum which the United Nations has acquired in solving various regional conflicts  represented by the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan  the developments concerning the independence of Namibia  the end of the war between Iran and Iraq  the dialogue in Cyprus  and the self-determination of Western Sahara  is to a great extent the result of the work undertaken by the Organisation and its Secretary-General on behalf of world peace. Although it is trying to take credit for these achievements  the credit certainly does not lie with the United States  the action of whose Government over the past eight years has been characterised by systematic blocking of this Organisation and its specialised agencies and the promotion of such theories as linkage  constructive engagement and low-intensity warfare  all invented to prolong the suffering of peoples and postpone the dawn of freedom.If today we are witnessing a resurgence of the United Nations  it is precisely because this policy of overt and covert war against multilateralism has been defeated.If today we can hope to see solutions to various regional conflicts  it is because throughout our resistance struggle we have succeeded in firmly defending our principles and have persevered in proposing solutions based on them.If today it is possible to foresee the end of the hateful policy and practice of apartheid. which constitutes the most serious offence to the universal conscience of our time  it is thanks above all to the heroic struggle of the people of South Africa  as well as to international solidarity  first and foremost that of the front-line States  the heroic and disinterested assistance given by the Cuban people  backed by the entire Non-Aligned Movement  and the praiseworthy efforts of the United Nations. It is the admirable tenacity shown by individuals  peoples and institutions struggling for peace that will lead to recognition of the inalienable rightÂ· of the Palestinian people  to the reunification of Korea  and to the liberation once and for all of Central America for  the age-old scourge of United States intervention.In Central America peace efforts continue to be sabotaged It has not been possible to give full effect to the Esquipulas agreements  signed by the Central American Presidents on 7 August last year. One basic aspect of the agreements concerns the essential verification mechanism. Nicaragua has insisted that this mechanism take the form of a United Nations peace operation under the direction of the Secretary-General and with the participation of a group of countries which have already stated their willingness and desire to take an active part in this noble task of making peace and harmony a reality in our region. As is well known to all  Honduras has been unwilling to sign a request together with all the Central American countries asking the Secretary-General to organise the verification mechanism. Here  the Honduras Foreign Minister made much oÂ£ presenting an alternative proposal to that discussed in the context of Esquipulas II  but  as always  he has refused to engage in serious talks with a view to agreeing on the setting up of an instrument to ensure security on the border between Honduras and Nicaragua.We have been repeating this to the point of exhaustion  and it is not worth spending much time on it here. The problems in Central America has a first name and last name  and they are the same namely United States intervention. When the United States stops making war on Nicaragua and stops involving its lackeys in that war  then the international situation in Central America will be immensely eased.We have spoken of the need to establish genuine international democracy. The foundation for this democracy is principles and norms of a legal nature  compliance with which ensures international peace and security.In the defence of its sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity in the face of United States aggression  Nicaragua  in addition to its heroic military resistance  has given top priority to international law and justice.In its historic ruling of 27 June 1S86  the International Court of Justice agreed with Nicaragua  claim and ordered the United States immediately to put an end to its sordid and immoral war and make reparation for the damages and losses inflicted on Nicaragua.The fact that the Government of the United States refuses to comply with the Court's decision does not affect the validity of the verdict one jot. One of Nicaragua's guiding principles has been and continues to be the defence of international law. It is precisely for that reason that we favour universal acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the world Court.During the most recent ministerial-level conference of the Movement of the Non-Aligned Countries  held in Cyprus  Nicaragua proposed that nest year  in the Hague  a special non-aligned ministerial meeting should be held on peace and international law. The proposal was approved by acclamation.The celebration next year of the ninetieth anniversary of the first Peace Conference  held in the Hague  at which the first international accords on the peaceful settlement of disputes were reached  constitutes an ideal framework for such an undertaking. It is our desire  given the importance of the subject matter  that this meeting be open to the participation of all Members of the United Nations and States party to the Statutes of the International Court of Justice who wish to take part.	.  The question of Nicaragua-and specifically the subject of the military and paramilitary activities organised  financed and directed by the United States against Nicaragua - is something that has occupied a central place in the awareness of all peoples of the earth over the last few years. In my travels throughout Africa  Asia and the South Pacific  as well as in Latin America  Europe and the United States itself  I have found that my small country has become a symbol of dignity and heroic resistance against those who seek to deny third world countries their rights to genuine self-determination and independence - the indispensable basis for the genuine democratisation desired by all peoples.At the same time  we have witnessed the profound discredit into which the aggressor has fallen. In Latin America  the low prestige of the United States has reached bottom; some feel that it can no longer recover  or that at the very least a long time will have to pass before that prestige is regained. All agree that the sordid  immoral and illegal policy against Nicaragua is the basic reason for this discredit. Secretary of State Shultz and a few of his Latin American friends may think otherwise  but that is another kettle of fish or perhaps another few hundred dollars. The facts tell another story.Latin America's sentiments were clearly manifested by the masses of people that Secretary of State Shultz and Vice-President Bush saw in Buenos Aires  Montevideo  Brasilia  and recently Quito  places which were simultaneously visited by President Daniel Ortega. I do not think it is necessary here to repeat what those masses of people were shouting at Secretary Shultz  nor to state once again how warmly they greeted the Constitutional President of Nicaragua Daniel Ortega Saavedra.Having failed in its attempts at a military overthrow of the democratically elected Government of Nicaragua  the Reagan Administration has been involved in promoting different acts of provocation in order to test my Government's willingness to apply the law and thus run the risk of suffering official reprisals from the United States.The Nandaime incident  which caused much hypocritical rending of garments  is only one of the latest examples of what is known today as the Melton Plan  named after the former United States Ambassador to Nicaragua responsible for its implementation.I think it is obvious to everyone here that no government worthy of the name can make the application of its laws subject to considerations of political expediency  and much less to forecasts as to how its enemies abroad  or the friends of its enemies  might choose to interpret its legal actions.It is never proper to allow flagrant disregard of the law to pass with impunity. Nothing could be more damaging to the authority and credibility of a government. Nothing could be more effective in promoting anarchy and in inducing people to take justice into their own hands  than the demonstration of government weakness in the enforcement of the law.The Reagan Administration is fully conscious of this fact  and its efforts are therefore aimed at causing an internal breakdown in the Nicaraguan Government as a result of inaction - inaction imposed on us by that Administration - in the face of domestic lawlessness.In Nicaragua we have a popular Government  freely elected by the people  by means of one of the most exemplary electoral processes ever established in Latin America. We have laws. We have a Constitution. And those who choose to disregard those laws have to bear the consequences  even though they may seek to take cover under the official sponsorship of the United States for their criminal activities. In the military struggle against the mercenary forces of the United States we were not intimidated - we have defeated them. Nor will we be intimidated by the ever-mounting political attacks and multi-million-dollar slander campaigns aimed at discrediting our nation. It is the United States that has seen fit to take fright and flee the impartial eye of the highest tribunal of justice in the world.We will not be lectured to by a Government that lags far behind us in its own record on human rights and civil liberties  particularly in times of war. Neither  obviously  will we accept the shameless lectures of the Central American lackeys of that empire  who themselves have lost all credibility in the international community  especially in the United Nations  because of their disastrous record on human rights. For this reason  we shall not even bother to refute the unfounded accusations that were levelled against us here this morning by the Salvadoran Foreign Minister. Rather  we  for our part  will continue to oppose irrationality with reason  terrorism with law  intimidation with a guest for honest dialogue. We shall continue to insist that the country that is host to the United Nations and to the Organisation of American States prove itself worthy of continuing to be the meeting-place of these organisations. This implies respect for the sovereign rights of member States and for the independence of the organizations.In this connection  I just want to add that we reserve our right to take further action in respect of the improper denial of visas to members of the delegation that was to accompany President Ortega to this session of the General Assembly.We believe in the United Nations and in the possibility of achieving international peace and security through the scrupulous observance of the norms and principles of its Charter. We believe also that it must be possible to reach an understanding with the United States and to normalise our bilateral relations with that country. We hope that  under the next United States Administration  that may be possible. Our banner is  and always will be  ""A homeland free  or let us die."" We shall continue to defend the right of our people to live in peace only to have their inalienable right to self-determination and independence respected."
"104",5189,"NLD",43,1988,"ï»¿Sir  it gives me particular pleasure to see you in the Chair as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We know that under your guidance this gathering is in good hands. My delegation looks forward to cc-operating with you in the months ahead. At the beginning of this week ray friend and colleague  Mr. Papoulias  the Foreign Minister of Greece  set out before the Assembly the views of the 12 member States of the European Community - including the Netherlands - on a wide range of international issues. This enables roe to concentrate on two major issues that deserve our common attention: the role of the United Nations in the promotion of peace  justice and international law and its significance in the field of human rights. On both subjects I should like to make a few suggestions.Earlier this month  in the presence of the Secretary-General  a ceremony in commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Peace Palace  the seat of the International Court of Justice  was held in The Hague. I was intrigued by a Latin phrase on the wall of the large courtroom: ""Arma togae cÃ©dant  this is  ""May weapons yield to law"". One could hardly think of a more appropriate motto for the present Assembly session than Cicero's dictum. The Assembly convenes at a crucial juncture. In different parts of the world  conflict is giving way to negotiations  and more and more voices are calling for the supremacy of the rule of law. The United Nations may well be about to assume the role its founders envisaged. The United Nations Charter embodies the bold vision of a world-wide system of collective security  with the Security Council as its pivot. As Dag Hamnar once pointed out  the United Nations reflects at the same time an aspiration and a falling short of that aspiration. But  he added  the persistent struggle to close the gap between aspiration and actual accomplishment makes the difference between civilization and chaos.During these weeks representatives of nations from East and West  North and South  are paying tribute to the Secretary-General and his staff who  quietly but with perseverance  are serving the cause of peace. Like others  we applaud recent achievements in Afghanistan and the Gulf and the new impetuses being given elsewhere. Those developments have added much to the prestige of the Organization and of the Secretary-General. In those developments we recognize vital elements of the recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the Security Council that the Secretary-General advanced in his reports to the General Assembly in 1983 and 1986. At the time  those ideas did not receive the hearing they deserved. Now  the mood of frustration and impotence is giving way to renewed optimism. There seems to be a new confidence in the effectiveness of the multilateral approach in international relations.We must seize the opportunities to promote peace. United Nations peace-keeping is one of them. It is therefore most befitting that the United Nations peace-keeping forces were collectively awarded the Nobel Peace Prize yesterday. On behalf of the Netherlands Government I most warmly congratulate them on that well-deserved award. The Prize honours all those soldiers who over the years have served in United Nations forces all over the world.The Netherlands has always supported the efforts of the United Nations in the field of peace-keeping. We are now actively considering with our partners in the Twelve how we can contribute more effectively. In this context the valuable comments on the growing role of peace-keeping operations in the Secretary-General's annual report to the Assembly certainly deserve careful attention. Of course  one should not overlook the fact that here  as elsewhere  there is an obvious need to make the best possible use of scarce resources. This is the more true in the light of the magnitude of some of the peace-keeping operations that are envisaged  for instance in Namibia and in Western Sahara.  For many years the world community has been demanding independence for Namibia. We are encouraged by the progress recently made. I trust that the momentum can be maintained.The process of dialogue and negotiations we see in many parts of the world is also needed in South Africa itself. Apartheid is totally and fundamentally wrong. It has no future. Although change is long overdue  it is not too late to bring it about peacefully. But every new delay will make the task of national reconciliation even more difficult. The artificial separations apartheid has created between the various segments of the South African population ha/e bred deep resentment and fear of the unknown. In our opinion it is high time to replace this by a broad dialogue across all lines of colour. The Kingdom of the Netherlands urges the South African Government to release Nelson Mandela and all those others detained for their political beliefs. That could open the way to negotiations with the genuine representatives of the population.We look not only to the early abolition of apartheidÂ·  we look also to its replacement by a just political order in which all South Africans can live in peace and harmony. It is  of course  up to the South African peoples themselves to join hands in order to shape a new constitutional framework. But let me say this on the subject: the ideals of human rights  democracy and the rule of law to which ray country  like so many others  is deeply attached  would seem all the more essential in a society as diverse as South Africa's. May I submit that a bill of rights  to be negotiated and agreed upon between the authentic representatives of the entire population and safeguarded by an independent judiciary  would do much to guarantee equal rights and allay the fears that some have. Would not a pluralistic democracy providing adequate participation by both majority and minority offer the best prospects for lasting reconciliation? And  nay I add  would not a South Africa at peace with itself be a tremendous asset for the region as a whole?The cease-fire in the 8-year-old war between Iraq and Iran was greeted with great relief. Untold suffering is coming to an end. But there was more to this war. In flagrant violation of international law we saw chemical weapons being used on a scale not witnessed since the First World War. The war endangered yet another principle of international law  namely freedom of navigation  on one of the busiest sea-lanes of the world. It was to uphold that principle that my country  together with a number of other Western European countries  contributed to mine-clearing in the Gulf. We have noted with interest that the Secretary-General has suggested looking into the possibilities of extending peace-keeping to the maritime environment. We are prepared to study the implications of such a new dimension in United Nations peace-keeping tasks.Negotiations between the two belligerents have now started under the auspices of the Secretary-General. The intransigence that has prolonged the war for so many years should not be transferred to the negotiating table. Together with others  we call upon both parties to co-operate intensively with the Secretary-General in order to achieve a comprehensive peace settlement in compliance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987).Turning to Cambodia  we welcome the intensified diplomatic efforts to read a settlement and the constructive role played by the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Cambodia has had more than its share of suffering. Our goal must be an independent Cambodia  free from foreign occupation and invested with democratic institutions strong enough to withstand internal and external threats. Clearly  neither a continuation of the current foreign the universally condemned policies and practices of the regional conflicts also  we see how the improved activities of States in the region and the support given to each other in working towards peaceful is that was found for direct talks between the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus is another example of progress to that end.And in another hotbed of tension an unjust and painful stalemate continues to exist. We are looking forward to the day when the United Nations can also play an enhanced role in the settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The status quo there is not sustainable. The tensions in the occupied territories demonstrate the need for a renewed impetus to the peace process. My country fully understands the Israeli concerns about security. Israel  indeed  is entitled to existence in security. But the Palestinian people too have their legitimate rights. Their right to self-determination will have to be accommodated in the context of a comprehensive and lasting settlement. In recent meetings with the Israeli Government and with Palestinian representatives in East Jerusalem  the Netherlands Government joined those who urged moderation and a constructive approach by all concerned. The road to a settlement will no doubt be long. It might have to be covered in stages  but then with a clear final perspective. Success will only be achieved if parties are willing to compromise  if parties do not confront each other with conditions they know beforehand to be unacceptable to the other side. Peace involves mutual concessions. Delaying the inevitable will diminish the opportunities of reaching a solution and will only increase the tensions. The role of the international community is  as we see it  not merely to mete out reprimands  it is to help the peace process along and eventually  once the negotiations have led to results  to guarantee their outcome.We are concerned about developments in Lebanon and saddened by the continuing suffering of its people. We urge all parties concerned to abstain from any action that would deepen the rifts that have kept Lebanon divided for so long already. It is imperative that the constitutional framework of Lebanon be allowed to function so that a new President  elected freely and without interference from outside  can take up the pressing task of restoring the unity of the Lebanese people.Much is changing in Eastern Europe. We follow the processes of reform with great interest and commend the spirit of greater openness. My country has  together with its allies  consistently pursued a policy aimed at better East-West relations and arms control. We will not be remiss in seizing opportunities to further these aims. Important progress in arms control has already been achieved  and this to an extent that seemed inconceivable only a few years ago.The Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty was indeed a major breakthrough. And the 50-per-cent cut in strategic weapons  which is now being negotiated  would be an even more significant disarmament measure. But however much we hope for further results in the field of nuclear disarmament  it is essential that progress should also encompass conventional arms control. The serious conventional imbalance we face in Europe is at the core of our security problem  and our aim is to bring about a stable conventional balances at lower levels and with more transparency.It is also essential to press ahead with a total ban on chemical weapons. The imminent danger of proliferation of chemical weapons underlines once again the need for such a ban  and that on a world-wide basis. Indeed  the verification problems are daunting  but I refuse to believe that they cannot be solved. In the meantime  while a total ban has not yet been concluded  it is tragic to see that the 1925 Geneva Protocol has not prevented the use of these abhorrent weapons. We support President Reagan's proposal  made last Monday  to convene a conference to see how together we can remedy the erosion of the Protocol.When addressing the third special session on disarmament I emphasized how important it was that the Secretary-General be able to conduct investigations  whenever there were allegations of the use of chemical weapons. The Security Council confirmed this necessity and encouraged him to carry out promptly investigations in response to allegations concerning the possible use of chemical weapons. It is therefore disappointing and disturbing to note that recently the Secretary-General was not permitted to ascertain the facts when there were strong reasons to do so.It is indeed a worrisome development that ""proliferation""  which used to refer exclusively to the danger of nuclear proliferation nowadays is acquiring new connotations  as we see proliferation  not only in the chemical field but also in that of missiles and missile technology. It would be a bitter irony if at a time when arms control negotiations are at last beginning to yield long-sought results  we failed to stem the danger of proliferation.A key element of any arms control agreement is verification  and I am happy to note the growing international consensus on this point. In my statement at the third special session on disarmament last June I suggested strengthening the general role of the United Nations with regard to verification in a practical manner. Our proposal is that a group of qualified governmental experts would study ways to improve the assistance United Nations bodies could render in the verification of arms control agreements. This would apply in the first place to multilateral agreements and  furthermore  to regional  or even bilateral agreements  if parties so desired. Together with Canada and Prance  we intend to submit our ideas to the Assembly in greater detail.Maintaining peace and security is a primary task of the United Nations  but by no means the only one. All of us should seriously consider how we can increase the relevance of the role of the Organization in the light of constantly changing conditions  how we can enhance its efficiency and flexibility  and how we can counteract bureaucratic tendencies and duplication.The Netherlands has participated actively in the special committee on the restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations. I must admit that we are rather disappointed with the outcome of these deliberations so far. None the less  we must continue this reform process in order to enable the United Nations to increase its relevance also in the economic and social fields.One does not have to be a prophet to foresee a major transformation of the international system in the decades ahead. The spectacular emergence of new economic centres in various parts of the third world is only one indication that we are witnessing a development towards greater multipolarity. This in itself could enrich the interaction amongst us  and  it is to be hoped  will increase the effectiveness of the United Nations when new actors assume larger responsibilities for the common good.The recent economic recovery in the industrialized countries has not yet led to an improvement of the economic situation in many parts of the developing world. I believe that it is high time to remind ourselves of the target for official development assistance of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product that has been adopted. In order to assist the economic and social advancement of developing countries  the Netherlands will continue to disburse 1 per cent of its gross domestic product for development purposes.The review of the Programme of Action for Africa has made clear that it is Africa in particular that is facing economic problems of staggering magnitude. I am convinced  however  that the review has provided important impetus to both the African countries and the international community to redouble our common efforts to reach the goals of the action plan in time. The debate on the strategy for the fourth development decade offers a good opportunity to discuss the interrelationships and mutual dependence of specific development topics such as debts  investments  the environment  natural resources  commodities and trade and their implications for sustainable development. As a contribution to solving some of the most pressing environmental problems  my Government will host high-level consultations on the ozone layer next month and a conference on the protection of the atmosphere next year in the Netherlands.Regional co-operation has much to offer to people on all continents  both as a way to promote peace and as an instrument for increasing prosperity. Integration amongst European nations has allowed us not only to overcome a bitter legacy of division but also to achieve a considerable degree of prosperity for our peoples. Our endeavours have not led to Euro centrism but stimulated even an outward orientation of Western Europe. One large single market instead of 12 separate smaller markets should offer new opportunities  not only for the Community  but for third-world countries as well.We do not see regional co-operation as a substitute for global co-operation. The two complement each other. Interdependence and co-operation are at the heart of the new global reality and the United Nations should be an energetic reflection of that reality.The Olympic games provide us  right at this moment  with a powerful symbol of brotherhood and friendly competition. Against this background I may say that we hope that the Republic of Korea  now hosting the games  can soon take up its rightful place in this universal Organization.In order to strengthen the basis for global co-operation we must reflect upon the values that bind us together. Article I of the United Nations Charter lists the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms among the three main purposes of the United Nations. Forty years ago  the General Assembly  building on this foundation  proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since then  the universal applicability of the Declaration has been firmly established.Human rights transcend national borders. Violations of these rights - and they are only too frequent - are a common concern of the family of nations. They are not simply an internal matter within the exclusive domain of national sovereignty. The past 40 years have clearly refuted this argument.The 1948 Declaration was the starting-point of an impressive effort at international law-making. The two United Nations Covenants on human rights  of 1966  were milestones in this effort and it is to be hoped that in this year  in which we are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  those Member States that have not yet acceded to some of the United Nations instruments on human rights will be able to decide to do so in the near future. Let us be clear - the concept of human rights was not an invention to be used to attack those with whom we find ourselves in disagreement. No  we refer to fundamental standards on which we should all be prepared to be judged. Moreover  we feel that respect for human rights is essential for confidence-building between States.Formal accession by countries to the various conventions is important  but it is only a first step. Implementation must follow - and as we all know  that is where the real problems begin. This underlines the importance of the various monitoring procedures and mechanisms designed to hold States to their obligations. Signs of erosion of the supervisory system are a cause of concern. We would hope that the meeting of chairpersons of the various United Nations supervisory bodies scheduled for this autumn will be able to propose practical remedies to remove the strain on the reporting system. At the same time it is essential that adequate levels of funding for human rights monitoring mechanisms be secured. The Netherlands has circulated some ideas on monitoring procedures and mechanisms amongst these chairpersons. These suggestions will also be circulated in a document in the course of this session of the General Assembly.As I have said  efforts at the regional level can supplement and reinforce those at the global level. In the Helsinki Final Act 35 countries pledged themselves to a broad programme designed to improve mutual relations. This programme includes respect for a comprehensive range of clearly defined human rights. Here  too  we have been faced too long with a gap between the standards we set and the degree to which they are being complied with. That is why the Netherlands insisted so strongly on the incorporation  within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)  of a mechanism to review compliance in the field of human rights and human contacts. I hope that this concept will be reflected in the final document of the CSCE which  as we all hope  the current meeting in Vienna will be able to agree upon soon.There is much to celebrate during the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration. But celebrations or commemorations should not divert our attention from the more sobering task of stock-taking. We should ask ourselves to what degree the rights proclaimed are actually promoted and enjoyed. Torture  summary executions and unlawful detention are an everyday reality for all too many of our fellow human beings. And yet  there is probably no government that does not profess respect for human rights. Let us not forget that the scourge of the abuse of human rights is man-made; it can therefore be remedied by man. The international Bill of Human Rights exists; the mechanisms are in place. Our task in the years ahead should be to promote the political will to bring about the effective enjoyment of human rights by all mankind.There is a growing realization that these concepts  while values in themselves  are also basic conditions for shaping a more prosperous and a more just society. Freedom and democracy  we feel  are not luxuries. On the contrary  they go hand in hand with development and prosperity. The age of technology gives an advantage to those societies that allow information to circulate freely and give room to the innovative capabilities of the individual.But if we cherish human rights so much  it is not only for their intrinsic value or for their contribution to the prosperity of man. Human rights are  as the Universal Declaration states  ""the foundation of freedom  justice and peace in the world"". Indeed  internal oppression and external aggression have often gone together. It could not have been phrased more aptly than it was by the Secretary-General during his recent stay in the Netherlands when he said that ""respect for human rights and peace are inseparable. Just as the violation of human rights leads to conflict  so conflict and war lead  all too often  to the suppression of human rights."""
"105",5234,"NOR",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of Norway I add my congratulations to those of the speakers who have preceded me  Sir  on your election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.The community of nations is looking to this forty-third session of the General Assembly with high hopes and great expectations. After years of decline in multilateral co-operation  are we finally witnessing the turn of the tide? The conspicuous  constructive role that the Organization has lately successfully played with regard to many regional conflicts clearly demonstrates the need for an effective United Nations. We  who as a matter of policy and conviction have always supported the United Nations  are encouraged to see it resume its rightful role as the protector and promoter of peace and stability  a centre where nations harmonize their policies and actions in Favour of a more secure world based on social and economic justice.As policies and positions of nations change we must have one focal point in the world which is constitutionally and permanently charged with the task of searching for negotiated solutions to political  economic and social solutions.There have been long periods when the United Nations has suffered from the divisions between blocs  and in particular from the lack of dialogue and co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union  but the post-war bipolar world has yielded to a multipolar one. The major Powers are gradually realizing that it is in their own interests to maintain a more effective world Organization.The improved bilateral relations between the United States and the Soviet Union  epitomized by the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - will undoubtedly have positive effects on the ongoing endeavours for substantial arms reductions. It remains a primary concern for the Norwegian Government to capitalize on what has been achieved and to work towards agreements on deep cuts in strategic nuclear weapons  a comprehensive test-ban treaty  a ban on chemical weapons and the elimination of asymmetries with a view to establishing a balance of forces on a lower level of conventional armaments. This is particularly important in Europe  where the concentration of weapons is the largest and the most threatening to peace and stability.Disarmament and arms control is a matter of global concern. The United Nations has an important role to play in encouraging  supporting and supplementing disarmament negotiations conducted in other forums - multilateral  regional and bilateral.An encouraging feature in today's improved international atmosphere is the willingness to address serious regional conflicts in a new and constructive manner. We welcome the fact that the various parties are increasingly making use of the good offices of the Secretary-General  thus allowing the world Organization to serve as a real catalyst for progress towards a more peaceful  just and safer world.I should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General. Years of patience and hard work are now paying dividends. Stalemate and setbacks are giving way to meetings of minds and to progress. We have witnessed this new attitude in the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan  in the success in bringing about a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war and in the progress towards peaceful solutions in the Western Sahara  Kampuchea and Namibia.In other areas of conflict  progress is desperately needed. We welcomed the Esquipulas Agreement of last year. Expectations were high that the five Central American Presidents would themselves  find solutions to the problems of that troubled region. The present stalemate is  however  severely prolonging the plight of the peoples of Central America. We urge the parties to return to negotiations and to continue the implementation of the peace plan.In the Middle East the state of chronic unrest in the Israeli-occupied territories underscores the need for Israelis and Arabs to make genuine and determined efforts aimed at achieving a lasting and comprehensive peace. The Norwegian Government supports the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations. We believe that such a conference  with the participation of all parties directly concerned  represents the best way to achieve a negotiated settlement. Meanwhile  Israel has a special obligation under international law to protect the civilian population in the occupied territories and to secure their human rights.In South Africa the apartheid system is still being upheld in defiance 06 basic principles of civilization. The apartheid system must - and will - come to an end. Apartheid  representing institutionalized racism  cannot be reformed: it must be abolished. International pressure on South Africa must be increased  Ten years have passed since the United Nations was able to agree on limited mandatory sanctions against the Government in Pretoria. Now we need to move towards the adoption of comprehensive and effective sanctions  and we need to move now.We are encouraged by the Secretary-General's optimism concerning the improved prospects for the independence of Namibia. We welcome the news that an advance team can now be sent to Namibia to prepare for a United Nations military and civilian presence in the Territory as it assumes its rightful role and place amongst the sovereign and independent nations of the world. Norway will stand firmly by its commitment to participate in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group.The system of apartheid  wars and natural catastrophes in southern Africa have produced millions of refugees and displaced persons. An international conference held in Oslo last month focused on the situation for those unfortunate and deprived people. The conference stressed in particular the need to cater for displaced per sons  who at present fall outside the responsibility of United Nations agencies. It also underlined the need for emergency programmes  contingency plans and early-warning systems. We must all support the programme of action adopted at that conference.It is a paradox that at a time when the political climate in the United Nations has improved considerably the Organization should be threatened with financial bankruptcy. The financial crisis facing the United Nations is unacceptable from every point of view. It impedes planning it creates a bad climate for the implementation of reforms and it undermines the morale of the staff of the Organization. Unilateral withholding of contributions undermines multilateral co-operation. All Member States must respect the United Nations Charter and meet their financial obligations. We urge all countries to settle all their debts promptly.We are living in an era of rapid change. In general terms the peoples of the industrialized countries have experienced a rapid improvement in their living conditions. For the developing countries this is not so. While the 1980s may be a decade marked by real progress in respect of international peace and security  the decade is one of lost opportunities for the third world. Very little has been done to prevent the gap between 'Â¿he rich and the poor countries from widening. As we approach the turn of the millennium  we face the major challenge of overcoming the global development crisis. We must launch a victorious battle against the poverty that continues to tie hundreds of millions of people to an existence that cannot be reconciled with human dignity.Stability  prosperity and social and economic justice are coming to different parts of the world at different speeds. Corrective action needs to be taken. The challenge that confronts us is ethical as well as political. We can safeguard the future only by working together; we cannot safeguard it at each other's expense. The future will depend on how successful we are in adopting common attitudes towards our common challenges.Most of the developing countries are witnessing a reversal of the earlier were hopeful trends in growth performance. A sharp deterioration in the international economic environment has played a major role in triggering the acute crisis which now afflicts the third world. This was clearly established once again during the mid-term review of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990 conducted here in New York over the past two weeks.The critical economic situation for the developing world is characterized by unsustainable  crushing burdens of external debt; a substantial decline in export earnings due to severely depressed commodity prices and to increasing protectionism a significant decline in flows of resource transfers  in particular with regard to private lending and investment; and the chronic instability of the international currency market; as well as abnormally high real interest rates.Is it not politically  morally and economically perverse that there has been a net transfer of resources from poor countries to rich countries totalling over $100 billion in the past few years? Is it not appalling that while close to a billion people are living in poverty and squalor  the per capita income of some 50 developing countries declined last year?These trends will have to be reversed  not only because the situation in itself is unacceptable  but also because it is in the self-interest of all developed countries - West and East. There is a need for a fresh start in international development co-operation. Development aid and lending must be increased. I emphasize this  and I see no reason to conceal the fact that while Norway in recent years has given around 1.1 per cent of its gross national product (GNP) in official development assistance (ODA) to developing countries  we are disappointed that at the same time the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average has declined to a meagre 0.34 per cent. Clearly  many countries can and must do better  much better. We call on those donor countries which have been lagging behind in their transfers to make renewed efforts commensurate with their abilities. There is a need for a double-track approach: the development and the debt crisis have to be urgently and effectively addressed. The two are interlinked and they are equally acute. Many countries are caught in the vicious circle of having to service  reschedule and refinance their external debt while necessary investments and reforms are being suffocated. Urgent action is now needed to alleviate the debt burden in ways that represent a fairer burden-sharing between debtors and lenders. Norway has taken concrete steps to alleviate debt  and strongly advocates further multilateral co-ordinated debt-relief measures.It is obvious that the heavily indebted low-income countries will never be able to repay their debts. We must fully recognize this and deal with it accordingly. We cannot continue to maintain iron codes that carry with them the risk of political destabilization and increased suffering for the most vulnerable groups  codes that negatively affect women and children  block the development of human progress and human resources  curtail investment and innovation and make it virtually impossible for many debtor countries ever to assume their rightful place in the international economy.The decisions taken at the Toronto economic summit brought some new hope that the major economic Powers are willing to act upon these issues. Although they have recently agreed on some further steps  in particular with regard to Africa  much remains to be done by the large industrial countries to alleviate the debt problem.The recent proposals by the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are steps towards a real solution of the debt crisis  which is indeed a common crisis - both for the North and for the South.The industrialized countries of the North must now demonstrate that they see the poverty of the third world as their common challenge. We need a more equitable world order based on common responsibility  on mutual respect and solidarity  and on the fundamental principles of human rights. The protection of human rights is a matter of priority concern for the Norwegian Government. To work for human rights is to work for democracy  development  solidarity and progress. Unfortunately  systematic and persistent violations of human rights still occur in many countries. We must work tirelessly to counter these violations and to strengthen the instruments of implementation that we have created. This year we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It gives us an opportunity to reconfirm our obligations and to redouble our efforts to upgrade our civilization.The world's population may double by the middle of the next century. It is clear that meeting the needs of present and future generations will require forceful  sustainable economic growth supported by a world-wide campaign to protect the environment and our natural resources. In the 1970s  environment and development were seen by many as plainly contradictory. At that time  environmental concerns were considered as something only the rich could afford. Today they are concerns no one can afford to ignore.The time has come to start this process of change that is needed. We need a new sense of mission and we need a vision of a better future. We need a common framework and concepts that can unite us.The threats to the ozone layer have opened even more eyes to the fact that no single country can protect its environment in isolation. Global problems require global solutions. The Montreal Protocol of last year needs to be followed by further agreements on measures to protect the atmosphere.The problem of dealing with hazardous and nuclear wastes and recent cases of dumping in the third world clearly show that a strict international regime is required also to protect the developing countries from becoming a dumping ground for industrial excesses in the North.In the ongoing negotiations led by the United Nations Environment Programme the developed countries must now sensitise themselves towards the just demands of the developing countries with a view to adopting a global consensus early next year.At the Oslo Conference in July this year  the Heads of 22 United Nations agencies discussed the follow-up of the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. They agreed with the Commission that to achieve sustainable development  environment and development policies must preserve peace  secure growth on a sustainable basis and alleviate poverty.At last year's session of the General Assembly  the proposal was put forward to hold a global follow-up conference in 1992. Norway supports the proposal to hold such a conference  which should focus on the broad issues of sustainable development. One hundred years ago the Norwegian writer Henrik Ibsen said: ""Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come."" Sustainable development is such an idea Together we must make it a reality.Humankind is exposed to risks - political and economic risks - and we are becoming increasingly aware that we run the risk of an ecological disaster comparable in scale and impact to large-scale nuclear destruction. The next decade will be crucial. Vital and difficult decisions will have to be taken. We have the capacity to destroy life on this planet  but we also have the capacity to save and to enhance it. To achieve the necessary changes we need a stronger commitment to the international institutions we have created. We need a coalition of reason and a real co-ordination of policies. The Secretary-General of the United Nations must have our firm support. He must be accorded the authority and the resources necessary to promote the basic objectives for our own survivals peace  development and environment."
"106",5280,"NPL",43,1988,"ï»¿Mr. President  I have the honour to convey to you and  through you  to this assemblage of representatives greetings from my august sovereign. His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev  and his best wishes for the success of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.On behalf of the Nepalese delegation and on my own behalf  I congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Your election is as much a reflection of the high esteem that the Argentine Republic enjoys in the international community as it is of your well-known diplomatic skill and dynamism. My delegation feels confident that under your guidance the Assembly will achieve its goals.On this occasion I should like to express my delegation's deep appreciation to Mr. Peter Florin  Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic  for the exemplary manner in which he guided the fifteenth special session of the General Assembly as well as the regular and resumed meetings of the forty-second session of the General Assembly.I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to pay a richly deserved tribute to the Secretary General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his admirable endeavours in promoting the cause of international peace and co-operation in general  and  in particular  to congratulate him on the award of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. After years of frustration we meet today in an atmosphere of renewed hope. The restoration of peace on several fronts  as has been understood so well in the report 'of the Secretary-General  has been a source of satisfaction and encouragement to all. At a time when the United Nations is emerging as an effective instrument for peace we find it somewhat ironic that it should be subjected to financial commitment. It is our fervent hope that peace will be given a chance  while welcoming recent moves in some quarters to meet their financial commitments the United Nations  we urge all Member States to rise to the occasion by underwriting the costs involved in the ongoing and future peace-making and peace-keeping operations of the United Nations.As a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement  which has all along been working for the reduction of cold war tension  Nepal is naturally happy to note the recent signs of improvement in East-West relations  particularly those of the two super-Powers. Its ripple effects have wafted across the wide international horizon. The most visible manifestation of this change was reflected in the signing and ratification of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty.Nepal warmly welcomed this disarmament agreement as a landmark of historic dimensions  aimed as it is at the elimination of an entire category of nuclear missiles. We are hopeful that this will pave the way for serious negotiations and the early conclusion of an agreement on a 50 per cent reduction in their arsenals of strategic  offensive arms. Given the latest technological advances and innovative verification median isms incorporated in the INP Treaty and  more important  a continued climate of mutual respect and trust between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  we believe that such a disarmament objective is attainable. Like other Member States  Nepal attaches the highest urgency to nuclear disarmament concerning as it does the very survival of humankind. At the same tine  given the all-too-frequent resort to conventional warfare and the ever increasing destructive capacity of conventional weaponry  Nepal can hardly overlook or minimize the importance of conventional disarmament. My delegation is concern Ï over the repeated use of chemical weapons in recent years and joins with other countries in calling for the complete and effective prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of chemical weapons  and their destruction.Nepal shared the disappointment of the majority of Member States when the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  which convened here this summer  could not adopt a consensus document. There was solace  however  in the fact that it could generate an enhanced understanding of the triangular relationship between disarmament  security and development.Appreciation of such a relationship  indeed  lies at the very core of Nepal's long-standing policy of support for initiatives that seek to promote disarmament through the establishment of nuclear-free zones and zones of peace  whether they relate to the Indian Ocean or the South Atlantic  the Mediterranean or South-East Asia  the South Pacific or the continents of Africa and Latin America.The concept of an intimate linkage between peace and development and its corollary - that a durable peace is a prerequisite for meaningful development - is the foundation on which rests His Majesty Ring Birendra's proposal that Nepal be declared a zone of peace. I should add that the peace proposal is an effort on our part to give practical expression to the basic ideals of the United Nations and the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement. In this context  I am pleased to disclose that 97 Member States have thus far extended their valuable support  for which I once again express my deep appreciation. Similarly; it gives me great satisfaction to inform the Assembly that consequent upon a mandate from the forty-second session of the General Assembly  the United Nations Centre for Disarmament in Asla has been set up in our capital  Kathmandu. His Majesty's Government has extended all possible co-operation towards its establishment and hopes it will receive active support from interested countries and non-governmental organizations.I have referred briefly to some positive developments with regard to the present international political climate. Among them must be mentioned  of course  the very welcome cease-fire and ongoing peace negotiations between Iran and Iraq following their acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). I assure the Secretary-General  and his Personal Representative  Mr. Jan K. Eliasson of Sweden  of the continued support and co-operation of Nepal in the Security Council in the urgent task of the speedy restoration of a lasting peace in the Gulf.Since December last year  we have watched the developments in the Middle East with increased anxiety. These have created new political realities on the ground and completely altered a 21-year occupation imposed by military might. This has only reinforced our view on the desirability of convening an international conference on peace in the Middle East. The three essential elements of a durable peace in the Middle East  in our view  are a recognition of the right to an independent homeland for the Palestinian people  whose sole  legitimate representative is the Palestine Liberation OrganizationÂ·  the withdrawal by Israel from territories occupied since 1967; and recognition of the right of all States in the region  including Israel  to exist within secure  internationally recognized borders.Another area in the Middle East that has been caught in an endless cycle of violence and strife is Lebanon  which has been the unfortunate focus of competing foreign and sectarian interests for more than a decade. While recent events in Lebanon have increased our concern  Nepal is proud to be making a small contribution to the cause of peace in the southern part of the country by participation in United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) operations. Ðs a country that yearns to be universally recognized as a zone of peace  Nepal will naturally continue to endorse any proposal that ensures Lebanese sovereignty over all Lebanese territory and secures not only the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon but also acceptance by all concerned of commitment to non-interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.Nepal was encouraged by the recent meeting in Geneva between the Cypriot leaders  under the auspices of the Secretary-General  which led to peace talks in Nicosia last month on all aspects of the unification of Cyprus  under the auspices of Mr. Oscar Camilllon  the Special Representative of the Secretary-General. I take this opportunity to reaffirm Nepal's strong support for an independent  non-aligned  federal and bi-communal Cyprus.Nepal warmly welcomed the signing in Geneva on 14 April 1988 of the Accords on ending the conflict in Afghanistan. Admittedly  the process envisaged in the Geneva Accords has yet to be completed and some uncertainties remain. Nepal is nevertheless heartened by the fact that the foreign military presence is withdrawing  thus preparing the way for the voluntary return of millions of Afghan refugees from Pakistan and Iran in conditions of peace and security for the region and beyond. Nepal has also been encouraged that such a turnabout has taken place thanks to the painstaking efforts  over six years  of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative  Mr. Diego Cordovez. It was a matter of considerable pride and honour for Nepal to be invited to participate in the United Nations Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNGDMAP) set up to monitor the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan.Nepal has been following with considerable interest recent developments with regard to the situation in Kampuchea  including the Jakarta Informal Meeting held at Bogor  Indonesia  from 25 to 28 July 1988. We have also taken note of recent high-level talks between China and the Soviet Union on the situation in Kampuchea and the initiative of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries before  during and after the Bogor talks. While Nepal notes that some progress has been made  we remain convinced that a peaceful settlement of the Kampuchean problem requires  first and foremost  the unconditional withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea and the full and free exercise by the Kampuchean people of their right to determine their own future.The situation in the divided Korean peninsula still remains potentially explosive. Nepal is greatly pleased that the Seoul Olympic Games have been brought to a successful conclusion on an overall; note of sportsmanship and harmony between participating countries and athletes. It has observed and welcomed endeavours for broadening ties and contacts and initiating dialogue between the two Koreas. It thus remains Nepal's hope that the Korean people will address the important question of reunification with their age-old wisdom and customary ingenuity  without outside interference. Auspicious harbingers or change have been discernible in Africa in the recent past. Among those that Nepal views as positive end hopeful are the efforts of the Organization of African Unity and the quadripartite negotiations can Angola and Namibia. The recent visit of the Secretary-General to Pretoria has paved the way for the dispatch of a United Nations technical team to Namibia to prepare for the emplacement of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group and has given rise to hope that South Africa may actually begin the Implementation of Security Cornell resolution 435 (1978)  which it accepted in principle 10 years ago. Nepal would be honoured to co-operate in any Security Council endeavour to implement its resolutions on Namibia particularly resolution 435 (1978)  if such a Council meeting were convened during Nepal's current tenure of non-permanent membership of the Security Council. On this occasion I should like to place on record Nepal's recognition of the contributions to Namibian independence made by the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)In South Africa  despite the clearly and repeatedly expressed will of the international community  the racist regime tenaciously clings to its abhorrent system of apartheid. As the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa and the anti-apartheid movement worldwide gain new momentum every day  there are welcome signs that a growing segment of South Africa's white community is increasingly beginning to see the writing on the wall. Nepal remains convinced that comprehensive and mandatory economic: sanctions  under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter  represent the most effective and peaceful instrument for dismantling the apartheid regime and installing a truly representative  multiracial society in South Africa. A note of optimism is also in order# we believe  with respect to the conflict over Western Sahara following acceptance by parties to the conflict of proposals for a peaceful settlement put forward by the Secretary-General and the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity. Nepal was privileged to have joined in the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 621 (1938) authorizing the Secretary-General to appoint a special representative on Western Sahara.Last year from this rostrum I welcomed the Central American peace plan signed by the five Central American Presidents on 7 August 1987  based & that document greatly was on a commitment to strict observance of the principles of non-interference and non-intervention by all States with concerns and contacts in the region. That being so  it is only natural for us to be disappointed at the lack of substantial progress in the consolidation of peace in Central America since then. Nepal appeals to all concerned Governments to continue to demonstrate political will in favour of peace and commends those which have already fulfilled their commitments as enumerated in the Central American peace plan.This year we have witnessed a tragic number of natural disasters and calamities that have struck various parts of the globe  including our region of South Asia. Coming as this does when broad global environmental concerns such as those relating to the depletion of the ozone layer and the increase in the greenhouse effect  among others  have spurred calls for a comprehensive study on climate and man's environment  my country welcomes the inclusion of the item entitled ""Conservation of climate as part of the common heritage of mankind"" in the agenda of this General Assembly session. As the Himalayas in Nepal constitute a very important climatic determinant for much of South and Central Asia  we would certainly co-operate in any regional or international effort aimed at a better understanding of the crucial  if often fragile  linkage between roan and the biosphere of environment in our part of the world. A further matter of grave concern is the prolonged crisis in the international economic system and its adverse effect on the economies of the developing countries and the sharp decline in the general level of international economic assistance. This phenomenon  we have long maintained  has its origins in the structural inequities and imbalances in the present international economic order. It has been exacerbated by the anti-inflationary policies pursued by sons developed countries  adversely affecting the prices of and demand for products from the developing world  including commodities and oil. While industrial market economies appear to be progressing through the longest period of prosperity since the Second World War  this has coincided with the most prolonged and severe structural development crisis in the developing countries. As a consequence  over the past 10 years many developing countries have experienced stagnant or declining growth rates  in stark contrast to the goal of a 7 per cent growth rate set in the International Development Strategy. It is also quite contrary to the targets and objectives of the United Nations Substantial New Programme of Action for the 19e0s for the least developed countries  into which category ray country falls. Nepal is concerned at the deteriorating external debt situation of many developing countries. That is a cause of grave economic and political anxiety  severely threatening as it does their very political stability. Ws believe that a lasting and mutually acceptable solution of the current external debt of developing countries is feasible only through an integrated growth-oriented strategy. In this context  we hold that debt rescheduling merely postpones the problem of indebtedness. Hence  in addition to reducing debt .repayment  whenever possible  we believe that a substantial portion of such debts of the least developed countries should be written off. Nepal also supports the call made in Geneva last month by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for commercial banks to reduce by 30 per cent debts owed by developing countries.What is clear  in any case  is the urgency of the revitalisation of the stalled North-South dialogue  based on a shared and enlightened community of interest. We therefore endorse the Economic and Social Council's recommendation to the forty-third session of the General Assembly to call a special session of the Assembly in 1990 to examine ways of a maintaining sustained growth in the world economy. Such a special session  we maintain  would not only assist in solving the problems facing the world economy but also help to improve the overall climate of international economic co-operation. Similarly  we support the Economic and Social Council's call for chalking out an international development Strategy for the fourth United Nations decade  from 1991 to 2000.Over the years  Nepal has sought and welcomed assistance from friendly countries and development agencies to complement its own efforts to ensure planned economic development. In this context  Nepal is deeply grateful to Japan not only for its recent decision to convert official loans into grants but also for its long association as a major partner in Nepal's development efforts. On this occasion  I should like to express again the appreciation of His Majesty's Government of Nepal for the sympathy and the timely and generous support extended by friendly countries and non-governmental organizations in the aftermath of the severe earthquake that struck eastern Nepal in the early hours of 21 August 1988.Development assistance is welcomed across the spectrum of planned development activities in Nepal  international assistance is especially invited for the exploitation of Nepal's well-known potential in water resources and for the expansion of its own determined and urgent - but necessarily limited - forestation endeavours. Besides helping Nepal to meet the chronic fuel and energy needs of its rising population  such assistance would  we sincerely believe  also have a profound and salutary impact in preventing further ecological degradation of the Himalayan foothills.We have long held that the annual flooding of the plains that stretch from the foothills of the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal - of which the recent devastating floods in Bangladesh were such a stark example - is inextricably linked to  among other factors  the denudation of those once verdant and densely forested hillsides. One direct by-product has been thisÂ·  every year  from Nepal alone  an estimated 250 million cubic metres of precious topsoil is washed away into the Bay of Bengal. On this occasion X should like to recall and reiterate the proposal made by His Majesty Ring Birendra as far back as 1977 indicating Nepal's readiness to co-operate with all countries in its region in any joint ventures to marshal and exploit its water resources for the common good of the region. Such benefits could be realized in the area of flood control and regulation  in the production of new and renewable sources of energy and in the provision of additional navigation and irrigation facilities  including those of my landlocked country. As a least developed country  Nepal finds it most disturbing that in today's unfavourable economic situation there should be a general decline in official development assistance (ODA) including that to the least developed countries. In this context we regret that the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product called for in the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade and the ODA target for the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the least developed countries remains unfulfilled.The full and timely implementation of the Substantial New Programme of Action is of vital importance for Nepal which is making serious efforts to ensure that our people's minimum basic needs for food   grains  clothing  fuel  wood  drinking  water  primary health care and sanitation  primary and skill-oriented education and minimum rural transport facilities are met before the turn of the century. Under the dynamic and forward-looking leadership of His Majesty King Birendra of Nepal has for many years been engaged in an all-out war on poverty and - underdevelopment. This is a battle that is being waged against such formidable foes as the legacy of a century-long period of isolation a rapidly expanding population and a difficult topography within the confines of a landlocked configurationI wish to record ray country's commitment to the eradication of the social cancer of drug abuse and illicit trafficking. In that regard# I should like also to recall that Nepal has been co-operating with its South Asian neighbours within the framework of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC).With respect to another scourge of our times - terrorism - I am pleased to inform the Assembly of the signing at the third SAARC summit in Katmandu last November of the SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism. I am also pleased to confirm that the cause of regional co-operation in South Asia has been further boosted since last addressed the General Assembly. Agreement on the establishment of the South Asian Food Reserve and the declaration of the SAARC member countries on initiating the process of dealing with the causes and consequences of natural disasters can be cited as two positive examples in that context. My delegation has every reason to believe that  given the grave dimension of the natural calamity that struck our friendly neighbour Bangladesh last August  the next SAARC summit - scheduled for December at Islamabad  Pakistan - will provide further momentum and urgency for such a study.In conclusion  I take this opportunity to reaffirm our steadfast adherence to the principles and purposes of the United Nations - a commitment that is enshrined in the Directive Principles of the Constitution of Nepal. Similarly  I wish to express again Nepal's continuing support for the Non-Aligned Movement.Nepal is convinced that the United Nations Charter provides the most universally accepted legal framework for conducting international relations. If recent developments have tended to rekindle new hopes in the future of the United Nations  the materialization of those hopes will largely depend on the active support of Member States for the principles of the world order to which the United Nations is committed. In our view  the continued credibility of the United Nations will also depend  in our dangerous nuclear age  on how effective the United Nations can be as an instrument of multilateral diplomacy at the preventive level.Since January Nepal has had the great honour of sharing in some of the responsibilities of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security  by virtue of its non-permanent membership of the Security Council. I should like to assure the Assembly that Nepal will continue to uphold the cherished values and ideals of the United Nations Charter in the discharge of its duties in that principal United Nations organ. Nepal will  naturally  be extending its unstinting support and co-operation to you  Mr  President  for the success of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. As in the past  Nepal will continue to join in any concerted endeavour that is aimed at the realization of the noble objectives of this world Organization  convinced as it is that the United Nations remains not only an accurate mirror of an ever-changing world but also the most effective international agent for affecting timely  peaceful and meaningful change."
"107",5344,"NZL",43,1988,"ï»¿Sir  I congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this forty-third session of the General Assembly. I say  with the benefit of my personal acquaintance with you  that it is an honour that you truly deserve. This Assembly is in good hands as it begins to tackle the work on its agenda. This forty-third session of the General Assembly carries more than the usual sense of occasion. I am not alone in detecting here a feeling of purpose and o  achievement that has not always been evident in recent years. I take great satisfaction in being able to address the Assembly at a time when the standing of the United Nations is higher than it has been for some time. Even the fountain works. The mood has changed distinctly since the fortieth commemorative session  because  despite the difficulties and uncertainties it has faced  the Organization has pursued its diverse agenda while tackling a major programme of administrative reform. The record in recent times has been one of solid achievement.The changing international climate has helped this process. In this Hall on Monday  President Reagan in his valedictory address spoke to us of his satisfaction at the movement towards a more constructive relationship between his country and the Soviet Union. Foreign Minister Shevardnadze pursued the same theme. In certain regions of the world there has been welcome progress in resolving conflicts that had been festering for some timeâ Many of the signs are favourable.That will be a matter of particular satisfaction to the smaller members of the international community  including my own country. We have always attached importance to the principle that the collective effort of that community should above all be applied to the task of keeping the peace. That was the central purpose of those who founded the Organization. Today it remains a goal of no less importance. Thus far 1988 has been a year of significant peacemaking  from which the world can take heart and upon which it can build. As one who stood here to address the fortieth anniversary session  I am pleased that we are now seeing renewed recognition of the value of the role and achievements of the United Nations.Recent developments have highlighted the continuing value of this Organization's efforts in the settlement of international conflict. The accords reached on Afghanistan and the cease-fire in the devastating Gulf War required the co-operation of those directly involved. But a particular tribute must go to the dedication of the Secretary-General. The people who ate saved from further threat or have the hope of peace are indebted to his patience  skill  perseverance and unquenchable optimism. We welcome the role he has played.There are other situations that still need the resources the United Nations can offer by way of mediation or assistance with peacemaking. Western Sahara  Namibia  Cyprus and Cambodia are all affected by unresolved conflicts. But even here the auguries are promising.In this age regional tensions cannot be isolated from the mainstream of international life. There are dangers for all of us in conflict wherever it occurs. It follows that we share a responsibility to do all that we can to eliminate the conditions in which conflict breeds and to restore the peace if it is broken. At times the principle of collective security has commanded more support than the practice. I hope the success of current peace-keeping efforts under United Nations auspices will reinvigorate the principle of collective security and lead to its wider application.My Government pledged last year to expand our practical contribution to the United Nations peace-keeping efforts. I am pleased that we have been able to give effect to that undertaking. Our existing commitment to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization has been maintained. In the past month we were pleased to be able to respond to the Secretary-General's request for a contribution to the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG). A contingent of New Zealand army officers was deployed to UNIIMOG following the cease-fire. Earlier this week a Royal New Zealand Air Force Andover transport aircraft with flight crews and maintenance personnel left New Zealand to become an important national contribution to UNIIMOG's air capacity. We stand ready to assist in a practical way if  as we hope  solutions are found to other long-standing conflicts.I have already welcomed the signing of the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan. Noteworthy as they were  the Accords did not put a final end to the conflict in Afghanistan nor did they bring into being a fully representative government enjoying the confidence of the people of Afghanistan. New Zealand hopes that the withdrawal of the remaining Soviet forces will be accompanied by real progress in addressing those unresolved problems. As Mr. Shevardnadze said:""The Geneva Accords"" [should be] ""the first step in a chain reaction leading to a healthier world."" (A/43/PV.6  p. 66)The values of tolerance and respect for the dignity and worth of human beings can be seen by us all in the current Olympic Games. They are a sign of that healthier world and we congratulate the Republic of Korea on its role as host. But it is a matter for regret that divisiveness has persisted on the Korean peninsula for so long. We look for an easing of tensions and an improvement in relations between the Koreas.Cambodia  too  has been a tragic source of international tension for many years. That impasse has come to seem rather less intractable during 1988. In each of the past nine years  this Assembly has rightly emphasized Vietnam's violation of the Charter of the United Nations by its invasion and occupation of Cambodia. That remains a fundamental issue.But we must insist also on a settlement there which will prevent a return to power by the Khmer Rouge. The international community was slow to accept the evidence of genocide committed by the Pol Pot Government and we have had to deal with the consequences ever since. We have a responsibility to ensure that such atrocities are never again committed against the peoples of Cambodia. Harrowing images of mass persecution  unfortunately not confined to a single country or continent  remain fresh in our memories as we commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Much has nevertheless been achieved in the intervening years. But it cannot be denied that gross and massive abuses of human rights continue.The problem of human rights is more and more the focus of the attention of the Members of the United Nations. All of us are bound to speak up and  if we do not  we bear a responsibility for continuing and future evils. The authority of this Organization as it deals with human rights must rest on a commitment by all to objectivity. South Africa's system of apartheid is an abuse in a category of its own. Events of the last year have shown the South African Government clinging tenaciously to its course  in spite of the international community's abhorrence of its apartheid policies.It has so far spurned all the voices of reason and moderation. Nelson Mandela  the most respected leader in South Africa  remains incarcerated. The Sharpeville Six are still under sentence of death. The intercessions of the Security Council have been ignored. The country lives in a continuing state of emergency; it experiences increasing repression. The South African response to protests from neighbouring States is to make repeated terrorist attacks on them and to undermine their economic stability - all totally unacceptable.New Zealand has implemented wide-ranging sanctions against South Africa. We believe that such sanctions are an effective means of changing the attitude of the white minority. New Zealand is ready to implement further measures. Our goal is non-violent progress to a non-racial  democratic and just society in South Africa.There has been an encouraging movement recently towards peace in Angola. In Namibia  the United Nations has faced an enormous task. At last Î± settlement there appears tantalizingly close. We trust that Namibia's independence can be secured peacefully and soon in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). That would present a further major achievement in the work of the United Nations on decolonization.On the initiative of the seven South Pacific member countries of the United Nations  New Caledonia was re-inscribed in 1986 on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories  thus invoking a United Nations responsibility for the future of the progress of the Territory to self-determination. The tragic events at Ouvea in New Caledonia earlier this year demonstrated the consequences of ignoring United Nations principles and also the aspirations of a major communal group. New Zealand therefore welcomed the decision in June by the new Prime Minister of France and the leaders of the loyalist and independence movements in New Caledonia to move together on a plan for political development. That plan rightly takes account of the interests of all genuine New Caledonians.That development was recognized last month by the Special Committee on Decolonization in a resolution which was adopted by consensus and has since been endorsed by the South Pacific Forum at its annual meeting last week. No one should underestimate the difficulties that may lie ahead  but everything is looking better. We look forward to a free and genuine act of self-determination in New Caledonia which is consistent with United Nations principles and leads to a settlement safeguarding the rights of all New Caledonians  including the indigenous Kanak people. Some argue that while the United Nations has a vital role in dealing with regional issues of the kind I have mentioned  the scope for its involvement in the balance between the super-Powers is a limited one. I do not accept that. We have seen how the super-Powers inevitably become involved in the troubles of the world's regions. Equally  issues of disarmament - including those which vitally involve the super-Powers cannot be considered as anything but questions involving all members of the international community for we are all affected  by choice or otherwise.The issue of nuclear disarmament has taken on new urgency. Nuclear weapons technology no longer remains the exclusive preserve of the five permanent Members of the Security Council. The capacity to build a nuclear weapon is now possessed by a larger number of countries  and soon even more will have it. There are indications that some of those countries have nuclear ambitions. Whatever their motivation  such ambitions have to be curtailed.There is a real risk here. Regional conflicts  and their tendency to attract external intervention  are dangerous enough as it is. But the prospect of nuclear weapons being deployed in such situations must now be taken into account. In that event  the dangers we would all face would be appalling.This is an added reason why the efforts of the United States and the Soviet Union to agree on further reductions in their nuclear arsenals are so important. What prospect is there of blocking the spread of nuclear weapons if these two nations cannot stop their relentless drive to develop and deploy new nuclear weaponry? In the course of last year's general debate  New Zealand applauded the United States and the Soviet Union for their decision to eliminate their land-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles. The resulting treaty is now for the first time leading to a real reduction in the world's stock of nuclear weapons. With an agreement in the strategic arms reduction talks  the super-Powers would truly have shown the way to the other nuclear weapons States and those which have nuclear ambitions. It is not too much to hope that a corner would be turned and the threat of vertical and horizontal proliferation would no longer hang over us all. New Zealand believes that achieving reductions and balances in conventional forces will be central  in the search for nuclear disarmament  to the nuclear-free world seen by President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev at Reykjavik. In Europe and many other parts of the globe the accumulation of conventional forces  often without regard to actual defensive requirements  has heightened tensions and led some to look for other mote dangerous means of deterring aggression; so the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament must take place in step  and must involve all States.Yet  at the third United Nations special session devoted to disarmament  when we had an opportunity to set up a multilateral disarmament agenda to take us up to the beginning of the next century  we could not take advantage of it. But our failure then does not mean it cannot be done. Instead we have the task now  beginning at this session of the Assembly  to pick up where the special session left off.Rather than confess disappointment at the special session's results  or conclude that the job is too difficult  we must try all the harder to broaden the areas of international agreement. The search for consensus on the prevention of an arms race in outer space must go on. The campaign must continue unabated to convince those few remaining States which yet doubt it that a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is an essential measure to end the proliferation of nuclear weapons.The world community must at last bring to conclusion the negotiations on a comprehensive chemical-weapons convention. The Secretary-General has been called on time and time again to investigate allegations of chemical weapons use. He should never again have to issue a finding confirming such a charge. These hideous weapons must be outlawed once and for all  so that the world will never again be a horrified witness to chemical warfare. The main elements of a multilateral agreement have now been elaborated by the Conference on Disarmament. It is time to finish the job.New Zealand has taken substantial disarmament initiatives. We are proud to have been part of the regional drive to create the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone  a significant multilateral arms-control measure.The Treaty of Rarotonga makes a decisive contribution to the stability of the region. The majority of South Pacific Forum members have become parties to the agreement. Two of the nuclear Powers  the Soviet Union and China  have ratified the protocols to the Treaty. We look to the other nuclear Powers to do the same. The Treaty covers a wide area of the region  bordering the Latin American nuclear-weapon-free zone to the east  and the demilitarised Antarctica to the south. We support ongoing co-operation with the Latin American patties to the Treaty of Tlatelolco so that we can each benefit from our mutual experience.For nearly 30 years the Antarctic Treaty and its associated instruments have provided the framework for effective and peaceful co-operation in Antarctica  keeping that vast area free of all military activities. The Treaty  which is open to all States  has been the basis for a unique programme of scientific research and for the adoption of measures to protect the fragile environment.A further element was added to the treaty system with the adoption in June this year of the Convention on the regulation of Antarctic mineral resource activities. New Zealand was pleased to host the final session of the negotiation. The Convention provides a strong mechanism for protecting the Antarctic environment if mineral resource activities ever take place. It is a significant strengthening of international co-operation under the Antarctic Treaty. A peaceful Antarctica is of the highest importance for New Zealand. We look for a consensus at this session of the Assembly to preserve the Antarctic Treaty. New Zealand is strongly opposed to any efforts to undermine it.The world economy offers us little cause for satisfaction or confidence. Trade growth is uncertain. The economic difficulties facing many developing countries seem almost intractable. Indebtedness and underdevelopment are threats to global economic stability. Much is at stake for developed and developing countries alike in the present round of multilateral trade negotiations. New Zealand calls on all member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to go to the forthcoming mid-term review in Montreal in a positive mood  determined to achieve real progress.New Zealand places special important on achieving from the Uruguay Round a liberalization of world agricultural trade and the elimination of domestic and international policies which distort such trade. There would be no better single way of solving the menacing problems of indebtedness and underdevelopment of which I have spoken.There have been significant moves recently towards regional free-trade areas  including an agreement between New Zealand and Australia to establish a single trans-Tasman market by 1990. It is vital  however  that the international community should continue at the same time to move along the road to an open  market-oriented  multilateral trading system. We must look for strong leadership here from the major economies  which have a special responsibility to apply  fairly and across the board  the principles of comparative advantage and fair competition. Smaller countries like my own  dependent on primary production  require the reassurance that we will not continue to be subjected unreasonably to artificial restraints on trade. It is a paradox that the United Nations is demonstrating renewed vitality and relevance at a time when it faces major financial uncertainties. It is unacceptable that Member States should fail to carry out their legal obligations to contribute their assessed financial dues in good time.We must recognize  nevertheless  that constraints on available resources are likely to remain while at the same time the demands upon the Organization continue to grow. Accordingly  there is no choice but to maintain the worthwhile progress already achieved towards administrative reform; otherwise  the Organization will be incapable of meeting the critical challenges as they arise.I speak here as the representative of the Fourth New Zealand Labour Government. The First New Zealand Labour Government  and its Prime Minister Mr. Peter Fraser  played a deeply committed role in the discussions leading to the adoption of the Charter in 1945. New Zealand's hopes of those early days have been exceeded by some of the Organization's achievements - in its economic and social work  for example  and in its human rights and decolonization activities. By contrast  our high hopes for the United Nations peace-making and disarmament roles have yet to be fully realized  but we are optimistic that the log-jam has started to move in those areas.New Zealand continues to set high store on the work of the United Nations - particularly in its tasks of promoting world peace  preserving the global environment  combating world hunger  removing racial discrimination everywhere and creating equal opportunities for men and women throughout the world. We are determined to maintain New Zealand's strong support in the years ahead."
"108",5389,"OMN",43,1988,"ï»¿It is a pleasure for me  at the beginning of my statement  to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. My country's delegation is confident that the deliberations of the Assembly at this session will be crowned with success and  owing to his consummate skills  know-how and sagacity  will achieve the desired results. I also take this opportunity to commend his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic  who presided over the work of the previous session with distinction and skill. We have no doubt that Mr. Caputo will prove a worthy successor.A short time ago  the world lost one of its outstanding leaders. General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq  the late President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Although the loss of President Zia ul-Haq is a very great misfortune  we are confident that the new Pakistani leadership will play an important political role  in keeping with the high standing of the people of Pakistan at the regional and international levels.At the present session  the Sultanate of Oman would like once again to reaffirm its faith and confidence in the noble principles of the Charter of the United Nations  and to assert its conviction that the organs and institutions of the Organization have a constructive role to play in devising solutions to the problems and crises afflicting mankind. That conviction stems from its belief that dialogue and understanding among nations achieved within the fold of the United Nations is the best way of overcoming such problems and crises.The Nobel Peace Prize given to the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations this year is an expression of the world's recognition of the role of the United Nations in the context of peace and security. The award is a historic recognition of the role of the United Nations  and a sign of the international desire to emphasize the impetus towards world peace. We are truly overjoyed by this event  and congratulate everybody in the United Nations  but especially the officials who are working throughout the world to preserve peace and security.Among the purposes of the Charter are the establishment and maintenance of a climate of confidence and mutual understanding within the international community  the creation of normal  just and equitable relations among Governments  nations and peoples on the basis of dialogue and non-recourse to war as a means of resolving conflicts  and compliance with the principles of mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of others. The United Nations has the capacity and the means to achieve the purposes and give effect to the principles set out in the Charter.As members know  at the beginning of each of the last seven sessions of the General Assembly  in presenting ourselves here to participate in the work of the Assembly and to speak from this rostrum of the problems that beset international peace and security  we have begun our remarks by referring to the Iraq-Iran war as the regional problem that poses the greatest danger thereto. At the present session  from this rostrum  we extend our warmest congratulations to Iraq and Iran on the agreement they have reached for the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and to congratulate the international community on the success of its efforts to quell the flames of the longest and most dangerous regional conflict the world has witnessed since the Second World War. In this context  we can only express our overwhelming sense of relief and satisfaction at that outcome.We see it as our duty  moreover  to extend particular congratulations to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  on the positive and constructive role he has played  his tireless patience and his endurance under the psychological and moral burden of this problem until he was able to bring it to the threshold of peace. A success rarely matched in the history of the United Nations will thus be put on record to the credit of the Secretary-General. The role of the United Nations has undergone a diminution that has aroused the concern of all nations and peoples for the future of peace and security. What has been achieved in the Perez de Cuellar era  however  has restored confidence in the United Nations and in its peace-keeping role in the maintenance of security and stability. It has also added a new dimension to the credibility of the United Nations as a guardian of peace that allows all nations great and small to come together under its auspices and engage in dialogue with a view to achieving through its good offices  stability  reassurance and peace  in accordance with the Charter.Accordingly  we call for greater self-sacrifice in maintaining the new momentum in United Nations endeavours  for action to reinforce those endeavours and for support for the role of the Secretary-General and co-operation with him in his efforts to solve other regional problems. He has our gratitude and our support for the efforts he is making to bring about a more tranquil and peaceful world.The agreement reached on the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) in the Gulf region marks the beginning of a future brimming with hope  peace and prosperity. That would not have been possible without the courageous and judicious roles played by the leadership of both Iraq and Iran. The achievement brought about by resolution 598 (1987) will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the roost illuminating examples of the momentous acts that characterize great peoples and nations. We are hopeful that the agreement between Iraq and Iran will mark the conclusion of one era and the beginning of a long and all-embracing new era of peace and co-operation. The key elements of Omani policy include the alleviation of tensions in the region  promotion of factors conducive to security and stability and encouragement of all parties to build mutual trust  with a view to ending disputes and achieving peace based on good-neighbourliness and mutual respect for the interests of the peoples of the region. The steps already taken by Iraq and Iran give us confidence that their readiness to take positive steps towards the implementation of resolution 598 (1987) will endure. We gratefully salute the two countries for the patience and diligence they have shown  and pin our hopes on the flexibility and co-operation that they are demonstrating in the ongoing talks  which will help in the achievement of peace and security in the near future. Among the most important benefits of a lasting peace between those two countries are the reconstruction and development they will be able to achieve. The international community must therefore do everything in its power to support their efforts to rebuild and to restore an understanding that will have far-teaching effects in assuaging the bitterness left behind by the war between those two peoples. It must help them achieve the development and prosperity that will provide a firm foundation for a lasting peace.As one of the two States bordering on the Strait of Hormuz  ray country has a special interest in the regulation of navigation in the Strait we continue as in the past to play our role in regulating shipping in that important international waterway in conformity with provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the rules laid down by the International Maritime Organization. The Sultanate of Oman reaffirms its determination to continue to perform that role in a way that will enable shipping in the Strait to catty on unhindered and in peace in accordance with the relevant international regulations.The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and International Maritime Organization regulations accord equal rights to all coastal and land-locked States in the use of maritime straits  including the Strait of Hormuz  so long as that use is harmless and poses no threat to peace and security.Following the lessons relating to Gulf shipping that have been learnt from the Iraq-Iran war  and following the negative developments that accompanied that war  the United Nations should ensure that peace agreements in the Gulf include an appeal for respect for freedom of international navigation and for non-interference with shipping both in international and in regional waters  including in ports  harbours and maritime installations  in time of peace or in time of war  in accordance with international law and recognized norms and within a framework of collective action for international legitimacy. Such action would ensure that the treatment accorded to shipping in the Gulf during the war does not become an acceptable precedent in international law that could be applied in other regions.No discussion of navigation in the Gulf would be complete without reference to the foreign presence in the area. With respect to the growing dispute concerning the foreign naval presence  we should like to stress the importance of international co-operation in a framework of peace with a view to "" king the Gulf region a zone free of international conflicts. We also stress how important it is that all States should refrain from using the Gulf in ways that would increase tension or be prejudicial to the interests of any State bordering on the Gulf.We look forward to the day when we can speak here on the question of Palestine with a heart full of joy at the Palestinian people having achieved its aspirations: a day we hope is not far off. At this session  however  we are obliged to express our deep concern at Israel's continuing occupation of Arab and Palestinian territory and at its failure to respond positively to international peace offers that would enable the Palestinian people to exercise its rights and the Arab States to enjoy security and peace. Israel has rejected all international political initiatives aimed at achieving peaceful coexistence between it and its neighbours  and insists on perpetuating the state of belligerency in the region  just as it persists in its illegal occupation of Arab territories and its abasement of the Palestinian people by denying it the rights set out in the United Nations Charter and in hundreds of resolutions of the General Assembly and other United Nations bodies  first and foremost the Security Council  which is responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security.It is time for Israel to wake up to the fact that  if it genuinely wants peace with its neighbours and coexistence with the Arab peoples  it must immediately abandon its present policy and cease its belligerent and oppressive methods. Peace depends primarily on coexistence with the Palestinian people? Israel must therefore become sensitive to the true nature of that people's peaceful uprising in the occupied Arab territories and respond to it by agreeing to the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East rather than by using force and oppression against the peaceable Palestinian people.Never in history has an occupying authority meted out such harassment as that faced by the Palestinian people in its peaceful legitimate struggle against Israeli occupation. Despite the international community's inability to play a role in keeping with the scale of the suffering of the Palestinian people and with the peaceful nature of its uprising  that people continues to hope fervently that it will be accorded justice and fairness by the international community  as represented by the United Nations  in the realization of its aspirations and of its legitimate right to the establishment of an independent State.The measures announced on 31 July 1988 by His Majesty King Hussein bin-Talal of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan severing the legal and administrative ties between Jordan and the occupied West Bank will unquestionably advance the Arab approach to peace. Moreover  they will facilitate arrangements for convening the international peace conference on the Middle East  thereby highlighting Jordan's important positive role in achieving peace  a role indispensable to the Middle East peace process.These positive developments have created historic new opportunities for achieving a just and permanent peace in the Middle East guaranteeing the rights of all parties concerned. If these opportunities are not seized now  similar ones may not arise in the future  and this issue could continue to threaten international peace and security. There are indications that solutions are at hand to certain regional issues that until recently clouded international peace and security; solutions that should provide the best of motives for placing the question of the Middle East atop the list of regional issues demanding speedy solution.The Government of the Sultanate of Oman is satisfied at the developments regarding the issue of Afghanistan and particularly at the signing on 14 April 1988 of the Geneva Agreements. In that connection it endorses the agreement that was reached and commends the efforts made by the United Nations on that issue  undertaken by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and his representative  Mr. Diego Cordovez. We express our complete satisfaction with the steps taken with respect to the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan  and with the latitude accorded the Afghan people to choose the system it desires without outside interference. The Sultanate of Oman further calls for the speedy solution of all issues relating to the implementation of the agreements  including the question of the composition of the future Government of Afghanistan. We urge the international community and all peace-loving States to make greater efforts to assist in the reconstruction of Afghanistan in order that it may overcome the devastating impact of the war that has afflicted it. The Government of my country is hopeful that the international situation  which is brimming with optimism  will help in the solution of the worsening Kampuchean problem. In this connection  we should like to commend the sustained efforts being made by countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to solve the problem  and we also applaud in particular the efforts made by Indonesia on behalf of ASEAN. We regard the results achieved by the informal meeting of the Kampuchean parties held at Djakarta in July this year as particularly auspicious  and we hope that  God willing  the meeting will mark an opportune beginning for the resolution of the crisis. We wish success to all the efforts made to solve the Kampuchean problem  so that the Kampuchean people will be able to live in peace and choose for itself  of its own accord  whatever system it pleases.Since it became a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean  my country  together with the other members of the Committee  has made modest efforts towards implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  adopted by the General Assembly in 1971 in its resolution 2832 (XXVI). Its implementation would preserve equilibrium in the region and insulate it from the effects of great-Power rivalry.Despite the fact that patience is all but exhausted by the deadlock that has stifled the work of the Committee in recent years  we are pleased to note that appreciable success was achieved in the Committee's preparatory work this year. We hope that this success  together with recent positive developments in the region  will provide a fitting impetus for the convening of the conference in question at Colombo in 1990  as a first step towards the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. We feel a sense of gratification at the sustained endeavour by the States of Central America to implement the agreement on arrangements for the inauguration of a firmly established and permanent peace in the region  which was signed by the Heads of State of the region on 8 August 1987. This agreement promises a future of peace and prosperity  not only for the region of Central America but also for the entire Latin American and Caribbean region. We take this opportunity to express the support of the Sultanate of Oman for all efforts made to bring peace to Central America  particularly those: of the Contadora Group  which has continued to make exhaustive efforts to implement the letter and spirit of the August 1987 agreement.The building of a world in which security  goodwill and harmony prevail requires that we eliminate those inhuman manifestations which the international community continues to endure  such as racial discrimination. The vile policy of racial discrimination pursued by the Government of South Africa against the black majority brings with it only increased destruction and bloodshed. While condemning that policy  we are hopeful that the international community will spare no effort to realize the aspirations of the oppressed peoples of South Africa for freedom and stability.In that connection  the Sultanate of Oman welcomes the progress achieved thus far in the rounds of talks taking place  under the auspices of the United States of America  between Angola and Cuba on the one hand  and South Africa on the other. We hope that the results of these efforts will advance the interests of the peoples of South Africa and restore security and peace to that important region of the world.The world is at present witnessing a unique gathering that exemplifies peace in its noblest sense the Olympic Games hosted by Seoul  the capital of South Korea. The Sultanate of Oman hopes that the spirit of peace represented by the Games will promote confidence and stability in the Korean peninsula. In this connection  my country would welcome any international move to admit either of the Korean States to membership of the United Nations  and we particularly welcome the sincere interest shown by the Republic of South Korea in addressing the General Assembly  especially since it announced  through the declaration made by its President on 7 July 1988  an end to the state of diplomatic enmity characterized by its rivalry and confrontation with the North. Such a move would strengthen the principle of universality which is the corner-stone of this Organization.It is encouraging to see today that the process of dialogue and negotiation between the two great Powers has entered on a new course and has begun to develop. The positive results of that process have begun to show an appreciable impact in the easing of international tension  and they represent a sound basis for a more peaceful world and presage prospects for a dialogue of broad enough scope to include agreement on the solution of an increasing number of international issues. The entry into force of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles is an important historic event. The Treaty  as well as being the first of its kind  has highlighted an important fact: that regardless of how great the destructive military power of a State might be  it cannot be assured of peace and tranquillity  and that the only way to achieve security and stability is to engage in dialogue and to respect the interests of others on the basis of justice for all nations  great and small alike.That Treaty  although important  affects only a small number of the nuclear weapons on the face of the planet. We have nevertheless taken one step towards the world envisaged by the Charter  despite the statistics available on military expenditures. It is enough to recall  by way of example  that the world spends $1.3 million each minute for military purposes while in some of the developing countries hundreds of children are dying of malnutrition and disease  to say nothing of the 570 million human beings who are suffering from hunger  the 1 500 million in need of health services  the 800 million who remain under the shadow of illiteracy  and the 300 million unemployed.These and other relevant facts make it incumbent on us to take urgent steps to break the deadlock that beset the disarmament process at the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. The disarmament issue is not the unique concern of one State or one group of States  but a universal issue that involves all peoples because none will survive a nuclear catastrophe. Since we believe that nuclear war will eradicate the human heritage and human progress on this planet  there is no alternative to collective action to prevent its occurrence. This will of course only come about if every State assumes its responsibility with zeal and sacrifice in preparing for a concerted effort of universal scope to formulate a full and comprehensive programme for disarmament.The structural changes experienced by the world economy during the 1980s raise questions and cause concern in view of the sharp decline that has taken place. The changes that resulted from technological and scientific progress  as well as from the overall economic policies of the large industrialized countries  have had a negative impact on growth and development in the world in general and in the developing countries in particular. The worsening situation of the world economy is due to the interaction of a number of factors  including the fall-off in the prices of those commodities on which the economies of the developing countries depend j instability in the exchange rates of the major currencies; the protectionist measures adopted by the industrially advanced countries; the debt burdens of the developing countries; the deterioration in the terms of trade to their detriment  and the reduction in financial flows to those countries. This has led to an aggravation of the economic problems from which the countries in question suffer  perhaps the best indication of which is the decline in their average per capita income. The uncontrolled persistence of such an abnormal situation will compound the suffering of even more of the inhabitants of third world countries. If such policies on the part of the wealthy countries are allowed to continue  it will mean that the developing countries will also continue to suffer from backwardness and poverty and that their economies will not have the opportunity to achieve increased rates of growth and recovery.Although the beginning of a new approach on the part of the industrialized countries towards alleviating the burden of third world indebtedness  extending repayment schedules and lowering interest rates was apparent at the recent Toronto summit meeting  that approach is not universal and we hope that it will not be an interim phenomenon. We call for more constructive co-operation from the industrially advanced countries in order to increase growth rates in the developing countries and alleviate their debt burdens  just as we call on those countries to show more flexibility and greater seriousness in negotiations on that matter.The solution of many of the problems faced by the international community depends on improvement of the world economy as a whole and on ensuring equitable and fair growth for all countries. This naturally requires the countries concerned to be flexible enough to renew the North-South dialogue. We believe that the present session will provide an excellent opportunity to bolster the optimism that arose as a result of the resumption of the dialogue between producers and consumers. We have a duty to co-operate closely in order to create the conditions necessary to bring about a world economy that will be of benefit in a fair and balanced manner to industrialized and developing countries alike.The United Nations has played a pioneer role in solving world problems and in promoting international peace and security. The Organization has demonstrated its ability and aptitude in devising solutions to many problems that had appeared to be insoluble  just as it has succeeded in breaking the deadlock in issues that had seemed to have reached an impasse.The United Nations will remain the hope of mankind in its search for peace and security. In conformity with its policies directed towards the establishment of friendly and peaceful relations with surrounding countries and with the rest of the world  the Sultanate of Oman will continue to support all efforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations as the major collective instrument capable of solving the intractable problems facing mankind."
"109",5435,"PAK",43,1988,"ï»¿I consider it a great privilege to convey to the President  on behalf of the delegation of Pakistan  our sincere congratulations on his election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. My delegation looks forward to working under his guidance to ensure the success of this session. The many complex issues on its agenda demand the qualities of leadership  diplomatic skill and experience which the President so indisputably commands.May I also convey our deep appreciation  through the President  to his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  the Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic  who conducted the forty-second session of the General Assembly in an exemplary manner.The delegation of Pakistan welcomes yet another occasion to extend heartiest congratulations to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his dedicated efforts and tireless endeavours  year after year  to promote the aims and objectives of this Organization in strengthening the foundations of peace and security around the globe.His faith in the role of this Organization as an instrument of international peace and security has never wavered. No challenge  howsoever grave or forbidding  has ever dimmed his resolve or led him to doubt the capacity of the United Nations to meet it. The fruits of his patience and perseverance are manifest. They bring the United Nations to the centre of the world stage  where it clearly belongs and where conflicts that appeared intractable are moving towards solutions through the direct or indirect efforts of its Secretary-General.The forty-third session of the General Assembly promises to be more productive and more lively than those that preceded it. Profound changes have taken place in the world situation and we are keenly aware of the contribution which the United Nations has made to the improvement of the international climate. No one was more conscious of this welcome trend than our late President Mohammad 7ia-ul-Hact. He had made up his mind to lead the Pakistan delegation himself to pay a personal tribute to the Secretary-General and to this Organization in a year when a wave of peace was steadily moving across the globe and controlling the fires of conflict and confrontation. Alas  we lost President Zia-ul-Haa in Ð° tragic incident before he could fulfil his desire.As we look around we see dramatic reversals of the proposition that political problems can be solved by the use of military force. Our international system itself offers the strongest disincentive to adventures of this kind. Indeed  the war weariness and attrition that attend protracted conflicts have provided a fresh impulse to the peace-keeping instruments of the United Nations. There is a resurgence of faith in this Organization and a new commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Welcome signs of support to the United Nations are emerging from those powerful sources that can either help to build it into a genuine instrument of international peace and security or to relegate it to the hack water of a forum for rhetoric and sterile debate. It was the Secretary-General who said in one of his earlier reports that a modicum of co-operation between the super-Powers was indispensable for the smooth functioning of this world Organization. It appears to us that a beginning has been made towards the kind of co-operation between the two super-Powers that the Secretary-General had in view. The world situation has greatly improved as a result of the summit meetings between President Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. The United Nations is already a beneficiary of the lowering of tensions between the two super-Powers. The signing of the Treaty between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - is a historic achievement which needs to be celebrated and applauded by the international community. It marks the beginning of a great forward movement in the collective effort to rid our planet of the prospect of annihilation in a nuclear holocaust and to reduce  if not eliminate  conventional armaments  everywhere.This could be a memorable year for the United Nations. All of us  and the Secretary-General in particular  can take legitimate pride in its crucial role in contributing to the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan  in bringing about a truce between Iran and Iraq  in the emerging settlement in Namibia and in promising developments in Kampuchea  Western Sahara  Central America and Cyprus. We hope that the time is not far off when the seemingly intractable problems of the Middle East will also succumb to an irresistible process of peace which has been set afoot as a result of these achievements.While we are entitled to welcome and celebrate the ascendancy of the spirit of peace over our globe  we must not forget that many of the peace processes in which our optimism is rooted need continuous and careful tending by this world body if the consummations we so devoutly desire are to be realized.In our immediate neighbourhood  the signing of the Geneva Accord on Afghanistan has laid the foundations of peace in that war-torn land. The entire international community is anxiously awaiting the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops by 15 February next year. We hope that this withdrawal will be completed in accordance with the time-table laid down in the Geneva Agreement.The Secretary-General has rightly observed in his annual report that; ""The conclusion of the Geneva Accords in April represented a major stride in the effort to secure a peaceful solution of the situation relating to Afghanistan and provide a basis for the exercise by all Afghans of their right to self-determination."" (A/43/1  p. 2) We must recognize the fact that the Geneva Accords  which address the external aspects of the Afghanistan issue  have not restored peace in that land. The internal conflict continues to rage. Millions of Afghans who took refuge in Pakistan and Iran will not return to their homeland until peace is restored. A comprehensive political settlement of the Afghanistan problem has yet to be achieved. Central to such a settlement is the exercise of the right of the Afghan people to self-determination.Pakistan has been most profoundly affected by the consequences of the conflict in Afghanistan. It has been host to more than 3 million Afghans who have sought refuge on its soil from the cruel and protracted conflict in their own country. By accommodating these afflicted and courageous people and by providing them food and shelter with generous assistance from the international community  we have tried to fulfil a humanitarian obligation towards a neighbour in distress and agony. The conflict will not end for these refugees and  therefore  not for Pakistan  for their sufferings are our sufferings  until conditions inside Afghanistan permit them to return to their home safely and in dignity. We await anxiously the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and the beginning of the process of intra-Afghan dialogue for the establishment of a broad-based interim government. This alone will make it possible for peace to be restored  enabling the Afghan refugees to return  and the Afghan people to exercise their sacred right to self-determination.After the loss of over a million Afghan lives and the exodus of more than 5 million Afghan refugees to Pakistan and Iran  a vast effort will be required for the repatriation and rehabilitation of the refugees and for the reconstruction of their war-torn country. We value the appointment of Prince Sadruddin as United Nations Special Co-ordinator for Economic and Humanitarian Assistance to the people of Afghanistan. We trust that this purely humanitarian endeavour will not be used by interested parties for political ends.It is a matter of profound concern to us that our frontiers and airspace have been frequently violated. These violations have continued after the signing of the Geneva Agreements. On several occasions  the intruding aircraft have penetrated deeper than ever into our airspace. About 387 air and ground violations  causing 40 deaths and injuries to 114 persons  have been registered since the coming into effect of the Geneva Accords.The armed incursions have been accompanied by widespread acts of subversion and terrorism. According to an annual survey entitled ""Patterns of Global Terrorism 1987""  incidents of international terrorism increased by 7 per cent last year  largely as a result of attacks in Pakistan by agents of the Soviet-backed Kabul regime. As many as 259 attacks were conducted inside Pakistan last year alone  killing 264 and wounding 1 069 people. Since the coming into effect of the Geneva Accords there have been nearly 70 further acts of sabotage and subversion  claiming 74 innocent lives and causing injuries to 55 persons. We have a vital stake in the restoration of peace and normalcy to Afghanistan. When peace finally returns  it will have been due to several causes  foremost among them the will and capacity of the people of Afghanistan to resist foreign aggression. The United Nations role in ending the conflict will have been equally important  as will the supportive role of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement and the staunch support of the United States under President Reagan's Administration. Let us also recognize and applaud  across the ravages of a cruel and searing conflict  the bold and constructive contribution of General Secretary Gorbachev to the successful conclusion of the Geneva Accords.Pakistan signed the Accords in good faith and is committed to their implementation. The United Nations Good Offices Mission for Afghanistan and Pakistan  after a number of inspection visits  has established in its report that no evidence was found of any violations of the Geneva Accords by Pakistan.The Geneva Accords pave the way for a comprehensive settlement of the complex situation inside Afghanistan. Therefore  the United Nations will have a continuing role to play in the unfolding situation until the Accords have been completely implemented  foreign forces have been withdrawn and an intra-Afghan dialogue has produced a broad-based interim Government. The Afghan refugees can then return to their homes and all the people of Afghanistan can freely determine their own future.We are heartened by the fact that the call for the establishment of a broad-based Government in Afghanistan  which was made with the understanding of the four signatories to the Geneva Accords in April this year  was further endorsed by the conference of Foreign Ministers of the non-aligned countries which was held recently in Nicosia. I take this opportunity to convey to the Secretary-General and his Special Representative  Mr. Diego Cordovez  who is now the Foreign Minister of Ecuador  our gratitude for the contribution which they made in working out the Geneva instruments  and for the patience and skill which ensured the signing of the Accords by all the parties concerned last April.Pakistan was also closely involved  through the Organization of the Islamic Conference  in the promotion of the peace process between Iran and Iraq in the long-drawn-out war which brought so much death and destruction. That is why we join in celebrating today the great success achieved by the Secretary-General in bringing about a cease-fire that will  it Is hoped  pave the way for a comprehensive peace settlement  so that a new chapter of peace  friendship and fraternal co-operation between these two countries can be opened. There was deep anguish in Pakistan while this conflict lasted. As with Afghanistan  so with Iran and Iraq  not only are we close neighbours in a geographical sense  but historically  spiritually and culturally we are tied to them by the strongest bonds.The role of the Secretary-General and the Security Council in bringing about the cessation of hostilities in the Iran-Iraq war was a critical factor. It demonstrated that concerted action by its members could enable the Council to fulfil effectively its primary responsibility under the Charter. We agree with the Secretary-General's observation in his annual report that there are two essentials for continuing success in implementing Security Council resolution 598 (1937); namely  a conviction on the part of the belligerents that genuine peace will provide the opportunity for reconstruction and progress that an uneasy truce cannot; and the continued exertion of its influence by the international community  particularly the permanent members of the Security Council  to bring about a just and lasting solution. The eight-year-old Iran-Iraq conflict  which is mercifully coming to an end  was a comparatively short-lived calamity  as against the Arab-Israel conflict that has ravaged the Middle East for more than 4Ï years. Throughout this period women and children of Palestine have demonstrated extraordinary courage and resilience in keeping alight the flame of freedom. The most ruthless use of force by Israel has not extinguished that flame. The people of Palestine are in a state of constant ferment and for as long as their legitimate aspirations have not been fulfilled Israel cannot hope to live in peace.The latest phase of the Palestinian uprising  which began last December  continues unabated. Unless the relevant United Nations resolutions are honoured in letter and spirit  peace in the Middle East will be as elusive in the future as it has been in the past. The people of Pakistan have a deep commitment to the cause of Palestine's freedom - a commitment that is as old as Pakistan itself. We shall continue to uphold the Palestine cause  and we shall work unrelentingly for the restitution of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and nationhood under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PÅO)  their sole and legitimate representative.The withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Palestinian and Arab territories  including Al Quds Al Sharif  is indispensable to the restoration of peace in that ancient land. We urge the early convening of an international conference  with the participation of all parties concerned  including the PLO  for the realization of a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East.It is our fervent hope that the forty-third session of the General Assembly  which is witnessing the resolution of many a regional conflict  will also witness accelerated progress in the resolution of the Middle East question  the oldest unresolved item on the Assembly's agenda. There is a discernible movement towards the peaceful resolution of regional conflicts from Kampuchea to Western Sahara and Namibia.We hope that the Vietnamese troops in Kampuchea will be withdrawn immediately and that the people of that afflicted country  like the people of Afghanistan  will be left to decide their own destiny  without any interference or pressure from external sources. We also hope that this vital question will be resolved by the United Nations in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions and with the collective effort and support of all freedom-loving countries.We welcome the signs of progress towards the resolution of festering political problems in Namibia and other parts of southern Africa. Pakistan is committed to the independence of Namibia under the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole and authentic voice of the Namibian people  and we will continue to give whole-hearted support to the Namibian people until they have achieved their sovereignty and independence.Pakistan is equally committed to the eradication of the abominable system of apartheid in South Africa. In our adherence to the Charter of the United Nations lies our commitment to uphold ""the dignity and worth of the human person"". The inhuman policies and practices of the Pretoria regime and its aggression against the front-line States cannot be tolerated. We salute Nelson Mandela  that redoubtable fighter against apartheid  and demand an immediate end to his long incarceration  which has failed to break his spirit or to weaken his resolve.We also welcome the signs of movement towards a peaceful settlement of the problems in the Central American region. The Guatemala peace accord of last year  initiated by President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica  together with the on-going efforts of the Contadora Group and the Support Group  holds hopeful prospects for peace and stability in that region.We hope that the return of peace in our own part of the world and in the Gulf region will be conducive to improvements in our relations with India. We give special importance to this  while we work for peace and friendly co-operation with all our neighbours  bilaterally as well as in the framework of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). We have taken a number of initiatives to demonstrate our desire for a good-neighbourly and co-operative relationship with India  on the basis of mutual advantage and sovereign equality.The development of friendly relations between Pakistan and India would be greatly facilitated by the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute  which continues to hinder the process of normalization of our bilateral relations. We shall continue to seek a peaceful settlement of this problem  in accordance with the Simla Agreement and on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation holds great promise for our region. Peace and prosperity can best be ensured through planned co-operation by all its members acting together. Co-operation and joint action would be particularly efficacious in such situations of natural calamity as unfortunately have befallen Bangladesh ""n the recent past. We feel the deepest sympathy with and most profound concern for  our brethren in Bangladesh for the grave loss of life and property resulting from the recent inundations  which submerged most of its countryside and agricultural land.Indeed  at the third SAARC Summit in Katmandu it was decided to undertake a study of regional measures to preserve our environment and prevent natural disasters. We are convinced that timely action and co-ordinated efforts by the member countries in pursuance of this decision can effectively contribute towards preventing the recurrence of such natural disasters.The on-going super-Power dialogue on arms control and disarmament has produced significant results. We hope that a treaty on reducing strategic nuclear weapons will soon be concluded. We also welcome the current efforts for confidence-building measures between the two major military alliances and for the reduction of their conventional forces.The super-Power bilateral negotiations on disarmament  though important  cannot be a substitute for the multilateral disarmament process. Three months ago the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament debated issues affecting not only the question of peace and security  but also the threat of nuclear annihilation which hangs over mankind. Nearly all the participants underlined the close relationship between disarmament  security and development  and urged the reinvigoration of the multilateral disarmament process  while there were divergences on certain issues  the debate revealed the existence of agreement on many important subjects and an emerging consensus on others.It is now up to the international community to preserve the gains emerging from that special session and to build upon them in order to promote the objectives of general and complete disarmament. In this context  there is a pressing need for such measures as a convention banning chemical weapons  a comprehensive nuclear test ban and the extension of security guarantees to non-nuclear-weapon States  a halt to the development of nuclear weapons  the prohibition of the introduction of new weapon systems  either on land or in the oceans  and the prevention of the arms race in outer space.Pakistan is deeply concerned by the prospect of nuclear proliferation in South Asia and the introduction of sophisticated weapons and delivery systems in our region. These matters include the stockpiling of fissionable material and the acquisition of nuclear submarines as well as the indigenous production of lethal weapons  such as long-range surface-to-surface missiles  which will upset the regional equilibrium.Pakistan has made several proposals in the field of nuclear and conventional disarmament in order to avert the dangers of nuclear proliferation and a disastrous arms race in our region. We are convinced that in our quest for general and complete disarmament regional approaches to disarmament hold increasing promise and can contribute effectively to this objective. Pakistan is fully committed to this approach  which we believe is the only viable one in a region that has a long history of tension and conflict. Our proposals  in both the bilateral and the regional contexts  aim at allaying the mistrust and suspicion about each other's intentions and capabilities and at fostering a climate of good will and understanding  so necessary for the promotion of the well-being of our peoples.The international economic situation  particularly for the developing countries  remains a cause of concern. The 1980s are shaping up as a lost development decade. Hunger  disease and poverty continue to stalk entire continents. The living standards of many poor countries have dramatically declined. Their debt problem is increasing with the passage of time.It is important to seek concerted solutions to the international economic problems. The results of the United Nations efforts in this direction need to be carefully assessed so as to evolve a fresh agreed approach at the multilateral level  revive growth and development and address the problems of the developing countries  including the issues of trade  finance and debt  and monetary reform. The growing interdependence of the global economy underscores the paramount need to establish a long-term perspective for international economic collaboration. My delegation fully supports the recommendation of the Economic and Social Council calling for the initiation of a comprehensive process for the preparation of an international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade  and the proposal of the Group of 77 to convene a special session of the General Assembly by 1990 to revive growth and development in the developing countries.The co-operation between the two super-Powers  which has been instrumental in laying the foundation of a significant process of disarmament  will  no doubt  have an impact on the roles they play at the United Nations. In a refreshing approach to the United Nations  General Secretary Gorbachev has singled it out for praise  and the Soviet Union has decided to pay the arrears in its contribution to the Organization's peace-keeping forces. There are signs of a similar revision of the United States policy towards the payment of the arrears to the United Nations budget. Financial support to the United Nations in this critical year is indispensable. It would indeed be tragic if  at a moment when the Organization is poised to accomplish important missions for peace which would restore humanity's faith in it  the denial of resources should cripple its efforts and deprive it of the opportunity of achieving its purposes and goals.It is a good augury that both super-Powers as well as other permanent members of the Security Council and the general membership of the United Nations wish to see the United Nations strengthened  at the end of a lean period induced by super-Power rivalry. The recent successes of the United Nations in dealing with regional conflicts owe a great deal to the process of dialogue  and even a degree of convergence on certain issues  which has developed between the two super-PowersThe prospects for peace in many parts of the world - most conspicuously in Afghanistan  southern Africa  Western Sahara  Kampuchea and the Gulf region - have brought unprecedented credibility to the United Nations system and to the future role of the United Nations in promoting international peace and security.There is a new consciousness that the United Nations is the best instrument for forging a sound international partnership for peace and progress. It is the only forum through which the moral  intellectual  political  cultural and scientific resources of all States can be combined for the benefit of mankind. As the Secretary-General says in his annual report: ""Multilateralism has proved itself far more capable of inspiring confidence and achieving results than any of its alternatives. Millions around the world have had a gratifying demonstration of the potential of the Organization and the validity of the hopes they place in it."" (Ä/43/1  p. 2) Towards the end of a decade marked by conflict and convulsion and often clouded by cynicism and despair  we have reason to look to the future with confidence and consolation. "
"110",5478,"PAN",43,1988,"ï»¿ Mr. President  on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Panama  may I express great pleasure at the choice of Your Excellency to carry out the responsible task of presiding over the forty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Your Excellencyâs experience and capacity  as well as your thorough knowledge of world problems  and in particular your familiarity with the cause of Central American peace  will  without doubt  contribute to the achievement of satisfactory results in the Assembly's consideration of the complex and delicate issues with which it will be dealing.I wish to pay a special tribute also to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his diplomacy  which has produced significant results in the case of some of the issues that concern us most. He is to be commended for his immense and positive activity in the cause of peace  particularly with regard to the cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq  Those achievements seem to have brought closer the realization of the ideals espoused by the founders of the United Nations  enabling the Organisation to serve effectively as a system of collective security. From the Secretary-General's report  there are many lessons we can learn concerning the need  in the case of external debt  to recognize that debtors and creditors share responsibility  and concerning the relationship between the arms race and inequalities of economic development. In addition  there is the question of the net export of capital to which the Latin American nations have been subjected in the servicing of their debt. The imposition of terms that are quite our of keeping with their capability  or even with the most elementary criterion of equity  constitutes a graphic accusation against their creditors A decade of zero growth in our continent  and even  in many areas  of decline in the production of wealth  constitutes an irrefutable and terrible denunciation of the imbalance that still persists in our world. What has really been happening is a greater concentration of wealth in a tiny minority of nations  while the difficulties placed on the majority of the less privileged nations  which are trying to break out of the trap of poverty and backwardness  have increased. If it is calculated that there may be 200 million Latin Americans living in poverty by the end of this century  surely that is more than enough reason to assert that the problem requires immediate action through the integration of Latin America  leaving aside traditional considerations.Apart from the grave economic and social problems encountered everywhere  we are deeply disturbed by the international conflicts that keep the world in a state of instability and anxiety.Even so  let me observe that the recent understandings between the two great Powers on the reduction of certain types of nuclear weapons allows us to hope that the world is moving away from the danger of a holocaust and that immense resources may be released for the solution of the most serious economic and social problems. It is encouraging that the principal source of fear and disquiet for several decades among large segments of mankind now appears to be less threatening.However  these nuclear-arms limitation agreements coincide with the emergence of new concepts of security among the Powers that feel the need for greater emphasis on the use of conventional weapons as an instrument with which to subjugate weak and smaller peoples. This in turn means that renewed importance attaches to military installations located in strategic sites of regional or global importance.Thus  while the world moves towards peace  a new danger hovers over many underdeveloped countries  and this is particularly true of Panama because the United States is now attaching greater importance to its military bases on Panamanian soil than it did before its agreements with the Soviet Union. That is why the United States does not wish to honour the commitments it entered into under the current Panama Canal Treaties and seeks to prolong its military presence in my country beyond the agreed terms. Our geographical position  our most important and valuable natural resource  is thus being turned into the greatest danger to our sovereignty and independence. What for us is a bridge between the seas for the strengthening of international trade and for our own development is for others becoming a strategic position with global implications. What we have offered for the benefit of the world  others want for control of the world.We in Panama have no ambitions or aspirations to wield power. We aspire only to being allowed to develop  under normal conditions  our capacity and potential to bring about material and spiritual improvements for our people.Another of the great dangers now hanging over small peoples is disinformation. Using the weapon of disinformation to subjugate a smaller people  a great Power has set in motion its enormous established capacity to influence and control systems of collection  generation  distribution and presentation of news and comment  and has established a network for the manipulation of public opinion the world over.The defenceless state in which societies now find themselves  confronted with massive processes of distortion in the mass media  is one of the most terrible problems of our time  particularly for the underdeveloped peoples  which are very vulnerable to disinformation. If that vulnerability is exploited at the national level  or at the level of regional hegemony  and if the strategy includes cultivating  exporting and introducing methods of Nazi fascism  from the defeat of which this Organization was born  then the time has come to give thought to the need for broad-based action to halt such a diversion of mankind from the right path.Discord has been introduced into Panamanian society in a studied and planned way by the manipulation of minds  which has been extended to the rest of the world through the substitution of invented reality for truth - an invented reality in keeping with the will and designs of the present American Government. It should be recalled that in the last two years disinformation has been functioning as a propaganda ministry whose purpose it is to introduce everywhere a monstrous image of Panama and its highest officials.If I say here and now that the whole campaign against the Commander-in-Chief of the Panamanian Defence Forces  General Manuel Antonio Noriega  is nothing but a sinister tissue of lies and falsehoods organized and spread by agents of the present Government of the United States  and if I say that the Panamanian defence forces have struggled in an exemplary manner against narcotics trafficking throughout the whole time they have been under his authority  some of the distinguished statesmen and officials in this Hall will perhaps think I am not talking about the same man against whom such immense power has been unleashed.What  then  is the truth?On 12 July 1988  in the Senate of the United States  Mr. John C. Lawn  Chief of the United States Drug Enforcement Agency  declared that he had never seen any evidence at all linking General Noriega with drug trafficking. What the United States Government has done is to introduce into world public opinion an image of Panama and its leaders that is nothing more than the product of its own invention  a fiction manufactured by its agents and transmitted and disseminated through channels under its control and orchestrated to lend dignity and merit to United States objectives.The peoples of the world  and particularly the people of the United States  have been feed deplorable lies about Panama and have been induced to yield to fear of Panama. In the implementation of this plan not only the norms and fundamental principles of the United Nations have been breached but also even the most elementary considerations of humanity. What is being inflicted on the Panamian nation today deserves the most careful attention and very serious thought by the Governments of States Members of this Organization  because a new mode of war of conquest; is now being set in motion against the Republic of Panama.Since the end of February of last year the present United States Government has committed against my country an astonishing series of violations of the basic norms of international law and the rules of peaceful coexistence. I wish to place on record categorically that my Government has more than sufficient reason to fear direct military aggression by the United States against the Republic of Panama. The Heads of State or Government of countries which have diplomatic or consular representatives accredited to my Government know quite well what I am talking about.With the presidential succession of 26 February this year  when I took over as constitutional Head of State  all the masks were torn away  to leave exposed to the eyes of the whole world the objectives of the United States Government - that is  to overthrow the legitimate Government of Panama and impose a de facto regime headed by figures committed to theÂ· renegotiation of those clauses of the Panama Canal Treaties which guarantee the Panamanian people definitive consolidation of an independent  free  sovereign and neutral nation at noon on 31 December 1999.I strongly urge all representatives to focus most emphatically on this painful account of the grievous sufferings which my country and my people have endured  and which I shall now describe.Panama was a flourishing  tranquil  happy and simple country with a satisfactory growth index. Dialogue had been the normal way of resolving our internal and international differences  when suddenly we found that discord had  been insidiously injected into Panamanian society  with a strategy of subjugation aimed at my country under the pretext that the system of government was not democratic.We have long understood that the only way to give the word ""democracy"" any teal meaning is by means of a high level of popular participation and a just distribution of wealth and opportunities  so that all sectors may have access to the political decision-making machinery and the benefits of growth.Aware of the inherent weaknesses of institutions which are copied or imposed by force  we have worked constantly on the vital substance of democracy  striking at the essence of social injustice and the social and economic obstacles that confine the liberty and equality of individuals  because they are prejudicial to human dignity. Of course  this mode of thinking gave rise to opposing reactions among those who felt that it was a threat to the privileges which they had accumulated with a regime of supposed formal democracy  but which could not be sustained. There were also opposing reactions in sectors which felt that we were moving too slowly  because the solution of problems could not be delayed. Those reactions were viewed and accepted by us as a domestic issue. We find it utterly unacceptable that a foreign Power should use all the resources of disinformation and manipulation of peoples' minds in order to penetrate those sectors and force them to act against the interests of our nation.Democracy is forged through the daily practice of a combined effort  by those who govern and those who are governed  designed to establish the true economic and social justice on which is based the development of a new mode of life  which each nation has the right to try for itself. No country may take upon itself the power to intervene in another in order to impose on it an institutional pattern contrary to its self-determination. Our sovereign rights were violated when the Government of the United States proceeded to freeze $54 million belonging to the National Bank of Panama belonging to the Panamanian people  thus unleashing a fierce campaign designed to create widespread distrust in the Panamanian banking system. This was action provided for in plans made long ago to destroy the banking centre of Panama  an objective which  independently of the destabilising campaigns  had been attempted some years before. So arbitrary was this action that it Included the denial of justice to the National Bank of Panama  which has been unable to bring its case before United States courts or even obtain any information on the fate of its funds.Similarly  another thing that is completely inconceivable is the retention of payments which the United States Government undertook to make to our country under the Panama Canal Treaties  and of payments which should be made by United States individuals or corporations in the form of taxes or duties established in our fiscal legislation.It is without precedent  moreover  that by virtue of the Executive Order of the United States President  of 8 April 1938  the State Department authorises individuals to dispose with absolute impunity and no legal controls of public and private Panamanian funds arbitrarily withheld and deposited in a bank of the United States Federal Reserve. That Executive Order  to provide a reason to invoke the war powers Act  makes the absurd claim that my Government""constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security  the foreign policy and the economy of the United States of America."" A country such as Panama cannot be a threat to the United states from any point of view  and our legitimate exercise of our independence  sovereignty and self-determination cannot be a threat to any people in the world. But  when the United States resorts to arbitrary actions and capricious moves in its relations with another nation  that certainly has very grave consequences. World leadership in the political field imposes great responsibilities in both the execution and the formulation of policies.The United States declared economic war on the Republic of Panama. In this war the effects of warfare are not quantified in terms of loss of life and material destruction  but rather through the grave political  social  economic and moral damage which has had such a severe impact on the entire Panamanian people. In 1988  the gross domestic product will drop by more than 20 per cent  which represents more than 32 billion. In a country of 2 million inhabitants  sudden impoverishment of this sort makes the whole job of strengthening democratic institutions very much more arduous and difficult.When we have seen the destruction of our economy  of the sources of our work  of our means of production and exploitation of our resources  and when supplies of food and medicine for our population have been seriously jeopardized  how can Panama fail to protest in the most energetic terms? How can it fail to protest when its financial negotiations are sabotaged  when public Panamanian funds  which have been withheld  are dealt with in a piratical manner without precedent in history  and in particular when every day may be the eve of a military attack from those United States bases located in our own territory?Allow me now to state the reasons why the Panamian people is increasingly afraid of direct military intervention. We are now experiencing a visible  tangible and permanent threat  as can be discerned from the facts I have given and shall now continue to give because the entire international community needs to know these things.The 1977 Panama Canal Treaty authorizes United States military presence in my country only for the purposes of the defence and protection of the inter-ocean Canal. However  that presence has now been turned into a base for hegemony and influence  particularly since 1986 with the fundamental restructuring of the nature and purposes of that military presence.With the establishment of the Southern Army  and the reorganization of the hierarchy of the chain of command in the Southern Command  and with the considerable build-up of troops and military hardware  the United States military bases became a part of a structure designed to have Â·the capacity to plan and carry out armed attacks against other countries. At the beginning of 1988  the total United States manpower present in Panama exceeded by several thousand the figures permitted by the Panama Canal Treaty.Between 27 February and the first days of March of this year  commando units specialized in surprise attacks arrived in Panama together with an elite battalion of the 82nd Airborne Division  groups specializing in electronic warfare and more than 300 attack helicopters and troop helicopters ; in addition to special units for control and occupation of urban centres.Later  1300 more soldiers arrived  and 800 marines  combat helicopters and offensive military equipment which has never been a part of the military facilities used by the United States for the defence of the Panama Canal.Fighters planes have taken over the Panamian skies. They are carrying out  with significant frequency  threatening manoeuvres not only against installations of the Panamian defence forces but even against international commercial flights flying different flags.There has been a steady  unbroken succession of movements of arriving troops  reinforcing and taking over from those already present  together with more armaments having overwhelming destructive power. In addition  every day an interminable succession of manoeuvres and war exercises is rehearsed continuously; its purpose can only be to display the power constantly available for attack.I wish now to refer again to the Secretary-General's report in order to reiterate the position the Panamian Republic has traditionally upheld at the United Nations and as a member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in the light of the problems dealt with in this important paper presented to us by Mr. Perez de Cuellar. We agree with the Secretary-General's concerns about Central America and  as Panama has done within the Contadora Group and the Contadora Support Group  we insist on the need for a halt to pressure and foreign interference so that the Central American Republics can press ahead on the path to the broad-based agreement adopted in the Esquipulas II Agreement.Mr. Perez de Cuellar's report also touches on a problem of vital importance to my country and people when it refers to the manifestations of contempt for international law which have occurred lately. If States do not properly implement treaties they have entered into and are currently in force  that will mean the collapse of the entire superstructure of international law and of the foundation of the organized international community. The Secretary-General tells us this in words which are a warning laden with grave implications.Seeing the sufferings being endured by ray country as a result of the determination of the United States to disregard substantive commitments under the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties  I wish to add some final considerations because contempt for international Treaties implicitly involves a very grave breakdown of the moral basis for coexistence among nations.When force replaces the mandates of international law  the door is opened to all sorts of abuses. The United States maintains a diplomatic Mission in my country but does not recognize my Government that Mission continues to engage in destabilizing activities  and we cannot have it removed from our soil because we are quite sure that that would be used as a pretext to use force against us. This is a new dimension of abuse of power. It is a day-to-day humiliation  an affront to the dignity of nations and their leaders. It is disrespect for the law of peoples. Panama is not the only vulnerable nation. Many other nations now run the same risk and are faced with the same threat  a threat we can avoid only by uniting more strongly  because the sole protection of weak countries lies in our common defence of the principles the United States is violating.Is not the power to decide upon the legitimacy of a Government and to give the funds of a sovereign State to individuals to use as they like a threat to everybody?Only through the fullest and most resolute exercise of solidarity in union by all now and the taking of concrete steps towards prompt integration can it be guaranteed that Panama will be the last in a chain of similar cases. The political alliance constituted by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries is a powerful moral force in the international community. It is an unquestionable political force which is now obliged to extend its influence to the economic field in order to generate greater solidarity among the smaller  weaker countries. That is the best protection against situations such as that now inflicted on my country. Latin America bears an excessively onerous burden in terms of its problems of social  economic and cultural development  with immense numbers of people plunged into despair. In that context the introduction of discord into societies in the name of democracy  justice and freedom may give rise to results that will be quite contrary to those same ideals.One hundred and sixty-seven years ago  one of the most distinguished of the founders of the United States  John Quincy Adams  uttered a prophetic warning against the danger of its government going beyond its frontiers seeking monsters to destroy  warning that the consequences would severely tarnish its libertarian ideals.Those who love freedom  in my country and indeed all over the world  are certainly dismayed and indignant that the United States Government now resorts to the invention of monsters in pursuit of its designs of continental domination. The fact that the United States Government is now using its economic and military might to asphyxiate Panama and trying to bring it to its knees is seen by the countries of Latin America with weak economies as a sinister precedent. That policy can turn into a grievous parasitic burden for continental development and for the normal deployment of United States capital.Foreign investment would give rise to apprehension and well justified fear  particularly in the Latin American countries  which would find themselves abruptly obliged to identify such investment as potential Instruments of imperialist designs. The orders and prohibitions imposed by the current United States Government on the corporations of its nationals in Panama are really tantamount to stamping its foreign investments with the label of weapons of aggression.There are many countries which  like Panama  require massive capital investment in their development process  countries which have reformed their policies  have modernized their methods  have invested efforts and valuable resources in the training of Qualified personnel. They have adapted their laws and signed agreements in order to help attract foreign capital for the strengthening of their economy.However  if those countries now see that Panama  with an economy so closely linked to United States investment  suddenly finds that the United States Government is exploiting the relative dependence which emanates from that bond  and if they see that it is then brandishing that fact as a weapon in order to strangle the Panamanian economy  bring its Government to its knees and subjugate its people  then  of necessity  they are bound to have grave misgivings. In the world economy a formula whereby more dollars are generated with less dignity can only give rise to fear.Panama has rigorously fulfilled its international function as a centre for inter-ocean communication for the benefit of mankind and will continue to fulfil its historic role with absolute self-denial whatever difficulties may come its way and notwithstanding all the obstacles deliberately placed on its path. For that reason we demand respect for our dignity as an independent nation. We demand full compliance with the terms of the treaties which govern the functioning and maintenance of the Canal  with a view both to achieving full control by the end of this century and to ensuring its strict neutrality. As the main reason for the existence of the United Nations is the desire of all mankind for peace  I am obliged to invoke the full capacity for moral deterrence which its assembled Members represent as protection for a nation which is threatened and against which aggression has been committed.My Government wants peace and will seek a dialogue and broad-based agreement for the solution of all its international disputes. I wish to place on record in this Assembly that Panama has proved itself able to withstand aggression and has upheld its dignity because of the sense of nationhood and the feeling of the sovereignty of the Panamian people  which has gradually deepened with each passing generation in my country. Our will not be stifled however unequal the terms of the struggle that lies ahead of us may be. The deliberate aggravation of differences and the stepping up of aggression against Panama can only result in driving our peoples further apart and doing serious damage to the peace and security of that part of the world. It can have no other result. On the other hand  stretching our hands to each other and reaching an understanding will have great mutual benefits for the community of nations as a whole."
"111",5525,"PER",43,1988,"ï»¿Mr. President  the delegation of Peru welcomes your election to preside over the present session of the General Assembly where countries of the north and south  the east and west will set forth their vision of a world still beset by war  conflict  injustice  inequality and the disgraceful racial discrimination of apartheid.We feel that we have a share in the responsibility assumed by our region in your person. We are confident that your presidency is inspired by the ideals of freedom  independence  development and peace that bind together the kindred peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean.I am addressing the General Assembly in my capacity as Minister of Foreign Relations of Peru. I represent a country of ancient civilizations and cultures  a country which today on the eve of the twenty-first century has more than 20 million inhabitants  40 per cent of its population being under 15 years of age  and a country stubbornly striving to uphold its independence and attain its development.For us  being Peruvian means being a Latin American and that constitutes an inescapable commitment to affirm our standing as citizens of a continental homeland  or  as our liberator Simon Bolivar said  a nation of republics. Because of the Latin American commitment to the Peruvian people and because of the alarming features of the economic and social crisis that affects our region  it is imperative for me to focus my statement on the challenges posed for Latin Americans by the problems of the present and the promise and challenges of the future. As the representative of a nation struggling against inflation  the foremost enemy of our people  through a severe economic programme of austerity with social implications  the situation of my country is not unrelated to the drama being experienced by the continental people of Latin America where economic and financial difficulties are aggravating our social problems and demanding a united  innovative and coherent answer.We Latin Americans have an historical awareness that only by being united can we advance towards resolving our economic and social problems. By being divided we will only manage to perpetuate and deepen those problems and we should be allowing a dangerous expansion of the distance separating us from the industrialized world  at a time when other geographical areas in the process of development are stepping up their rate of progress. Latin America is in a state of crisis. We must say so plainly and we must point out to the international community soma indicators which  like an X-ray  clearly indicate its magnitude. One indicator is the volume and structure of an irrational external debt that burdens us with payments that are impossible to meet  drastically limiting the mobilization of resources to take care of the most pressing social needs and hindering the flow of external investments and resources required for development.  We Latin Americans owe $420 billion  representing 45 per cent of the region's gross regional product and whose servicing absorbs nearly 40 per cent of our total export earnings. In 1982  at the beginning of the crisis  the regional debt amounted to 2.7 times the total exports; that ratio has now increased to 3.5 times and the trend for future years is upward. Moreover  from 1982 to 1987  owing to debt payments Latin America transferred 3190 billion to the developed world  while receiving 340 billion in new inputs - a shortfall of 3150 billion. That is most alarming  for the region is dramatically losing its financial resources and our countries are being transformed from capital recipients to net capital exporters to the developed world  thus depriving us of vital resources for social and development programmes whose non-implementation exacerbates the poverty of our peoples and endangers their very survival.In addition  our share in world trade has declined to 4 per cent and the terms of trade have deteriorated by 14.5 per cent. Had this deterioration not occurred  Latin America would have had additional income in the order of 370 billion over the last eight years.An equally serious aspect of the situation is the investment and financing attracted by the region during the same period. Domestic savings geared to investment in the region diminished from 24 per cent to 15 per cent of the gross domestic product  largely because that money went to paying the external debt; at the same time  external investment also declined  from 12 per cent at the beginning of the decade to 4.6 per cent in 1986. Formerly  in the context of the developing world  Latin America received 70 per cent of world investment; today that figure has been reduced to 17.5 per cent  largely because the impossibility of paying the debt on the terms imposed on us has discouraged capital investment in the region.Those are the realities of the crisis besetting us  as is the fact that our imports and exports have declined to historically unprecedented levels  pointing to an alarmingly regressive situation in circumstances where the Latin American population is constantly growing and thus creating corresponding economic and social needs.What can we do  given this harsh reality? What can we do to ensure that Latin America can emerge from a crisis that threatens to become chronic?In the first place  it is imperative that we become aware of the magnitude of the tragic situation and that we Latin Americans assume a commitment to unite not just in a rhetorical repetition or reiterated announcement of the problems but in concerted efforts in laying our joint strategies enabling us to renegotiate the external debt on acceptable and realistic terms  and leading our creditors to understand that the debt cannot be retired on the terms originally contracted. Secondly  we believe that the time has come for Latin American States definitively to integrate.Latin American integration can no longer be a long-term project or aspiration. It has become an imperative of the present  an urgent need  an indispensable option to modernize our productive structures in order to bring about a broader market that will endow our exports with greater competitiveness and enable us to receive investments and financing on realistic terms without detriment to our sovereign decisions. Integration thus understood will clearly give the region multinational negotiating power and strength enabling it to present a solid front in international economic and trade negotiations and to resist and reverse the protectionist measures of the developed world.Latin American integration - the key to development  the unrealised dream of our liberators and the unfulfilled commitment to our peoples - has been limping upstairs on crutches while in the developed world integration has gone up by the elevator  thus broadening the gap separating us from the North and painfully losing us resources and opportunities vital to regional development.Hence our peoples cry out with good reason for action  responsibility  dynamism  resolve and concerted effort.There is no time to waste in Latin America. There is no room for apathy  bureaucratisation and insensitivity  because 700 000 children in our continent are dying of hunger every year; because more than 110 million Latin Americans are living in poverty  and of these 35 million find themselves in that subhuman situation described as extreme poverty; because the children of 40 per cent of Latin American homes do not have adequate nutrition; because 78 per cent of them are living in unhealthy surroundings; because the absolutely unemployed  which in 1980 numbered 25 million  now number 40 million and may be growing as a result of recession; because the underemployed also number 40 million; because 60 per cent of the economically active population does not have social security coverage and because per capita income has declined by 10 per cent.As if all that were not enough  hunger and poverty are also creating  conditions making children the targets of war  political violence or terrorism  as is shown dramatically by the fact that from 1982 to date more than 300 000 children have been displaced from their homes and thousands more have died or been injured as a result of these destructive tendencies. Terrorism  a pathological and extreme form of violence which holds life and democracy in contempt and makes crime an aberrant style of politics  has also emerged in Latin America and deserves our most vigorous condemnation and our commitment to fight it with firmness  but within the framework of the law  because only thus will we be affirming the humanistic and democratic structures we want for our societies. Latin America must also face the serious and disturbing phenomenon of drug trafficking  which is a crime against humanity  distorts our economy  erodes the moral foundations of social coexistence and seeks to set itself up as a new focus of power  threatening the security of States and of society. Since the decade of the 1970s  when the consumers market for cocaine and other drugs grew tenfold in some industrialized countries  international drug-trafficking cartels have taken shape  and there are now more than 50 million addicts throughout the world.Because of the magnitude of drug trafficking  which acts like a multinational and annually mobilizes some $400 billion  it is impossible to defeat it with isolated or partial strategies. It must be attacked frontally in every aspect through a comprehensive approach that takes into consideration the relationships between consumption  production  transportation  illicit trading and financing  which feed and perpetuate the economic cycle of drugs.Peru is affected by this plague  and it is committed to the struggle. Therefore  in the Andean Group  in the Organization of American States  in the Non-Aligned Movement and in the wider forum of the United Nations  we promote the co-ordination of policies and actions designed to establish effective international standards which should make it possible without delay to bring about crop substitution in the framework of an integrated development programme  a drastic reduction in consumption  the seizure of property and currency produced by drug trafficking  the unification of our legislations in giving decisive impetus to prevention and rehabilitation  and the enhancement of unconditional international financial co-operation to assist countries affected by illicit production.The draft convention being negotiated in the United Nations should quickly lead to the approval of an effective international legal instrument. That can be achieved only through a balanced convention that attacks consumption  trafficking  transportation  production and illicit financing equally  and is based on full respect for the sovereignty and international jurisdiction of States.We shall persist in the struggle against drug trafficking because that struggle represents a moral commitment to all the peoples of the world  especially the children and young persons affected by this plague. The President of Peru  Alan Garcia  has repeatedly called for such a commitment and has emphasized that there is no time to lose and no effort must be spared in this battle for morality and for life itself.I shall now refer to some of the priority items on the international agenda.There have been significant advances in resolving principal areas of conflict  such as the cases of Iran and Iraq  Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Western Sahara and Namibia  which have been set on a path that augurs well for peace. The processes of detente and rationality are long-term processes that uphold life over death  and peace over war  and they are promoted with talent and vigour by the Secretary-General  a distinguished son of Peru whom we salute with legitimate pride. It is important that those processes bear fruit  and that new areas of negotiation are opened up for other regions in which there is conflict  such as Central America  a part of Latin America in which it is indispensable to fulfil the agreements of Esquipulas II and to affirm international law and the rule of law  under which non-intervention and non-use of force should guarantee the peaceful coexistence of the peoples. All of this is necessary to culminate a long process of negotiation in which Peruvian diplomacy has taken part and continues actively to participate through the Contadora Group and the Support Group.Similarly  it is urgent for disarmament agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union to be deepened until they remove the nuclear threat from the face of the earth. Otherwise those agreements already achieved will have little practical effect  for real progress cannot be seen in merely moving from the destructive capacity to destroy the earth 100 times to the destructive capacity to destroy it 80 times. Disarmament is a synonym for detente and brotherhood. In economic terms  it implies releasing resources used for destruction and death for purposes of construction and life. Therefore the Latin American and non-aligned concept of using the funds thus released to establish a fund  under United Nations administration  to counter poverty and hunger retains its relevance.Those of us who call for the democratization of international relations  those of us who struggle for a process of peace  detente and non-violence  ate thus expressing the sentiments of our peoples  which cry out for life and social justice. Peru firmly and stubbornly believes in democracy and civil liberties  and that the State should be based on the rule of law. Those are enduring principles that govern our national life.In this forum Peru holds out its hand to all peoples and reiterates its faith in the United Nations  and it expresses the hope that the results of this session of the Assembly will meet the aspirations of all who proclaim faith in the brotherhood of man and the common destiny of all who share this still torn and troubled world.The eyes of the world's poor are upon us  in anxious hope. All who hold peace and humanity dear await our decisions. Let us not disappoint them."
"112",5572,"PHL",43,1988,"ï»¿The Philippines greets you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. It is not only the votes of the membership of this body  but your own erudition  experience and diplomatic skills and your country's brilliant contributions to this Organization that have elevated you to that exalted office. My delegation awaits the impact of your shining leadership on the labours of the Assembly.You succeed Mr. Peter Florin  the President at the forty-second session of the General Assembly  and the Philippines appreciates his performance in that capacity. It was a performance that was at once vigorous and unselfish. We recall that he returned to New York several times to preside over our resumed sessions and at one special session  which attests to his commitment as well as to his diplomacy I bring the General Assembly a message from the poor of my country. Why are many Filipinos poor?They ate not poor because they come from an indolent race. Out countrymen now covet the earth - two million of us in the Americas  half a million in the Middle East  a quarter of a million in Europe  half a million in Asia and the Pacific - seekers all of toil and of life  teachers of nations  physicians of men  builders of industry  designers of modules that challenge the stars and settle on the moon  men and women of skill and diligence  like those of Europe who settled America and here built a new world.They ate not poor because they do not know how to fight for their rights.They were the first in Asia to shed their blood against Western colonialism and produce their own republic. Ninety years later  they were the first nation in the world to mass by the millions  to confront guns with rosaries and bring down a dictator without the shedding of blood. In those four bloodless  spectacular days of February  under the leadership of Corazon C. Aquino  they raised the new peaceful rallying cry of ""People power.Â·"" which even now resonates in the streets of nations in transition on more than one continent of this earth.They are not poor because they multiply too fast. They try not to  against their own human instincts. And they know that in rich nations it is the building of cities and industries  not the extermination of human instincts  that has reduced this multiplication.They are not poor because their nation does not grow. For our country does grow. Now that we are free again  although we remain harassed by the extremes of left and right  we have kept to our democratic course and our economy is growing again  last year by S.6 per cent  this year by 6.8.Why  then  do so many of us remain poor?Thirty years ago  our country was second in East Asia in economic development  next only to Japan. Twenty years ago  along with those developing countries you now call the South  we were growing faster than the developed countries of the North.Then one day the countries that produce oil decided to form a cartel. And why not? Other countries more powerful then they had deprived them of their just profits and it was time that they stood up  joined forces and assumed control of the wealth that God had given them.We in the South who do not produce oil waited for the new oil alliance to share their profits with us. But they did not. The South was not ready with the mechanism to attract and absorb these profits.Therefore  the oil producers chose instead to store their gains in the bank vaults of the North. The petrodollar was born  and the bankers of the North opened their doors wide to the money-famished financial planners of the South  including those of my country. We started to borrow  borrow  borrow  enticed by abundant funds and low interest rates. Some countries learned to control themselves  to borrow just enough  to use their borrowed money wisely and begin to grow.But for our leaders the lure of more and easy borrowing was too strong.Then one day a dictator seized power in our country. There was no more legal opposition  no free press to question enormous r hasty loans. Absolute power produced absolute corruption. The petrodollar was recycled back to the North in the bank deposits of the dictator and his friends.No one warned us of the cataclysm that had to follow. Instead a banker of the North said to just ""Do not worry. Sovereign countries never go bankrupt.""And so  indeed  they lent us more and more. These debts were at that time guaranteed by the Government of the debtors. And sovereign Governments never disappear. They just change hands.Thus it was that in 1970  our country and those of the South owed only 100 billion dollars to the North. Ten years later we owed $500 billion. Now we owe 1 trillion.It was our Mexican friends who were first to realize it could go no further. They produced oil but its value went down when the cartel collapsed and industry decided on other ways of fuelling itself. Mexico said ""We have no money. We cannot pay"" and the South woke up to the realities of borrowing.The banks of the North began to say: ""We have been lending too much  even more than 20 times our capital."" And so now we must pay more for every dollar we borrow  and there are less of those dollars to borrow. And so  after we were titillated into a borrowing pattern - nay  a borrowing spree - the spigot is turned off. Up to 1981 the money was coming into our countries: now it is going out. Now we of the South must together send out 320 billion more than we are receiving every year from our international creditors. Last year alone our country sent out 31.7 billion more than it received.Our country must now export much more and import mudÂ· less just to earn the money with which to pay our debt. Yet  what do some of our friends of the North do? They make it harder for us to export. When they decide that we are exporting enough  they want us to restrain ourselves. When our exports displease their labour  they cut them down. When we export the fruits of our soil  they demand health certificates. When we export what we manufacture  they decide that our products are not good enough. When they cannot say that our products are not good enoughÂ¡  they say it is our packaging that is no good. And when we have done everything to please them  they inundate us with customs documentation.When the countries of the North want to export their service industries to us - their insurance  their banking  their finance - they ask us for market access  national treatment  right of establishment. Yet  are the market services of the North open to the South? If it is their services  they call it export. If it is our services  they call it immigration.So many of our factories  unable to export more  to import enough of the raw material that they needed for their products  shut down many of their machines. By 1985  600 000 in our country had lost their jobs this way. In despair many were tempted to join the rebels in the mountains} many who understood and who saw that death by bullet could be less painful than death by debt. But  though many are starving  they have faith in the ways of peace  which are the ways of the nations united in this Assembly. This then is the message I bring to the Assembly from the poor of my country. It is the same message from the poor of the world  the poor who suffer  but who want peace  not violence. It is a message of hope  not of despair. How do we respond?As Polonius advised his son Laertes:""Neither a borrower  nor a lender be For loan oft loses both itself and friend.And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry."" (Hamlet  1: iii)Shakespeare's admonition may have its relevance for an adolescent who is about to set out on his own  but it has no appeal for a young nation that must grow  must build  must stoke its furnaces with the resources of other nations.Yet borrowing can be heady stuff for eager nations and avid lending houses  and the point of crisis is not difficult to reach. Debt crises are not new in this century  and they have not been beyond solution. In fact  when the crisis is bilateral and horizontal  between North and North  lessens have been learned in time and new disasters averted.At Versailles in 1919 the victorious Allies of the First World War refused to condone the enervating obligations of the defeated Germans  and Germany went to the radical right for a solution. That solution produced the Second World War  The Allies  again victorious in 1945  remembered Versailles  and in London  forgave 70 per cent of the German debt. The same bold visionary leadership that executed that condemnation also conceived the International Monetary Fund  the World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).But when it is a multilateral and vertical crisis  between North and South  the condemnations come much more swiftly and painfully. There was one such crisis in the 1930s. At that time the creditor countries refused and most debtor countries responded quickly and simply. They refused to pay their debts. A few did pay like Argentina  where British leverage could administer sanctions. But for the rest of the debtors no sanction was to be feared. There was no hegemonic Power to enforce international contracts. When most of the debtors refused to pay  the world economy did not collapse. The debtors could not pay and the creditor Governments chose to look the other way. There was only the impulse to create the institutions that would provide the framework for international economic relations.There is one hegemonic Power today that could crack the whip: the united States of America. But the crisis is enormous and there are rising economic Powers with which the enforcer must co-ordinate if order and resolution are to be readied. This is not happening. Today the fund well is dry and there have followed recession and inflation. The response of most creditor countries has been to tighten monetary policy and reduce trade deficits. And so the cost of debt has increased.For its part  the United States has opted for supply-side economics  continuing budget deficits  reducing tax rates and expanding the economy. In the North there has followed turmoil in interest rates as well as unemployment which is now being blamed on imports from the South.The South is now being asked to undertake structural reforms and to rely more on the market and the private sector. But the North with all its technology could solve its unemployment problem# not by blaming imports from the South# but by getting out of economic activities in which the North has no economic advantage: textiles# garments  shoes.We repeat our salute last week to President Ronald Reagan's veto of the protectionist textile Bill. That masterful act of principled determination was a signal of hope for justice in international free trade and of faith in international negotiations and institutions. We also applaud Japan which has offered to recycle $30 billion of its annual surplus by supporting export industries in developing countries. But for this strategy to succeed the developing countries must know what it would be profitable to pursueÂ·  and to know this they must also know what structural transformations can take place in the North.The debt crisis is not a problem only for the debtorÂ·  it is a problem for the creditor; it is a problem for the world. Therefore  the solution cannot be sectoral; it must be total. It cannot be regional; it must be global. It cannot be technocratic; it must be political.Economic and finance ministers of the world must confer. That is vital. But that is not sufficient. The men and women who make political policy - it is these who must agree on the final resolution of this global tragedy. In this last year  in many capitals of the world  political policy-makers of this stature have met and called for valiant responses but have not yet found formal decisive consensus: in Manila last December at the summit of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Toronto last June at the summit of the Seven  again  in Manila last June at the International Conference of Newly Restored Democracies; in Cyprus last month at the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement.How shall we resolve debt? It is valuable to reschedule debt. But it is even more precious and human to forgive debt. The makers of policy must agree to resolve the question  who is entitled to debt relief and debt forgiveness? Is it possible to fix standards rather than leave the answer to the strengths and weaknesses of negotiators?They must agree to alternative adjustment programmes to promote growth that will suit both planned and free economies. They must also develop new modes to carry out global solutions. For the present mechanisms are not equipped for such a momentous mission.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) approaches short-term problems  like balance of payments  with an average span of 18 months. But the structural and financial horizons of transnational debt can span a generation.The World Bank has primarily concerned itself with financing projects  and  more recently  with programmes. Yet  it is only in the context of an aggregate panorama that the financial obligations of nations can be amply appreciated.It is now seven years that the debt crisis has been thundering across our planet. The assault is overwhelming us because our defences are isolated and our strategies fragmented. I propose a global counter-attack by forces that will transcend geography and ideology. I propose an international debt and development commission. I propose that this commission be constituted of men and women whom the world recognizes for their redoubtable seasoning in foreign policy  diplomacy  finance  political economy  trade and development. I propose that the Commission be provided not with a new bureaucracy but with a staff seconded from outstanding multilateral agencies. I propose that the commission be rendered a life-span of five years.I propose that this commission be mandated to evaluate alternative schemes for global debt management  move to concrete action to rectify the trading system consistent with that global debt management  formulate institutional changes in international agencies so that they may discharge a more comprehensive role in the process  commend specific actions to member Governments to address alternative schemes  oversee and monitor its own output.I propose that the commission conduct its own study  but look into recent proposals on global debt management  including the report on an international debt management authority made by the Committee on Banking  Finance and Urban Affairs of the United States House of Representatives  and the French plan announced by President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand.I propose that with this mandate the commission develop standards under which debtor countries nay qualify for debt relief or debt forgiveness; formulate alternative adjustment programmes that promote sustainable growth among nations accompanied by an expansion of their capacity to pay their debts; specify actions  such as the amending of bank laws  necessary for this growth; offer policy practices for industrial countries  newly industrializing economies  middle-income and low-income nations; identify precise interactions between debt  trade and growth which require multilateral response.I propose that this commission submit these measures to the United Nations for approval  proclamation and execution. The United Nations has been demonstrating an expanding genius for waging triumphant campaigns for disengagement - in Afghanistan  in the Middle East  even as it is now engaged in promising peaceful actions in Kampuchea  Western Sahara and Namibia.It is a tribute to this General Assembly  to the Security Council  to the Headquarters and agencies  to the Secretariat and perhaps above all to Javier Perez de Cuellar  that the United Nations has at last become validated in its avowed designation  not only as the forum  but indeed as the engine par excellence for peace.Yet what is this debt crisis but a monstrous threat to peace? Pope Paul VI once stood on this very podium and proclaimed that development is another word for peace.Debt  reasonable debt  even in the holy books  is sanctioned and is meant to develop man. But today the debt of nation to nation is not developing man. It is killing man.The killing must be stopped  and only the nations of the world together can stop it. Stop it now on end the dream of peace in our time. Stop it now or answer to the generation of tomorrow for decimating the human number s of the generation of today. "
"113",5632,"PNG",43,1988,"ï»¿I congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the important post of President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. My delegation shares the confidence that the members of this body have placed in you. Let me assure you of my delegation's full co-operation in the discharge of the high duties entrusted to you.May I also take this opportunity to place on record my country's appreciation of a job well done by your predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin.I have had the honour of addressing the General Assembly on two previous occasions in my capacity as Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea: on 10 October 1975  shortly after my country gained independence  and in 1983. I sun especially honoured to be able to represent Papua New Guinea as Foreign Minister at the forty-third session of the General Assembly  an occasion which marks the fortieth anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.As I stated on those two previous occasions  Papua New Guinea regards the United Nations as having a special role in working for the resolution of tensions and conflicts and for building a stranger framework for international co-operation based on mutual respect and understanding.Papua New Guinea remains committed to playing its part in contributing to this objective. As in previous years  the agenda for this session of the General Assembly is a complex one. Many pressing issues remain unresolved  and many uncertainties still exist in international relations  uncertainties which have a direct impact on the development processes of a great number of developing countries  including Papua New Guinea. But despite these uncertainties  there can still be some cause for hope and optimism. It can be said with a measure of confidence that a number of positive steps have been taken in tackling problems which are the subject of this session's attention.My delegation highly commends the Secretary-General Mr  Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his unwavering efforts in upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter. We also commend the comprehensive report he has presented to the Assembly. It is especially pleasing to note the progress that is being made in respect of the situations concerning Afghanistan  the Iran-Iraq conflict  Namibia  Kampuchea and Cyprus.But his report also underlines other pressing issues  including disarmament  trade  finance and human rights  where more resolute international action is required. We remain convinced of the need for a strengthened United Nations system to play a central role in promoting peace and security and more equitable economic relations between developed and developing countries.Our own region in the South Pacific is comparatively free of major conflicts. Indeed  the region continues to enjoy peace and stability. But there are some changing trends and  unlike the past  more countries and organizations beyond the South Pacific are showing an interest in engaging actively with the region. The South Pacific is not immune from the effects of international tensions and many of the worrying trends in the world economy. Our region is one where in some parts colonialism has not been brought to an end  where in other parts nuclear activities continue to be conducted  despite strong protests from Governments of South Pacific nations  and one where there are growing tendencies for big-Power rivalry.The South Pacific community is made up of many small island States scattered in a vast expanse of ocean  which depend on only a small number of agricultural and marine products for their livelihood and export income. I am pleased to be able to say that there have also been some positive trends in the South Pacific since the last session of the General Assembly.In New Caledonia  constructive progress has been achieved by the French administration in re-establishing dialogue between different ethnic groups in the Territory. One year ago  my predecessor drew the Assembly's attention to the presence of a large number of French security personnel stationed in New Caledonia which  among other things  served to intimidate the Kanak people in their just struggle to seek independence from Prance.In April this year  Papua New Guinea and other island nations were outraged by the merciless killing of 16 Kanaks by French security forces and the build-up of tension in the Territory. We are pleased that the Rachard administration has now set in train a process that will bring about positive changes for the better. The framework agreement concluded in Paris in August provides a basis on which the different communities in New Caledonia can work together in a spirit of reconciliation and understanding to achieve independence. But not all causes of tension have been removed. New Caledonia is on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. The Assembly  therefore  has a responsibility to continue monitoring developments in New Caledonia. We also hope that the administering Power will live up to all its responsibilities and obligations as provided for in the Charter of the United Nations.Papua New Guinea has also closely followed developments in other Territories in the Pacific. In the case of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Marshall Islands  we believe that the people of those States have expressed their wishes on their political future. Political evolution in those States has been consistent with United Nations principles and practices. Papua New Guinea has therefore established full diplomatic relations with the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Marshall Islands. We urge other Member States of the United Nations to do the same. We hope that the way will be clear for the people of Palau and the United States Administration to resolve outstanding matters affecting Palau's political future.Papua New Guinea is a full and active member of the South Pacific Forum  the major regional organization of the South Pacific. We continue to work with other member States of the South Pacific Forum in opposing nuclear testing and the dumping of nuclear wastes in our region.The South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty and the South Pacific Regional Environment Protection Convention are the two most important instruments established to safeguard the environment of our region. Papua New Guinea will shortly ratify both these Treaties. The decision by the Governments of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China to ratify Protocols 2 and 3 of the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty is a welcome development. We urge other nuclear Powers similarly to ratify the Protocols and to respect the operation of the Treaty in the South Pacific.At a recent meeting of Heads of Government of South Pacific nations in September it was decided to put in place Ð° number of new arrangements to facilitate more constructive dialogue and exchanges with other countries and organizations. A Forum institutional network has been created to bring together all regional bodies operating in the South Pacific for improved co-ordination and collaboration. Regular high-level consultations between the nations of the South Pacific and interested third countries are proposed to take place each year immediately following the annual meeting of Heads of Government. These arrangements are intended to draw greater international attention to the development needs and constraints of the island nations of the South Pacific to draw attention to our resource potential and to mobilize appropriate resources to contribute to economic development  self-reliance  capacity building and the social progress of our people. The entry into force in June this year of the multilateral fisheries arrangement between the Government of the United States and the Governments of Pacific islands nations has been an important step forward not only for the development of the region's principal resource - fisheries -- but also for the expansion of economic relations in our region. Papua New Guinea would welcome similar fishing arrangements with other major fishing nations. We urge the Government of Japan to continue the dialogue with island States with a view to concluding a multilateral fishing arrangement soon.The South Pacific region is relatively unknown among the majority of the States Members of the United Nations  and to0 many United Nations agencies. The needs of the island communities in the South Pacific are great. The South Pacific Forum has taken important initiatives to encourage other nations and organizations to contribute to the development of our region in fields where they are able to assist. Other important regional initiatives are to follow  in arrangements dealing with trade  transport and telecommunications.Regional co-operation has been a corner-stone for the development of many United Nations programmes. We see a pressing need for many of the United Nations organs to be more sensitised and reoriented to the real needs and aspirations of the island nations of the Pacific.Papua New Guinea's interests extend beyond the South Pacific region. We seek to strengthen our ties with the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Our ties with ASEAN have steadily expanded in recent years. We continue to value our special observer status at the annual meetings of ASEAN foreign ministers. My Government is pleased also that the ASEAN nations have agreed to our request to be allowed to accede to the Treaty of Amity and Co-operation in South-East Asia. The situation in Kampuchea continues to give cause for concern. My delegation notes with guarded optimism the developments and initiatives seen in the past 12 months relating to the Kampuchean problem. The informal talks held in Jakarta  Indonesia  by all the parties concerned with the Kampuchean issue ace a welcome development. My delegation believes that the Kampuchean problem will be resolved not only by the unconditional withdrawal of Vietnamese forces but also by the prevention of the return of the genocidal policies and practices of Pol Pot and the Khmer Ruge. Papua New Guinea commends the efforts of the ASEAN group of countries to resolve this outstanding problem of our region.The situation of the Korean peninsula is also of concern to my Government. We appeal to the Governments of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to continue to seek ways whereby dialogue and reconciliation can prevail. My delegation notes favourably the recent initiatives contained in the July 1988 Declaration issued by the President of the Republic of Korea aimed at enhancing the prospects for reunification. We urge the Governments of both countries to reflect the wishes of their people  who earnestly hope for early reunification. My Government is of the view that the admission of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to the United Nations has the potential for opening up an additional avenue for dialogue. My Government associates itself with the growing number of Governments that wish to see North and South Korea join the United Nations.The Iran-Iraq war represents one of the most unfortunate and saddest mobilizations of people in recent times. The unnecessarily prolonged conflict has cost so many lives and inflicted misery on so many persons. My delegation joins other delegations in welcoming the 20 August cease-fire. In that connection we commend the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar. The members of the Security Council have demonstrated the necessary political will to find an early solution to the Iran-Iraq war  and we commend them also. The leaders of Iran and Iraq owe it to their people to restore peace and harmony as soon as possible. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) provides a sound basis for the early resolution of the unfortunate conflict.Recent events in the Middle East call for nose efforts to be made to address the underlying causes of tension and conflict. My delegation believes that the Palestinians have a right to a homeland. Israel; too  has a right to exist within secure borders. Those two conditions are fundamental to any lasting solution to the problem.The situation in Central America  especially in Nicaragua  deserves the understanding of the leaders of that region and those who are in a position to influence the outcome. We commend those leaders in that region who have demonstrated foresight and sensitivity to the problems in their midst. My delegation recognizes the value of the regional approach to the problems there.Every year we have come to the General Assembly with expectations that some concrete measures would be taken in response to the problem of apartheid in South Africa. But  despite many resolutions by the United Nations  the problem still exists. My delegation believes that the option of mandatory sanctions against South Africa holds some prospects for success. We acknowledge that such a course of action  if adopted  could create economic hardship. But what other options are there? Economic hardship can be corrected over time  but left unattended apartheid will continue to create oppression and suffering.Recent signs that the people of Namibia could regain their freedom and sovereignty give us some hope. Papua New Guinea urges all parties that are in a position to bring about a favourable outcome to spare no effort to facilitate progress towards Namibia's long-awaited achievement of independence. We in the Pacific are made up of mainly small StatesÂ·  yet we are linked with the international community in many significant ways. Our environment may be less troubled than perhaps that of others  but we continue to be highly vulnerable to influences of the international environment.Keeping our region free of big-Power rivalry and of nuclear activities is an issue to which Papua New Guinea continues to attach considerable importance. The conclusion last December by the United States and the Soviet Union of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles is an important step forward in disarmament and arms control. But more can and should be done in this area by all those who possess nuclear weapons. Like other representatives who have addressed the Assembly  we believe there is a pressing need for further steps to be taken if effective disarmament  arms reduction and arms control ate to be achieved.As I have sought to set forth earlier  vulnerability stems also from limited opportunities to promote economic development. Papua New Guinea attaches importance to international efforts aimed at dealing with the growing problems of trade protectionism  debt-servicing and the slow-down in financial transfers to developing countries. We have taken full account of the many comments that delegations have made in relation to the role and effectiveness of the United Nations at the present time. While the Organization has not been able to deal with all problems affecting the international community  there are positive signs that the United Nations machinery has been given a chance to work. Some momentum has developed in tackling a good number of problems for which solutions have been sought for a long time. Let us not waste this opportunity."
"114",5678,"POL",43,1988,"ï»¿Let me at the outset express our profound and sincere satisfaction over the fact that the helm of the current session of the General Assembly has been placed in hands as skilled and competent as those of Mr. Caputo. My delegation wishes to express to him its heartfelt congratulations on his election to this prestigious and demanding office. I am fully confident that he will not only live up to but significantly contribute to the tradition associating with his compatriots - Mr. Carlos Calvo and Mr. Louis Drago - and that he will guide the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly in such a way as to attain the meaningful results which we all seek. We wish also to express our warm greetings to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and to assure him of our unchanging respect and support for his indefatigable efforts.The United Nations has recently proved its vitality and potential. The Polish delegation has come to the forty-third session strongly convinced of the urgent need for all Members of the United Nations assembled in this Hall to undertake yet another joint effort to further strengthen the role which this Organization has come to play in the world today  to promote positive experiences in its work while seeking to eliminate the lingering weaknesses. At present  we perceive auspicious tendencies in international affairs. They manifest themselves in reduced confrontation  the development of East-Westdialogue  the resolve to settle regional conflicts but  above all  to halt the arms race. The Treaty signed at Washington entitles the international community to extend to the two signatories a fresh credit of confidence in respect of further disarmament measures  especially in the field of strategic arms  and the discharge of their singular responsibility for world peace and international security in the years to come. The Treaty has been instrumental in removing the psychological barrier that attaches to the view that the arms race is beyond man's control. Potentially the most profound changes have taken place in the philosophical aspect of international relations - an era where the new political thinking is making ever greater inroads. It signals  first of all  that effective and lasting resolution of the contemporary dilemmas cannot be accomplished except through political means  with equitable and democratic participation of all interested States  growing mutual confidence  and determination to seek compromise based on international law  with due account taken of the interests of all parties. Under the conditions prevailing today  security cannot be attained through military means alone.Secondly  it is encouraging that  as far as international affairs are concerned  the great humanist idea of the primacy  in international politics  of human values over group or class interests is reasserting itself.The significance of these two phenomena cannot be confined to East-West relations alone; they are relevant to international relations at large and to the whole world  as is confirmed by the agreements concerning Afghanistan  the prospects of the termination of the Iran-Iraq conflict  the resolution of the Kampuchean problem  or the progress in regard to the Questions of the south of Africa We wish to place on record our great appreciation of the productive efforts of the Security Council  as well as of the Secretary-General  with a view to peaceful resolution of acute regional conflicts. We give these efforts our full support  as is manifested in Poland's decision to dispatch a group of army officers to the United Nations good offices missions in Afghanistan and Pakistan  as well as to those in Iran and Iraq.The course of international events is also significantly influenced by the development of the internal situation in particular countries. The Polish case demonstrates all too clearly how difficult it is to reconstruct internal relations. In our profound democratic reforms we are guided by the principle of seeking political solutions based on a wide-ranging dialogue between all who stand on the firm ground of the Constitution and the legal order it established. We are seeking to create wide-ranging national understanding and to further democratize the methods of governing the country. We are undertaking these efforts in conditions of persisting economic difficulties and social impatience. We are fully aware that the transformations in Poland are being closely followed by the international community  for which what goes on in a State of 40 million people in the heart of Europe is not irrelevant.The desire for undisturbed development of the positive tendencies in East-West relations is universal. Poland has irrevocably opted for profound socio-political and economic reform  aimed at increased effectiveness and export- and market-oriented restructuring of the economy. We want to take an active  broadly conceived part in the international division of labour  in keeping with the principle of mutual benefit. In this respect we count on the co-operation of all our partners  including creditor States  both on a bilateral basis and in the international financial organizations. We are confident that all States will have understood  and will lend their support to  the Polish Government's efforts with a view to reforms. We are confident that  given the ameliorating international climate and the increasing co-operation with all States  Poland will be able Â¿o overcome its present difficulties and  as so far  will continue making its contribution to the consolidation of international security  detente and comprehensive international co-operation.The world's primary integrating factor is the common fate of mankind. There is an urgent need to solve global problems and  unfortunately  global threats. There is a growing conviction that only together can we stand up to the challenges of the day  and only together can we hope to survive. The United Nations must become to an ever greater extent the primary multilateral forum where solutions to the major world problems of our time can be worked out. Among such problems  the question of the consolidation of peace in international security remains the central one. Some three months ago  the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament concluded its debates in this Hall. Contrary to the expectations of world public opinion  of a majority of nations and Governments  including my own  the session failed to conclude its work with the adoption of a final document. The significance of the third special session consists  however  in the fact that it has demonstrated to the world the outer limits of compromise that are feasible at present. As will be recalled  out of a total of 67 paragraphs of the draft final document  agreement proved possible on 61. These considerable and valuable achievements must not be wasted. They must be consolidated and further developed by  among other things  resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly at its current session.The Political Consultative Committee of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty  which met in the capital of my country last July  has submitted a programme of concrete disarmament undertakings. The documents of the meetings  which  at Poland's request  have been circulated as official documents of the forty-third session of the General Assembly  reaffirm adherence to the ideals of a world rid of arms of mass destruction and all forms of violence  a world based on the principles of mutual and equal security  democratic coexistence and wide-ranging  equitable co-operation. The States parties to the Warsaw Treaty have addressed an appeal to the international community at large  especially the States members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the States participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  to increase efforts to bring about the early conclusion of meaningful agreements on the reduction of arms and armed forces and the consolidation of security and stability  as well as to refrain from any steps likely to make progress in that direction more difficult.The Political Consultative Committee has recognized the following as priority objectives! a 50 per cent reduction of the strategic offensive arms of the USSR and the United States of America; the prohibition of nuclear weapon tests; the elimination of chemical weapons; and the reduction of armed forces and conventional arms in Europe  with a corresponding reduction of military expenditures.The disarmament initiatives offered by the Warsaw Treaty and the Alliance's individual members  including Poland  over the past few years  also remain valid.These issues  among other things  have for years been on the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament. The General Assembly has also repeatedly issued appeals for the process of negotiations to be accelerated. For years we have found that the only progress scored at Geneva has related to chemical weapons. Yet even in that province  regrettably  one finds slow-downs and diverse impediments to the negotiating process piling up  relating  for instance  to the question of verification  despite the fact that the USSR and other socialist States are prepared to accept far-reaching compromise solutions.The current session of the United Nations General Assembly offers a good opportunity to issue an appeal for a constructive reaction to the initiatives put forward by the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty. The need for concrete actions in the field of disarmament was similarly pointed out by the conference of non-aligned countries in Nicosia.The reduction of military confrontation should begin where catastrophe could most easily occur. Inevitably  we arrive here at the problem of Europe. It was on that continent that deep divisions first emerged under the surveillance of the mightiest military potentials ever. It has  therefore  become the lightest risk area  but also one that offers singularly great opportunities.Specific to Europe  and at the same time critically important for its security  is the sphere of conventional disarmament. The positive evolution of the international situation  announced in the Budapest appeal of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty  and the subsequent constructive response of the States members of NATO have led to substantive progress in preparations for the negotiating process of the 23 States. Poland and the other States parties to the Warsaw Treaty are prepared to do their utmost to ensure a constructive negotiating process  as they indicated in a special statement on negotiations concerning the reduction of armed forces and conventional arms in Europe adopted at the last meeting of the Political Consultative Committee  in Warsaw.The socialist States have come out in favour of the commencement of new negotiations in 1988  stressing that the priority objective of such negotiations ought to be the achievement on the continent of Europe  from the Atlantic to the Urals  of a situation in which the Warsaw Treaty and NATO States retain a level of armed forces and armaments indispensable for defence but far from sufficient to launch a surprise attack and conduct offensive operations.The first stage of such negotiations should be concentrated on reaching equal and lower collective levels of manpower and conventional armaments for States members of the two alliances  the prevention of surprise attack and the establishment of an effective system of verification of compliance with future treaties  including mandatory on-site inspections. These proposals respect the principle of equal security for all the parties concerned. Poland has always attached great importance to the consolidation of peace and security in Europe and sought to make its own genuine and autonomous contribution to the European disarmament process. The Jaruzelski plan for decreasing armaments and increasing confidence in central Europe is only the latest manifestation of that policy. The various aspects of the implementation of the plan were addressed in detail in a message from Wojciech Jaruzelski to the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. They were also dealt with in a statement by the Government of Poland containing an expanded version of the plan.I once again emphasize from this rostrum that  in view of the convergence of the proposed plan and the content of documents of the Political Consultative Committee adopted at its Warsaw meeting last July  and in the light of the views and comments of other Governments  our conviction has been strengthened that the plan fits perfectly the pattern of European disarmament undertakings  and represents their most timely and concrete manifestation  going a long way towards meeting the expectations of the broadest social strata  as well as those in many official circles. The plan offers a solution that responds positively to the requirement for the consolidation of security in central Europe  yet is not without a universal relevance owing to the distinct possibility of applying the ideas it advances to solutions on a Europe-wide scale and beyond. On behalf of the Government of Poland  I wish to reaffirm our readiness and determination to offer constructive co-operation to all interested Governments for the further development of the plan. We are persuaded that reduction of the level of armed forces and armaments in Europe would be a major factor conducive to the construction of a common European home. Its corner-stone must be due respect for the post-war political and territorial order on our continent. Such a home should provide an ever greater possibility of promoting dialogue and mutually advantageous all-round co-operation  open to the world  in keeping with the process commenced some 13 years ago in Helsinki.This explains the great importance that we attach to the CSCE meeting in Vienna. For our part  we shall spare no effort to bring it to a positive conclusion. Similarly  we consider economic co-operation in the European region most important  a fact borne out by the regional conference of the Food and AgricultureOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) held at Cracow last August.Disarmament must be accompanied by the fostering of an appropriate social awareness and promotion of the involvement of public opinion in order to create a special moral sanction - that of universal condemnation of the use of force in international relations. Only in such a state of awareness can one understand Voltaire's observation that in the world there are only offensive wars  the defensive ones being mere resistance to armed robbery.In a few weeks' time it will be 10 years since the adoption by the General Assembly  on the basis of a Polish initiative  of the Declaration on the Preparation of Societies for Life in Peace  a document whose overriding objective is  first and foremost  to ""demilitarize"" thinking and ensure that the seeds of the idea of peace fall on the fertile and well-prepared soil of the awareness of all people. The Declaration has not lost any of its topicality; on the contrary  the putting into effect of its recommendations is becoming an increasingly urgent task. Indeed  attempts to anchor the idea of peace firmly in people's minds make up a logical and indispensable supplement to the material infrastructure of peace.The consolidation of peace and the strengthening of international security  disarmament and the growth of mutual confidence are among the conditions necessary to make possible the solution of many of the pressing problems of the day. Among these are global ecological and demographic threats  as well as those arising from external debt  all of which are growing in a snowball fashion. They defy solution by individual States and co-operation and combined efforts on a global scale ate necessary. This applies in the first place to relations between highly developed and developing countries  between creditors and debtors. The tremendous external debt  especially dramatic for the poorest countries but also painful for those at the medium level of development which are highly indebted  undermines the basis for socio-economic development and international exchange of goods and services. The shortage of hard currency to finance imports cripples reforms  restructurization and modernization of industry. National efforts in respect of economic adjustment encounter barriers to the financing of development. A practical demonstration of the co-responsibility of creditor and debtor countries  with the appropriate involvement of banks and international financial institutions  in an effort to loosen and untangle the noose of indebtedness becomes absolutely indispensable. The General Assembly already has at its disposal resolutions adopted at its two previous sessions from which it clearly follows that an individual approach to solving sue- problems should be followed as soon as possible by multilateral measures. Such relief action should either precede or constitute a preliminary phase of agreed steps in favour of debtor countries  to stimulate effectiveness and make possible export-oriented restructuring of their economies - undertakings reinforcing the internal efforts of many debtor countries  which often involve acute social sacrifices. The Cracow Debt and Development Research Centre  which co-operates with the relevant United Nations institutions  is now concentrating its attention precisely on such problems.The state of affairs is much the same as far as the protection of the environment is concerned. Poland values highly the United Nations record in this respect  especially the resolutions of the forty-second session of the General Assembly adopted on the basis of the Brundtland report and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) recommendations. None the less  there is a distinct and pressing need for major new  joint undertakings in regard to the protection of the environment. Our Organization should strive to do more than it has so far in that field. For instance  one can conceive of the establishment and implementation within its framework of a concept of international ecological security - a code of binding principles and norms of conduct of States in the field of protection of the environment. Appropriate proposals in that respect were formulated at the Warsaw meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty in a document entitled ""The implications of the arms race for the environment and other aspects of ecological security"".However  even the best international legal regulations will prove insufficient unless accompanied by material means for their implementation. Owing to the lack of financial and technical resources  ecology-safe development may well prove for some countries a luxury beyond their possibilities. This is the reason for the need for identification by appropriate international bodies  including those within the United Nations system  of areas of threat  where international aid should be forthcoming with a view to the application of recognized norms of protection of """"the environment. It need not be financial assistance. For instance  implementation of the principle of unrestricted transfer of experience  know-how and technology in the field of the environment  as proposed by Wojciech Jaruzelski at the fortieth anniversary session of the United Nations General Assembly  would be of considerable consequence.As postulated by my delegation  the urgent need to expand international economic co-operation and strengthen constructive bonds and interdependency in the world economy requires that we proceed forthwith to promote confidence in international economic relations. The United Nations system  at both regional and global level  has a considerable role to play in that respect  a fact recognized in the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council. The strengthening of confidence in that sphere would promote a new and more just international economic order and the enhancement of international economic security.We must note with satisfaction the marked improvement in the climate of international co-operation within the United Nations system also in respect of social and cultural problems and human rights. For mankind  the resolution of the most burning social questions is as critical as the prevention of an arms race or an economic crisis.On Poland's initiative  the General Assembly at the previous session adopted a resolution calling for the examination of the possible proclamation by the United Nations of an International Year of theÂ· Family. Our initiative has met with the support of many States  which have made known their positive views in that regard. The conditions are increasingly favourable to the proclamation by the General Assembly of such an International Year of the Family at the outset of the next decade.There exists a tremendous interest in humanitarian problems  especially those pertaining to human rights. Along with other States  Poland attaches considerable significance to the observance of the fortieth anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We intend to take an active part in that important event.It is with considerable satisfaction that we welcome the conclusion of the preliminary phase of the long work on the preparation of a draft convention on the rights of the child. Let us hope that in a year's time  at the next session of the General Assembly  the Member States will adopt the convention to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of the Child. The problems I have commented upon can be solved provided we succeed in turning our Organization into Ð° genuine centre of co-operation and co-decision exercised by all its Members. We have to strive together to enhance the performance of the United Nations and of its principal organs - the Security Council and the General Assembly - as well as to promote the role of the Secretary-General  including in the settlement of inter-State conflicts through negotiations  good offices  mediation or conciliation. It is indispensable to make use in a more effective manner of the entire United Nations system for the maintenance of peace and the consolidation of the primacy of international law. That is the objective of the initiative submitted by the socialist States  including Poland  to develop a comprehensive system of peace and international security.Poland is deeply convinced that a strong United Nations  faithful to its Charter  promoting the spirit of multilateral co-operation and successfully overcoming partisan interests  stands a very good chance of meeting the challenges of the day and the expectations of nations. We are fully prepared to make our contribution to the construction of such an Organization  in the belief that - in the words of the Charter - all nations ought to ""live together in peace with one another as good neighbours""."
"115",5749,"PRT",43,1988,"ï»¿Allow me to begin by congratulating you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. I particularly want to express  on behalf of Portugal and on my own behalf  all the confidence we have in you and our conviction that positive results will be achieved owing to your professional skills and total commitment.Similarly  I wish to express my gratitude and that of my country for the generous and serious work carried out by the President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session  Mr. Peter Florin  to whom I address ray warmest greetings.1 should also like to join all those who have praised the outstanding performance of the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  and the commitment and dedication he has shown in resolving the problems which have been of such concern to us. His actions have certainly contributed to the recent awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations.Portugal as the current President of the European Community  has wide a statement on behalf of the 12 member States in which it addressed the most Important and relevant issues in the present international situation. I reaffirm our support for that statement. However  I should like to recall the importance which my Government attaches to some of those issues. It will surprise nobody if I single out first the question of East Timor As the United Nations seems to be resuming its role in the peaceful solution of conflicts  while we welcome the successes registered in the solution of several international problems of the  outmost gravity and the effective progress achieved in settling others that until now have apparently defied solution  I regret to have to refer to a question which has dragged on for years without any meaningful progress towards a just solution in accordance with the principles and fundamental resolutions of the United Nations.The question of the decolonization of East Timor is a thorn in the international conscience and a challenge to the consistency with which the essential principles of decolonization  so often invoked and reaffirmed as Î² fundamental part of the heritage of the Organization  are applied and observed. It is sad to see in the case of East Timor the flagrant and direct violation of such principles perpetrated by a country which was also subjected to colonialism and which performed such an important role in the struggle for emancipation of the colonized peoples.It is 13 years since the Non-Self-Governing Territory of East Timor  then under Portuguese administration  saw its process of decolonization interrupted when it was invaded and occupied by its powerful neighbour. Portugal does not deny its share of the responsibility for the difficulties and troubles that have affected that process since its beginnings  but we cannot accept that such events legitimise its invasion and occupation by Indonesia and the subsequent denegation of the fundamental rights and freedoms of its people  including its inalienable right to self-determination. No circumstances whatsoever could legitimise the ruthless way in which repression was waged in the Territory  with an intolerable price in human life and sacrifice.A people  numbering a few hundred thousand  which saw a fourth of its citizens killed  which is subject to an authority it did not choose and whose rights  freedoms and fundamental guarantees are restricted  demands an opportunity to choose its own political destiny.Portugal - I repeat once again - has no claim to sovereignty over the Territory of East Timor. We uphold the right to self-determination of East Timor  and we cannot understand why the occupying force  which constantly invokes the benefits brought by its administration to the well-being of the inhabitants  fears to face the result of a free act of self-determination. If  as has been argued  hearts and minds are already won over to its cause  why fear the expression of the will of the people?East Timor is for us a moral  historical and legal responsibility. The defence of the rights  freedoms and specific identity of its people - so often proclaimed in this forum as an imperative for the international community as a whole when referring to other colonial Territories - is also the collective responsibility of us all as Members of this Organization committed to the observance of its fundamental principles. We cannot ignore the drama of East Timor without becoming accomplices in an intolerable policy of fait accompli imposed by force.Portugal will do its utmost to find through dialogue a just and comprehensive solution acceptable to the international community. We are fully committed to collaborating with the Secretary-General  whose mediation efforts I acknowledge with gratitude. It is in a constructive spirit  and having in mind primarily respect Â¡for the legitimate rights and aspirations of the people of East Timor  that we envisage the continuance of this mediation process. We sincerely hope that âat spirit will also prevail on the part of Indonesia.The international community views with justified apprehension the continuing deterioration of economic conditions in a great number of countries  especially on the African continent. This situation - to which the inadequacies of prevailing models of development  the seriousness of certain structural and conjectural imbalances in the international economic order and the extreme vulnerability to natural catastrophes of many African societies  often contribute - is characterized by the stagnation of growth  high rates of inflation and a disturbing level of external indebtedness. This question was dealt with here during the session which analysed the implementation of the United Nations special Programme of Action for Africa. Without ignoring the responsibilities which primarily rest with the Africans themselves  that is only fair to recall that the member countries of the European Community have tried to create efficient schemes of aid to least developed countries. The successive LomÃ© Conventions must be singled out  because they have established a relationship of co-operation  outlined in a freely agreed legal framework. They associate the interested countries in a structure of permanent consultation which is an important forum for the development of the North-South dialogue.I should like in this context to draw attention to my country's commitment to and interest in the preparation  within the framework of the Community  of the negotiations on a new convention between the European Economic Community (EEC) and the African  Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. We believe that the relations fostered between the Community and its 66 partners in Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific are an important example in the area of co-operation and aid for development.The perspective being defined at the Community level is that sectoral interventions should be complementary to the process of development  and not mere emergency operations lacking long-term effectiveness. This is  in our view  the most effective and responsible path to pursue to aim for a progressive balance of the system of exchange so as to achieve the harmonious development of international trade. I believe that the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) deserves the continuing support of the international community  being an experiment in regional co-operation with practical achievements of major importance for the economic self-reliance of the countries of the area.The processes of structural adjustment which are being implemented by several developing countries  in a courageous way and at an obvious political and social cost  deserve growing support from the industrialized countries  through integrated actions in co-ordination with all entities taking part in financing and in an active dialogue with the beneficiary countries.For historical and cultural reasons known to all  my country pays very special attention to the question of development assistance. That serious problem now affecting the peoples and countries of the so-called third world is of great concern to us  and we are deeply committed to the search for means to solve it.Here I wish to recall the proposal made last May by the Prime Minister of Portugal in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to create in Lisbon a North-South centre  with a flexible structure  to work as a forum for a permanent exchange of views with the objective of encouraging a climate of understanding and confidence between North and South. We hope to have the support and participation of all States represented them.My country acknowledges with appreciation the increasing value which is being attached to this aspect of international relations  because that is in line with the historical role that Portugal has played in the world and corresponds fully to the way in which we envisage our place in the community of nations.Africa is of special importance to Portugal because of the historical and cultural ties which bin-l us together and which we continue to strengthen today  co-operating to the mutual benefit of and in the interest of the socio-economic progress of the countries involved. This co-operation  as the practical expression of an active political relationship  is definitely more visible in bilateral actions with the African countries whose official language is Portuguese: Cape Verde  Guinea-Bissau  Sao Tome and Principe  Angola and Mozambique. But I am pleased to note that every year Portuguese participation in the structure of multilateral machinery of great importance - namely  the LomÃ© Convention and the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference - assumes a wider expression of political and economic solidarity specially geared to realistic development priorities.In this context I believe then we can emphasize the United Nations special Programme of Action for Africa  which is clear evidence of the attention and commitment of the Organization in the quest for a solution to this problem  to which none of us can remain indifferent.In the last two months we have seen historic developments which have opened up new horizons to the peoples of Angola and Namibia  who  I believe  will overcome the long years of suffering and enjoy in the future conditions of development and progress in a climate of peace  with due respect for territorial integrity.I congratulate all those who  by their pragmatism  commitment to dialogue and readiness to yield on accessory matters to guarantee the essentials  made possible the achievement of a breakthrough in a process that dragged on for so long.In this context I wish to send a very special message of greetings and solidarity to the Angolan people and to reaffirm Portugal's readiness to do everything possible  at both the bilateral and the multilateral level  to help the People's Republic of Angola in its difficult task of achieving the reconstruction and development to which it is justly entitled. As for Mozambique  I take this opportunity to condemn once again the intolerable situation of insecurity created by a guerrilla movement supported from outside. It is high time to allow the martyred people of that country to work in peace towards a better future. Mozambique also deserves the solidarity of the international community in its struggle for peace and development.However  it is really up to the Government of South Africa to shoulder its responsibilities and give evidence of a true willingness to pursue dialogue and good-neighbourliness. This would prove that it remains faithful to the spirit and the letter of the historic Nkomati Agreement  which was recently reaffirmed at the Songo meeting. Nevertheless  I wish to reaffirm my country's conviction that complete detente in the region can be attained only through the elimination of internal tensions in the Republic of South Africa.Portugal has denounced and condemned  not only in the United Nations but also on many other occasions  the immorality and injustice that are the main features of the apartheid and bantustanization systems aimed at perpetuation of the political  economic  social and cultural discrimination that is at the heart of the continually worsening internal situation in that country. Here again we appeal to the Government in Pretoria to deal with its internal problems with the open-mindedness recently shown in the Namibia negotiations and the pursuit of peace in Angola.Any progress towards the definitive breaking-up of the apartheid system is  in this framework  a fundamental and high-priority matter. Only the eradication of apartheid will give all communities of that country access to political participation  work  security and social well-being. It is in the hands of the South African authorities  had they the political courage and awareness of the irreversibility of history  to make of the Republic a multiracial  economically advanced country  a revealing-pot of all its communities - in short  a real focal point for the development and progress that would undoubtedly have a positive impact on all southern Africa.Indeed  it is up to the South Africans - all South Africans - to decide on the best way to implement reforms  the need for which is incontrovertible. But it is clear to me that freer political expression by the black majority would undoubtedly contribute to the creation of the climate of mutual confidence indispensable for the transformation of the South African society. I cannot leave this subject without referring to the deep concern in my country at the situations of Nelson Mandela  whose seventieth birthday was recently celebrated by the international community  and the Sharpeville Six - both crying examples of injustice.Portugal  a member of the European Community and of the Atlantic Alliance  and a participant in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)  has followed East-West developments with particular attention. I note with satisfaction and confidence the clear improvement in recent months in the relations between the two super-Powers. Today  after the Washington and Moscow summits  there is a positive spirit} dialogue is more open and frequent  and decisive steps have been taken  specifically in the areas of arms control and disarmament.My country welcomed the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - as a positive and important step towards international detente  and therefore towards peace. In this connection we support the objectives already set by both parties of a 50 per cent reduction in the strategic nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union.  Portugal is confident that in the near future decisive moves will be made on conventional arms. Specifically  we hope that the existing imbalances between East and West will be corrected through a process of negotiation. This would eliminate the disproportion  thus making possible stability and security at the lowest level of armaments. He therefore have the greatest hopes of the CSCÂ£ process. My country is confident that a quick settlement at the Vienna meeting will permit the approval of a final  substantive and well-balanced document that will make possible the beginning of negotiations on conventional-weapons stability and the renewal of talks on confidence- and security-building measures.Nuclear and conventional disarmament - the guarantee of peace and security - is the indissoluble condition of the establishment of universal peace. We therefore welcome the significant progress registered in this area. However  we view with great concern the recent upsurge in the use of chemical weapons. My country  which is a signatory to the 1925 Geneva Protocol  is firmly committed to efficient  global and verifiable implementation of a convention that will ensure the total elimination of this type of weapon. It is our imperative duty to arrive expeditiously at the consensus needed to fulfil that requirement. In this context Portugal supports without reservation the proposal made in this Assembly several days ago by the President of the United States for a concerted international effort to ensure the elimination of chemical weapons.I wish to express my country's satisfaction at the cease-fire recently signed between Iran and Iraq  which should allow for a just and lasting solution of that long conflict  which has claimed so many victims. I therefore pay a tribute to the endeavours of the United Nations in persuading the parties involved to abide by Security Council resolution 598 (1987).  As for the Israeli-Arab conflict  we note with regret that the present situation is not encouraging. The serious events in the occupied territories demonstrate the fragility of previous solutions. Any lasting solution will have to take account of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and recognise the right to exist of all countries of the region. Portugal together with its European partners  believes that the expeditious convening of an international conference would provide the appropriate framework for the essential negotiations between the parties directly involved.As for Latin America  I wish to reaffirm our fraternal solidarity with the countries of that vast region  and our total readiness to contribute actively to their efforts to overcome their difficulties. 1 am convinced that the developed countries can help significantly in ameliorating these problems and in the search  together with the countries of the region  for new and imaginative forms of co-operation. The question of external indebtedness  in particular  must be seen in the context of economic growth  given that it is important to reduce the social burden that it imposes.I must also make a special reference to the situation in Central America  where the hope generated by the signing of the Esquipulas Agreement was followed by a stalemate in the peace process. Portugal believes that the solution to this situation should be sought  in the first instance  at the regional level  in a climate of mutual trust and within the framework of strict respect for human rights  pluralist democracy and the principle of the inviolability of frontiers. He have always taken into consideration the unjust and unfavourable social conditions that have contributed to the present state of affairs in that region and we therefore believe that economic co-operation among the countries of the region and the industrialized countries will also have a determining influence in achieving the desired peace and progress for the region.Reaching a political solution for Cambodia is also an imperative necessity for the international community and one which is daily becoming more pressing. It is time to restore peace  dignity and hope to a country that has been successively martyrized by the intolerance of a minority that shows disrespect for the most elementary human rights and by a foreign military occupation that cannot be legitimised under any pretext.On the other hand  the Geneva agreements on Afghanistan constitute a significant stride towards solution of a conflict which  for almost a decade  sowed suffering and misery among the Afghan people. I cannot but note the courage and spirit of self-sacrifice of the Afghan resistance and the humanitarian solidarity displayed by Pakistan in receiving millions of refugees displaced by the conflict.Peace among nations and respect for human rights are the aspiration of us all and are inseparable from the well-being of each and every individual in the world community. That well-being is closely linked to economic development and is based on sound international trade  free of protectionism  be it open or concealed.This has been the position which ray country has clearly assumed. As a member of the European Community  Portugal considers it indispensable to have reciprocity in the opening up of markets. That is our practice and a fundamental feature of the Community's trade policy. My Government firmly believes that we are in the final stage of the setting up of the institutions necessary for the full participation of Portugal in the world market  in accordance with the objectives of the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).In this perspective we recognize the importance and the opportunities provided by the Uruguay Round  the satisfactory outcome of which would  without any doubt  contribute to a better balance in the world's trade relations. I reaffirm that the goal of those negotiations will be reached only if the principle of globality is strictly upheld.The joint declaration by the European Economic Community (EEC) and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) establishing official acknowledgement between the two organizations  issued in Luxembourg on 25 June 1988  ended 30 years of non-recognition of each other by the two Europes.Aware of the historical significance of this event and of its implications for the future relationship between the two organizations and the respective member States  Portugal welcomed it and believes that a major step has been taken towards a new era of international co-operation extending to the most diverse fields. Ws trust that multilateral co-operation  reflected also in the relations between the EEC and the European Free Trade Association  the Association of South-East Asian Nations and the Gulf Co-operation Council  will be expanded and intensified.The commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should provide support to the efforts of the international community to ensure the exercise of the rights and fundamental freedoms inherent in the human person everywhere in the world. Now that the United Nations already has available to it several international instruments for defining and guaranteeing such rights  it is therefore important to ensure their effective implementation and the strengthening of international control mechanisms. As a priority of its foreign policy  Portugal contributes to the promotion and protection of human rights. In the United Nations Commission on Human Rights  my country has striven to comply with the mandate entrusted to it  rejecting duplicity of criteria and working towards the strengthening of the effectiveness of existing mechanisms. To achieve full enjoyment of the fundamental freedoms of each individual  it is indispensable to keep in mind the complementary nature of civil and political rights and economic  social and cultural rights.Throughout the past five centuries  Portugal has enriched its history  its culture and its language in all parts of the world. That would be enough to justify its interest in the international scene. Such an interest acquires a new and powerful thrust when one consider the committed and active participation of my country in many international organizations - from the United Nations to the EEC  from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to the Council of Europe  to mention only a few.We are aware  however  that it is not enough simply to observe the international scene and to react to events. Together with other countries of good will Portugal has a part to play in combating situations of injustice and war which  unfortunately  still occur. We have to overcome inertia and mobilize wills in order to change ineffective practices of co-operation. Above all  we must work hard to co-ordinate efforts to ensure that existing or potentially dangerous situations do not prevail. And  if present solutions do not work  we must search with daring and creativity for new ones.Portugal once again reiterates its availability and willingness to contribute to efforts to ensure that we may all enjoy more peace in security  more freedom in democracy  more solidarity in prosperity."
"116",5795,"PRY",43,1988,"ï»¿At the outset of this statement before the forty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  we extend our respectful greetings to the President  Mr. Dante Caputo  Minister of Foreign Relations and Worship of the Republic of Argentina  and we sincerely hope that  under his wise guidance  this session will be crowned with success and result in meaningful solutions towards international peace and security.Similarly  we hail our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  to whom we express our gratitude for his tireless and fruitful efforts for peace at a time when his worthy endeavours have brought the world lofty victories that lend this Organisation a role of universal leadership. Just recognition of these efforts is clearly expressed by the recent award of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces  to our great satisfaction.Since 1945 the Republic of Paraguay has never doubted that the world needs an Organization respected by all States  based on international law and the noble principles of justice  peace and security  which would at all times guarantee the peaceful settlement of disputes  continuing social and economic development  respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States  and other no less important principles  such as the territorial integrity of States and the equality of all countries under the law.We have never understood the position of those States which  forgetting their moral obligations to the Organization  do not take advantage of this forum for the settlement of international conflicts  thus depriving the United Nations of its leading role  which must be recognized because of the purposes for which it was founded.Today our hopes are rising once more because the importance of the United Nations is being recognized with new understanding wherever problems of international law have to be solved  thanks to the productive work of the Secretary-General and his special representatives and to the change of attitude which at last seems to have occurred  so that States are  prepared to reach solutions to their disputes with the help of our Organization.On behalf of the Republic of Paraguay  I wish to express our satisfaction at the good news that preceded the opening of this session of the General Assembly of the possibility of chronic conflicts being solved through the effective intervention of our Organization. We hope that time will prove that we are right  that what now presents itself as merely the glimmer of a solution will become an effective reality  to the benefit of all peoples  and that It may be said once  again that there was a moment in history when Governments gave the United Nations effective means of solving problems that had seemed insoluble. Such is the case with regard to the Persian Gulf war the gradual withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan  the possibility that foreign soldiers will be withdrawn from CambodiaÂ·  the possibility of a peace agreement between Angola  Cuba and the Republic of South Africa; and the beginning of a dialogue  in auspicious conditions  between the two communities in Cyprus.I cannot do better than recall here certain passages from the statement made in this forum by the President of the Republic of Paraguay  General Alfredo Stroessner  at the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We said: âI am honoured to bring to this lofty forum the voice of the Republic of Paraguay  the thinking of a nation truly dedicated to peace  which shares universal ideals of security  freedom  justice and development. The Republic of Paraguay firmly upholds the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States  the legal equality oÂ£ nations and the self-determination of peoples. In all international forums we maintain clear positions in favour of relations between nations based on fair legal principles of mutual respect and co-operation.In the United Nations and in the Organization of American States (OAS)  we uphold the principles of friendship and co-operation  with full confidence in the beneficial results that accrue whenever relations between States are established with goodwill and in a spirit of solidarity. At all international events  conferences and meetings we speak the constructive language of peace  thus projecting the reality being led by the Republic of Paraguay. Paraguayan constitutional law takes as its essential principles respect for international law; condemnation of wars of aggression and conquest and all forms of colonialism and imperialism  the peaceful settlement of international disputes by lawful means; respect for human rights and the sovereignty of peoples; and the aspiration to live at peace with all nations."" (A/S-lS/PV e  pp. 3  4)The desire of the peoples for a genuine peace that will improve their relations with each other is universal. Nations  without exception  cherish international law and view with concern the unilateral decisions taken by certain States in their relations with other countries  which damage not only the prestige of the United Nations but also the essential principles of its Charter  the purpose of whose adoption was to banish the evil of war  injustice  the predominance of brute force  foreign intervention in the affairs of other States  and all the other evils that affect the relations between peoples.My country takes this opportunity to express its gratitude to the whole United Nations system for the work it does in all areas  and especially for the efforts made on behalf of land-locked countries with a relatively low degree of development. We are grateful for the continuing assistance of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  which has carried out and follows up so many projects all over the world to reset the need for technology to be at the disposal of less developed countries. At the risk of repeating ourselves  we must say that this victory of our times puts an inescapable moral obligation on the wealthiest countries at a time when extreme poverty robs men of their dignity in so many parts of the world. The poor in La tin America number 173 million. Of this number  in 1985  61 million lived in extreme poverty. If this trend continues  the poor in Latin America will number 204 million by 1990  according to the UNDP. That body also says that there is a social debt of 3280 million - the sum that these countries would have to invest to eradicate poverty.These really shocking figures must  of course  be seen in relation to the foreign debt problem of the countries of Latin America  at a time when development demands new investments  and the prices of raw materials from the developing world are not remunerative. Although the Republic of Paraguay  fortunately  is not in the same situation as many other countries of the region  we feel complete solidarity with all those who see their future jeopardized by this problem  which is so radically bound up with development and the improvement of living standards. This problem requires not only economic but also political solutions which recognize the moral obligation of the super-industrialized world to the less developed countries. In 1987 the regional foreign debt amounted to $410 billion  and in the last five years the continent has remitted 3150 billion to the international banking system just for debt servicing  amortization and interest  without reducing the capital debt  which in fact has increased because of new loans  in a dangerous race between attempts to improve the life of the majority of our peoples and the unfair distribution of income between North and South.The problem of the foreign debt is so serious that recent United Nations reports advise creditors to reduce the amounts owed by up to 30 per cent  because otherwise there will be no possibility of fulfilling commitments or resolving satisfactorily the problems deriving from this troubling question. Highly specialized Latin American technical organizations have expressed the opinion that solution of the foreign debt problem is very closely related to an increase of trade in the region and a substantial improvement in the prices for commodities at which the debtor countries sell to the industrialised world.The Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization deserves our praise. We ate familiar with the Secretary-General's commitment to fulfil his difficult and noble responsibilities as a man of peace  conciliation und dialogue at the international level. There are always factors which undermine world order and peace and which are not precisely within the area of competence of the United Nations  but time has shown that selfish  unilateral decisions are becoming more rare  especially in the light of what is happening at the present time  which shows that the work of the Organization and the Secretary-General is having positive results  despite the many difficulties on the thorny path of peace  justice and the peaceful settlement of disputes. The Republic of Paraguay is experiencing an encouraging growth in its economy. For example  the rate of growth of our gross national product  which was 4.3 per cent in 1987  has reached almost 6 per cent this year as a consequence of good prospects  basically in the agricultural sector. Therefore  despite the adverse world economic conditions  the Republic of Paraguay - according to a report by the World Bank - is among the countries with the highest average rate of growth during the past two decades. Sources in the Economic Commission for Latin America confirm that the cumulative growth rate of the gross national product from 1980 to 1987 was 16.9 per cent - one of the highest rates among the Latin American non-oil-exporting countries.This forward movement of the Paraguayan economy is the result of putting into effect a plan to give an impetus to the economy  that has been done with discipline and austerity  in a climate of peace and serenity.The economic and financial strategy and the great efforts that have been exerted have had and still have the objective of achieving continuing development  to counteract the adverse trends in the terms of trade  the burden of amortizations and interest payments  and the low investment inflow. Those factors compel all the developing countries to take strong economic adjustment measures.Nevertheless  despite the unsteady evolution of the world economy owing to restrictions on international trade and the Latin American external-debt problems  the Republic of Paraguay continues its efforts to promote a better quality of life  education and public health within the country; it also continues to encourage agricultural and industrial development as well as doing a great deal of work on the basic infrastructure. On the other hand  because of the brotherly ties of friendship between my country and its neighbours  we have in mind large-scale integration projects which will have a broad and favourable impact on development within Latin America. In that regard  it should be noted that  with the beginning of the commercial operation of turbines 12 and 13  envisaged for the end of this year  Itaipu - the largest dam in the world  built jointly with the Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil - will generate 9 100 000 kilowatts. Similarly  there has been no interruption in the construction of the Yacireta hydroelectric dam on the Parana River  with a power of 4 050 000 kilowatts  or the construction of an international 2 600-metre bridge  which is now nearing completion. Both projects are being carried out in conjunction with the Argentine Republic. These large undertakings have already had the following positive effectsÂ·  the availability of abundant electric powerÂ·  possibilities for electro-intensive industries and the export of the energy from those industriesÂ·  the electrification of villages and towns in the interior of the country  from which 289 communities have so far benefited.We should also emphasize the facilities that are granted to us by brotherly countries in free ports such as Paranagua and Rio Grande do Sur in Brazil  Rosario and Buenos Aires in Argentina  Nueva Palmira and Montevideo in Uruguay  Antofagasta in Chile  and Matarani in PeruÂ·  the latter two are on the Pacific coast.I mention those examples of growth  efforts and sacrifices in order to demonstrate the vigour of a Government that is aware of its responsibilities and is seeking a quality of life for its people that is in keeping with the progress of our civilization.On 15 August this year  a new period in the life of the Government began  in conformity with the national Constitution. That Constitution was promulgated in 1967; it was the undisputed product of the National Constituent Assembly  made up of four political parties. The elections for the five-year period 1988 to 1993 were free and direct  in accordance with the provisions of the electoral law. The right to vote was exercised  as usual  with many options and within the specific time-limit established by the law. The three branches of State power are functioning freely  and the nation is moving towards the attainment of better goals of progress and development in a multi-patty environment open to all democratic political trends that are in keeping with legal rules that are the same for everyone.The Persian Gulf war has been and still is a matter of concern to the Republic of Paraguay. It appears that the war has come to an end  thanks to the skilful negotiations carried out by the Secretary-General and to the moral authority of our Organization. We applaud the good spirit shown by the parties involved  who have rejected intolerance and chosen  instead  conciliatory dialogue. The Republic of Paraguay hopes that these efforts will succeed  so that world peace may be strengthened.Another cardinal subject among the International conflicts threatening international peace and security continues to be the thorny question of Afghanistan. That question can be summed up as armed intervention by a super-Power that shows contempt for the principles of the self-determination of peoples and non-intervention in the internal affairs of nations. The news about the gradual withdrawal of the occupying troops indicates another extraordinary achievement by the United Nations. That is a source of satisfaction to the international community and a sign that international practice is again moving towards respect for the sovereignty of States  in accordance with another principle  the juridical equality of nations. We hope that the withdrawal of all the troops will soon be a fact  for the sake of the institutions on which the ethical order of international life and respect among nations is based. We note with interest the developments in the informal talks that were held recently  at the request of Indonesia and other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations  to consider the serious problem of Kampuchea in the context of the search for a long-term political solution in keeping with the resolutions of our Organization. The withdrawal of the foreign military forces remains the pre-condition for the restoration of Kampuchea's sovereignty  independence and self-determination.The problems of the Middle East and Lebanon persist. There has still been no positive response to efforts by the international community to restore peaceful and tolerant coexistence to that region. In response to the call for a peace conference concerning the region  dissident voices have been raised alleging that such a peace conference would be useless; but no suggestions have been made for an alternative under which the parties could give up their radical  conflicting positions. The Republic of Paraguay repeats that any arrangement that is reached must be in accordance with the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  and that two fundamental principles must be respected in any resolution that may be adopted full recognition of the sovereign existence of the State of Israel  and the Palestinian people's right to exist and to have a homeland. The problem of Lebanon continues to be of concern to all men and women in the world. It is time to end this irrational war that has destroyed a country which was a centre of peace and progress but in which today these is an ever-increasing spirit of belligerency and destruction.The recent events with regard to the Cyprus question open up encouraging prospects for the solution of the problem  as the Secretary-General points out in his report. The parties have resumed their talks  and with the good offices which the Security Council has requested the Secretary-General to exercise  commitments to co-operate have been made. The Republic of Paraguay very much hopes that through direct dialogue between the parties  and with the Secretary-General following up the progress achieved in the preliminary stages  the fundamental objective desired by the international community can be achieved - that is  to see the people of Cyprus living in peace and harmony within the concert of nations.The Government of the Republic of Paraguay  in accordance with a tradition that has not varied since it participated in the founding of the United Nations  will lend its solidarity and co-operation to any initiatives that obtain the required consensus to be put into effect  for the good of the Organization and the international community - initiatives ranging from the financial strengthening of the institution to the peaceful solution of the various problems with which it is confronted. The position of Paraguay on human rights has always been one based on justice without giving offence  with a view to maintaining the highest levels of coexistence between Governments and nations. Similarly  the right to life  liberty and property are and will continue to be guaranteed by the terms of the Constitution and by law  in keeping with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.The Republic of Paraguay has in all forums always rejected both the nuclear and the conventional arms race  since it entails wasting billions of dollars while there is an urgent need for economic and social development. International security  the process of development and peace based on respect for the dignity of all nations  law and the right to life can be achieved only by the cessation of the arms race both in the rich industrialized countries and in countries that need these resources to promote their development.Another scourge on mankind that negatively affects the very structure of human life is terrorism. This practice continues to undermine the moral order of human existence and its fatal consequences have shocked nations that cherish peace  order and respect for human life without distinction of any kind  such as nationality  colour  origin or opinion. It is time to be frank and ask ourselves whether our countries and our Organization have done enough to put an end to this horrendous scourge  for there is nothing so cowardly in the world and in the history of mankind as the murder of innocent human beings under the pretext of calling attention to certain issues that cannot be resolved in this way  by destroying man and his social institutions. The Republic of Paraguay  which has not experienced this madness that is terrorism or armed violence  urges all Member States which usually blame the existence of this evil on underlying causes to change their attitude and unreservedly support all initiatives to eliminate terrorism from the world. There is only one alternative for our Organization; either all countries agree to combat this cruel and bloody practice with all the force of morality and law or the Organization will lose its prestige and credibility before the peoples of the world  who see in the United Nations a valuable and irreplaceable instrument for putting an end to international terrorism.My country's Government is combating the scourge of drugs with all its legal and moral strength. As the President of Paraguay  General Alfredo Stroessner  said before the General Assembly.""With the Constitution and the laws  we are confronting those who are trying to weaken our free institutions  the detestable agents of that social cancer  the drug traffic."" (A/S-15/PV.8  p. 11)Our country has joined world efforts to terminate this pernicious activity. It took part in the last Vienna Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking and is giving full effect to the Declaration and broad plan of action which emanated from that international conference. Our legislative branch is currently engaged in preparing a new law to suppress drug trafficking  for we know that our legislation must reflect this sad moment for mankind which is destabilizing its free institutions and corrupting the human person.Vie firmly believe that our Organization has now readied a high point in its activities for international peace and security. We trust that its valuable co-operation with the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Latin American Economic System (SBLA) will continue to increase in the quest for a better future for our region and for all the world  for no one doubts the need for the existence and activities of regional organizations. The Republic of Korea has always been a country under international strict juridical order  respecting the law  ethical norms and international law. My Government understands that there is no obstacle standing in the way of its admission to the Organization  while keeping open the possibility for the People's Republic of Korea to do likewise. This request is justified by the fact that the United Nations must become increasingly universal  without any exceptions.We fully appreciate what the law of the sea means to the world in the context of an increasingly interdependent and participating international community where countries are seeking agreements on improving the use of the resources of the sea without discrimination. My country firmly believes that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is proof of the progress made by mankind towards fairer goals. The Republic of Paraguay ratified that international instrument and will support its applicability in all forums of the world.The world is closely following the work of this session of the General Assembly in this crucial time for the peaceful coexistence of peoples  when the media are reporting the activities of the Organization with regard to well-known hotbeds of conflict  death  desolation  misery and pain.It is necessary to redouble our efforts in order to promote peace and security and overcome understandable differences and existing ideologies  united in our desire to serve mankind  making sure that the terror of war and the next war could indeed be the last if nuclear weapons are used - will never again grip the world. Let us continue together in the search for a future of love and understanding between men and peoples where no room is left for the hatred that kills  the hunger that undermines the dignity of the King of Creation  the terror that petrifies and converts us into wild beasts  and the intolerance that denigrates the moral quality of life in society. That is the only hope left to us in view of the arsenals that have been built up in the world. It is up to us  through conciliation  to convert this aspiration into reality.We trust that the Supreme Creator will enlighten us and give us the necessary moral strength to continue to work for a world of peace and justice."
"117",5860,"QAT",43,1988,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to congratulate the President on his election to guide the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I am confident that his wisdom and experience will contribute effectively to the achievement of the results we all seek through strenuous efforts to find constructive solutions to the problems of international peace and security through the co-operation of all the peoples of the world. My pleasure is all the greater because the President represents a country with which mine maintains positive and constructive co-operation.The experienced leadership given by his predecessor at the forty-second session of the General Assembly earned him the gratitude and recognition it is now my pleasure to express.We also wish to express our appreciation and thanks to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his distinguished service to our Organization in pursuance of the goals and political objectives of the Charter.We are now witnessing hopeful international developments in the direction of dialogue and peaceful coexistence after a critical period of tension and confrontation. We join with the international community in hailing these welcome developments. We hope that this new atmosphere will help bring about just solutions to problems affecting many of the peoples of the world  f ere race t among which are problems such as regional wars  foreign occupation  denial of the rights of other peoples  external hegemony  economic exploitation  terrorism end degradation of the environment. It is encouraging to note the new awareness of the impasse reached in the arms race and  as a result  the conclusion of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles between the United States and the Soviet Union. We also welcome the agreement on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan  and the first steps taken towards solving the problem of Namibia  the Iran-Iraq war  and a number of other regional issues. We hope that this new awareness of the futility of military force will pave the way towards the settlement of other conflicts around the world and that the year 1988 will be the gateway to world peace.My delegation salutes the popular uprising - the intifada - in the occupied territories of Palestine against the Fascist policies  encroachments and depredations of the Zionist entity in the holy places of Palestine  We strongly condemn the violent repressive measures  including deportation and the use of terrorist tactics practised by the Zionist entity against the unarmed Palestinian people  including women  children and the elderly.The valiant resistance and steadfastness of the Palestinian people under occupation are the measure of its categorical rejection of the status quo imposed by Israel and of that people's Insistence on its right to self-determination  to preservation of its national character and the full exercise of its national rights on the whole of its territory.The intifada and the new facts it brought to light have negated Israeli propaganda's false claims to democracy. The new facts expose Israel before the whole world and starkly underline its Fascist practices and expansionist policies expressed in such abhorrent measures as deportation  imprisonment without due process  demolition of homes  confiscation of property  the establishment of colonial-type settlements and the continued transgression on the al-Aqsa mosque and other holy places in Palestine. Israel has to learn the lessons of history and reconsider its policies in light of these new facts which belie the ""secure boundaries"" argument invoked as a pretext for continued occupation and creeping annexation  in violation of the United Nations Charter and its resolutions  the norms of international law and the Geneva Convention of 1949 on the protection of the civilian population in time of war.We reaffirm our unlimited support for the Palestinian people's uprising and call upon the world body and all peace-loving forces in the world to shoulder their historic responsibilities and do what is necessary to put an end to attempts at genocide and the policy of expulsion and deportation practised by Israel and aimed at driving out the legitimate inhabitants oÂ£ Palestine and the occupied territories from their homeland.Just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East cannot be founded on repression  terrorism and killing. It can only be built on a foundation of justice and respect for human rights and international norms of conduct. This can only be achieved by recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  foremost among which is the right to self-determination and the establishment of its own State on its national territory.From this perspective  the Amman summit meeting of Arab States unanimously declared that the only way to solve the problem in a fair and comprehensive manner is the convening of an international peace conference  with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (FLO)  on an equal footing  as the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The international community is leaning towards reaching a definitive solution along those lines.The State of Qatar declares its support for all steps the PLO might take in its capacity as the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We welcome the acceptance by Iran of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  which had been accepted by Iraq when it was adopted. This acceptance carries great potential for the establishment of a just peace between two neighbourly Muslim nations  Iran and Iraq.We express the hope that Iran and Iraq will be able to resolve all the problems between them in a peaceful  just and comprehensive fashion  thus safeguarding their respective interests and consolidating the peace and stability of the region in the best interests of their peoples and of the whole Arab and Islamic world.In this regard  we commend the fruitful efforts of the Secretary-General  which were crowned by a cease-fire between the two warring neighbours. We reaffirm our support for his continued efforts to achieve the lasting peace for which we all yearn.The State of Qatar  together with the other sister nations members of the Gulf Co-operation Council  stands ready to make every effort to ensure the success of the peace talks between Iran and Iraq. Despite all the difficulties  we are confident that negotiations will continue until a real  just and permanent peace is achieved and the stability of the Gulf region restored.The State of Qatar welcomes the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and hopes that conditions in that country will be stabilized so that the Afghan people can devote its efforts to rebuilding the country and determining its own course.The current situation in Africa is one of our main concerns. The South African regime represents the antithesis of what the United Nations was intended to embody  namely  the negation of repression and discrimination. The United Nations should intensify its efforts aimed at putting an end to the inhumane and immoral regime of apartheid. That regime cannot be reformed; it must be dismantled. We condemn the new racist legislation on residential segregation and fully support the just struggle of the peoples of South Africa  Namibia  and the other countries in southern Africa. We call upon the international co unity  especially those countries which can influence South Africa's policies  to support the struggle of the people of southern Africa and compel South Africa's racist authorities to renounce their policies of apartheid and their attempts at destabilising the neighbouring countries.We commend the efforts of those parties which seek a solution to the problem of Namibia by putting an end to South Africa's illegal occupation and paving the way foe Namibia's independence. We hope that the current negotiations will bring a halt to military operations on the Angolan border  ensure Namibia's independence and eventually do away with apartheid. The ever-growing nuclear arsenals of the two super-Powers are a persistent threat to the survival of the human race. We therefore welcome the initial agreement reached by the United States and the Soviet Union on the elimination of medium-range nuclear missiles. We hope that this agreement is the harbinger of other agreements on radical reductions of their strategic missiles and on the prevention of an arms race in outer space. The decision to conduct negotiations on nuclear testing should lead to the early conclusion of a treaty banning all such tests. At the Geneva Conference on Disarmament  the adoption of a convention prohibiting chemical weapons seems now more than ever before to be within ready. That result should speedily be achieved.Another Important problem is that of international terrorism. It is a complex problem that endangers the stability of States and affects their mutual relations. Moreover  terrorist activities pose a wanton threat to life  limb and property. While international co-operation and the enactment of co-ordinated measures at the domestic level are needed to combat terrorism  it is necessary also to understand the true nature of international terrorism.We must also condemn terrorism practised by or under the direct supervision of States. Colonialism  Zionism and racist and hegemonist regimes indulge in State terrorism through armed aggression against sovereign States and interference in their internal affairs  and the expulsion from their homes and assassination of Innocent people. Colonialism  Zionism and racism are all sources of widespread international terrorism  which constitutes a threat to peace and security and is condemned by the peoples of the world.It is of prime importance to draw a clear distinction between evil acts of terrorism and the legitimate struggle of national liberation movements. The state of the world economy is a source of deep concern. Despite all efforts to assemble the prerequisites for development  the rate of growth in industrialized nations has been less than expected. In the developing world  dwindling returns on the export of raw materials and high interest rates on foreign debts have critically affected the financial resources of developing countries. This situation has a negative impact on economic performance and diminishes the possibility of growth through development.The indebtedness of the developing world continues to be the main obstacle to growth. It lowers the already low standard of living of the poorest of the poor. The heavy debt burden complicates all attempts at structural improvements in the economic policies of the countries concerned. All efforts at restructuring and at better mobilization of local resources are hampered by the immediate claims of debt servicing and thus fail to produce the expected rapid results. The problem of the effects of debt servicing on developing countries needs to be re-examined in a world-wide context. In allocating financial aid  the needs of the least developed countries should be given the special consideration they deserve.Against that background  the State of Qatar welcomes the positive achievements of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Implementation of the recommendations in the Final Act of that session could lead to specific progress in co-operation in dealing with the current acute crisis in international economic relations.In conclusion  I wish to state that  even though changing conditions since the inception of the United Nations may have required changes in the Organization's methods of work  the lofty purposes and principles of the Organization remain as relevant as ever. The importance of the role played by the United Nations on the world scene has been enhanced. It is more than ever necessary for us all to renew our commitment to the Charter principles  for the sake of a better world for our peoples and the future of mankind in general."
"118",5906,"ROU",43,1988,"ï»¿It gives me particular pleasure on behalf of the President of the Socialist Republic of Romania  to convey to you  Mr. President  as well as to the Secretary-General  cordial greetings and best wishes for success in your highly responsible function; strengthening the role of the United Nations in  and its contribution to  the solution of crucial issues of our world.It is my great privilege  on the instructions of the President of Romania  Nicolae Ceausescu  to present his thoughts and proposals on the main issues of international life  which are to be found on the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly. Romania considers that  although in the year which has elapsed since the preceding session some steps have been taken in the direction of nuclear disarmament and the solution through negotiations of international disputes  the situation in the world continues to be particularly grave and complex. No radical turn has been achieved towards peace  security and co-operation  the increase of mutual confidence  respect for equality between States  non-interference in their internal affairs  and respect for the independence and sovereignty of each State.The quantitative and qualitative arms race has continued unabated  stimulated by research and the development of new nuclear weapons. Grave conflicts are continuing in some parts of the world  constituting potential threats to world peace and security. The world economic crisis  which has particularly aggravated the condition of the developing countries  has resulted in deepening the gap between the rich and the poor countries and has become a real obstacle to the progress of all States.In view of the danger that the arms race presents for the present and the future or mankind  Romania submitted to the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament its considerations and proposals on disarmament issues and on the course of action that States should take for their solution.As members know  the special session concluded with no decision  thereby disregarding the wishes and expectations of the great majority of the peoples of the world. Nevertheless  it strongly demonstrated the almost unanimous decision of all States and peoples to put an end to the harmful policy of armaments and to proceed resolutely  before it is too late  with concrete disarmament measures.The interests of world peace and security require the United Nations to make full use of the many proposals and ideas put forward by all States at the special session  in order further to increase its role in multilateral negotiations. In view oÂ£ present international conditions and proceeding front the reality that the intensification of the arms race  especially the nuclear across race  constitutes a grave danger for international peace and security  Romania submits to the attention of this world forum the following measures which it believes should be taken: the adoption by the United Nations of a comprehensive programme for nuclear and general disarmament  which would take into account the proposals submitted by all States at the recent special session; the adoption by the General Assembly of a call on the Soviet Union and the United States of America to conclude the treaty on the 50 per cent reduction of their strategic weapons at the earliest possible time; the prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests and the curbing of the development of all such weapons  as well as of new military technologies and weapons of mass destruction; the prevent Ð» of the extension of the arms race into outer space and the adoption of measures conducive to the renunciation of the militarization of outer space  which should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes; the prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons  along with actions aimed at reducing and eliminating nuclear armaments; the reduction of military budgets  including the adoption of unilateral measures and the basis setting of mutual examples; the undertaking of measures conducive to Îµ sizeable reduction In the number of troops and conventional armaments and military expenditures - in this respect  negotiations on conventional disarmament In Europe should start later this year; encouragement by the United Nations of the creation of zones free of nuclear and chemical weapons in the Balkans and in other regions of the world; the strengthening of the role and the capacity of the United Nations to act in the field of peace and disarmament  as well as the role of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. Among the actions to be taken in order to proceed with the implementation of concrete disarmament measures  ate the finalization and adoption by the United Nations of the principles to govern the negotiation and conclusion of agreements on the reduction of military expenditures. Likewise  we propose the adoption of the report on the economic and social consequences of the arms race and military expenditures  prepared by the Secretary-General with the assistance of a group of experts. The report should be brought to the attention of States  negotiating bodies and public opinion.We also believe that  in order to promote peaceful solutions to disputes and conflicts  the General Assembly should prepare a mandate that would enable it to bring to a successful outcome the initiative submitted by Romania at previous sessions on a procedure to establish a commission of good offices  mediation or conciliation for the peaceful settlement of disputes. At the same time  we believe that work should be continued to identify and clarify the elements which are to constitute the background for an international document on the development and strengthening of good-neighbourly relations among States. The creation of a climate of durable peace and security requires resolute action by all states to educate peoples  including the young generation  in the spirit of mutual confidence and respect  and of the need for co-operation among peoples. It also requires repudiation of any action that would contribute to discord between nations. With this in mind  Romania requested the inclusion of a new item on the agenda   entitled ""Responsibility of States to ban in their territory  and to refrain from instigating or supporting in the territory of other States  chauvinistic  racist and other manifestations that may cause discord between peoples and involvement of Gov err n Â¡cents and the mass media in combating such manifestations and in educating peoples and youth in the spirit of peaceful co-operation and international entente} and evaluation of the implementation of the Declaration on the Promotion among Youth of the Ideals of Peace  Mutual Respect and Understanding between Peoples"".Tb this end  Romania submits the followingUnited Nations programmes should provide that Governments will not permit such manifestations and activities and will not instigate or support such acts on the territory of other States. At the same time  United Nations programmes should emphasize the need to promote measures to educate peoples and the young generation in the spirit of the noble ideals of peace  mutual respect and understanding among peoples.The United Nations should address a call to all States for the adoption of concrete measures against those political circles and groupings which promote chauvinism  racism and apartheid and which foster an atmosphere of mistrust between States  discord between peoples and misinformation vis-Ã -vis international public opinion.We believe that the Commission for Social Development should be entrusted with the task of reviewing the Implementation of such measures and submitting a report thereon to the General Assembly at its next session. Taking into account the fact that the year 1990 will mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption  at the initiative of Romanian of the Declaration on the Promotion among Youth of the Ideals of Peace  Mutual Respect and Understanding between Peoples  it would be useful to evaluate the practical results of this international document.A dramatic reality of our days  which deeply affects the health and the environment of our planet and of its-peoples  is the continuous proliferation of ail sources of pollution of the atmosphere  soil  marine environment and outer space. At the same time  in some countries large quantities of toxic radioactive and polluting substances and wastes continue to accumulate. Lately there has been an increase in attempts to transfer such wastes abroad and deposit them on the territories of other States  usually in less developed countries  or dump them in international waters.In order to eradicate this phenomenon  Romania requested the inclusion on the agenda of a special item entitled: ""Responsibility of States for the protection of the environment and prevention of environmental pollution as a result of the accumulation of toxic and radioactive wastes  and strengthening of international co-operation for the purpose of resolving the problem."" To this end  we submit the following.A system of universal norms should be established aimed at preventing  by all possible means  such practices and at prosecuting those responsible for such offences. Specific rules should be adopted which would establish the concrete responsibility of States under whose jurisdiction activities resulting in radioactive and toxic wastes are taking place  as well as the responsibility of the producing firms  for the damage caused by fraudulent trans-boundary movements and the dumping of wastes on the territories of other States or in international waters. A group of experts should be established  within the framework of the United Nations Environment Programme  which would consider the question of adopting certain guidelines and mandatory norms to be observed by all States.Preparatory work should be started with a view to convening  in 1992  a Second United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  which would lay the groundwork for broad international co-operation in the field of environmental protection  taking account of the concerns and proposals of all States.Romania is deeply concerned about the world economic situation  which continues to deteriorate  and the worsening condition of the developing countries  whose external debt exceeds one trillion dollars. The problems of the world economy cannot be resolved by a few countries alone  however developed they may be. It requires the active participation of all States. In this light  we submit the following.The United Nations should make a thorough assessment of the way in which the principles and the essential provisions of the Declaration and of the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  as well as of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  have been implemented. Such an assessment could be done next year  in view of the fact that  in 1989  15 years will have elapsed since their adoption. It should result in the preparation of some guidelines for United Nations action in the field of the world economy until the year 2000.In this regard  particular attention should be paid to finding ways and means for resolving the external debt crisis of the developing countries; to revitalizing the world economy and ensuring conditions for reviving the active role of the developing countries in the general process of economic growth; to restructuring the monetary and financial system and to democratizing international financial organizations to eliminating discriminatory practices and barriers from world trade; to refraining from the imposition of trade embargoes and other measures of economic coercion on political grounds} and to ensuring unrestricted access by all States to science and technology.The General Assembly should call upon all States to assume a greater responsibility for the present state of the world economy and to engage fully in genuine negotiations on those issues within the framework of the United Nations. Such negotiations should be attended by all States  both developed and developing  and pursue the objective of reactivating the international economic dialogue. They should be aimed at solving the serious problems of the world economy  eliminating underdevelopment and restructuring international economic relations on a new  more just and more equitable basis.A special body should be established within the United Nations to deal with the problem of external debt  and a corresponding organizational structure should be set up within the United Nations Secretariat  through redistribution of existing personnel. Such a body would consider the various aspects of the external debt problem and elaborate specific proposals for solving it  in the multilateral framework offered by the United Nations system.In line with its general policy of peace and broad co-operation with all countries  Romania advocates elimination of the use or threat of force in international relations. It upholds the solution of conflicts and disputes in all parts of the world solely by political means  through negotiations and strict observance of the right of each people to independence and free development  without any interference in its internal affairs and with full respect for its vital interests. Along these lines with regard to the situation in the Middle East  it would be of particular importance to convene as soon as possible a conference under the auspices of the United Nations  in which all interested countries should participate. Including the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel  as well as the permanent members of the Security Council.He welcome the cessation of the war between Iran and Iraq and we hope that  in the framework of the negotiations which started under the auspices of the United Nations  all necessary efforts will be deployed - by each of the two sides - to find mutually acceptable solutions leading to a final settlement of the Gulf conflict. Thus a dangerous hotbed and a threat to peace and security in that region and in the world as a whole would be eliminated.Romania has been actively supporting the national liberation struggle of peoples and is firmly in favour of the elimination of any neo-colonial policies and strict observance of the right of every nation to assert itself according to its own aspirations. In this spirit  we support the efforts made  in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  for the accession of Namibia to independence  which would eliminate one more remnant of colonialism. Likewise we support all initiatives for the peaceful settlement of other problems in the south and west of Africa  as well as in other regions of the world.We also reiterate our solidarity with and active support for the initiatives of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea and its political and diplomatic efforts and actions aimed at the peaceful  democratic and independent reunification of Korea. The evolution of international events makes it necessary  today more than ever  that the United Nations act with all resolve to strengthen its role and its contribution  as well as to increase the efficiency of its decisions  in solving the crucial problems of our world. That would fully respond to the aspirations of all peoples for peace  co-operation  independence and social progress.To attain that goal we support the need to improve and simplify the machinery of the United Nations Secretariat and to reduce budgetary expenses. This should be done  however  in such way that the basic political and economic activities of the United Nations are not diminished and its democratic structures not affected.To that end we should consider whether a larger part of the United Nations activities could not be organized on a voluntary basis  without financial implications for the budget of the Organization. We believe that the General Assembly's decisions to cut the staff from 15 to 25 per cent could be implemented at a more speedy pace and that expenses for existing staff be given a more rational basis.In our view  consideration should also be given to the possibility that a State whose nationals in the Secretariat exceed the quota allotted to it be requested to cover the expenses incurred for that part of its personnel above the quota.The final result of the implementation of such measures would be to cut administrative expenses in half. A part of the resources thus saved could be allotted to setting up funds intended for specific activities of the United Nations  mainly for the support of the developing countries  or for other fundamental objectives incumbent upon the United Nations in solving the major issues of international life.While submitting these considerations and proposals  the Romanian delegation is ready to act in close constructive co-operation with all other delegations  in a spirit of mutual receptivity  so that the decisions adopted fully respond to the trust placed in the United Nations by peoples all over the world. Our actions should respond to their aspirations for the cessation of the arms race and the elimination of under-development  for a better world.As President Nicolae Ceausescu recently emphasized: ""Although the world situation  as a whole  is complex and serious  we share the confidence that the peoples and the progressive political forces  have the necessary strength to change for the better the course of events  to ensure and impose disarmament  peace and a new economic world order.âFrom this rostrum I would like to reaffirm the unflinching resolve of the Socialist Republic of Romania to act along with the rest of the international community  within the framework of the United Nations  for peace  co-operation  disarmament and security in the world."
"119",5952,"RUS",43,1988,"ï»¿As my first duty  permit me  Sir  to congratulate you on your election to the important and honourable post of President of the General Assembly at the current session.We are meeting at a remarkable time. Though it may appear quite unremarkable on the working calendar of our Organization  it is a time filled with extraordinary events - events that can become the norm for the life of mankind if we succeed in turning them into a trend. Such  in our view  should be the main thrust of the current session  which in many respects is a watershed for the world community. I am referring to a new world calendar which is being created by the efforts of States and peoples  by the efforts of the United Nations. A character in the classical comedy ""Woe from Wit"" exclaims  ""Calendars all lie"". However  the calendar that has taken shape today does not deceive us. It tells of change in the world; change that is a product of reason. We find on that calendar the Moscow summit meeting  at which Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan exchanged the instruments marking the entry into force of the Treaty on the elimination of intermediate- and shorter-range missiles; the conclusion of the Geneva Accords on political settlement around Afghanistan; the first ever public destruction of nuclear missiles; and the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. All this is a product of reason  of a new political intellect  which has superseded the dark legacy of the past. It is destroying the reciprocal ""enemy images"" that have existed and is shaping the image of co-operative partners. It has made it possible to discuss a world without arms in the emerging context of real disarmament  as was recently demonstrated at the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. It offers us a chance for the successful conclusion of the Vienna meeting  which is a major milestone in the process of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) .All that has occurred in the year 1988  which has witnessed many other remarkable events. This year has witnessed the four-party talks on southern Africa; the movement towards a political settlement around Kampuchea; contacts to resolve problems existing on the Korean peninsula; dialogue between the leaders of the two communities in divided Cyprus that were until recently irreconcilable; and the positive response to the initiative of the United Nations Secretary-General concerning a settlement of the problem of Western Sahara. I shall permit myself to include among the year's landmark events the Party Conference in my own country. Its main conclusion was that perestroika is irreversible. It is irreversible in both our domestic and our foreign policy. Radical change in our own house - and here I am quoting Mikhail Gorbachev - has engendered new approaches by us to international affairs too. In a sense  the calendar that I have brought to your attention is one of the consequences of that process.Two years ago we said here that group  bloc or ideological considerations were beginning to give way to an understanding of peace as the supreme value. Only peace  translated from the language of declarations into practical action  can give mankind a chance of survival. The Soviet Union has grasped this world-wide trend and coupled it with its own perestroika  its process of renewal.Today the world is changing along new lines. Through the joint efforts of States and by implementing the principles of the new political thinking  it has become possible to avert the threat of war. To a large extent this is due to the political will demonstrated by the leaders of States  and here I can only agree with President Reagan's remarks yesterday about the beneficial impact on that process of Soviet-American political dialogue.We are now moving further ahead - towards comprehensive security. This requires truly international co-operation. This universal international alliance must rise above differences  which  to use the words of Albert Einstein  are infinitely small compared to the danger that threatens us all.The formation of this alliance is being facilitated by the emergence of mechanisms of interaction among States and peoples  first and foremost through the United Nations and its institutions. Its main working unit  its engine  its heart  is here  in our house of peace  as are the people who have found way to increase the power of the instruments of peace-making  and we thank them for that. There is however  no better way of expressing gratitude than by a collective effort to enhance the role of the United Nations and make it stronger not only as a unique international forum but also as an equally unique global centre for ensuring universal and regional security and the security of each country. In this capacity the United Nations should  in our view  play a more active and direct role in eliminating the main threat to mankind - the threat of a nuclear catastrophe. We would like to see greater involvement by the United Nations in the process of nuclear disarmament  in reaching a global agreement on the cessation and prohibition of nuclear-weapons testing  and in creating nuclear-free zones in various parts of the world.Space should become an area for the priority attention of the United Nations. The international community has a vital interest in preventing it from becoming an arena for military rivalry. Today this can still be done; tomorrow will be too late.The Soviet Union has made the case for setting up a world space organization  which could include a centre for international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space  to be established on the basis of the Krasnoyarsk radar  as proposed by Mikhail Gorbachev.We call upon the Government of the United states to follow that example  and thus allay our concern with respect to United States radar facilities in Greenland and Great Britain. By doing that  we would not only lay the material groundwork for international co-operation in space but also strengthen the ABM Treaty regime.This Organization could become involved  in practical terms  in resolving the issue of conventional arms limitation. The Soviet Union supports the idea of setting up  within the United Nations  a register of conventional arms sales and transfers  and is ready to take part in developing the parameters of such a register. The arms race cannot be curbed without putting under control the use of scientific and technological achievements for military purposes. We support the proposal by India and other countries to set up a group  under the United Nations Secretary-General  to provide assessments and forecasts in the area of new technology.The United Nations will measure up to all these tasks if we take a fresh look at the practical aspects of our work. First of all  the General Assembly  as one of the principal bodies of the Organization  should substantially increase its contribution towards finding ways and means of solving international problems  inter alia  through renewing and improving its methods and procedures.There is but one criterion here - that decisions be productive and democratically worked out and adopted. A first step in this direction would he to adopt an increased proportion of United Nations decisions by consensus  though it is important that General Assembly resolutions adopted by a vote should not be devalued.It is also necessary to reinvigorate the work of the Security Council  and to ensure closer interaction among its members. At consultations among the five permanent members of the Council  attended by the Secretary-General  it would be useful to hold periodic reviews of situations in areas of conflict and to identify priority measures to improve the situation. It is felt that there is a need for periodic meetings of the Security Council at the foreign-minister level  as envisaged by the Charter.The idea of convening special expanded Security Council meetings in regions of tension is worthy of consideration. Such meetings could also be held in the capitals of the Council's permanent members. The Soviet Union confirms its readiness to host such a meeting in Moscow. We all owe a debt to the United Nations  and it is in our common interest to repay our debts. We can repay them in full if  in addition to dollar contributions  we invest innovative thought in the activity of the Organization's institutions  if we revive its main function - as a centre for the settlement of international conflicts through united efforts.Let there be no lament  then  over the sacred national prerogatives. The Soviet Union is a firm advocate of strengthening national sovereignty  particularly wherever infringements of it are most keenly and painfully felt. We regard as highly objectionable the anomaly of foreign military presence - military bases in other States' territories - as well as violations of national sovereignty by the undeclared arrival of nuclear arms in  or their transit through  ports of other countries. We have stated clearly what we believe: that any military presence must be confined within national borders.But what we are speaking of now is voluntarily delegating a portion of national rights in the interests of all - paradoxically enough  to strengthen national security  while at the same time strengthening universal security.The interrelationship of events in an interdependent world increasingly compels us to delegate some national prerogatives to an international organization. In fact  this is happening already. Military activity is ceasing to be taboo. Having cleared the verification barrier  and having initiated the process of real nuclear disarmament  the Soviet Union and the United States  the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia  the United Kingdom  the Federal Republic of Germany  Italy  Belgium and the Netherlands gave up some of their rights when they permitted the inspection of facilities in their territories. This was done in the interests of universal security. By establishing new  previously inconceivable  rules of openness in the military sphere  the world is undoubtedly moving towards the creation of a common sovereign right - the right to survive. When the United States Secretary of Defence sits at the controls of a top-secret Soviet bomber  and the Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet armed forces tours an equally secret United States base  that is something more than a mere exchange of protocol courtesies in the spirit of the times; it indicates that the elimination of secrecy is becoming a factor of security.We draw this conclusion from the conviction that  today  it is no longer possible to achieve political goals by means of war. To put it simply  war is ceasing to be - indeed  it has already ceased to be - an instrument of rational policy.Let us consider this from the perspective of regional conflicts  while they flare up and develop in different ways  they still have one feature in common - they drag on intolerably long  without delivering positive political results.However  positive political results are not slow in coming when interference in regional conflicts gives way to the efforts of the world community to promote their settlement. No one should hinder this process. In this context we have to speak of Afghanistan.The Geneva Accords are not just an isolated local instance of the settlement of a regional conflict. They ate the first step in a chain reaction leading to a healthier world. They are a new promising beginning in world politics  attesting to a qualitative change in political thinking. They are a message of good news to other regions. Any violation of the Geneva Accords undermines those achievements.The Soviet Union and the Republic of Afghanistan are observing their obligations under those Accords faithfully  to the letter. There is no need to prove that. However attempts are being made arbitrarily to alter the formula established by the Geneva Accords  thus significantly changing its meaning.As soon as the Soviet troops began to withdraw  a non-stop production line of violations was set in motion. The list of them would totally refute the assertion heard here yesterday that bloodshed has diminished in that region. On the contrary  terror has been mounting sharply and is increasingly directed against civilians.In the circumstances  the fact is that faithful compliance by some with their obligations creates conditions for others to commit new crimes  of which the most heinous is the destruction of hard-won hopes. This must not be allowed to happen. The chain of conflict settlement generated by Afghanistan must not be allowed to break.We are not complaining to anyone. We have the means to make things fall into place. But we are responsible to the United Nations  and therefore we are appealing to it. We are proposing that a meeting of the permanent members of the Security Council  hosted by the United Nations Secretary-General  discuss the question of compliance with the Geneva Accords. It would also be appropriate to invite to such a meeting representatives of the parties directly concerned. The deep involvement of the United Nations in the resolution of major international problems has spotlighted the acute need for new mechanisms of verification and control. We propose that consideration be given to the idea of an international monitoring and verification agency within the framework of the United Nations.That body's terms of reference could be very broad. Disarmament and security in all its aspects are becoming an increasingly multilateral and truly international process. The institution for monitoring and verification should also be international.Many countries feel the need for it. Thus Japan is proposing an interesting idea for the world-wide seismic monitoring of nuclear explosions. France has what we regard as the reasonable idea of setting up an international satellite monitoring system.These are interesting ideas  but how could they be implemented? Naturally  the most sensible way is to make their  part of a universal monitoring and verification mechanism that would operate under United Nations auspices or within its structure.Verification is no longer a preference but an imperative of our time. It is an imperative of our time to search for forms and methods for the development of societies that would be in keeping with modern requirements. Certainly this is true with respect to socialism  but with equal certainty it applies to other socio-political systems. While we are changing in both our own and international interests  we are entitled to expect the same kind of perestroika from others.Separating the wheat from the chaff  distinguishing the right choice from the wrong  and achievements from deterioration  we are unforgiving in judging the past. To be self-critical is the canonical rule for politicians who believe in their people and want the people to believe them. But we expect certain leaders of States who address the international community to be equally self-critical in assessing the past.It is appropriate to mention this in the year that marks the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  which some are marking by reasserting the supremacy of law  and others by preaching their own faultlessness. We could list numerous international instruments on human rights that have not been ratified by the countries represented here by some speakers. We could talk of the continuous practice of violations of civil rights in those countries. But we prefer to speak of ourselves.The supremacy of law is the corner-stone of political renewal in our country. Creating a State based on the rule of law also has a direct bearing on our foreign policy.A constitutionally authorized mechanism for working out and adopting strategic foreign-policy decisions is being put in place in our country. Questions such as military budgets  the use of troops outside the country  and innovations in the development of the armed forces will also be subject to constitutional and legal scrutiny.For us  the principle of the supremacy of law and the policy of democratising our society ace indivisible. The emergence of a State based on the rule of law links with the world-wide will to assert the primacy of international law as the standard for mankind's existence. Among politico-military  economic  humanitarian and environmental guarantees of universal security  we view its legal guarantees as paramount.From States based on the rule of law to a world based on the rule of law - such is the logic of the movement. A starting-point on this path could be the elaboration of a major long-term programme for the development of international law. Its thrust could be expressed in the motto ""Security  trust and co-operation through law"". We must also work persistently to enhance the effectiveness of the International Court of Justice on the basis of developing a common approach by all States to that main judicial body of the United Nations. Completion of the preparation of a code of crimes against peace and the security of mankind would be a major step.Probably nowhere is the role of law so important as in ensuring freedom of choice  which is the linchpin of the new political thinking. For how can there be any freedom to choose one's own course in situations in which international law is constantly violated - as in southern Africa  the Middle East  Central America and elsewhere?Freedom of choice defies confinement within ideological borders or geographical zones. It cannot be stopped by ""crusades""; it can only be recognized. It is absolute  and equally -resolute is our respect for it  regardless of the orientation of any particular country.By defining freedom of choice as the key link in the new political thinking  we hope to use that key to open many doors that until now have been tightly locked. Recognition of the diversity of interests  the priority of universal human values and the supremacy of political means in solving international problems  and replacing confrontation with dialogue - those and other components of the new political thinking have resulted in substantial and  we trust  irreversible positive changes. Yet  the fires of political inquisition ace still blazing in the world  and some would try to bring to the stake entire nations and movements accused of the heresy of having freely chosen their own course. Ideology in the shape of missile projectiles crushes them with the cruelty of a medieval axe. I should like to stress that our sympathy is on the side of those who seek to achieve freedom of choice.Why  for instance  can the great American people have their own great dream  and why should the Cuban or the Nicaraguan  the Angolan or the Vietnamese people  the Ethiopian people be deprived of the right to have their own ideals? Why cannot the Palestinian people have their homeland? Why should other nations  countries and movements be humiliated by great Power arrogance? While not renouncing any of our values or denying to others the right to have their own  while continuing to respect the yearning of peoples for national self-assertion and liberation from economic subjugation and political dependence  the Soviet Union supports the de-ideologization of international relations and the exclusion of the overwhelming component of ideological differences from foreign policy and diplomacy. It expects and hopes that others will do likewise.It expects the problem of how to pool our efforts to be recognized as commensurate with the problem of the survival of mankind. It expects the force of peace-making policy to prevail over the policy of force which has run its historical course.The division of mankind into great and small countries is something which has also run its historical course. And  if the term ""great Powers"" is to be kept at all  it is only in the sense of great responsibility towards the rest of the world. Divisions and re-divisions of the world into spheres of influence are historically pointless. Today  we must all have only one sphere of influence â our planet. It will perish if our influence on the threatening course of destructive developments is divided and fragmented into blocs and systems. Therefore  the Soviet leadership has attempted to reinterpret more profoundly the idea  originally inherent in Marxism  of the interrelationship between class and universal human values  according priority to the interests shared by all nations. In our vision of peaceful coexistence as the universal principle of international relations  it does not emerge as a special form of class struggle.A rigid polarization of the world  which is becoming increasingly diverse  must give way to its consolidation  which allows the rivalry of two different systems to take on non-confrontational forms. This  if you will  is also a choice  the freedom of which is born of the new political thinking and of its dialectics- which makes it possible to put policies to the test of real life.But it would appear that not everyone measures up to this freedom. Obstinately clinging to divisive fetishes  some would try to put a brake on the action of the centrifugal forces. As a result  any red-letter days have not appeared on the new calendar of peace this year. For example  it does not include the date marking the completion of a treaty on 50 per cent reductions in strategic arms. The pace of real disarmament set by the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles is slowing down as negotiations proceed.We seemed to have dealt once and for all with the issue of verification  but it has arisen again because of the negative position of our negotiating partners. It looks as if the Russian proverb ""Trust but verify"" is good only when applied to the Soviet Union but is not applicable to the United States.Once again we call on the United States of America to reconsider its attitude to verification of the process of reducing and eliminating nuclear arsenals. For verification is something more than the technical checking on the parties compliance with their obligations. It is the material expression of sincerity and honesty  without which it is impossible to make policy today. It is also regrettable that an agreement barring weapons from outer space has not been concluded in 1988.We had every reason to hope that 1988 would see the signing of a history-making global convention on the complete prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons. Indeed  most of the complex fundamental issues have either been settled already or ace close to agreement. But once again  the sticky quagmire of procrastination is thwarting the final step towards victory. Meanwhile  in the absence of progress an alarming trend towards the spread of chemical weapons and what I would call chemical permissiveness is surreptitiously beginning to develop.We do not object to the exploration of alternative ways. The Soviet Union takes a positive view of the proposal made yesterday by the President of the United States to convene a conference of the parties to the 1925 Geneva Protocol. At the same time we  of course  assume that the drafting of the convention banning chemical weapons will be continued and  of course  completed.The beginning of the process of nuclear disarmament has brought into sharper focus the problem of conventional armed forces and armaments  including naval armaments. Here  too  great hopes were being pinned on this year. The programme of radical reductions in the military capabilities of the two opposing political-military alliances proposed by Warsaw Treaty countries has put the problem on the track of practical solution.We have a clear goal - to achieve a situation in which the two sides would . have only the forces and capabilities sufficient for defence but insufficient for launching a surprise attack or conducting offensive operations. There is also another priority problem. Access to conventional weapons in their most modern modifications is expanding. Their technological sophistication makes it easier to use them. There is now no need to spend much time or money on special training  and anyone can easily operate those infernal devices. In other words  conventional weapons are becoming part of everyday life  a common tool in the hands of too many people. This dangerous situation  which is particularly typical of regional conflicts  calls for joint efforts to constrain international arms markets.Working out a mandate for the future negotiations is also a collective undertaking. Jointly with our allies  we have been finding solutions which bring general agreement closer.On the question of unfulfilled hopes  we must mention the lack of progress in settling some of the most pressing problems  such as those of the Middle East  Central America  and certain others.Today  it is clearer than ever what needs to be done. Elementary common sense enjoins that consolidation of forces must be placed above their fragmentation  and constructive dialogue must be placed above destructive scepticism. None of us can any longer waste our time on mutual fault-finding  on mutual recrimination and reproaches. The growing physical destruction of our planet is the verdict against the existing division of the world. It is because of that division that so many pages in the 1988 calendar have not been filled. It is foe the same reason that this year has had such a generous supply of sombre dates.It is perhaps for the first time that we have seen the stark reality of the threat to our environment - a second front fast approaching and acquiring urgency equal to that of the nuclear and space threat. For the first time we have seen clearly that  in the absence of any global control  man's so-called peaceful constructive activity is turning into global aggression against the very foundations of life on earth. For the first time we have understood clearly what we had guessed: that the traditional view of national and universal security  based primarily on military means of defence  is now totally obsolete and must be urgently revised.Faced with the threat of environmental catastrophe  the dividing lines of the bipolar ideological world are receding. The biosphere recognizes no division into blocs  alliances or systems. All share the same climatic system and no one is in a position to build his own isolated and independent line of environmental defence.Man-made ""second nature"" - the technosphere - has turned out to be dangerously fragile. The consequences of many of its breakdowns are becoming international and global.The environmental crisis is being exported on an increasing scale  with toxic technologies  facilities  products and wastes spreading  overtly or covertly  through the channels of economic relations.Quite deliberate attempts are being made to turn densely populated areas of the third world into toxic waste dumps.In a situation like this it is suicidal to try economically to rein in progressive national developments  to wear down an imaginary enemy by economic pressure. That is the kind of thinking that belongs to the Stone Age.It is unreasonable to impede the economic reconstruction of countries that seek to restructure the energy industries and to introduce resource-saving and waste-free technologies  thus making the world less dangerous.How much more sensible it is  as we ate proposing to the United States and other countries  to abolish some planned or ongoing military programmes and channel the funds thus released towards instituting an international regime of environmental security.All the environmental disasters of this year have placed in the forefront the task of pooling and co-ordinating efforts to develop a global strategy for a rational management of the environment.All of us - and I emphasize this  all of us - need an international programme to manage the risks involved in economic activities and to shift to alternative technologies that spare both man and nature.We need resources to save our planet  instead of destroying it. I believe that the world community possesses such resources. But they have to be supplemented  first  by the will and readiness to act and  secondly  by an effective mechanism for international ecological co-operation.It is quite clear that in this area  too  nothing can be done without the tools of the new political thinking. In this area  too  it must emphasize the factor of time. We have too little of it - very little - and problems are piling up faster than they can be solved.Even the implementation of the positive decisions already adopted could take years and years. Just the physical elimination of intermediate- and shorter-range missiles will take three years of continuous daily work and the Treaty's entire sequence of implementation will take 13 years. This makes it incumbent upon us to take responsible decisions today.What are our liabilities? Tens of thousands of nuclear warheads and hundreds of thousands of tons of toxic agents; mountains of conventional armaments; holes burnt in the ozone layer and the eroding biosphere; the greenhouse effect and the depletion of non-renewable sources of energy; acid rains and deserts devouring the green world; forest fires-and floods; drying up seas and dying fauna; terrorism against the peoples and aggression against nature.What are cur assets? The world's growing maturity which makes it possible to raise and solve global problems on a planetary scale; a growing world-wide ""Green Peace"" movement; shared perceptions of environmental scientists and policy-makers who are becoming increasingly active as environmentalists  as demonstrated by the document of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty and the recent appeal issued by the peace movement; the report entitled ""Our Common Future""  prepared by the World Commission headed by Mrs. Brundtland  and the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) models of environmental renascence to counter environmental apocalypse; the experience of the past three years which attests to the possibility of removing corrosive growths from the body of the earth; the experience of pooling the efforts of States in the use of advanced technology  such as thermonuclear fusion and superconductivity  in the interests of human survival.This year's calendar has also included another event; the inauguration of the Centre for the development of an international experimental thermonuclear reactor by scientists from very many countries who will chart the way towards inexhaustible sources of energy for the coming century and at the same time develop a model for concerting efforts in the interests of all peoples. Among our assets is the realization that a monopoly of a small number of countries over advanced technologies and attempts at all costs to keep others on the sidelines of the emerging science-and-information world may boomerang against the monopolists.Among our assets is the United Nations  whose high efficiency has been so graphically demonstrated by the events of 1988. They have also highlighted a simple but very profound truth; when nations  particularly the great Powers  begin to co-operate  the United Nations gains in influence and strength  once again recapturing the spirit of its initial objectives.It is true that the fable about two elephants stamping our grass is still popular. President Reagan's statement yesterday would seem to indicate that this grass is not being threatened.We do not want to fight  and love is still a remote possibility.But speaking seriously  the world community has gained much from the improvement in Soviet-American relations.In this regard I am pleased to cite a remark by Mr. Perez de Cuellar.The meeting between Gorbachev and Reagan  he said  has shown the world community an example of voluntary dialogue. Governments have suddenly realized that the United Nations is an entirely appropriate place for negotiations and solving problems. Precisely  but I would say ""the most appropriate place"". If in the past it has not always been that  the Organization itself is least to blame.Let us speak frankly and say that many of us  including particularly the permanent members of the Security Council  are to blame for the fact that at some point certain fundamental values of our Organization embodied in its Charter were devalued. Now that they are regaining their initial level  it is our duty to learn the bitter lessons of the past for the sake of the future.Today  for instance  the Soviet Union is reconsidering its previous attitude to the Organization's economic institutions. In particular  we attach great importance to the activities of the United Nations Economic and Social Council and would like to contribute to enhancing its effectiveness.No country stands to gain by remaining aloof from the international forums of our Organization. Having drawn this more than obvious conclusion  we are asking: should not some of our partners take a fresh look at their attitude to the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)?The permanent members of the Security Council should set an example in strengthening the authority of the united Nations  enhancing its role and expanding and enriching its peace-making functions. All of us here are witnesses to the beginning of the renaissance of our Organization. At the same time we are architects of this process. We shall enhance the role of the United Nations even more by concerted efforts to combat the threats to our environment. It is  we believe  precisely within the framework of the United Nations that international machinery should be established to formulate urgent decisions on pressing global problems  above all economic and environmental problems. The Soviet Union proposes a discussion on the question of how to turn the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) into an environmental council capable of taking effective decisions to ensure ecological security. It proposes that a three-event series of emergency meetings be held - of course  under the auspices of the United nations - to co-ordinate efforts in the field of ecological security; a consultative meeting of experts to discuss the health of the Earth  in 1989? a summit meeting of the leaders of  say  15 or 20 States representing all continents  and the influential force of our time  the Non-Aligned Movement  in 1992 the holding of the second United Nations international conference on the environment  as planned  in 1992  or even earlier  but in any event at summit level.We have been speaking of a calendar of real achievements  a calendar of ideas as yet unrealised  a calendar of hopes and plans for the future. The review of this year that we have undertaken is not an end in itself. What can be an end in itself is the inner moral objective of achieving progress and acceptance of the political need to identify the moment of truth  which from time immemorial has tended towards movement  towards overcoming inaction.This year has been full of both movement and slow-downs. It has shown that Mikhail Gorbachev was right when he said;""A complex and in many respects unusual situation is developing in the world. We are at the beginning of a new  long road that offers new prospects and new problems"" Which tendency will prevail? What will gain the upper hand - the tendency towards further movement ahead or the inertia of stagnation?The answer is to be found in abandoning certain dogmas  even though cast in the form of eternal truths. We have to write a new catechism of international existence  in which the beginning will be thought and reason  followed by deeds for the sake of our common salvation and development. We must stop sermonizing from lofty international rostrums and recognize the principle of equality in international dialogue.As for the dogma of ""peace through strength""  let us leave it to those who worship the faded commandments of the past. The keynote of history is peace through reason  and this  too  is a commandment foe the future.The past has great power over us  but although that is true  the future has an even greater gravitational pull. The poetic metaphor  ""to win the affection of space  to heed the call of the future""  takes on a lofty political meaning.Let us not be deaf to that call. Let us respond to it by really uniting to save life on our Earth.Let us begin now."
"120",5999,"RWA",43,1988,"ï»¿The forty-third session of the General Assembly gives the Republic of Rwanda the happy opportunity to join with other nations as a faithful participant in this annual meeting of international diplomacy  to evaluate  in an open  constructive and sincere dialogue  the problems facing the world as they pertain to the mission assigned to this great family of the United Nations.The annual session of the General Assembly follows the time-honoured tradition in the life of the world community established by the 51 founding Members of the United Nations when they paved the way for us to maintain international peace and security for the common development of all mankind through international co-operation.The Republic of Rwanda finds in this Assembly the ideal institutional framework in which to proclaim regularly and solemnly its unshakeable faith in the noble objectives of the United Nations Charter - the reign of peace  concord  freedom and progress for all peoples the world over. From this lofty rostrum  Rwanda joins with the nations that have preceded it in paying a solemn tribute to the United Nations  whose commitment to the maintenance and development of peace has been successful despite the many obstacles it has encountered.That commitment  whose ultimate objective is improvement of the lot of humankind on the basis of multiple interdependence  complementarity and peaceful coexistence among nations  has met with economic and political obstacles in international relations.In economic terms  international relations have revealed a grim picture of the continuing crisis in raw materials  part of the recession in the world economy  whereby the third world and especially Africa face increasingly alarming situations that compromise the execution of development projects and thus harm peoples languishing in ever-growing poverty.Low commodity prices  reflecting the trade depreciation in raw materials  have harmed the economies of the developing countries  and are an aspect of this essentially structural crisis inasmuch as they result from the machinery currently governing international economic relations  which are characterized by  among other things  instability in financial markets and the over-indebtedness of the third world. The gap which continues to widen between developing countries and developed countries justifies the calls for the establishment of a new  mote just  international economic order meeting the aspirations of the peoples of the third world who wish to take up the many challenges of underdevelopment.Because of the crisis which continues to undermine the world economy  three quartets of mankind finds itself faced with three major obstacles preventing the acceleration of developments the external vulnerability of marginal economies  the continuing trend towards imbalance in foreign trade and the chronic shortfall in savings to meet increasing investment needs.Among the challenges before the international community  the ravages caused by the seemingly organized anarchy in world markets  the fluctuations in raw material prices in favour of consumers and the consequent and continuing deterioration of the terms of trade  and protectionism by the industrialized countries in the face of disarray as a result of third world over-indebtedness - all tell the flaws in the current international economic system. The heavy external-debt burden and the growing dependency of the third world on the industrialized world are of special significance in Africa  for they threaten peoples who are victims of the vicious circle of dire poverty because of a lack of structural reform in the world economy.Rwanda deplores this international economic situation  marked as it is  by worsening stagnation year by year to the detriment of the peoples of the third world  which are victims of decreasing economic growth  deficits and food shortages  constituting a tragedy for the African continent  which is haunted by the spectre of constant hunger owing  in particular  to unpredictable climatic changes. In order to limit the scope and the seriousness of the problems arising from structural imbalances in international economic relations - a disorder which is compounded by the various natural disasters that add to the third world's misfortunes - the industrialized countries should adopt new strategies to hasten the dawning of a new international economic order by reducing the gap which is growing between them and the developing countries.Thanks to the prestigious framework that is the United Nations and its specialized agencies  the world community has continued to record the grievances of the developing countries as they decry the injustice and other ills of the international economic system and plead for its restructuring so that international relations might be guided by the principles of equity  solidarity  complementarity and open and active co-operation for the harmonious progress of all mankind.In this connection we must observe that the many appeals of the developing countries have not been sufficiently heeded by our partners in the industrialized countries  as is shown by the latter's lack of deep commitment to the goals fixed for recovery in the economic growth of the third world.Hence  the goals set in the International Development Strategy for the three United Nations Development Decades  the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries  the Vienna Programme of Action on Science and Technology for Development  the Plan of Action for the Promotion and Implementation of Technical Co-operation between Developing Countries and the Fund for Land-locked Countries have not been reached. It is to be hoped that the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 will not meet the same fate owing to lack of financial contributions commensurate with the commitments entered into by the developed countries and the international community during the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa.The Rwanda's Republic firmly believes that global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development remain the appropriate framework for promoting a new international economic order.In this context  one must look to the adoption of a new international development strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade and on the holding in Paris in 1990 of the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries and hope that there will be renewed impetus in international co-operation for development.A number of third world States have been disappointed by the latitude of the rich countries in regard to the imbalances in international economic relations  especially in production  investment and trade - a continuing situation which is undermining the efforts at s el f-development of the poor countries with limited resources.Among these disadvantaged countries  those which  like Rwanda  ate on the list of less developed countries - deserve special attention and even more active support  in order to help them reduce their specific constraints and development problems. While praising the international communityâs gesture in recognizing the need for making special assistance efforts for their benefit  Rwanda's optimism is tempered in the face of the meagre results of the Substantial Programme of Action adopted during the Conference held in Paris in September 1981 under United Nations auspices.The African continent is still where problems of underdevelopment arise in anguishing terms and where the economic prospects for most of the countries classified by the United Nations as least developed are still grim  especially for those which  like Rwanda  are faced with various structural handicaps exacerbated by a number of situational factors.Hence it can easily be seen that  when speaking of economic and financial issues  the problem of external debt is of the greatest importance in Africa  where it is a serious threat to Africa's own efforts at self-development.Whereas creditors believe that the debt problem should be solved on a case-by-case basis on a bilateral framework  the African countries take the view that the solution should be found through shared responsibility within the framework of an international conference  as endorsed by the third special summit of the Organization of African Unity  held in Addis Ababa in November-December 1987  on Africa's external debt.The Rwanda's Republic regrets that the idea of convening an international conference on Africa's external debt  as well as the idea of holding a world conference on monetary and financial problems  have not yet enjoyed consensus between the developed industrialized countries and the developing countries especially within the United Nations  where there is nevertheless wide consensus on the principle of promoting international economic co-operation on the external debt.On the basis of the pragmatism that characterized the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held in Geneva in July 1987  we hope that the realism which also characterized that session will breathe new life into the North-South dialogue  from the standpoint of the commitments made to improve the situation of the poorest countries  whose external debt is  sadly  a bottle-neck in the development process. Among the problems that continue to concern the international community is  most assuredly  the problem of protectionism in world trade  which is doing well in spite of the economic crisis  having increased by 4 per cent in volume in the past year. Nevertheless  we regret to note that the major multilateral negotiations that began more than a year ago in Geneva  at the initiative of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  have taken place in an atmosphere of confrontation. On the one hand the resurgence of economic nationalism in some of the rich countries has exacerbated the rivalries among the major industrialized countries  while on the other hand developing countries are still struggling for improved access to the market of the industrialized countries.The third world expects from these new international trade negotiations  first  the elimination of all the protectionist measures that block their exports  especially of manufactured and semi-finished goods. The developing countries then hope to send their agricultural exports and their food products to the many markets that are still closed to them. The primary objective of these negotiations is to draw up rules for more equitable world trade for the year 2000  in response to the concerns of Africa and many industrialized countries  which fully appreciate the interdependence of the economies of the North and of the South.Outside the framework of the North-South dialogue  the Republic of Rwanda attaches great importance to the ideals of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  we are in favour of promoting and strengthening horizontal co-operation between developing countries as a formula that will help to solve problems of underdevelopment.The South-South dialogue is clearly reflected in the Lagos Plan of Action and Final Act  adopted in April 1980 by the OAU  with a view to promoting the gradual socio-economic integration of the continent and ensuring its food self-sufficiency and collective self-reliance. In the same context  Rwanda continues to develop relations of friendship and co-operation with other countries in the third world  both bilaterally and multilaterally. Formulas for vertical and horizontal co-operation are all the more necessary because  over the years  the number of African countries faced with the tragic effects of the raw materials crisis  over-indebtedness and climatic disasters has been increasing. Far from giving in to pessimism  Rwanda remains convinced that the efforts and initiatives aimed at promoting effective solidarity in the international community with make it possible to limit the damage caused by the world economic crisis by offering the third-world countries the necessary means to emerge from the rut of underdevelopment.The Republic of Rwanda firmly believes that world co-operation regarding agro-food strategy is necessary to foster appropriate programmes of action likely to enable countries faced with climatic changes and agricultural production deficits gradually to achieve food self-sufficiency.Strengthened by this conviction  which at the same time is an expression of hope  I express again from this rostrum  on behalf of the people and Government of Rwanda participating in the national revolutionary movement for development the most earnest and sincere thanks to all our partners  friendly countries and international bodies that have been supporting our country and continue to assist it in its tireless development efforts.The international community  in addition to the socio-economic challenges that I have just described  is still faced at the political level with crises and areas of tension that encourage a climate of insecurity in the world. Following the violation of the principle of the equality of rights of peoples and of their right to self-determination  the world community is suffering from the escalation of violence in various regions of the world where the principle of respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of States has sometimes been infringed. The Government of Rwanda notes with bitterness that these tensions and conflicts  which threaten international peace and security stem from divergent interests or the determination of oppressed peoples to break the chains of colonialism  neo-colonialism and every other form of disregard of the right to freedom and independence.In the light of the ills in some parts of the world where the cycle of violence seems to have established itself  Rwanda believes that the fate of these peoples cannot be a matter of indifference to countries that proclaim their dedication to the ideals of our Organization  whose sublime universal mission is to foster  through international peace  security and co-operation  the full development of the dignity of the human person.It is in this context that the Government of Rwanda follows very closely the initiatives aimed at promoting a policy of detente in southern Africa  putting an end to the Iran-Iraq conflict  seeking an appropriate  just and equitable solution to the question of Western Sahara  and fostering the gradual  smooth withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and Kampuchea  not to mention other efforts to put an end to the violence that seriously compromises the development of certain suffering societies in the third world.Aside from these prospects of peace  Rwanda also welcomes the initiatives relating to disarmament for the benefit of development  as evidenced  in particular  by the conclusion of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development and the results of the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament.Reason would seem to be triumphing in southern Africa  where the intransigent arrogance of the proponents of the policy of apartheid continues to disgust those nations which  cherishing peace  justice and freedom  remain convinced that the Namibian people must press their right to self-determination until final victory and that the South African people must struggle to achieve true democracy - a starting point for the development of the front-line countries  which are victims of the destabilizing acts of aggression of the Pretoria regime.Without either underestimating or overestimating the negotiations begun five months ago in London  which have since given rise to another series of talks  the Republic of Rwanda is following with some relief developments in these quadripartite meetings aimed at finding a way out of the conflicts in southern Africa. The history of international relations in our time will record that the countries taking part in these talks have for the first time achieved a new breakthrough towards a return to peace in this suffering region of the African continent.The racist  minority South African regime  which has been flying in the face of international morality and ethics  should speed up its reconciliation with the international community by letting the Namibian people gain independence  by destroying its odious system of apartheid  and by allowing those front-line States that are prey to its policy of aggression and destabilization to live in peace. We express the hope that the quadripartite meetings already referred to will not turn out to be just a sham dialogue likely to compromise implementation of the United Nations process set forth in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) for Namibia's accession to independence.In expressing this hope we also express our fear that any backsliding might halt the dialogue that has just begun  making it possible for South Africa to use dilatory manoeuvres to perpetuate its minority regime  anachronistic racism and illegal occupation of Namibia  which is waging a liberation struggle under the banner of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) .Coming to another African issue  the question of the Western Sahara cannot leave proponents of peace indifferent  with the Saharan people striving to win recognition of its right to self-determination  a universal right enshrined in international ethics.In the context of the new Maghreb dynamic  the Republic of Rwanda puts its hope in direct dialogue between the protagonists in this conflict and in the organization of a referendum in accordance with the spirit of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).As regards the eastern Horn of Africa  the delegation of the Republic of Rwanda salutes the initiatives of peace and detente that have recently heartened international public opinion  after the fraternal dialogue which fostered a resumption of diplomatic relations and an exchange of prisoners between Ethiopia and Somalia. That dialogue should give rise to a strategy that might unleash the dynamics of lasting peace and stability based on the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity  the inviolability of borders inherited from the colonial period  and the peaceful settlement of disputes.While we deplore those drawbacks that have weighed heavily on the climate of security in the world and denounce the enemies of development in Africa  we must observe that that continent is not the only place where there has been conflict and tension.To be sure  the efforts for peace and development have been held back by overt or covert conflicts that have broken out or continued in other parts of the world. So it is that in the Middle East the martyrdom of the Palestinian people  which is at the heart of the Israeli-Arab conflict  and the Iran-Iraq conflict have been sowing destruction and massive killings of frightening proportions  replacing the rule of law with the concept ""might makes right"".In solidarity with the Palestinian people  Rwanda remains convinced that a just and lasting settlement of the Middle East problem requires recognition of and respect for the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to a homeland and free exercise of its rights under the aegis of its sole legitimate representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  as well as the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied by force since 1967.We deplore that on the eve of the twenty-first century the Iran-Iraq conflict has taken on the attributes of a war of extermination despite United Nations mediation efforts and efforts made by the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of the Islamic Conference  which have spared no effort to convince the two warring parties that they should take the path of open negotiation to put an end to the massive killings which recall the tragic statistics of the last world conflict. The delegation of Rwanda expresses the hope that Iran and Iraq will now avail themselves of the opportunity offered by the winds of detente now blowing in international relations  and respond favourably to the constant appeals of the international community  urging them to return to concord and development in their region  so sorely tried by hatred  devastating strife and so many other horrors.In South-East Asia  Rwanda observes with sorrow that a climate of peace and security is still being prevented by the trials of the Cambodian people following after the incursions of foreign forces into a political crisis that has become a bloody ideological struggle of which many have fallen victims and that has caused so many to become refugees.We should here express our appreciation for and encourage the atmosphere of detente surrounding the various talks that have begun between the parties concerned since the end of 1987. May this glimmer of hope enable the Cambodian people to find a solution to the tragedy imposed upon it.Our Organization acknowledges that divided countries have the right to seek the ways and means to regain their unity through constructive dialogue free from outside interference and pressure. It is in this spirit that the Republic of Rwanda salutes and supports efforts to promote the peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean nation.In this context  still referring to the basic principles of the Charter of our Organization  Rwanda continues to hail and encourage initiatives to promote the normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to meet the legitimate and profound desire of the German people to regain its national unity.Furthermore  the Republic of Rwanda encourages the continuation of direct negotiations  under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General  on the question of Cyprus  a solution to which should be found through implementation of principles enshrining respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States.Humankind  which still remembers the massive killings of the last two world wars  the many victims of regional conflicts  the division of the world into spheres of influence  and the unbridled contest in the most destructive weaponry's throughout the twentieth century  seems to be asking our Organization to help make the twenty-first century one of disarmament and development  so as to exorcise the spectre of apocalypse.In applying the principles that govern our great United Nations family  principles in keeping with the wishes and aspirations of the international community it is high time that the savings achieved through the disarmament programmes of industrialized countries were recycled for development projects in the third world  especially for the poorest nations which make up the group of least developed countries.The delegation of Rwanda wishes to avail itself of the opportunity provided by the current World Cultural Development Decade to express its desire that a new pacifist ethic will guide international relations and that man's creative genius will not devour human  technical and scientific material and financial resources for the production of ever more sophisticated weaponry  in a vicious circle of competition but will  rather  he devoted to solving the tragic problems of underdevelopment. Most surely such a change in thinking would be reflected in some industrial change  in turn involving a cultural revolution of mankind  whose future would no longer be darkened by the excesses of the military-industrial complex  but rather reassured by the significant and positive factor of a recycling of capital from disarmament to the economic recovery of the third world  especially in the current situation of constant world economic crisis.After describing the concerns which the Republic of Rwanda shares with all countries devoted to peace  freedom  equality  justice and progress  concerns which pertain to the world economic crisis in general and to the economic crisis of the third world in particular  where many political tensions are developing  I should like  as other speakers before me at this rostrum have done  to convey to Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina  on behalf of the delegation of Rwanda  its most earnest and sincere congratulations both to him personally and to the officers who have been elected along with him to guide the work of the current session of the General Assembly.May I also pay a tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic  who presided with such competence and dignity over the work of the forty-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.In conveying to Mr. Caputo our most earnest and warm congratulations  I should like also to emphasize our conviction that his sound and prestigious experience  together with his outstanding Qualities  will help to ensure the success of the work of the Assembly under his guidance.In the same vein  the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier PÃ©rez de Cuellar  is also deserving of the warmest congratulations  which I should like to convey to him on behalf of the Rwandan Government  since we greatly appreciate the outstanding qualities he has constantly shown in carrying out his noble and difficult tasks so that our Organization may always work for peace  solidarity and complementarity among nations.The Republic of Rwanda would like most particularly to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his patient and persevering efforts  which are increasingly hearing fruit in a climate of dÃ©tente and constructive negotiations designed to put an end to conflicts in all parts of the globe.Permit me also to mention  as a guarantee of the success of the work of this session of the General Assembly  the determination of each and every Member State to work for the principles of peace  security  freedom  justice and progress  with a view to a new world order offering the third world  the opportunity of escape from the vicious circle of underdevelopment  while benefiting from a definite reduction in the hotbeds of tension to which it is often exposed.In this spirit  the Republic of Rwanda would like here to reiterate most solemnly from this prestigious rostrum its commitment  deriving from its membership in our Organization  to the principles which are the best guide for a planet seeking peace  security  co-operation and prosperity for the well-being of all mankind."
"121",6044,"SAU",43,1988,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to convey to you  Mr. President  and to the Heads of delegations participating in this forty-third session of the General Assembly  the greetings of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques  King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz  and his wishes that God grant you success to accomplish the expectations we all have of this Organization as the appropriate framework for co-operation among nations and peoples  an important forum for dialogue and understanding and an effective tool for the settlement of disputes and handling crises.The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques was keen to participate in this session  which coincides with an important juncture in the course of international relations and in the crucial role of the United Nations  and would have done so had it not been for the present circumstances which required continuous follow-up of the issues of peace and security in our region. I therefore have the honour to present the following statement on his behalf:""Mr. President  I have the pleasure to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this session  which reflects the personal esteem you enjoy and is an expression of the important role your friendly country  Argentina  plays in the international arena. We are confident that your competence in conducting the affairs of the General Assembly will provide new possibilities for dealing with international problems  and we are certain that your objectivity and far-sightedness will be reflected in the work of this session.""I wish also to express our thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  President at the forty-second session of the General Assembly  for the objectivity and wisdom with which he conducted the work of the last session  which has appropriately earned him the appreciation of all.""I take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his continuous endeavours to enhance the opportunities for establishing peace and to lessen the sources of tension that prevail in various parts of the world. His personal qualities are without doubt of great influence in this regard.""It gives ms pleasure  on the occasion of the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize for this year to the United Nations peace-keeping forces  to congratulate the United Nations  the Secretary-General and the members of these forces and to express our thanks to the countries participating in them. This appreciation reflects the increasing importance of the role of the United Nations in keeping the peace and maintaining it in different parts of the world.""Our belief in the principles and objectives of the United Nations as an international forum where all the peoples and the Governments of the world gather is firm and has been reinforced over time  despite the complicated problems and entangled crises from which the world suffers. Therefore  we return every year to the Organisation to consider problems and crises and to co-operate in finding solutions to them in order to establish an international community that enjoys stability and progress and in which justice  security and peace prevail. We hope that our Organization can work for the consolidation of the basic objectives for which it was created and for which the Charter was established  objectives to which we are all committed for the establishment and preservation of world peace  namely  laying the foundations of equity in relations among States in the political  economic and social fields. ""The ability of the United Nations to continue to serve as a safety valve  trusted and respected as regards the preservation and affirmation of these goals  is dependent  to a large degree  upon its ability to find appropriate solutions for the problems that threaten international peace and security.""At past sessions of the United Nations General Assembly we used to review the problems and enumerate the dangers and crises they posed. It seemed to us each time that the world was living under a cloud of ceaseless conflicts and wars with no peaceful end  and that the trend towards evil and its destructive effects would prevail. But today we are seeing a noticeable breakthrough in many problems and crises and we are saying the distinctive and important role the United Nations can play in this regard. On a number of different occasions in the past  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expressed the view that the role of this Organization should not be confined to identifying international conflicts and crises  but should also include the formulation of realistic concepts that would enable the international community to face up to the dangers confronting it  and consequently to work out solutions based on justice and objectivity. Today  as we are witnessing many breakthroughs in which the United Nations has played an effective role  we cannot but mention the great importance of the work this Organization can do in this respect. We stress that the continuation and consecration of this role cannot be realized and accomplished unless the Organization can find ways and means to institutionalise this role through the organs of the United Nations system and at the core of its political activities  and not simply confine itself to the improvements in circumstances that take place in super-Power relations periodically. While we appreciate the importance of the role played by the members of the Security Council in making it possible to achieve such positive developments  we wish to mention also the special responsibility that the permanent members bear in this regard  which should complement the responsibility of the united Nations  and not  in any event  be an obstacle to it.""The breakthroughs on the international scene which we are witnessing enhances the scope of hope for the accomplishment of increased peace  security and stability for the benefit of all.""Lately  relations between the two super-Powers  the United States and the Soviet union  have experienced a noticeable rapprochement  one outcome of which has been the realization of significant steps in the limitation of nuclear arms. However  there ought to be a positive and tangible relationship between the degree of the evolution of  relations between the two super-Powers and the role of the United Nations in this regard. Since the rapprochement in relations between these two Powers has a definitive bearing upon the opportunities and possibilities for the realization of other positive developments in the international arena  such a rapprochement should constitute a safety valve exercising its important influence whenever relations between the two super-Powers deteriorate so that a direct confrontation or a change in either of their positions can be avoided. On the occasion of their meeting in Washington last year  I addressed a message in this regard to the leaders of these two States in which we expressed our hope for the establishment of a new world order  supported by them  based on the principles of solidarity and co-operation between all nations and peoples  in order to provide security  stability and prosperity to the world.On the other hand  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia considered the breakthrough witnessed in the Iran-Iraq war as a good beginning for putting an end to a painful tragedy that had lasted eight years. As soon as it learned of the decision of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to fix a definite date for a cease-fire  with the consent of the two neighbouring States of Iraq and Iran  it immediately expressed its deep satisfaction and its great hope that this agreement would be an effective beginning for the establishment of a permanent and comprehensive peace in which all the States and 'peoples of the region would enjoy security  stability and constructive co-operation.""While welcoming the decision for a cease-fire and the initiation of direct negotiations  we express our hope that the negotiators will reach solutions that will help overcome the obstacles by dealing with the points contained in Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  stressing the stability of the cease-fire and the strengthening of the foundations of peace. We also hope that the cessation of the fighting between the two parties is a true and sincere beginning towards the accomplishment of the greater aim  which is the achievement of the desired permanent peace on the basis of good-neighbourly and constructive fraternal co-operation. While we appreciate the readiness Iraq has shown from the beginning to accept Security Council resolution 598 (1987) after it was adopted  and its consequent readiness for an immediate cease-fire  which demonstrates to the world the credibility of the Iraqi Government in its quest for peace and its earnestness to achieve it  we hope that the acceptance by Iran of a cease-fire and its participation in direct negotiations indicates a systematic change in its policy in the region  so that it will return to being a source of civilization and a pillar of peace stability and security  which are the responsibilities of all States in the region  thus sharing in the message of goodness  brotherhood and friendship  which are the goals that constitute the essence and the core of the true message of Islam. We hope to abide by all this. As the Almighty says:'Help another in righteousness and pietyBut help ye not one another in sin and rancour.(The Holy Koran V; 3)""He also welcomed the Soviet decision to withdraw from Afghanistan and to leave the destiny of the country in its own hands. He hope that this will take place according to plan  that all the obstacles in the way of the achievement of full political and economic stability in Afghanistan will disappear and that  after a glorious struggle of nine years during which it gave proof of its strong belief in God and of sacrifice in the defence of its religion and rights  a regime which reflects the wishes of its valiant Muslim people will be established.""We express our hope for the co-operation of all the parties concerned in restoring stability and tranquillity to Afghanistan  because the emergence of a Government which represents the true Afghan will is the firmest guarantee that Afghanistan will be the source of peace and stability for all its neighbours capable of co-operation on a sound basis of mutual interest.""The Geneva Accords have paved the way for the finding of a comprehensive solution to the situation in Afghanistan. They confer upon the United Nations a continued responsibility to work in this direction until final implementation of the Accords and until the establishment of the desired transitional Government that will permit the Afghan refugees to return to their country and give the Afghan people the freedom of self-determination.""At the same time  we deplore the violations of Pakistan's air space by the Kabul regime and express once again our appreciation of the great humanitarian role which the Government and people of Pakistan continue to undertake in hosting 4 million Afghans  who can now look forward to returning to their homes after Pakistan has alleviated their burdens for all these years. In this critical period  Pakistan has lost its President  the late General Mohammad Zia-ul-Hao  who worked hard in the service of his country  in supporting the rights of the Afghans and in bolstering the causes of the Islamic world. With the passing of the President  the Islamic world lost one of its most zealous and sincere Muslim leaders  one of the most experienced and well versed in the affairs of the Islamic world  as evidenced by his stands in international arenas and at the Islamic summit conferences.""We are  moreover  following with deep interest and appreciation the breakthrough taking place on the problem of Western Sahara  where the wisdom and farsightedness of the leaders of the region have enabled the United Nations to accomplish its constructive role in ending this problem. I had the pleasure of personally conveying my thanks to both His Majesty King Hassan II and his Excellency President Chedli bin Jedid for their co-operation and their successful efforts in settling the situation and narrowing the differences in the points of view concerning this problem  in the hope of reaching a final formula and of the coming together of the two States and peoples on the basis of trust  amity and common effort  for the welfare of the States of the Great Arab Maghreb.""With regard to the problem of Cyprus  we have always expressed our support for the ongoing negotiations  under the auspices of the Secretary-General  to find a solution to this problem which would protect the basic interests of the Turkish Cypriot brothers. We are encouraged by the fact that some positive signs have emerged  which will  we hope  result in the desired just solution. One of those signs is the growing understanding which has emerged in Greek-Turkish relations and the meetings which have recently taken place in Cyprus between the representatives of the two communities ""We are also observing with interest the efforts currently being undertaken to solve the problem of Namibia and to restore its rights. It is a problem that threatens stability and peace in Africa and causes great concern. We hope that the indications of the breakthrough taking place are genuine and will reach their natural conclusion. We also support every effort approved by the Organization in support of the people of South Africa and in deterring aggression against its neighbouring States. We stand with the African States in resisting the oppression inflicted upon the people of South Africa. We are with them in isolating the apartheid regime and condemning its evil alliance with the Zionist entity in Palestine. It is a regime based on the worst in the human soul of selfish traits  grudge and the abandonment of human values. Its oppressive and tyrannical measures against its black citizens and its aggression against the peace and security of neighbouring States should be halted ""It is regrettable that  in this atmosphere of breakthrough on different problems confronting the world  the question of Palestine and the Middle East  the Question that was created in the arena of the United Nations itself  remains the most dangerous of problems  undermining the progress of this breakthrough  and the most dangerous of the threats to regional security and world peace. It is unfortunate that this problem has not come closer to hope of a solution one way or another.""Peace is an indivisible whole. It is a right that should not be the preserve of one group or be applied to one cause at the expense of another. Peace does not stand and does not endure unless it is based upon justice. Peace is not the acceptance of the status QUO  nor is it a surrender to force and oppression  which do not create a right or establish peace. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has always believed that no real peace can prevail in the Middle East unless a just and permanent solution to the Palestinian problem  which is the core of the struggle taking place in the region  is found. Those who imagine that the passing of time is a guarantee that the status QUO will become an accepted fact seem to forget that the rights of peoples in their countries do not fade with the lapse of time and are never forfeited by forgetfulness. The Palestinians  after waiting for over 40 years without any glimmer of hope for a just peace  found only the stones of their land with which to express their rights and their rejection of the Israeli oppression.""Israel thought that by its continuous oppressive actions it could separate the Palestinians from their roots while they were on their own land and erase their history from the memory of their new generations  as well as from the annals of history. Then the Intifadah came  a revolution against oppression  a reminder that right never dies  and a daily and unanimous action for their just demands. Through its determination and sacrifices the uprising has been able to create a new reality  proclaiming its identity and vitality on both the local and the international level  with over nine months having passed since its beginning  it is clear that the Israeli violence has only reinforced its determination and that the logical result of the impossibility of things remaining as they are is the need for a movement towards a change.- the Intifadah has put an end to the false belief in the permanence of the status quo and killed the illusion that Israel worked to create in regard to the question of Palestinian representation  it has at the same time paved the way for concerted action aimed at attaining a just and permanent solution to the Palestinian problem. The blood of the martyrs and the sufferings of the victims are too dear to be squandered or uselessly lost; therefore there should be a conscious movement for the uprising of the Palestinian people to realize its desired objectives. The Palestinians have given all they can for peace and nothing demonstrates this better than the speech delivered recently by Mr. Yassir Arafat  the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization  in Strasbourg.""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has frequently expressed its full support and continued backing for whatever the Palestine Liberation Organization  as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  considers for the realization of its legitimate rights and the establishment of an independent State on its land and the right to self-determination. The Kingdom will continue its efforts in this direction according to what the Palestine Liberation Organization will decide and consider to be a realization of those goals.""As Chairman of the Arab Gulf Co-operation Council during its current session I sent messages to the leaders of the States permanent members of the Security Council to draw it to their attention that these developments do require of all parties a more realistic re-evaluation of the situation and a better perception of the dimensions of what is taking place in the occupied Arab territories  so that an end may be put to this tragedy in all its dimensions and all it entails in dangers  concerns and threats to security  peace and stability. A result will not be found except through a comprehensive and just solution to the Palestinian problem through the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East as the ideal means for realizing such a solution. It is worthy of mention that the two Arab Summit Conferences which took place in Amman and Algiers adopted a clear position towards supporting the convening of an international conference without pre-conditions.""If the question of Palestine is our primary concern  the problem of Holy Jerusalem constitutes  in our view  the core of the Palestinian problem. In this regard the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia renews its support for the necessity to preserve the Islamic and Arab character of Jerusalem and to restore the Holy City to Arab sovereignty  so that it will return to being  as it always used to be  the gathering place for the faithful of all the divine religions and a sanctuary for forgiveness and creative coexistence between the different religions.""As for Lebanon  we hope that God will guide its people to be able to provide a suitable climate for free and fair elections  emanating from the will of the Lebanese people and based on the present constitutional formula  so that a president may be elected who will endeavour to unify and to preserve the independence of the Lebanese territory and people and so that the shadow of the division which threatens Lebanon will fade away  denying continuous Israeli attempts to exploit these circumstances and to persist in perpetrating its aggression and occupying Lebanese territory.""While in international relations we are witnessing the beginning of different regional breakthroughs  we notice the continued deterioration of the economic situations of the developing countries  in spite of some positive signs witnessed recently in international economic relations. The Industrialized States have been able to realize a greater amount of co-ordination between their economic policies  a fact which has allowed a relative stability in the exchange rate of the major currencies as well as the achievement of healthy rates in economic growth  while the economic circumstances in many developing countries have continued to deteriorate as a result of a continuous decrease in the prices of their primary commodities and an increase in the price of their imports of manufactured goods  as well as an increase in their debt burdens in a way which seriously threatens the course of their development. ""It was hoped  at the commencement of the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations  that the terms of international trade would be corrected  that the protectionist tendencies would be reversed and that the trend towards freeing world trade in a meaningful way would be reaffirmed. But so far no tangible action on the part of the industrialized States has been forthcoming to eliminate the barriers which they have established on their imports from developing States. It is clear that some industrialized States are seeking to deprive the developing countries of many of the trade preferences required by their development circumstances.""It was hoped also that the initiatives aimed at easing the international debt burden of many of the poor developing countries would take a positive direction at the meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank currently taking place in Berlin. But in this regard  there have not so far been any tangible results on the part of the industrialized countries  and this leads to a loss of hope among the developing countries participating in the Berlin meeting.""While we welcome the progress achieved by the industrialized States in co-ordinating their economic policies  we express our apprehension at the continued deterioration of the economic situation in developing countries  many of which are facing heavy indebtedness on the one hand and a weak economic-growth rate on the other. That is a result of the failure to achieve practical measures to reduce the debt burden as well as of the continued custom and administrative barriers imposed on their exports to the industrialized States - which makes it very difficult to attain a reasonable level of growth in the developing countries. Therefore  while we emphasize the importance of expediting debt-relief measures for the developing countries  we also stress the importance of eliminating custom and administrative barriers and of giving developing countries the opportunity of promoting their exports to the industrialized States. We believe that that is the exemplary way to help the developing countries to correct their economic development  and at the same time would benefit the industrialized countries themselves  because this means a real contribution to the expansion of world trade.""The deterioration in the situations of many of the developing countries has increased as a result of a number of natural disasters which have taken the lives of thousands of persons and left millions of the homeless in many regions of the world - and the majority of them were women  children and the elderly. We expressed our deep sorrow at the devastation suffered by Sudan and Bangladesh as a result of the destructive floods. We declared our full solidarity with the two fraternal peoples  and we have put at their disposal all that we can offer in emergency humanitarian assistance. The citizens of Å the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia immediately made - and have continued to make generous contributions to the relief committees in the different parts of the Kingdom  which have enabled them to carry out their humanitarian duties towards the two fraternal peoples. ""Even a cursory glance at the extent of the suffering endured by many developing countries as a result of natural disasters clearly shows the important need for solidarity with them and for helping them to overcome their predicament. At the same time  it demonstrates that the ability to face such catastrophes is linked to the economic strength of these States; and yet we realize that roost of the States susceptible to such catastrophes are the weakest economically and the poorest. That truth leads us to an increased awareness of the problems of development and not to neglect of its humanitarian dimension. It also requires us to acknowledge that our solidarity with the afflicted States cannot be confined to alleviating the suffering of the affected peoples  but  rather  should continue so that these States may overcome their predicament and stand on their feet  so that they may prevail on their path to development.""The breakthrough witnessed in international relations clearly demonstrates the importance of the role of the United Nations in the development of international relations. We are confident that the success achieved by the Organization through that breakthrough entitles it  at the same time  to expect our trust as it deals with the problems of development in a comprehensive and integrated manner  without neglecting the humanitarian side of international economic co-operation.""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  whose principles derive from its compassionate Islamic Shariah and its Hanif faith  which call for peace  justice  equality and brotherhood  has forged for itself the path of peace that originates from these precepts and sublime values and from its belief in the principles and purposes for which the United Nations was created. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is continuing to play its role and to shoulder its responsibilities in every endeavour to achieve a just peace and to take a charitable course. It will continue to work side by side with all the peace-loving States to eliminate the shadows of war and develop friendly relations and fruitful co-operation between peoples  as well as to establish an international society where justice and peace prevail. ""From that standpoint  the decision of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  as a contribution on its part to the consolidation of this peaceful objective  reflects its intention to work within the framework of the efforts being undertaken by the United Nations in this regard. While the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia urges other States to sign the Treaty  it hopes that this action will not be merely voluntary but a basic requirement of international dealings. It also wishes to stress in this regard that the possession of nuclear weapons by States which do not respect the rules of international behaviour and international agreements and refuse to sign and adhere to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty  such as Israel  constitutes in fact a dangerous threat to international peace and security  especially in light of the development of the Israeli nuclear and military capabilities in a manner that is considered to be a source of direct threat to the peace and security of the region. ""Terrorism is one of the problems posing the greatest danger to the safety  peace and stability of societies. The-spread of this phenomenon throughout the international community has led to the disturbance of international relations and to increased anxiety  tension and trouble. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has contributed  with all the means at its disposal  to efforts aimed at combating it and preventing its destructive effects. In this regard the decree issued by the Council of the High Ulema of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia imposing the death penalty upon terrorists  saboteurs and subversives - a decree supported by the Ulema itself and by jurists. Imams and Great Muftis in the Islamic world - is a sign of the Kingdom's determination and underscores our well-known firm stand against a phenomenon that has begun to spread through the world and to pose a threat to the foundations of a stable society.""The position of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with respect to the phenomenon of terrorism accords with the positions adopted in this regard by the summits of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the League of Arab States. Moreover  while joining in the call for an international conference under United Nations auspices to define terrorism  we stress the need to draw a distinction between terrorism which aims to destroy society by striking at its roots  and the right of peoples to defend their existence and struggle for freedom and sovereignty when they have been subjected to occupation  domination  oppression and persecution in disregard of all international principles and norms.""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is presiding over the current session of the Arab Gulf Co-operation Council; we are proud to belong to that Council  which was established in conformity with the charters and resolutions of the League of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference as well as in accordance with the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Charter of the United Nations. The Council has played an effective and constructive role in promoting political  economic  security  social and cultural co-operation among its member States. While the Gulf Co-operation Council expresses the free will of those States and reflects co-operation among them in the context of a common perception of their national interests  it is not in fact a bloc against anyone  but rather a positive factor for stability in the region.""At the beginning of my statement I referred to the great potential of the United Nations in the context of the breakthroughs we have witnessed in many current international problems  breakthroughs in which the Secretary-General personally has had a significant role in bringing about. The success of the United Nations in achieving further breakthroughs in the international arena will unquestionably be linked to its capacity to consolidate and structure this trend and make it an integral part of the political work of the Organization.""If in the early part of my statement I concentrated on the subject of conflicts and what has been accomplished by way of breakthroughs in the international arena it is because the main concern in our region is the achievement of peace and because we are aware  as others ought to be  that instability anywhere is a threat to security everywhere.""The time has come for all of us to bring our thinking into line with contemporary reality and to recognize that all our efforts for the betterment of the life of mankind will be in vain if just and lasting peace remains beyond our grasp. ""The interests of States have become common and intertwined to such a degree that there are no longer any limited conflicts whose effects can be confined to the parties directly involved. We are all partners in the ebb and flow  in good and evil  in war and peace  in prosperity and adversity and in development and underdevelopment. Let us all work together for peace.""May peace and the blessings of God be bestowed upon you."""
"122",6081,"SDN",43,1988,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to extend to you. Sir  our warn congratulations on your election as President of the current session of the General Assembly  which reflects the confidence of the international community in your skill  long experience and well-known wisdom  and is also an expression of appreciation of your friendly country  We are confident that you will lead the work of the session- to achievement of the positive results we all hope for I would also express my delegation's deep appreciation of the skill and competence with which your predecessor served as President of the last session of the General Assembly.It gives me great pleasure to congratulate the Secretary-General on his valuable report on the work of the Organization and efforts in support of international peace and security.This year the world has witnessed important events and developments which have great significance for the efforts aimed at strengthening international peace and security. It has also witnessed serious natural disasters that have inflicted grave damage on the infrastructures of a number of countries and impeded their efforts to achieve development and progress. In this context  I would like to recall the Treaty between the United States of America and the Soviet Union on the elimination of their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  as well as other agreements reached by the two countries at the Washington and Moscow summit meetings of 1987 and 1983  respectively. These developments came as an expression of the peaceful approach adopted by the two super-Powers  the policy of dÃ©tente  and the improvement of the international climate  and also as an indication of the beginning of the movement towards disarmament and the reduction of risk of a nuclear war. While welcoming these steps towards peace  we call on both countries to continue to move in that direction  and we hope to see this policy of reconciliation applied in solving regional and world problems  eradicating racial discrimination and promoting respect for peoplesâ rights to independence and sovereignty.Among the most outstanding issues that should be given more attention by the super-Powers and the United Nations are the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East  which increasingly endanger international peace and security because of Israel's defiance of the resolutions adopted by the United Nations and of the unanimous will of the international community  resulting in its savage acts of terrorism against the defenceless Palestinian people.Peace can never be achieved in the Middle East region unless it is based on the principle of absolute justice. The question of Palestine is the origin and crux of the conflict in the region. Therefore Israel must unconditionally withdraw from the occupied Arab territories  including the Holy City of Jerusalem. In this respect  we reiterate the importance of holding the International Peace Conference on the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The uprising of the Palestinian people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has continued  for almost a year  to cause the loss of life of many martyrs  who have fallen under the fire of Israeli  terrorises and occupation. The militant Palestinian people has proven once more that its resolve will not be weakened and that its determination will increase even more  even at the cost of the greatest sacrifices  due to Israeli terrorism. My delegation wishes therefore  from this rostrum  to commend the struggle and brave resolution of the ""stone children. They have brought an ingenious innovation to the struggle of the Palestinian people and  with unique courage and unwavering determination have exposed the machinery and power of the systematic terrorism pursued by the Tel Aviv government. This people will inevitably triumph  however great the sacrifices may be.We view with deep appreciation the efforts made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to restore peace and to end the war between Iraq and Iran  efforts which culminated in the recent cease-fire. We sincerely hope that the negotiations currently under way will succeed and pave the way to a permanent  comprehensive  peaceful settlement of the conflict between the two countries.The situation in southern Africa is another source of grave concern. The people in that area are still suffering under the yoke of domination and the abhorrent apartheid regime  which is the most rapacious  fascist and racist colonial system. Despite international condemnations  the apartheid regime still persists in its crimes against world conscience and humanity  we salute the people of South Africa for their relentless struggle to attain their legitimate rights and achieve their just demands under the leadership of their legitimate representatives  the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC).The apartheid regime is an affront to humanity. We call upon the international community to help eradicate it by increasing its isolation and by carrying out comprehensive economic sanctions. We also call for support for the efforts that are being made to achieve Namibia's independence and to strengthen the means of implementing the United Nations resolutions aimed at putting an end to Namibia's illegal occupation by South Africa and at supporting the struggle of its people for liberation and sovereignty under the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  their legitimate and sole representative.We hope that the continuing efforts that are being made in the current negotiations to achieve a practical solution that would benefit the Namibian people  on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1987)  will succeed  so that an end may be put to Namibia's illegal occupation by Pretoria  that Namibia may be granted its independence and that favourable conditions may be created for the achievement of this objective.The Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan signed last April are outstanding achievements on the road to establishing peace and reaching a comprehensive settlement of the problem of Afghanistan. We hope that the national reconciliation endeavours currently under way will bear fruit  so that Afghanistan and its people may enjoy security and stability.The success of the United Nations endeavours inspires the hope that peace and security may be attained in other regions of the world. Cambodia still awaits a comprehensive  just and peaceful solution  one that would involve the withdrawal of all foreign forces from its territories and would help create a favourable climate that would enable the Cambodian people to exercise their right to independence and sovereignty. We hope to see the Korean people attain their aspirations and reunite their homeland in peace and without foreign interference.We also hope that political economic and social stability will be achieved by the peoples of Central America.Mr. President  we support what you said in your statement concerning the increasing effectiveness of the United Nations in arriving at a new pattern of international relations based on the belief that the force of arms  however strong  will not solve the problems of the world.The developments the world has witnessed this year have proved the effectiveness of the United Nations and its ability to contribute to the strengthening of peace and stability. We would like in this context to commend the Secretary-General for his wise leadership and efforts to achieve the goals of the United Nations. We congratulate the United Nations on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its peace-keeping operations. We call upon Member States to respect the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations.My country is following with deep concern the exacerbation of the acute crisis in the present international economic order and the negative impact on developing countries  especially the least developed among them. No one can deny the fact that the roots of the crisis lie in the continuation of structural imbalances in the international economic order. This is evident in the decline of the terms of international trade  the decrease in the prices of raw materials exported by developing countries  and the exacerbation of the foreign debt crisis to such an extent that it is now threatening the future of all economic and social developments. It also has political and social repercussions arising from the stagnation of the rates of growth and the decrease in the flow of development assistance. We would like in this context to mention in particular the tardiness of developed countries in fulfilling their obligations to implement resolutions on the International Development Strategy for the second and third development decades  which call upon those countries to allocate .07 per cent of their national income as official assistance for the financing of development in developing countries. The situation is also aggravated by the failure of developed countries to adhere to the decisions contained in the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries  despite the international consensus reached at the Paris Conference in 1980  which resulted in a serious set-back to economic development in the States of this group. The foreign debt crisis in developing countries has begun to assume serious dimensions  posing a major obstacle to the economic and social development of developing countries in general  and of the least developed countries in particular. We are convinced that the crisis is caused mainly by the structural imbalances in the present international economic order. The debt-servicing burden is worsening daily and giving rise to grave dangers as a result of the wrong policies being imposed by some international financial institutions  the stagnation of official development assistance  protectionism  the closure of markets to the exports of developing countries  and the instability of financial markets. This deterioration endangers not only the stability and security of developing countries  but also international stability and security. Therefore  my country would like to appeal from this rostrum for urgent international action to deal with the foreign debt crisis on a general  comprehensive and systematic basis  taking into account the importance of recognizing the principle of the common responsibility of both developing and developed countries  and the necessity of dealing with the debt crisis within a comprehensive international strategy.In this context  my delegation wishes to mention some positive signs at the international level  in particular the increasing awareness of the necessity of finding urgent and just solutions to the debt problem. In this vein  my delegation commends and welcomes the decisions taken at the industrial nations' summit ' meeting  held in Toronto  Canada  last June. Those decisions contained the first clear and explicit consensus among the major industrial nations on the importance of taking practical and concrete steps towards alleviating the debt burden of the poorest countries  especially those of Africa. In particular we would recall the recommendation calling for the writing off of the debts of poor African countries  which we believe would constitute an extremely important step towards containing this serious crisis.The critical economic situation in Africa also causes deep concern. The already grave economic crisis in Africa that has resulted from several external and internal factors has been exacerbated by natural disasters such as drought  desertification and floods. In this context my delegation expresses total support for implementation of the decisions contained in the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990  which was unanimously endorsed by the General Assembly at its thirteenth special session in May 1986. We observe with regret that several developed countries have failed to fulfil their obligations concerning the implementation of decisions contained in the Programme of Action  especially in the area of providing financial resources to finance development  as clearly shown in the medium-term evaluation of the African Programme of Action at the meetings of the Committee of the Whole held last month in this Hall. My delegation expresses its full support for the recommendations of the Committee of the Whole on the medium-term evaluation of the African Programme of Action and appeals to the developed countries to fulfil their obligations in order to secure the success of common efforts before 1990.My delegation stresses its firm belief in the principle of interdependence and organic integrity of the international economic order for the benefit of all  which can only be achieved through the devising of full and comprehensive solutions based on the principles of equality  justice and equitable opportunities. Accordingly  the activation of constructive dialogue between developing and developed countries constitutes an urgent and vital demand at this critical juncture  at which the international community faces major dangers and challenges which require wisdom  courage  clarity of vision and political will. We believe that the gravity of the present international economic crisis requires the intensification of efforts to devise a complete strategy  to reopen the channels of North-South dialogue in order to restructure the present international economic order  and to establish a new international economic order with a view to accelerating economic and social development in developing countries within the framework of interdependence and common benefit. The people of the Sudan have confirmed their determination to uphold the democratic option by establishing a national-accord Government which is a clear manifestation of the unanimous will of the people. That Government is supported by 90 per cent of the members of the Constituent Assembly. Its support is also rooted in a wide popular base  and is based on the rule of law  judiciary independence  freedom of expression and association  and respect for human and fundamental rights.The Sudan is not content with absolute-majority democracy; it transcends that  aspiring to reach the goal of total national unity through integral conciliation by accommodating the minority. Thus  the Sudan called for a constitutional conference attended by all political forces to discuss questions and problems in order to reach solutions by peaceful means. Accordingly  the Sudan adopted a consistent position vis-Ã -vis the rebellion movement in the south  based on inviting it to enter into a dialogue instead of fighting.The Government 's peaceful initiatives coincided with efforts to improve relations with neighbouring countries on the basis of the Sudan's foreign policy principles - that is  commitment to international and regional covenants  respect for sovereignty  non-interference in the internal affairs of States and pursuing a policy of maintaining good relations with its neighbours.On the basis of those firm principles of our foreign policy  we moved to conduct more serious dialogue with our friendly neighbour Ethiopia in order to solve problems between our two countries and promote prospects for co-operation  with a view to establishing more stability in the region. We even aspire to making the whole region of the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa a secure and peaceful place far from the rivalries and conflicts of the great Powers.My country is now faced with extremely difficult economic conditions. It is earnestly trying to cope with them through a four-year programme for salvation  rehabilitation and development and the formulation of strict substantive policies to restore balance and enable the economy to advance in a negative international economic climate. The Assembly is well aware of the adverse effects of that climate on the economies of the developing countries  especially the least developed countries.Moreover  we have been faced with great challenges and successive natural disasters. Our country  as the Assembly is aware  is host to more than 1 million refugees  due to my Government's commitment to international and regional covenants which regulate refuge. However  the burden of hosting refugees  given our country's complicated economic circumstances  which I have indicated  has surpassed our absorptive capacity and adversely affected our economic and developmental environment and efforts. The Assembly made reference to this in its resolution 42/129 by emphasizing the heavy burden on the people and Government of the Sudan and the serious social and economic impact caused by the presence of large numbers of refugees and its effect on development and infrastructure.In this context  I should like to renew our thanks and appreciation for the generous appeal made by the General Assembly to the international community last Match to render immediate assistance to my country in order to enable it to cope with the increasing consequences of hosting increasing numbers of refugees. We also thank the Secretary-General for the joint missions we sent to the Sudan. It gives me pleasure to express our appreciation for the reports and recommendations which these missions have presented to the General Assembly.We hope that at this session the General Assembly will be able to study the important proposal included in the Secretary-General's report (A/41/264) which calls for the establishment of a new group constituted of the States called ""refugee affected countries""  and that those States can obtain preferential treatment as regards international developmental aid.Apart from the refugee crisis  my country has been exposed to a wide migratory ' movement from the south to the north as a result of the rebellion movement  which is increasingly supported from outside the country. My Government strives to provide those migrants with shelter  food  education and medical treatment. The United Nations and the international community have been helping us deal with this formidable disaster  which involved the migration of more than 1 million persons to the north and a consequent burden in terms of refugees. Even as that help was being tendered my country fell victim last August to a serious disaster caused by torrential rain and flooding  resulting in huge losses and the destruction of roads  railways  farms  houses  public facilities  communications systems and power networks. More than 2 million individuals lost their houses in Khartoum and the northern province.Before these torrential rains and flooding ended  wide areas of the Sudan were invaded by locusts  posing a genuine threat to agriculture and the environment not only in the Sudan but in all the States of the region.We extend our sincere thanks and appreciation to our sister States and Governments and to non-governmental organizations for their help in providing relief for the victims. At the same time  we hope that support will continue beyond the time of emergency to consolidate our efforts to rebuild infrastructure  public facilities and various projects concerned with production. In that connection  we consider it necessary to conduct studies of the increase in natural disasters  to which a number of speakers have referred. Studies have shown that in the 1960s disasters claimed 5 million victims  they claimed 15 million in the 1970s  and that figure has doubled before the end of the 1980s. I hope that phenomenon will prompt the United Nations and the entire international community to study the question seriously  to reconsider the performance of existing machinery  and to devise the best practical means and efficient methods and machinery to handle such disasters.We hope also that the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its last session  which declared the 1990s as the international decade for natural disaster reduction  with a view to enhancing international co-operation in this field  will help consolidate ongoing efforts to confront these increasing disasters more effectively.Finally  I should like to reiterate our confidence in the United Nations and its leadership and in its capability to make an active contribution to strengthening international peace and security. Its achievements have confirmed its credibility and effectives as an invincible fortress of peace  prosperity and progress for the human race in line with the purposes and the spirit of the Charter."
"123",6126,"SEN",43,1988,"ï»¿The delegation of Senegal is pleased to extend to the President through m  its warmest congratulations  to wish him very success in the important task conferred upon him and to assure him  in this context  of its complete co-operation and total support. His election to the presidency of the forty-third session of our Assembly is an eloquent tribute solemnly paid by the Members of the United Nations to his great country as well as to him on the outstanding intellectual and moral qualities he possesses. His high sense of responsibility  his faith in the United Nations and his vast experience in the field of international affairs undoubtedly guarantee that the work of the present session will meet with success.Mr. Peter Florin  who preceded him in his office  conducted our debates successfully throughout his term of office. We should like here to reiterate our gratitude to him.I should like also to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Hr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  a man of courage and conviction  a staunch fighter for peace and co-operation among peoples  who deserves our appreciation and out support for the continuation and completion of the remarkable task to which he has totally dedicated himself and whose encouraging results in many ways demonstrate the timeliness and impact of the noble ideals of our Organization  as well as a positive perception of his role in the field of international peace  security and co-operation.In the history of nations as well as of institutions  there are critical times when the future of mankind is decided. The present period seems to us to be one of those crucial moments which call upon our conscience  invite us to reflect anew  and encourage us to redouble our political will  determination  lucidity and courage in our endeavours. It is in this spirit that my delegation would like to make its modest contribution to this joint reflection  the primary objective of which must be the safeguarding and strengthening of international peace and security as well as the development of a space for active solidarity within our global village.Four themes will serve as points of reference with regard to our contribution: human rights on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights peace in the world in connection with the positive work done by the United Nations for the settlement of certain regional conflicts} development in a spirit of solidarity  in connection with the mid-term review of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990Å£ and the strengthening of our United Nations through implementation of the recently adopted reforms.The celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights certainly gives us an opportunity to rejoice at the important successes achieved by the United Nations in the promotion and protection of human rights and freedom  and above all to consider what remains to be done in order to free mankind from all oppression. Concerning the balance sheet  suffice it to say that by proclaiming the Universal Declaration in 1948 and continuing to make appropriate efforts since then to transform the principles in that document into internationally binding obligations within the framework of legal instruments at the global level for which it attempts to ensure respect by States  the United Nations has accomplished remarkable work  in keeping with the basic aspirations of our peoples. The historical importance of that work must be recognized.As a State that has made respect for human rights a cardinal principle of its politics both within its constitutional system and in its foreign policy  and a country whose resolute commitment to the principles and objectives of the 1948 Declaration have won it many tributes  Senegal takes this opportunity to reaffirm its resolute support for the work of the United Nations to safeguard human rights.Just as at the domestic level it established a multi-partisan democracy whose multifaceted expression is a sign of its vitality and its deep roots in the thinking of people  just as it contributed to the achievement of this in the African continent by playing an important part in developing and ratifying the African Charter of Human and Peoples Rights and just as it is attempting to do in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights  in which the unanimous and consistent confidence of the international community has won it a continued presence over many decades and the active presidency of that Commission on the occasion of its fortieth anniversary  so my country will spare no effort in the continued quest for greater justice and equity in human relations at all levels.The quest continues because it is an effort that can know no respite until the total eradication of all vestiges of arbitrary rule and brute force such as exist  in particular  in southern Africa and in Palestine  has been achieved. The situation in these regions and many others is a clear indication of the efforts that remain to be made so that our world may come closer to the ideals for the attainment of which in inter-State relations the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should be the instrument.This struggle for the universal enjoyment of human rights is continuing today in the sphere of the protection of a sound global environment. As a Sahelian country attacked by desertification  Senegal is particularly sensitive to new threats that alter the quality of life on our planet and dangerously affect the fate of present and future generations  is why my country  like other African States  has asked the international community to draw up provisions without delay to prevent the developing countries from becoming dumping grounds for industrial waste from the developed countries. Such action would be an important  practical contribution to the defence of the rights of the weak and deprived and to the struggle against the degradation of the ecology  which we sincerely believe must be a global struggle.The hopes aroused by the improved relations between the super-Powers - which we welcome as it could bring about the strengthening of international peace and security - have not yet been translated into a new order in keeping with our expectations  in other words  a real democratization of international relations based on justice  equality of rights and the safeguarding of the interests of all the peoples of the world. Of course  the promise of the beginning of healthier international relations exists  and with that promise the will has been expressed in different regions to seek solutions to the various tensions  sources of friction and crises that exist.Thus  the doors of peace have begun to open in Afghanistan  in Kampuchea  in the Gulf region  in Western Sahara and in South-West Africa. This process must be encouraged and supported. But we must also work to promote the emergence of conditions that can lead to the extension of this process to other areas of regional conflict  beginning with the Middle East.That is  in our humble opinion  the sense of the message that the Norwegian Parliament addressed to our Assembly by awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. In the name of President Abdou Diouf and the Senegalese Government and people  I welcome this well-deserved tribute to the persevering efforts of our Organisation to eliminate hotbeds of tension  encourage the solution of conflicts by peaceful means and promote international peace and security. For Senegal  this award is of special significance. My country has always supported the peace-keeping operations decided upon by the Organisation and has endeavoured to make a practical contribution to their success by sending contingents on many occasions. We sincerely hope that this great distinction will encourage all the member of the international community to give their effective support to the United Nations peace-keeping forces  which have new  urgent and important tasks ahead of them.Deeply concerned by the vital issue of maintaining peace and security in the world  the Non-Aligned Movement  a few days ago in Nicosia  assessed what had been accomplished and what remains to be accomplished and took decisions on how the major problems of our day could be evaluated and tackled. By reiterating their commitment to the establishment of genuine collective security  by demanding the strict rule of law and of justice and the cessation of policies of oppression and domination  by proclaiming their will to stop being the arena and the prize of global confrontation  the countries of the Movement made it a protagonist in the new  changing international relations.The Non-Aligned Movement has had to call for increased respect for the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter  because among its ranks axe peoples still dominated and oppressed and regions where there are hotbeds of conflict and tension. Thus in southern Africa  after four decades  the question of apartheid still arises in the same time the legitimate aspirations of a people are still stifled and its right to freedom and dignity violated. In that region a system survives under which every day people die under barbarous repression; a system under which a people is subjected with impunity to the arbitrariness of racist repression; a system under which the peoples of southern Africa are the victims of the outrageous belligerence of a racist totalitarian order. In southern Africa we see the survival of a system that the international community has declared to be a crime against mankind. Therefore  the international community has the historic responsibility of ending that system.The only way to do that is through comprehensive  mandatory sanctions that measure up to the magnitude of the crime. To delay such action in southern Africa can only result in the sacrifice of millions more lives that could be saved. The outcome of the struggle being waged by the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC)  the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC)  the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and the front-line countries will be linked in history with the picture of the past 30 years  in which many peoples who were previously oppressed have become free and independent. The same law of oppression  aggression  occupation and plunder continues to apply in Palestine and the Middle East  where injustice must be redressed and national rights must be restored. The lessons to be learned from the historic resistance of the Palestinian people to occupation and oppression are unambiguous: there can be no lasting peace in the Middle East without the involvement of the Palestinian people and its vanguard organization  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) - no peace without them  nor  a fortiori  against them.The promotion of peace in the Middle East requires  first  working for the convening of an international conference under United Nations auspices. The representatives that the Palestinian people have chosen to express their views and aspirations must participate on an equal footing with all the other parties to the conflict. I am referring of course  to the Palestine Liberation Organization.As guarantor of the right of peoples to decide their own destiny a right that it has made a universal principle  the international community must shoulder its full responsibilities in southern Africa and in Palestine. By clearly assuming its obligations and taking the decisions that the situation requires  it would meet the expectations of the peoples of those regions. There is overwhelming international solidarity in condemning oppression and denouncing occupation  but it is sometimes difficult to organize it into the collective response that such challenges demand.I have said that the doors of peace are beginning to open in a number of conflicts  where hope of a speedy solution is emerging and becoming stronger. In most cases the principles applicable and the framework for a settlement have been unambiguously defined. In the process of applying those principles we must avoid viewing the problems through the distorting prism of ideologies and partisan politics and must ensure that they are not narrowly dealt with in the restricted ambit of East-West relations.However  there are other hot-beds of tension that have defied our Organizationâs peace-making efforts for many years. One is Cyprus  where the de facto situation continues to jeopardize its unity and territorial integrity. Senegal very much hopes for the prompt success of the Secretary-General's efforts for the restoration of sovereignty to that friendly country.Another example is another friendly country  Lebanon  wounded by a combination of civil war  occupation of part of its territory and numerous acts of interference in its affairs  threatening its very existence. Senegal calls for dialogue to begin soon to preserve its identity  territorial integrity  unity and independence. The Korean peninsula provides another example. We desire peaceful reunification through sincere  fraternal talks  taking into account the free will of the whole Korean people. Despite some hopes of peace  I cannot fall to mention again this year the occupation  aggression and oppression experienced by Cambodia  and I must repeat Senegal's appeal for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Cambodia and the restoration of a genuine Cambodian Government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk.My final example is Central America  where my country will continue to support the peace efforts of the Contadora Group to bring about a political settlement with absolute respect for the sovereignty of all the States of the region. Alongside the political challenges of preserving human rights and struggling for peace  which require the efforts of most of our States  we face the harmful effects of a continuing economic crisis  especially in the developing countries  which I do not need to elaborate now.Among the main problems that our countries still confront is the heavy burden of foreign debt and the intolerable pressure of all kinds that results from it.The debt constitutes a major obstacle to lasting growth and development in our countries because of its negative influence on our ability to import  invest and achieve our economic and social development goals. So far only partial  short-term and medium-term measures have been taken with regard to the debt  in a climate characterized above all by a decrease in flows of resources towards the developing countries  high interest rates and an unprecedented decline in commodity prices.Faced with such a situation  the international community must urgently adopt a new strategy based on growth and a sharing of responsibilities in order to achieve a lasting  comprehensive solution of the debt problem of the third-world countries  taking into account the guiding principles established in resolution 42/1S8 and the results of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII). In this regard  the Governments of the developed countries are becoming increasingly aware of the need to integrate dealing with the tragic economic situation of the developing countries into the strategy for global economic recovery. We commend unilateral decisions to alleviate or partially reduce the debt burden of the least favoured countries  proposals to refinance the debt in the form of bonds and to create multilateral funds for the debt and so on. However  important as those measures may be as symbols of solidarity  they are not in themselves enough to improve the economic situation of the developing countries. More general measures must also be taken. In particular  the access of developing countries' exports to international markets must be facilitated by the elimination of protectionist barriers in the developed countries  equitable  remunerative prices must be fixed foe the exports of developing countries; and there must be established a direct and clear link between payment of the foreign debt and factors that influence debt-servicing  such as export income  terms of trade  imports and the growth of gross national product. Another problem is that of the adjustment efforts by the developing countries. These adjustment programmes  which everyone believes are useful  have begun  in certain countries  to have positive results. None the less  the programmes  because they focus on major macro-economic balances  have given rise to very difficult situations - situations that are sometimes unacceptable from a social standpoint. So that adjustment efforts can go on  it is important for the international community to support the measures taken by the developing countries in order to alleviate the social consequences of recovery programmes.The situation in Africa remains critical  especially because of the combined effects of natural disasters  the decline in the prices of export commodities  the heavy debt-servicing burden and the stagnation of financial flows. It is true that the Advisory Group on Financial Flows for Africa  which our dynamic Secretary-General established  recognized that the additional financial support requested of the international community in the framework of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development was far from excessive vis-Ã -vis the funds of the developed world and State expenditures in these countries.What is needed  and what is at stake  is less the importance of the effort than the political will of certain industrialized States  as has been shown in the mid-term review of the Programme at the meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on Africa's Priority Programme for Economic Recovery  held in Dakar last June  and by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole on the United Nations Programme of Action  whose work was completed just a few days ago in New York.Having made specific proposals here a year ago with regard to the mid-term review of the United Nations Programme of Action  my country will at this point confine itself to that statement and a reference to the many suggestions that have already been made with a view to ensuring the success of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development within its' five-year term - 1986-1990 - and for the conclusions of the special session of the General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa to be implemented effectively. Let me repeat the appeal that His Excellency President Abdou Diouf made to ourAssembly just a little over two years ago when  as current Chairman of the OAU  he participated in the opening of the special session on the critical situation in Africa: we must always bear in mind that  having overcome so many major challenges in the past  mankind should certainly be able to overcome the challenge of solidarity with Africa in order to implement  with the support of the international community  its Priority Programme for Economic Recovery.Before concluding I should like to say a few words about the financial crisis of the United Nations and the need to enhance the Organization's effectiveness. For years now it has been confronting an increasingly worrying financial crisis. The causes of this situation have been debated at length here  so it is not necessary for me to repeat them. At its fortieth session the General Assembly decided  in resolution 40/237  dated 18 December 1985  to give a mandate to a group of 18 high-level Intergovernmental experts to study ways and means of making the United Nations more effective  more flexible and more orderly  and thus demonstrated its fervent wish to remedy the crisis. The report of that Group was studied thoroughly in the course of the forty-first session of the Assembly  and recommendations were made concerning the administrative  financial and technical aspects of the Organization.Resolution 41/213 of 19 December 1986  on the effectiveness of administrative and technical functions  endorsed the report of the Group of 18 with a view to making the multilateral system more dynamic through the implementation of reforms by the Secretary-General. What has been achieved from implementation of the resolution confirms our impression that important progress has been made in improving the management of the United Nations. While my delegation is justly pleased  it is  on the other hand  concerned that  because of the situation of financial instability that is constantly faced by the Organization  the process of reform may not be completed.Financial stability is all the more essential at a time when the United Nations is committing itself  on many fronts  to restoring peace in the world and to strengthening its role as the principal framework and instrument for the development of peaceful co-operation in the closing years of this century. Thus  my country wishes to make an appeal to all Member States to support the Secretary-General in his efforts to implement the necessary reforms of the multilateral system  and to do so  first and foremost  by meeting their financial obligations rapidly and on a regular basis.Our peoples are wondering about the political will and real capacity of this universal Organization to take full advantage of the current international climate  which is conducive to the dynamics of peace. A glimmer of hope has been rekindled in the hearts of millions of long-suffering men  women and children  whose dignity has long been trampled underfoot whose hopes have long been disappointed  and whose legitimate ambitions have long been obstructed.So that we may progress securely on the path of peace  justice and freedom  we must rally our energies and channel them towards our higher shared goals. We must quiet our differences in order to devote to the fundamentals that unite us our full resources and our full potential  for that unites us is priceless since it is the very destiny of mankind that is at issue.

"124",6173,"SGP",43,1988,"ï»¿For the past few years  we have been meeting hers with the financial crisis hanging over the United Nations like the sword of Damocles. Today the financial crisis continues unabated  primarily because of the reluctance of a few Member States to meet their legal dues  but the sword of Damocles has vanished. There is now widespread global recognition that the United Nations is an indispensable instrument in the search for peace. After the Afghanistan and Iran-Iraq agreements  the critics of the United Nations have been silenced  at least for quite a while.Under these auspicious circumstances  I am pleased to see you  Mr. President  presiding over a General Assembly session which will mark a turning-point in the history of the United Nations. With your extensive international experience and your country's commitment to the ideals of the United Nations  I have no doubt that you will bring to this session the right measure of fairness  firmness and guidance. I would also like to place on record our appreciation for the excellent work done by your predecessor  Mr  Peter Florin  who presided over one of the busiest year."" in the life of the United Nations.There is no doubt that 1988 will go down as one of the most remarkable years in United Nations history. Seemingly intractable problems are now making gradual progress at the negotiating table. A large part of the credit for this must go to the United Nations Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who never lost faith in the United Nations ability to contribute to peace even in some of the recent dark days of the United Nations history. His courageous and dedicated efforts  combined with his unflagging patience  resulted in the agreements on Afghanistan and the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. We applaud his commitment to finding solutions to the other equally intractable problems in the Middle East  southern Africa  Cyprus  Western Sahara  and especially Kampuchea.We are troubled that the hints of peace we get from Viet Nam on the Kampuchean problem remain meagre and uncertain. As long as the invasion and occupation of Kampuchea continues to threaten the peace and stability in North-East Asia  we are gratified that the Secretary-General and his Special Representative  Mr. Rafeeuddin Ahmed  continue to work on the Kampuchean issue. We also believe that the United Nations commitment to the search for peace in Kampuchin is in full inconformity with the letter and spirit of the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement  which declared in its latest Summit Meeting  in Harare  that ""the United Nations represented the most appropriate international forum with the central role in the maintenance of international peace and security and peaceful settlement of international disputes and crises ..."". (A/41/697  Political Declaration  para. 314) While the remarkable political developments of 1988 deserve our full attention and scrutiny at this General Assembly  they will not be the focus of my remarks. These recent developments represent significant changes in the political currents. Underneath these currents there are more significant tidal changes taking place which could significantly alter the political and economic landscape of our globe. These deep tidal changes are more difficult to perceive than the swift changes of currents we see on the surface  but their impact could be more enduring and perhaps determine the shape of the twenty-first century.These tidal changes are manifesting themselves in the remarkable change in the attitudes of all the major Powers and richer and more developed nations. In the past few decades the conventional wisdom in most multilateral forums was that it was the poorer  struggling nations of the South that faced a precarious and uncertain future. The richer and more developed nations of the North  viewing the future with greater self-confidence  were expected to channel their resources  imagination and energy to helping the South.Quite suddenly  in the past few years  it has been the richer nations of the North which have begun to speak and behave like endangered species. All these major Powers  perhaps with the rare exception of Japan  are now afraid that unless they make dramatic adjustments in their economic policies they may slip badly behind in the new industrial and technological race that has been unleashed. Nations that ate able to ride on the new technological wave will assure themselves of a privileged place in the twenty-first century; those that are not will be- considerably weakened.It is this realization that explains  for example  the dramatic reforms being undertaken in the Soviet Union under the banner of perestroika - a word that is now as easily recognizable in the English language as in the Russian. Any nation that worries about its future today should attempt to carry our equally bold restructuring  or perestroika  of its social  economic and political systems.There is no other choice  as demonstrated also by another large and important nation  China  which is attempting equally dramatic and no less visible changes in its economic system.Significant as these developments have been  they are dwarfed by the changes taking place in the even more developed economies. The largest bilateral trading relationship in the world is between the United States and Canada  with trade totalling 3130 billion per year. This trading relationship is likely to be further strengthened with the expected ratification of the United States-Canada free trade agreement by the two countries  resulting perhaps in the creation of a single  enormous North American market.Large as this market may become  it could still be smaller than another giant economic animal that will emerge in four years' time: the single European market. The decision in 1987 of the 12 Parliaments of the European Community to ratify the Single European Act virtually guaranteed the market's creation by 31 December 1992. The progress towards it may be slow  since the process of formulating it will be based on 300 directives  200 of which have been put to the Council of Ministers of the European Community and 69 of which have been passed. The political will to create a single European market is manifest.The economic benefits of such a single market could be immense. Today the Community has a total population of 320 million and a combined gross national product of $4.6 trillion. One study  by the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Commission  entitled ""The Economics of 1992"" and published in 1988  predicted an increase of gross domestic product when the single market is created of between 3.2 per cent and 5.7 per cent in the medium term  a 4 5 per cent to 7.7 per cent decrease in consumer prices  and the creation of between 1.3 million and 2.3 million new jobs. Other equally important changes will be taking place with the creation of the single European market  in the form of the gradual removal of the administrative barriers that separate the 12 nations.In 1992  or a little later  it will be possible for goods and services to flow freely among the 12 countries - perhaps an unprecedented development in the history of man  since a similar removal of national barriers has been accomplished in the past only through empire-building. Today these barriers are being removed voluntarily. For the citizens of the European Community this means that they will be able to go to college  work or retire in whichever European country they choose; to travel around without having to show passports; and to save their money in any of the 12 currencies  which may eventually become one currency.We can imagine what the world would look like if the other subregions were to attempt equally dramatic reductions in the artificial barriers that separate nations. Here again  the established wisdom is that it could not happen in other parts of the world  which are beset by national  ethnic or territorial conflicts. This may be so. Yet it may be salutary to remind ourselves that only 44 years ago the battlefields of Europe were drenched in the blood of millions of soldiers trying to defend or extend frontiers. If some of those soldiers are alive today  and some of them surely must be  they must be puzzled that the frontiers they defended with blood and enormous sacrifice are now being voluntarily dismantled in some significant respects.All countries which are at war today should pause to reflect on the European experience. If the armies of Viet Nam - to cite one example - were to return to their national frontiers and Viet Nam were to live peacefully with its neighbours  it could easily become a dynamic and prosperous nation. Instead  its people ate today suffering considerable economic misery and deprivation  leading to the severe outflow of economic migrants ; who have put a heavy burden on the rest of South-East Asia. The choice is clear: do we want to go the way of Europe or the way of Indo-China?Although we commend the growing integration of developed economies  we are mindful of the dangers it could pose for the global economy. One fundamental reason why the global economy has enjoyed relatively steady and constant growth rates has been the creation of an open and fair trading system under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  which has been in force since 1 January 1948. If the new economic giants of North America  Western Europe and Japan were to try to build economic fortresses that divided up the global economy they could well increase the vast gap between the rich and the poor nations. Members of the United Nations should be vigilant and ready to defend the open global economic system. It would be ironic and tragic if the economic integration designed to remove national economic barriers ended up by creating even more formidable economic barriers which shut most developing countries our of the global economic system.These are some of the major challenges that we shall face in the years to come. The United Nations has adjusted well to the new political currents sweeping across the globe today. It needs to pay equal attention to some of the major tidal changes that are forthcoming. If this General Assembly session could begin to focus its attention on some of these issues  it might well make a historic contribution. "
"125",6206,"SLB",43,1988,"ï»¿Sir  permit me to extend to you my congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. I am confident that with your wisdom and diplomatic skills you will effectively guide the deliberations of this session to a successful conclusion. To this end  I assure you of my delegation's support and co-operation.To your predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic  I convey the deep appreciation of my government for the excellent manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the last session.I also take this opportunity to thank our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  for his commitment and for his endeavours towards the fulfilment of our common desire for international peace and security. The award of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prise to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is indeed a worthy tribute to those who have risked and are risking their lives for peace. Since last we gathered here a year ago there has been a dramatic change in the international political climate. The role of the United Nations as a peacemaker has been reaffirmed. My delegation is therefore encouraged by the recent positive developments  which have brought rays of hope and the promise of peace to the troubled regions of our world. We are heartened that  after eight years of conflict the guns have fallen silent in the Persian Gulf and peace is being given a chance. The basis of that peace is Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We therefore earnestly appeal to Iran and Iraq  and all Member States of the United Nations  to co-operate with the Secretary-General in the effort to find a lasting solution to this conflict.The situation in Afghanistan also shows signs of hope and the process of peace. Hence  we welcome the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan and urge all parties to respect the letter and the spirit of those Accords to ensure nothing is done to slow the progress towards peace.We regard with optimism the apparent breakthrough in the 13-year war in Western Sahara. We note  particularly  the proposal by the Secretary-General in August whereby a cease-fire would be declared  followed by a referendum for the people of Western Sahara.My Government also regards with equal optimism the tripartite  agreement which provides for the withdrawal of South African troops from Angola and the possible implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia. It is our earnest hope that South Africa will respect the tripartite agreement and proceed to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We have always supported the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia and take this opportunity to reaffirm this support.The ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - by the two super-Powers is a major achievement of our tine. We commend the display of political will by the Soviet Union and the United States to reach an agreement calling for a 50 per cent reduction in their strategic nuclear arsenals. It is the hope of ay delegation that this achievement in disarmament will eventually lead to comprehensive disarmament  which includes not only nuclear weapons but conventional and chemical weapons a  well.Solomon Islands reaffirms its support for the principle of the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas  to be pursued without outside interference. We would welcome and support membership of the United Nations for both countries. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Republic of Korea on its role as host of the very successful XXIV summer Olympic Games.While we hail with gratification the developments in Afghanistan  the Western Sahara and the Persian Gulf  we are still gravely concerned about the atrocious situation in South Africa  where apartheid remains the root cause of conflict. Apartheid is institutionalised racism. In itself  it is evil. It must be eradicated - not reformed  but eradicated.With many sanctions already imposed and with the Pretoria regime showing no signs of giving in  it is time for the international community to take the only option left that is  to apply comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter  My delegation reiterates its abhorrence of apartheid and continues to support the call for comprehensive sanctions against South Africa.In the Middle East  peace is still denied to peoples of the region. My Government shares the view that the convening of an international conference on the Middle East sponsored by the United Nations would pave the way for a peaceful  comprehensive and just settlement of this conflict. We urge the Secretary-General to continue his good efforts to ensure the convening of such a conference. The situation in Kampuchea still requires surveillance by the international community. Hostilities have now entered their tenth year. My Government urges the' withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops so as to facilitate the settlement of the Kampuchean problem by the Kampuchean people themselves  free from outside interference.On 2 December 1986 the Assembly adopted resolution 41/41 A inscribing New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. This  in effect  gave the United Nations a major role in the decolonisation process in New Caledonia. My Government reaffirms the stand that the United Nations  through its appropriate organ  must be actively involved in this process  as must all the people of New Caledonia  including the original inhabitants  the indigenous Kanak people. To continue turning a blind eye to the United Nations principles &s well as the wishes of the major communal group could certainly take us back to the sad events of the morning of 5 May 1988 on the island of Ouvea in New Caledonia. Therefore  we are encouraged that the new Prime Minister of France has reopened dialogue with all the parties in New Caledonia and is working towards a long-term solution of the problems in this Non-Self-Governing Territory.At the nineteenth South Pacific Forum  which was held in Nufualofa  Tonga  last month and which my Prime Minister attended  the Forum leaders also welcomed the efforts of the administering Power to bring about a resumption of the dialogue between all the communities in New Caledonia. The Forum  inter alia  urged France to ensure that the proposed 1988 act of self-determination would be consistent with the established decolonisation practices and principles of the United Nations. The road to the resolution of the problems of New Caledonia is certainly not a smooth one. There are real problems to overcome. But with these new developments we look forward to an internationally accepted self-determination exercise in New Caledonia.I have already welcomed the ratification of the INF Treaty by the two super-Powers. This is a major step forward in the disarmament process. Another major step on the road to disarmament is the Treaty of Sarotonga  which declares the South Pacific region a nuclear-free zone. We are therefore deeply grateful to the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China  which have ratified Protocols 2 and 3 of the Treaty. We are disappointed  however  that France  the United Kingdom and the United States have yet to sign and ratify Protocols 1  2 and 3 of the Treaty  and we call on then to do so as a genuine demonstration of their goodwill towards the South Pacific region and its peoples  and the peoples of the world. Nuclear testing in our region haÂ· always been one of our major concerns. It remains a grave concern to us. Despite our numerous calls for the complete halting of these tests  France continues to carry out its nuclear-testing programme on Mururoa Atoll in Polynesia. I do not wish to insult the intelligence of this Assembly by giving a lecture on the effects of nuclear pollution. We all know the facts; it kills. Solomon Islands is totally opposed to nuclear testing  dumping and the use of nuclear weapons in our region. We again call on France to cease its nuclear-testing programme in our region.The current trend in the world economy is another problem of enormous propositions for developing countries. Our efforts to increase our export capacity are being frustrated by the distorted policies characterising the current international trading system. Those policies force a standstill  or  yet worse  negative growth  in our fledgling economies.Solomon Islands is a primary commodities producer. Restricted entry into the world market for these commodities is a heavy burden on our already ailing economy. My Government  therefore  attaches special importance to the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The question of reforming the agricultural and commodity trading systems must be resolved. We earnestly hope that the deliberations during the Uruguay Round will create greater opportunities for the developing countries to acquire a just share of the world's resources.In this context  I must say that special consideration must be given to the unique problems of island developing countries. Small internal markets  limited resources  poor communications  distance and natural disasters are but a few of those problems. On behalf of the Government and people of Solomon Islands  convey to the Government and people of Jamaica our deepest sympathy on their countryÂ· devastation by hurricane Gilbert. We understand and share their grief  for whichÂ·  on numerous occasions in the past  been through similar ordeals at nature's capricious hands.The point is that when addressing our special needs there must be some flexibility in the aid policies of our aid donors and of the world's financial institutions. Having said that  I must add that when it comes to trade we in the Pacific suffer more than other island developing countries simply because of our isolation from the major world markets. I arrived from Brussels just a few hours ago. Brussels is 11 500 miles from Honiara. Our commodities  therefore  have to take the long and expensive route to the European Economic Community (EEC). Despite the various problems we encounter as an island economy  we have striven and will always strive to better the lives of our people. We have to learn to live within our means - our means being our available resources and the different forms of assistance we believe to be available to us from friendly nations and multinational institutions.In this regard  we welcome the Multilateral Fisheries Treaty with the United States  which came into force during the year  so that benefits are already being received by the countries party to the Treaty  including my own. We look forward to achieving similar arrangements with other major fishing nations which fish in our waters. In this respect  my Government is very grateful to the Canadian Government and people for making available approximately $US 10 million to the Forum Fisheries Agency  which is based in Solomon Islands  for the development of the marine and ocean resources of the South Pacific region. Every year there is a special occasion. Thin year  on 7 July  Solomon Islands celebrated its tenth independence anniversary. We are very grateful for the kind congratulatory messages sent to us during our anniversary celebrations. It was also 10 years ago that I stood here to bear witness to the admission of my country to the Membership's Midst as the 150th member. My pledge then was that Solomon Islands would accept the obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and undertake to fulfil them. Today  let me conclude by reaffirming that pledge and the commitment of my country to the lofty ideals of this body.Finally  I should like to thank you. Mr. President  and our fellow members of the United Nations for letting Solomon Islands have the last word in this general debate."
"126",6253,"SLE",43,1988,"ï»¿There is an awesome power that pervades this Hall and the universe. It is a power that instils courage in the weak and humility in the strong. It is the timeless compassion and mercy of that ultimate and unseen authority chat inspired universal existence. It is to that eternal authority that I now raise my voice in silent thanksgiving and gratitude  for the glorious opportunity to address this dignified audience for the first time of my presidency.Let roe register my personal and my country's sincere congratulations to you  Sir  as President of this forty-third session. Your election is a testimony of your acknowledged ability and extensive diplomatic experience as representative of your friendly country  Argentina. We are assured that as you succeed the distinguished and dedicated Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic  Mr. Peter Florin  the work of this Assembly will be further enhanced.Permit me also to pay warm tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  who has shown tremendous courage in defending the Charter of the United Nations and unwavering tenacity in pursuing the Charter goals of peace and human dignity in all parts of the world. He will surely be remembered as the man who rescued the United Nations from imminent collapse in the face of impossible odds  and quickly transformed it into the most effective universal instrument for neutralizing international tensions and promoting social  political and human rights.There was a time in human history when war was pursued as an affirmation of the strength  courage and honour of men and nations. For others  it was a mechanism for the gratification of personal or territorial ambitions. It produced with traumatic regularity an array of fearsome leaders throughout the centuries. This tale of devastation  carnage and ferocity is catalogued in the pages of history. Today  in our world of the late twentieth century  minor traumas still exist  blemishing the intellectual  artistic and technological achievements of our age. From Kampuchea to southern Africa  from Western Sahara to Central America  the history is painfully familiar  and while the justification may be refined or righteous  the prosecution of war still bears many of the hallmarks of conflicts of distant ages.Yet  somehow  amid the chaos and devastation  man's ingenuity  underlying his constant struggle for survival  has established a mechanism for the resolution of the enduring problem of war - the United Nations. It has for over 40 years endeavoured to transform much of the energy of nations from actual and potential violence into discussion  debate  negotiation and peace.For 27 years of my country's history. Sierra Leone has had the opportunity to participate in the intercourse among nations in this dignified arena. It has been out pride to do so in the expectation that our young Republic has a contribution to make within the scope of its capabilities. Today  I wish to restate and reaffirm my country's faith and commitment to our Organization and to those noble ideals that inspire its existence. I am a simple man  inbred with those traditional values of family  community  religion  liberty and freedom of conscience that nurtured me. My country  sierra Leone  so named after the lion-like configuration of its coastal mountains  has had a long relationship with the world. Situated almost inconspicuously in the bulge oÂ£ Africa's west coast  it is a land of diversity moulded into a State and a nation in peace and harmony.For 40 years  the United States and the Soviet Union  backed by massive nuclear and conventional arsenals  have faced each other across an ideological divide that has constantly threatened peace. The language that has fostered their interaction has occasionally been uncompromising. But somehow the balance of terror and mutually assured destruction has maintained a nervous peace and stability for four decades. Now  more than ever before  we have the opportunity for establishing appropriate and acceptable criteria  for a comprehensive and durable peace. The citizens of the world cannot forever depend on the threat of mutually assured destruction as a guarantee of peace  stability and an orderly world.The recent series of remarkable successes achieved by the United Nations  especially in the mediation of major regional conflicts  and the generally improved climate of relations among Members of this Organization  particularly between the United States of America and the Soviet Union  provide a much needed departure from the gloom and tension that pervaded the international political climate over the last few years. We appreciate that this significant development has not occurred accidentally  but through the sincere and sustained collective efforts of all the members of the international community. While the significant achievements made recently are a fitting cause for celebration  they should be seen first and foremost as a catalyst for greater efforts at consolidating those gains and for the mobilization of resources to confront new problems.We therefore urge that greater encouragement be given to the Secretary-General in his efforts to advance the progress already achieved in the resolution of the Iran-Iraq conflict. We appeal directly to Iran and Iraq to continue to show maximum good will and co-operation. It is hoped that nothing will be done by outside forces to disturb the delicate negotiations that are currently under way. The chaos and economic devastation this war has produced must be an object lesson  not only for the two combatants  but for all those who contemplate military force as a primary option.The Jakarta informal meeting was one of the most significant diplomatic steps taken so far in the search for a resolution of the Kampuchean problem. For the first time ever it brought together most of the parties to the conflict  including Vietnam. It is important that the momentum created by those diplomatic initiatives should not be allowed to dissipate  and that even as this diplomatic momentum is maintained  the international community should continue to exert other pressures for the withdrawal of occupation troops from Kampuchea and allow the Kampuchean people to establish a government of their choice. As we renew out support for the coalition government of Democratic Kampuchea we commend China and the States members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) for their unwavering dedication to the cause of lasting peace in the region.The steady progress made so far in the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan is to be acknowledged and commended. The restoration of normality in that country should be facilitated by a deep and sincere commitment on the part of all parties in the region  to promote genuine national political reconciliation and rapid economic rehabilitation. Efforts should be made to remove any obstruction to the process of complete troop withdrawal.In Western Sahara  the useful collaboration between the Secretary-General and the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) constitutes a welcome and effective diplomatic effort  one which has sustained the momentum in the search for a durable settlement of that dispute. In the face of those developments  we express satisfaction at the improvement in relations among countries of the region  in the hope that this will be a significant contribution towards a resolution of the conflict. The fact must however be restated and reaffirmed that only a recognition of the endeavours and decisions of the United Nations will produce a durable foundation for peace.We are gratified that in spite of the occasional difficulties with the implementation of specific aspects of the Arias Plan for the political stabilization of Central America  adherence to its general principles has brought noticeable order into political and diplomatic conduct in the region. I pay a tribute to all the leaders of the Contadora Group of countries  whose collective determination to bring peace and prosperity to that region enjoys my country's admiration and support.Recent developments in southern Africa  leading to apartheid South Africa's uncharacteristic eagerness to facilitate Namibian independence  have been truly remarkable. While there are sufficient grounds for cynicism over South Africa's sudden apparent conversion to reason  our awareness of the delicate nature of the negotiations and the need for restrained commitment will limit us to merely extending deep gratitude to all parties who are currently working to bring about the early implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1971)  In marked contrast to the apparent signs of its flexibility over Namibian independence  the racist South African regime continues to resist pressures for the orderly transformation of South Africa into a genuine democracy. In its desperate attempt to maintain itself against overwhelming international rejection  this regime has intensified its aggression against neighbouring African States. In those circumstances  it is important that material assistance to the front-line States be intensified to strengthen their capacity to withstand and resist South Africa's aggression. We renew our support and admiration for the courage of Nelson Mandela  the fight for whose release from illegal imprisonment should continue to be a priority for all those with a conscience and a sense of justice. We also acknowledge the sacrifice and dedication of the freedom fighters  and the remarkable courage and dedication of Archbishop Desmond Tutu.It is with a tremendous sense of hope that I express satisfaction and optimism that someday the very foundations of apartheid will be dashed to pieces. The signs ate potent. David Bruce is a young  white South African  a conscientious objector  gaoled for refusing to be drafted into the South African army  which is a racist military machine devoted to the defence of apartheid. Many like David Bruce  have registered their repugnance and resistance.Recent attempts at resolving the Korean question  though significant  need to be further intensified. While we congratulate the two Koreas on their fortieth anniversary  we have great faith in the ability of their people to strive and overcome existing obstacles to the achievement of durable peace in the peninsula. The international community and  indeed  the United Nations have a responsibility to contribute to this effort and help release the enormous potential of the Korean people to contribute to the well-being of the world. The situation in the Arab territories occupied by Israel represents a disturbing contrast to the general climate of relaxation of tension in all parts of the world. The great and sustained impact of the intifada  or protests by the Palestinian people  in the face of continued repression  clearly underlines the high cost and futility of attempts to perpetuate an unjust situation.It will be tragic if we fail to learn an important lesson that has emerged from the intifada - that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is indeed the authentic and sole representative of the Palestinian people and that to continue to pretend otherwise can only further complicate the suffering and the instability in the occupied lands.We therefore see great merit in the convening  under the auspices of the United Nations  of an international conference on the Middle East  at which all parties involved  including the PLC  will participate on an equal footing. In the meantime  my country renews its support of the Palestinian people and to the leadership  f the PLO.The diminishing of regional conflicts is only one of the many steps necessary to ensure a stable and peaceful world. Another important step is to ensure predictability in the relationship between the super-Powers. In this regard  we should acknowledge the leading role played by President Ronald Reagan of the United States of America and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union in fostering a climate of cordiality in the relations between their countries  particularly the recent signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty. We express the hope that the climate will be improved with further wide-ranging disarmament actions  particularly in the area of multilateral disarmament negotiations. The economic difficulties of the developing countries  particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa  continue to pose the most immediate challenge to the Organization and to the entire international community. Since the beginning of this decade  the economies of those countries have stumbled from one economic crisis to another  leaving behind them widespread human misery and damage to the foundations of those societies.While it is noted that the international community has responded generously to emergency requirements  support for long-term development programmes has generally not been quite so impressive. Our efforts to mobilize our internal resources to address the economic difficulties facing us have been undermined by a host of intractable obstacles  among which are the steep and continuous decline in our export earnings  the shortage of appropriate human resources and a heavy debt burden. We are therefore encouraged that the Secretary-General has emphasized in his report that debt  trade and commodities and human resource development are three main areas in the economic field where the international community needs to act urgently. It is in that context that we acknowledge the important initiative taken by some creditor countries to cancel the debts of low-income developing countries  including Sierra Leone. It is also highly significant that leaders of the major industrial countries are now considering the possibility of debt cancellation as a serious idea. We hope that this climate of unprecedented consensus on the approaches to solving the debt problem will quickly lead to concrete action by the international community to lighten the debt burden of developing countries.We would also welcome a review of World Bank and International Monetary Fund conditionalities to enable low-income countries to gain access to funds specially reserved for assistance to those countries by those institutions.We also believe that there is an urgent need to create a climate of absolute understanding and trust among donor countries  the financial institutions and recipient countries in the area of implementation of economic reform programmes. This area has been a source of great and painful friction between the donor community on the one hand and the recipient countries on the other.While the necessity for economic reform is widely accepted by developing countries  it has been observed that the reform process is a delicate activity that could cause great suffering in society and harm to the economy  particularly if it is pursued too vigorously without sufficient supporting measures. Indeed  some time ago  when my country adopted a wide-ranging reform programme agreed with the International Monetary Fund  we were forced to suspend its implementation when the mounting toll of human misery could no longer be justified. Many basic commodities became unaffordable to the ordinary members of society  as prices rocketed with the sudden removal of subsidies  exacerbated by a general wage freeze and a series of massive currency devaluations which left our currency greatly weakened. Reform of our economy continues to be a major national priority. The loss of financial support from the international financial institutions which followed our suspension of aspects of the original programme has however weakened our strength to pursue this priority. We therefore appeal particularly to the international institutions for understanding and support to enable us to carry out reforms in an orderly and effective manner.It is appropriate at this juncture to express deep appreciation to friendly Governments whose bilateral assistance has helped to sustain us during our period of difficulty. In the same vein we acknowledge the important contribution of the various United Nations agencies including the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). In particular our commitment to ensure the survival and healthy development of our children has drawn great strength from the efforts of UNICEF.The purposes and principles of the United Nations  proclaimed in its Charter 43 years ago  set a high moral tone and the values and concepts enshrined in that Charter ate certainly enabling. As we understand it  the insistence of the Charter on encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms also implied a commitment by Governments to accept culpability  or at least moral responsibility  for violations of the human rights of their citizens  when the United Nations proclaimed its principles in the wake of the radioactive contamination of Hiroshima and Nagasaki  the torment  torture and guilt of that best forgotten era were still fresh in the minds of the founding fathers. Culpability may be moral  legal or religious  depending on one's cultural background and perception. It is an embarrassing fact  however  that some States which ate parties to the Charter and which have stringent laws to protect their own environment allow their citizens to effect toxic pollution on defenceless developing countries. If it is an offence for someone in one country to dispose of toxic wastes without adhering to stipulated legal guidelines or fulfilling mandatory requirements  it should be equally essential for the laws of that country to make it reprehensible for any adventurer to deposit such wastes in any other country of the world.The magnitude and complexity of this problem demand effective supportive action by the countries of origin of toxic waste as well as by the international community collectively. The initiative by the United Nations Development Programme to draft a convention on trans-frontier movements of waste is a welcome response. We believe countries of origin of hazardous waste have an obligation to extend their domestic legislation on hazardous waste disposal to regulate the disposal of such wastes abroad.It has been with profound joy and satisfaction that I have been able to take part in this session  and as I go back home to Sierra Leone I take with me a message of hope and optimism for the future of the human family  within the scope of the United Nations. Those who preceded us in the formative years of this Organization have spoken eloquently about two issues - peace and development. Those terms carry grave implications for ail men  for peace does not refer only to an absence of war neither does development refer only to the presence of material progress. They are central today in the interactions among States  as they have always been  and they hold the key to the solutions of many of the world's critical issues. Peace is the abiding desire of mankind the world over. It is a condition deeper in conception  interpretation and realization. The search for it has moved statesmen throughout history and produced agreements  pacts and treaties; equally so has the breach of it spawned a multitude of aggressions and violence that span generations.For the small and weak nations of the third world the United Nations is the ultimate platform for the search for peace. It is the arena that enables the instincts and precludes the realization of the dreams of evil men. In a world of competing national interests and jealously guarded sovereignties only the platform of the United Nations can assure humanity of a credible and durable peace. Support for the Organization  therefore  must be total and devoid of the secret manipulations and routine subversions that have characterized its relationship with some of its Members.The Organization's role in development - human and national - is equally critical. The calamities of hunger  drought  flood and social misery produce much the same threats to the human condition as war. The programmes of development initiated by the United Nations have been laudable ventures. They proclaim the common purpose and destiny of humanity in its constant search for peace  progress and concord. The achievement of those aims requires a collective sensitivity and the will and energies of nations to mobilize an agreed consensus on development. The United Nations still constitutes the universal platform for its achievement. While we deliberate the great issues of our day  let our hearts reach out to those members of our human community whose concerns we seek to articulate and realize. They need and deserve our attention in our collective search for an organized and beautiful world. Nowhere is that more vividly expressed at this moment than in the peaceful artistic and physical quest for excellence in Seoul  Republic of Korea. Those athletes individually and collectively have a common message - one human family linked in the search for peace and development. That is in sharp contrast to the terrorist  the drug addict  the hijacker  whose constant ambition is to frustrate the designs of noble men."
"127",6299,"SLV",43,1988,"ï»¿Mr. President  may I first congratulate you on your well-deserved election  which indeed guarantees the effectiveness of the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly and which is a great honour for Argentina  a country with which we are united by ties of friendship and solidarity. We are certain that your outstanding personal qualifications and keen understanding of Latin American and world problems will lead to success in the work of the Assembly in its quest for concrete solutions at all levels of international life  which is today more than ever before filled with challenges  hopes and new ideals.I am also very pleased to greet Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar  under whose leadership the United Nations h Â¿is indeed demonstrated its ability to deal with very important international problems with regard to the maintenance of peace and security. I take special pride in congratulating him on the recent award of the Nobel Peace Prize to a courageous group of men devoted to peace who work within the structure of the Organization. Central America - which was similarly honoured last year when the Prize was awarded to a great Central American  a keen advocate of similar ideals  Mr. Oscar Arias Sanchez  President of the sister Republic of Costa Rica - wishes today to pay a well-deserved tribute to these dedicated guardians of peace.El Salvador has done its part. When in 1984 JosÃ© Napoleon Duarte  the first freely elected President of El Salvador in more than 50 years took office  my Government set for itself a very clear and precise goalÂ·  to establish democracy in the country as the basis and the principle for the long journey towards peace  reconciliation and social justice. Almost five years later  in the final stages of a convulsive and difficult constitutional exercise of titanic dimensions  we can say with dignity  mission accomplished. This is because the dynamic democratic process the Government of El Salvador initiated is of great historical significance  since it brought about opportunities for action which had never before had been able to develop. This progress is part of our national task in all its aspects; it is a viable component of the strengthening of our free  pluralistic and participatory society - the society roost Salvadorians desire.The hard work and will of a visionary statesman  JosÃ© Napoleon Duarte  President of the Republic - whose mandate is to end on 1 June 1989 - must be emphasized. I wish to refer to him not only as a statesman but also as a man who is at this time undergoing great personal trial and tribulation.President Duarte took on the responsibility of leading El Salvador in full awareness of the problems and sacrifices this entailed at a crucial stage of our history characterized by political repression and social upheaval. This was a formidable challenge  but he has faced up to it without respite  deeply committed to his Christian convictions and principles. Since then he has devoted all his energies towards completing the mission he undertook  despite the most varied difficulties and cruel vicissitudes.The philosophy and plan of action of this man of unflinching will is and will be in the future of EL Salvador the only practical way in which to develop a new country  a country whose image has largely been formed as one of a struggling people aware of its historical commitment to achieve its own ideals. Thus  President Duarte outlined the plan that will bring El Salvador out of its former stage of backwardness and alienation into an era of democratization  participation  pacification  humanization  economic revitalization and internationalization of dialogue  not of conflict.Those are the moving forces  the ideas and the strengths that will continue to prevail until the final consolidation of the political landscape in El Salvador. The praxis of this programme is a unique challenge  because the application of these principles requires overcoming the forces of the extreme right and the extreme left while keeping a precarious centrist balance - what the President has termed  ""treading the cutting edge of the blade or walking along the edge of a precipice"".This is Duarte's contribution at this most difficult juncture for our country. This is the challenge> this is the philosophy we must promote in the midst of misunderstanding and external aggression. To democratise a society enmeshed in a crisis with so many components and variables is indeed a formidable task.But matters are now in the hands of the Almighty  a President and his courage  a people and a Government which have closed ranks in order to ensure the application of those principles. A great deal remains to be done  but what has been done with regard to each and every one of these principles has in sum yielded an outstanding resultÂ·  democracy  freedom and participation in a true social and humanistic context. This is a concrete legacy  a legacy of hope which impels us to continue to work with the same strength as our President. No doubt  in retrospect we see misunderstanding and destruction; and when we look closer we see a narrow and difficult path but when we look ahead we see the light at the end of the tunnel.This forum - whose main task is the search for international peace and security is the appropriate forum from which to draw attention to the situation in my country and in Central America in general. In both cases there is a need for broad understanding of the efforts to regain the path of democracy as a way of life and a system of government in which there is plurality of interests in an open society that tolerates differences and promotes fundamental freedoms and the values essential to human dignity.Therefore  this forum must  as it has always done  firmly reject anti-democratic theses based on violence and terrorism and reaffirm the principles of non-intervention and self-determination  co-operation and respect for the expression of the popular will in the establishment of a Government clearly separate from the army  the product of free elections with the participation of all political and ideological groups. We believe that only tolerance and the rule of law can contribute to lasting peace and security for all. In this context and within the framework of these principles  which are basic to this august institution  the United Nations  I must  in all fairness  repeat that the Government of EI Salvador has endorsed the option which allows and promotes political  economic and social democracy  respect for human tights  both of the individual and of society  and the broadest possible measure of freedom of expression and criticism for all political groups.May I be permitted at this point to make a necessary and timely distinction with regard to the context in which the problem of Salvador Is taking place. There are two systems at the present time. One is the institutional system  established on the basis of the freely expressed will of our people and embodied in a legitimate government. The other system. Imposed from outside through Cuba and Nicaragua  has given rise to a conflict which has completely lost its legitimacy  as the candidate from Democratic Convergence for the presidency of the Republic  Dr. Guillermo Manuel Ungo  who is from the FDR  recently stated. The fact is that the conflict is obsolete  it is a belated interventionist strategy advocated by the International enemies of democracy.In the same connection we must now distinguish between this problem and the treatment of the problem of human rights. In this context we see  first  an Institutional area in which human rights and respect for them are treated in a normal way. They are part of the day-to-day activities of the government at the social level. Here we must recognize that the democracy to which I have just referred - free elections  the return and resettlement of refugees  the fullest possible measure of freedom  the broadest and most generous amnesty - all represent undeniable progress on the part of the Government of El Salvador. In the other context  that of the conflict that has been ongoing  the problems which arise with regard to human rights  while they can be controlled through government action  as indeed has been done in the vast majority of cases  we must consider that in order to eliminate them  we must first remove their cause  which is the conflict itself. Secondly  we must also consider that in this field the most serious problems are brought about by the blind terrorist groups of the FMLN/FDR.	>We therefore insist that terrorism and subversion are not an option for the Salvadorian people or for the international community. . This has been shown by the political events that took place in March of this year  events in which the Salvadorian people participated and which were witnessed by more than 200 international observers  who confirmed that a pluralist democracy had indeed been established in El Salvador. The people expressed its views freely on 20 March and elected its deputies to the National Legislative Assembly and the municipal councils. The results of the vote favoured the political opposition. That event no doubt constitutes the strongest rejection of violence and is confirmation that most Salvadorians believe in the vote as the only way to obtain public power.With regard to dialogue and peace  our determination to seek peace has been evident in our government activity since 8 October 1984  when President Duarte  speaking before this General Assembly  took the initiative in instituting a dialogue for peace. It was thus that on 15 October 1984  four years ago  in the city of La Palma  the first meeting took place with representatives of the FMI/J/fDR groups.Ever since then the path we have followed has gone through AyagualÃ³ Sesori and  finally  after many other dialogues  San Salvador in 1987  in the context of the Guatemala agreement  known under the name of Esquipulas II. Unfortunately  the strategy or tactical lack of understanding on the part of IMLN/POR has impeded the incorporation of these groups  in their entirety  into the democratic process. However  as the undeniable result of tills effort  we can now see that what was formerly a guerrilla band has now been reduced to a group of recalcitrant terrorists helplessly constrained by its very commitment  whose threatened violence even keeps its own comrades from joining in the institutional process.Actually  the way towards the attainment of peace has been extremely difficult since we cannot compromise when it comes to the lofty values of freedom  democracy and the very institutional 1Ð³Ð°tion of the Republic. No doubt; the conflict has had implications in the economic and social spheres. Its consequences have been felt in that it has not been possible to offer the nation better living conditions. It is true that the people of El Salvador have suffered the loss of their property  which was systematically destroyed by the FMHL/FDR. This has resulted in suffering and poverty  and is a clear and obvious violation of the civil and social rights of the Salvadorian people.We can say that in El Salvador there is a widespread feeling that action should be taken to ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedomsÂ·  but in a form consistent with the circumstances  the right to self-defence is also allowed within the appropriate channels of a legal order to counteract terrorist action and the violence of the extremist groups.The democratic process has established areas in which everyone can express himself and criticize as he wishes  without  however  exceeding the legal limits  since respect for these limits and for order are essential conditions of democratic life. The Government of El Salvador wishes to express its firm resolve to continue to strengthen democracy in which all participate. In this context the leaders of the FDR  together with the PMLN began to return to the country in November1987  as the result of a general state of amnesty. Their incorporation into political activity is an established fact. They have enrolled in the national voters registry and they have announced that they will take part in the presidential elections of 1989 under the name of ""Convergencia Perroeratica - Democratic Convergence. Although the political arm of the FMUJ  still states that there is no democratic process  they fear fanatic reprisals from their own allies. The fact is  however  that their incorporation into the electoral process means that there is an obvious recognition on their part of our process toward democracy.The agreement entitled ""Procedure for the Establishment of a Firm and Lasting Peace in Central America""  known as Esquipulas II  has not lost its meaning  because the spirit of peace contained therein lives on  and it was the Central Americans themselves  through their Presidents  gathered in Costa Rica on 16 January 1988  who confirmed the value and importance of that agreement  as well as their commitment to its implementation. Similarly  the General Assembly  in its resolution 42/1  expresses its firmest support for the agreement and requests the Secretary-General to afford the fullest support to the Central American Governments in their effort to achieve peace. The quest for peace in Central America is a historic endeavour for El Salvador  and in this context  and within the framework of this session of the General Assembly  we have continued to pursue initiatives to follow up with meetings of foreign ministers first  and then meetings of presidents  which are to take place within the next few days. The agenda that we shall discuss will include items on amnesty  dialogue  democracy and freedom  refugees  human rights and a Central American Parliament. In this review all countries will be shown to have assets and liabilities in terms of economy  but  regrettably  it must be said that one of them  Nicaragua  despite its efforts  whether serious or not  will have a greater debit balance. The Sandinist Government  reverting to situations that existed prior to the Guatemala agreement  continues  unfortunately  to violate the most elementary freedoms and civil rights. It persecutes and imprisons politicians and activists  represses public manifestations and closes channels of expression. The Sandinist Government has not even made the required clear and definite public statement of a total break  with the armed subversion in El Salvador  which is a clear commitment under the Esquipulas II agreement.The link between the Sandinist Government and the FMIN is not only at odds with prevailing circumstances in El Salvador  but also totally incompatible with the letter and the spirit of Esquipulas II. Furthermore  the system which the Sandinist Government is trying to consolidate has been shown to be inappropriate at a time when everyone is trying to arrive at formulas of freedom and understanding far removed from totalitarian  oppressive and expansionist systems. Very few are going against the tide of history. We urge the Sandinist Government to reconsider and to join at this time with the world and Central America and no longer to obstruct the co-operation that now may lead to more concrete freedoms in the region  co-operation which the Government and the people of Nicaragua need.El Salvador has done its part. Esquipulas II has led to the successful implementation of important decisions in the country on  among other things  national reconciliation through the broadest measure of amnesty ever known in the country  the massive repatriation of Salvadorian refugees  and regional co-operation expressed in the Central American Parliament  which has been endorsed our Assembly with a view to eventual  but certain  regional integration  which will have to be based on democratic and pluralistic principles.The tragedy of Central America must be ended through global and regional solutions leading to a strengthening of peace and the restoration of security  Â¡recognition of democracy as the legitimate means of acquiring power  and rejection of all violence  totalitarianism and confrontation.This entire regional process must be credible. Thus  SI Salvador is proposing the establishment of a verification and follow-up commission at the political level to supervise in the various countries of the area the existence and validity of a true pluralistic  participatory democracy that broadly respects all individual  social  political and economic right the holding of truly free elections; and strict observance of human rights. We are proposing a commission linked to the executive commission of Esquipulas II  which my at its discretion visit the territory of the five countries to observe and determine compliance with these democratic commitments  which form the basic framework for real peace.Regarding the organization and financing of this commission  it would be made up of five Central Americans designated by the executive commission of Esquipulas II  and would have the necessary assistance of the international community in securing the appropriate technical and financial backing. We Central Americans must accept the commission courageously as a challenge for our future  which will be all the stranger and more vigorous for being based on the concept of a true democratic structure.This idea of the commission for democracy  far from being contrary to international law  had already been suggested in similar terms within the framework of the draft Contadora on Peace and Co-operation in Central America. Therefore it already had the support of the Latin American group and all nations that supported the draft. We certainly view with interest the suggestion by Honduras about establishing a security commission which was also considered in the Contadora context. We believe  however  that peace and security in Central America can be achieved only through the radical and essential functioning of regional democracy.El Salvador has done its part. What we have been able to do as guided by the far-sightedness of President Duarte  we have done and gone beyond} what has been beyond our ability and capacity  such as dealing with the effects of irrational conflict imposed from the outside  we have not been able to do  because the solution to this problem  unfortunately  does not depend solely on us  it depends on extraneous factors which violate the sacred principles that govern international coexistence and in which El Salvador firmly believes. These are the principles of non-intervention  non-interference  self-determination  good faith  loyal compliance with international commitment  and the consistent recourse to peaceful means of settling disputes.Esquipulas II appeals to countries not to support insurgency or armed subversion in El Salvador or in Central America in general. Today  I reiterate that appeal most strongly from this forum of peace  so that our democracy  free from interference  may bear fruit.We reiterate our call for development  peace and democracy. Co-operation must be directed especially to the less favoured countries. This entails the provision of financial  technical and human resources  because inequality and poverty are certainly hindrances to the permanent maintenance of international peace and stability. It is therefore urgently necessary that one of the most pressing problems in International economic relations between North and South - that is  the foreign debt - be tackled with justice and realism and without delay by creating mechanisms to establish the shared responsibilities of creditors and debtors and the link between this problem and international trade.We appreciate the co-operation we have received in SI Salvador and in Central America and the welcome intention of various countries and international organizations to continue to co-operate. In this connection  I reiterate the appeal in Esquipulas II to the international community to continue with urgency and determination to assist the region in its straggle to eliminate the deep structural causes of the conflict and to bring about the desired comprehensive development: of its societies  while understanding that democracy and peace cannot be consolidated without a policy of sustained growth. This effort is all-inclusive  and in the task of achieving the ideals of stability there are no priorities. All actions geared to the attainment of these objectives must run simultaneously and in parallel  so that if we wish to have democracy and peace we must also have development  to overcome poverty and backwardness. A colleague of mine has said that support should not wait for peace  because such support is needed to open up the road to peace.In 1987 the General Assembly adopted resolution 42/1  on the situation in Central America  and resolution 42/204  on special economic assistance to Central America. In this context the Secretary-General submitted to the Assembly a report (Ð/4Ð£949) containing a plan  which was prepared with the participation of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECÅA). El Salvador welcomes these expressions of support and urges the international community of donors to achieve to the plan  which is of immediate need for the region.Against that background  may I state  with regard to the tragedy of the Salvadorian refugees  that the Government has devoted important resources to their return to the country  in keeping with the principles of humanitarian international law and internal legal norms. More than 8 000 Salvadorians have returned to their country since October 1987 from camps on Honduran territory  which shows that there are indeed encouraging signs of development  peace and democracy in the country which have encouraged them to return.El Salvador considers it necessary to convene the proposed international conference on Central American refugees and expresses its strong support for thatIn this context we welcome the results of the San Salvador Declaration in which the Central American countries and Mexico  with the valuable co-operation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  within an apolitical and strictly humanitarian framework  decided that that international conference should be convened at the highest level and be held in the city of Guatemala in May 1989.El Salvador wishes to thank the International community and the friendly countries which have shown special concern over this humanitarian question and have offered immediate help and co-operation. We commend the work done by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and we especially agree with tine terms of the letter recently addressed by the High Commissioner to President Duarte recognizing his exemplary attention to this delicate and sensitive problem  which has been addressed exceptionally and with dedication by the Government of EL Salvador  as the High Commissioner has stated.Democracy  peace and development - that is the triptych of principles which will lead us to regional integration  that being the only politically valid  stable solution to the problems of the isthmus. Only a strong Central America  united in democracy and progress  will provide a sufficient guarantee of subregional stability in a world which is becoming increasingly free and pluralistic and which  fortunately  is overcoming the stages of confrontation through dialogue  understanding and the requirement of plans of action oriented towards gradual universal integration in which technology and science would serve as the binding and motivating element.This year  in which El Salvador was elected by an overwhelming majority to be the seat of the eighteenth General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS) as a gesture of continued support for the sacrifices of its people and Government to achieve democracy  we welcome the presentation to this session of the Secretary-General's report on the item entitled  ""Co-operation between the United Nations and the Organization of American States""  which is evidence of world solidarity. Our common universal objectives make it imperative for us to work together and I repeat  we welcome this with great hopes.El Salvador considers that peace and efforts to guarantee peace continue to be threatened in South Africa by the policy of racial discrimination practised by the South African Government. Vie also share in the wish for the adoption of a realistic solution for peace between Iraq and Iran. We continue to be concerned over the situation in Lebanon. We condemn the occupation of Kampuchea by foreign troops and we express the wish that there should be a progressive withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. We support the strategy of the Republic of Korea  in the framework of its initiative towards reconciliation  co-operation and national reconciliation through dialogue and its wish to become a fully-fledged Member of the United NationsEl Salvador has played its part. My government welcomes and views with hope the progress and the achievements of this Organization and the international community towards consolidating democracy  peace and co-operation throughout the world on the basis of transnational agreements. Six months before the ending of the constitutional Government of President Duarte  after four and a half years of severe tests and enormous work  our commitments have been strengthened to the point where there is an awareness among all of the vital sectors of the country - the armed forces  the private sector  social and cultural organizations and so on - that it is no longer possible to go back. that is our destiny and our conviction. Democracy has been won. We now await peace and we will achieve peace through democracy  in the certainty that the vast majority of the peoples and the Governments represented in this Assembly stand with us in this endeavour. "
"128",6371,"SOM",43,1988,"ï»¿I should like at the outset. Sir  on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-third session  and to express our confidence in the leadership  diplomatic skills and wisdom which you bring to your high office.At the same time  I wish to convey to Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic my sincere appreciation of his excellent work as President of the forty-second session. The annual evaluation of the international situation undertaken each year by the General Assembly has  of necessity  been pessimistic in recent years  reflecting a world gravely troubled by the race in nuclear and other weapons  the widening economic gap between the developed and the developing countries and the regional turmoil that inevitably follows racist oppression  foreign intervention  military aggression and the denial of the right to self-determination.The conditions that breed international instability and insecurity are still in evidence  but the General Assembly can undoubtedly be heartened by the signs of improvement in the world situation evident today. These signs allow us all to feel a certain optimism about the prospects for international peace and security.In acknowledging the improvement in the world situation  Somalia particularly welcomes the new spirit of rapprochement between the United States and the Soviet Union. There is an African proverb which says that when elephants fight it is the grass that suffers. Certainly  East-West rivalry has been a major factor in regional conflicts involving third-world countries  and the world's peoples  without exception  are endangered by the nuclear competition of the super-Powers. Somalia is therefore gratified that the change in East-West relations from confrontation to dialogue has resulted in progress towards the limitation of nuclear arms  and in efforts to settle some of the regional conflicts which have been of grave concern to the world community.In this context  Somalia shares the satisfaction that has been widely expressed at the ongoing withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan. We trust that the terms of the four-power agreements concluded under the aegis of the United Nations will be scrupulously observed. The paramount considerations in the days ahead must be national reconciliation  the safe return home of refugees and the full restoration of Afghanistan's independence  sovereignty and non-aligned status. It is also our profound hope that the changed international climate will ensure the successful outcome of agreements on the question of Namibia's independence and on an end to South Africa's military aggression and interventions in Angola. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) must  of course  continue to be recognized as the only internationally acceptable basis for Namibia's independence. We believe that Namibia's independence is the responsibility of the international community. We affirm our support for Angola's position as a sovereign State  free to negotiate in its own best interest  and we highly commend the Angolan Government for its statesmanship as it continues to play a key role in the achievement of a cherished goal of the United Nations. Namibia's independence is  of course  the moral and political responsibility of the world community  and its achievement is long overdue. We believe that a note of caution is in order in view of South Africa's past history of reneging on its commitment with regard to Namibia. In our view  the General Assembly must continue to oppose linkages that might unduly delay Namibia's independence and must insist on continued economic pressure against the Pretoria regime to ensure that Namibia is indeed set free.There is yet another conflict that has been the concern of the international community  that is  the Gulf war. We hope that the two countries concerned will continue to co-operate closely with the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  in his vigorous efforts to secure implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). The terms of that resolution provide a firm basis of progress towards a just and lasting settlement. We trust there will be no turning back on the path to peace.The cautious optimism abroad in the world today can also be directed towards the situation in Cyprus. The patient efforts of the Secretary-General to promote a negotiated settlement and the willingness of the leaders of the two ethnic groups on the island to engage in dialogue are positive factors in the search for an end to the division and conflict. We hope that a spirit of compromise will govern the negotiations and bring about a settlement that takes account of the rights of all concerned there.My Government regrets that in Cambodia  another troubled area  peace remains elusive. However  we believe that here too there is cause for optimism despite the apparent failure of the talks held recently in Indonesia between all those concerned. We trust that the great Powers involved will continue to exert their influence on behalf of the restoration of Cambodia's sovereignty  its national unity  and its political  economic and social stability. With regard to the developments in the Horn oÂ£ Africa  there is a movement towards peace and stability. My country remains committed to the Somalia-Ethiopia peace agreement  both in its letter and in its spirit. Somalia  as a third world country and Member of the United Nations and of several regional organizations  as well as other international movements  welcomes understanding and co-operation among States  big and small  and calls for strict adherence to the principles of the Charter. It is in this spirit that Ethiopia and Somalia reached an agreement for the normalization of relations and the creation of the necessary climate to permit a permanent and just solution of the existing problems between the two countries. As a result of this agreement  positive steps have been taken in the implementation of the agreement  such as the disengagement of forces  the resumption of diplomatic relations and the exchange of prisoners of war. In this respect  it could be stated that the two countries have taken strides in the direction of peace and we hope that there will be no further set-backs in the relations between them. We look forward to fruitful relations between the two countries characterized by mutual confidence  respect and good will. We in Somalia firmly believe that stability is the corner-stone of social and economic development and human progress.While I have voiced a measure of optimism about the international situation  I must also emphasize Somalia's deep concern over a number of questions long cm the agenda of the General Assembly which continue to resist efforts for their resolution.In South Africa  for example  the majority population remains disenfranchised and alienated in its own country authentic leaders such as Nelson Mandela remain in prison and the mass democratic movement protesting injustice is being ruthlessly attacked by South Africa's powerful police-State apparatus. This is the reality of apartheid  which the Pretoria regime attempts to hide under cosmetic arrangements and a curtain of censorship.My Government reiterates its call for the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against South Africa and for a strong international commitment in support of the front-line States as they face South Africa's aggressive and destabilizing policies.The complex Middle East question also defies efforts to achieve a comprehensive settlement. Today the courageous uprising of the people of the West Bank and Gaza serves to underline the central realities of the region: namely  that there will be no peace until Israel withdraws from all occupied Arab territories  including Jerusalem  and recognizes the right of the Palestinians to self-determination and statehood in Palestine.My Government strongly supports the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East  at which the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  would participate on an equal footing with other parties. In our view  the Conference would provide a unique opportunity for negotiations on the basis of the constructive Middle East resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly.I turn now to the disturbing phenomenon of an international economic system which increasingly militates against the economic progress of developing countries.The harsh realities of the world economic situation are vividly illustrated in Africa  the continent with the largest number of countries that are both least developed and prone to natural and other disasters. The best efforts of African States to bring about their own and Africa's recovery from economic crisis are thwarted on every side by catastrophic debt  the collapse of commodity prices  protectionism  grossly inadequate terms of trade and the stagnation of concessional funds of development assistance.Africa's colossal and steadily growing debt is of course its most crippling problem. Government regrets the decision of the major creditor countries to deal with the African debt on a piecemeal rather than on a comprehensive basis. This has been a heavy blow to hopes for the effective implementation of Africa's Programme for Economic Recovery  and we hope that this decision will be reconsidered.In its international economic system  the African countries expect an increase in the assistance they receive from major international institutions  such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in order to achieve recovery. Unfortunately  most structural adjustment programmes ignore the human dimensions of underdevelopment and thus fail to break the cycles of unemployment  malnutrition  ignorance and disease. International financial institutions must prescribe for ailing States in such a way that the patient is not overcome by the medicine.With regard to both bilateral and multilateral development assistance  it must be said that there has been a disappointing failure on the part of donor countries to make good the commitments undertaken two years ago at the height of Africa's economic crisis. Somalia gratefully acknowledges the development assistance received  in particular from Nordic countries. However  we appeal urgently to other traditional donors which have not yet done so to respond to the plight of the least-developed countries in a manner commensurate with the gravity of their situation. I wish to call attention to the area of development aid of particular concern to Somalia  that of assistance to refugees. In my country  my Government has for nearly a decade continued with its efforts to secure emergency assistance for Somalia's massive refugee population and it has also promoted permanent solutions in the context of national development plans. Unfortunately  international assistance for these efforts falls far ah or t of the need. Therefore we remind the donor communities of the pledges made at the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa. We hope they will support the related programmes of action which have been strongly endorsed by subsequent sessions of the General Assembly.My Government regrets that discussion of the larger issues on the agenda of a North-South dialogue has been suspended  and that the immediate problems of developing countries - particularly the least developed - are not being adequately addressed. It is widely acknowledged that world peace and security are ill served in a world characterized by marked divisions between rich and poor countries. There needs to be a wider understanding of the fact that development problems are an integral part of an interdependent world economy and a renewed commitment to the goal of narrowing the gap between developed and developing countries.The most important issue on the agenda of the General Assembly is without doubt that of disarmament with its serious and wide-ranging implications for world peace and security.My Government strongly hopes that the lessening of international tension already marked by the adoption of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - will have a significant and continuing effect on disarmament in all its aspects. We were disappointed  however  by the failure of the third special session on disarmament to reach agreement on vital aims and priorities. In our view the most urgent disarmament priorities roust be the conclusion oÂ£ & comprehensive test-ban treaty and a freeze in the production of nuclear weapons. Conventional disarmament is undoubtedly a grave responsibility for all Member States  but it is the nuclear-arms race which overshadows and threatens all our endeavours and the very existence of mankind.In this same context we strongly oppose the development of space weapons when our immediate environment is dangerously threatened by existing systems of mass destruction.Somalia welcomes the progress made towards the conclusion of a convention outlawing chemical weapons. We hope that the United Nations will play a role in the verification of disarmament agreements. This is a proposal with obvious practical benefits and one which would enhance the principle of collective security.Somalia was also disappointed that the militarily significant States have new largely disavowed the linkages affirmed by the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. There should be no need to emphasize once again the human tragedy implied in the expenditure of astronomical sums for armaments while a majority of the world's population goes hungry.Not very long ago the authority and effectiveness of the United Nations were considered to be at a low ebb  but nothing succeeds like success. Today a new and welcome prominence has been given to the world Organization because of the central or valuable supporting role it has played in promoting negotiations for the resolution of regional conflicts.I think it needs to be emphasized at the present time that the peace-keeping and peace-making abilities of the United Nations have always been available for application to conflict situations. If the function of the world body as a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations has not always been utilized  this is not the fault of the Organization. The United Nations can function effectively only if its Member states give it the moral and material support it deserves.Today there should be no difficulty or hesitation in giving unreserved support to the world Organization  since the extensive administrative reforms demanded by Member States have been faithfully carried out. It is certainly an anomalous situation that the United Nations should be faced with a financial crisis which threatens its very existence  while it is at the same time closely involved in the resolution of problems of the greatest international concern - in Afghanistan  the Gulf War and southern Africa  to name but a few. Somalia hopes that all Member States will faithfully carry out their financial obligations and ensure the continued strength and effectiveness of the t rid body.I take this opportunity to express ray Government's deep appreciation of the dedication and skilled diplomacy of the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar. The cause of peace is well served by the personal qualities he brings to his high office. We wish him good health and continued success.The world community faces formidable global challenges posed by economic and political interdependence  the escalation of nuclear and conventional weapons and serious threats to our planet's environment. It should be apparent to all that these challenges cannot be met without sustained and sincere efforts for international co-operationÂ¡  and that the United Nations is the indispensable centre for such co-operation. In conclusion  my Government reaffirms its full confidence in the principles and purposes of the world body and pledges continued support for its endeavours in all fields - economic  social and others - in a way that will ensure the prosperity of the world and serve the cause of peace.

"129",6407,"STP",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and my delegation I would like to present our warmest congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo on his election as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. His election is certainly a testimony to the high appreciation that his country  Argentina  deserves from the international community  and an additional acknowledgement of his well-known qualities as a diplomat and statesman. I would like to assure him of the complete co-operation of my delegation in the fulfilment of his mandate.Allow me also to take this opportunity to congratulate his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  on the highly satisfactory results achieved during his presidency of the forty-second session.Allow me to express my most profound admiration to the Secretary-General  for his dedication and dynamism in handling the questions under consideration by our Organisation and for his enlightened Â· dedicated and courageous actions in search of solutions to some regional conflicts affecting the world.We note with satisfaction that the United Nations is currently experiencing a fruitful period; its role and the role of the Secretary-General are considered to be important  I would even say indispensable  by all countries. As the culmination of this universal acknowledgement of the relevant action of the United Nations  the peace-keeping forces were awarded the Nobel Peace Prise  a highly significant event. We note that all countries  including the super-Powers  which is an important point  by virtue of their position and above all by their behaviour  define the United Nations as a place uniquely suited to the multilateral examination at political level of issues that are crucial to the future of humanity. In this context  the United Nations will be better able to operate more efficiently towards achieving the objectives and principles on which it was founded and will  it is to be hoped  be able to promote peace and security in the whole world and international co-operation for the multilateral development of all peoples.Indeed  peace and development are the two main concerns of the world. Regarding peace  we have lately witnessed promising developments  thanks to the new relationship now existing between the United States of America and the Soviet Union  and to prospects for a peaceful solution of the various conflicts that exist in the world.Indeed  1988 has been marked by events that constitute a crucial turning-point in the panorama of international politics. There is a climate of relaxation  of detente  between East and West which does not seem to be only temporary. It does not seem to be a cyclical phenomenon such as we have so often observed in international relations during past decades  which often disappeared under the stormy waves of ideological and expansionistic conflicts.This relaxation is based ultimately on a rational approach to the opposition between the two main socio-political systems of the world. There is a new awareness of the absurdity of entertaining ideas of military supremacy in order to impose one's ideology upon others  since  in the nuclear era  that would be an irreversible path which not only could lead to the complete destruction of everything man has built  but might also mean the end of all forms of life on the surface of the earth. However  it is clear that as long as there are people and ideas competition must serve as an important factor in progress  both through the improvement necessary to maintain competitiveness and through the progressive integration of opposed theses into a global synthesis. But peaceful competition is the only option.We may say that a new political and military mentality is emerging at the international level  creating the possibility of true coexistence among nations in a contradictory but interconnected and interdependent world  coexistence based on the principles of a ""humanized"" international law which really takes into consideration the interests of all countries and peoples of the world.Respect for the equality of the rights of States  for national independence and sovereignty  for the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs and for the right of peoples to choose the social and political system best suited to their specific characteristics ~ that will be the possible outcome if this new political mentality prevails as a palpable reality and not as mere rhetoric. If it does triumph  we will see peace flourish and international co-operation broaden  to the great benefit of all the peoples of the world.In December last year Washington became the unique arena for events which brought hope to the world  events such as the historic landmark represented by the signing by American and Soviet leaders of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  the IMF Treaty.This significant event  interpreted as a precursor of nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament - the great aspiration of all the peoples of the world - means in our opinion the final elimination of the obsolete cold war  and indicates the beginning of an era in which confrontation is replaced by co-operation in the relationship between the United States of America and the Soviet Union  with important and very positive results  not only for their respective peoples  but also for the entire international community.The four Reagan-Gorbachev summit meetings confirmed the existence of a dynamic favourable not only to positive progress on the path towards disarmament  but also to the stabilisation of Soviet-American relations. For developing peoples  if this dynamic continues to consolidate until a world without weapons and without violence may be built  there is the possibility of seeing the enormous amounts absorbed by the arms race being used for man's development and happiness.If universal human values finally become a priority in relations among States and nations  there would be some hope of putting an end to the regional conflicts which bathe our countries in blood and destroy them  causing misery  hunger and suffering. We note this evolution with satisfaction: it has led to specific results in the search for peaceful solutions to the conflicts in various regions of ÎÂ© world. In some of those conflicts  recourse to the principles and mechanisms of the United Nations has been decisive.	'Evidence of this development is to be found in the peace agreements signed in Geneva with regard to Afghanistan  in the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and the consequent beginning of direct negotiations between the parties with a view to the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  and in the progress currently being made in finding a peaceful solution in Western Sahara  Central America  Kampuchea and south-east Africa.In southern Africa  in our solidarity with the People's Republic of Angola  we are following with deep interest the progress of the quadripartite peace negotiations and the prospects opened up for the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We praise the constructive  discerning and courageous spirit with which the Government of the People's Republic of Angola is seeking a peaceful  fair and permanent solution to the conflict.In spite of these new prospects for negotiation  the international community must intensify its efforts to exert pressure on South Africa  with a view to speedy implementation of the process of independence for Namibia end to the establishment of a democratic and multiracial society in South Africa. The positive evolution observed in the approach to the above-mentioned conflicts is  unfortunately  not seen in other regions of the world. This is especially true in the Middle East  where only Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and recognition of the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-determination will permit the achievement of a just and permanent solution to the conflict.We reiterate once more our belief that the International Conference on the Middle East should be convened as soon as possible  with the participation of all the parties involved  including the Palestine Liberation Organisation  as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.Moreover  we cannot but express our concern regarding the continued aggression and occupation of East Timor and the fact that it is impossible for its people to enjoy their legitimate rights to self-determination end independence.We appeal to Indonesia  in the light of its historic tradition as a founding member and champion of the principles of the Movement of Hon-Aligned Countries  to co-operate with the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the continued efforts being made within the framework of General Assembly resolution 37/30 to bring about a just solution of this matter.Since the beginning of the 1960s  special emphasis has been laid on the need to make changes in international economic relations  especially in the areas of trade and price mechanisms for raw materials  with stress on the principle of reciprocity of advantages in international trade. In this regard  a number of initiatives have been widely debated  and important decisions Have been taken by the United Nations and the various specialised agencies in the United Nations system. By examining the various agreements and resolutions  however  we may conclude that there have been too many partial solutions and too many broken promises.The economic crisis besetting the developing countries does not allow them even to solve their food deficit. At the same time  all of them are in a situation in which they cannot comply with their foreign debt obligations and the servicing of that debt  the majority are becoming increasingly dependent on elements outside their region  and their development is accordingly blocked. In this context  the urgent convening of an international conference on the African foreign debt  in accordance with the decision of the Heads of State and Government of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)  is of the highest importance to our countries.These measures have not contributed effectively throughout the years to narrowing the gap between developed and developing countries  or to diminishing the economic and social imbalances existing in the world.If  in the past  industrial countries could not  or did not want to  face up to the deep structural imbalances observed in the economic situation of the world  today it is no longer possible to continue to ignore the need to take a number of joint decisions if we wish to address the whole problem of underdevelopment effectively.The interdependence of all countries and the global nature of current problems are not compatible with short-sighted egoism  which seeks to ignore the fact that the development of all peoples is a fundamental condition for international peace and security.Since each country has the responsibility of designing and choosing the model of development which is most appropriate for its specific characteristics  it is important for the international community to undertake a joint project for all countries  accepting international co-operation as a complement to everyone's individual efforts based on the democratic principles of solidarity and mutual interest. Among the fields in which international co-operation is required  we can also mention the protection of the environment. Today  the relationship between environment and development is unquestionable and It has become urgent for us to take a global approach to the problem  which should lead to appropriate follow-up action.We cannot fail to denounce the criminal complicity of certain economic agents of the West and some of their corrupt African allies  who are trying to use Africa as a depository for toxic and radioactive waste  and we hope that the analysis of the question during this session will culminate in a vigorous condemnation of those practices.At this session the General Assembly will examine  among other items  the results of the application of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development adopted in 1986 at its thirteenth special session. The recent meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the General Assembly entrusted with the assessment of that Programme completed its work here in the United Nations with satisfactory results  since it provided an opportunity for the parties concerned  two years after its adoption  to make an in-depth analysis and to consult with each other in an attempt to find the best ways of enhancing co-operation between Africa and the international community and of bringing about recovery in the impoverished African economy. While acknowledging the fundamental role to be played by African Governments in the elaboration of strategies for the implementation of the programme and taking into consideration the current serious economic situation in Africa  the meeting rightly emphasised the need for the international community to take urgent measures to speed up implementation over the next few years  especially by increasing the financial contributions to our countries on a predictable and sustained basis  thus supporting the efforts of the continent  especially in the field of agriculture.In order to overcome underdevelopment  we need to be clear and consistent in our analysis and denunciation of  and our battle against  factors brought about by our own mistakes. We must recognize that co-operation and solidarity among developing countries have not been taken sufficiently into consideration; it might even be said that they had been neglected. We must take specific and decisive measures towards the improvement of South-South co-operation and mutual assistance as an essential element in the establishment of a new international economic order.In the case of the African continent  there are various initiatives towards subregional economic integration that absolutely must be consolidated so that we may overcome the current balkanization  which is one of the reasons for our difficulties in achieving endogenous and self-sufficient development.On the other hand  we must have the courage to recognize the relationship between political power as it is exercised in many of our countries of the third world and underdevelopment. It is incontestable that development is essentially a cultural phenomenon  which requires the active participation of conscientious and responsible citizens. We must fight for the generalisation and consolidation of democracy  without which there can be no flowering of the people's creative spirit  which is the foundation that supports true development.In Sao Tone and Principe we are promoting an experiment in the involvement of the people in the political  economic and social life of the nation and the society  an experiment that we hope will be successful. After thorough  open  critical and outspoken debate on the problems that slow down our economic development  we decided that the State must withdraw from the management of productive units and that the citizen must bear the main responsibility for initiatives designed to bring about the economic recovery of the country. At the same time we took a historic step towerÂ· Ð· wider democratisation of our political life when we decided to grant freedom of expression to all political tendencies within the sole party. And we do not reject the idea of future evolution towards a plurality of parties  when the social  political and cultural contest justifies this.While this situation of democratic tolerance in our small country  as witnessed by Amnesty International when it visited Sao Tome and Principe a few weeks ago at our invitation  is a comforting reality for us  we cannot but be concerned about what is happening in more than half the countries of the world with respect to civil and human rights  as revealed by that same organisation a few days ago in its report  in the very year in which we commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This historic Declaration acknowledges that respect for the inalienable rights of all the members of the human family is the basis of freedom  justice and peace in the world. Although the objectives established by the Declaration may have seemed too ambitious for its tine  the progressive translation of its principles into rules of international law is today a reality which  in many parts of the world  stimulates and inspires all those who are fighting for respect for the inherent dignity of all human beings.The Government of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe  aware of its responsibilities in this field and wishing to participate in the international movement to safeguard and protect human rights  has recently ratified the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  in the belief that all human rights are indivisible and interrelated.I conclude by wishing this Assembly every success in its work  so that it may contribute effectively to the establishment of understanding among men and among nations  and to the material and spiritual progress of mankind."
"130",6440,"SUR",43,1988,"ï»¿Mandated by a free and determined people through the most adequate mechanism to designate by whom they wish to be governed  namely  free and fair general elections  I stand here today to bring a message of hope  determination  endurance and achievement.These past years have for us been marked by hope and frustration  illusions and dismay  the sense of participating in the dreams of young nations  yet also by a keen sense of isolation  bored by reality  the political leaders  together with the labour unions  the entrepreneurs  as well as the military leaders  have consistently sought a permanent solution to our fundamental problems. Pressure was applied from outside by withholding funds to which we were entitled by treaty provisions made in true faith after frank and open negotiations. At the same time  however  we were not without friends and sympathizers who backed us and wished us well  we are grateful for their understanding  their encouragement and their support.In the end the people of Suriname have prevailed  for  although they are small in number  their hope  determination  endurance and commitment are infinite. Allow me  Sir  to join all those who have spoken before me in offering you  on behalf of my Government and on icy own behalf  sincere congratulations on your election as President of the forty-third session of our General Assembly. We are particularly satisfied to see you in the Chair  as your election is a well-deserved tribute to you and to our sister nation  Argentina  with which we maintain excellent relations. My Government is well aware of your outstanding diplomatic skills and vast experience  and is therefore confident that under your able guidance the Assembly will deal successfully with the natters that cone before it.I also avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate your predecessor. Nr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic  on the dedicated and efficient way in which he presided over the forty-second session of the General Assembly.As this body was informed at its previous session  our people overwhelmingly approved a new draft Constitution for the Republic of Suriname in a national referendum held on 30 September last year  and in so doing paved the way for the holding of general elections. The draft Constitution was subsequently made law by a unanimous decision of our National Assembly.Apart from the subjects generally included in a Constitution  our new supreme law is characterized by the inclusion of specific provisions enabling direct influence by the people on the policy-making and executive processes through regional and subregional representative organs of the State. This newly enacted basic legal instrument of our nation further more enshrines the guarantee of human rights  while it also embodies the principles of a multi-party system and recognition of the important place and role of free  private enterprise  and guarantees the independence and integrity of the judiciary.On the basis of that Constitution  general  fair  secret and free elections were held on 25 November 1987  at the national  regional and subregional levels. As a result  in the wake of those elections  the first elected Executive President and Vice-President in the Republic of Suriname were inaugurated on 25 January this year  and a new Council of Ministers was installed on 26 January.At this point I should like to seize the opportunity once again to express the appreciation and indebtedness of my Government and people to various Governments and international organizations for the moral support given to us in our efforts to restore democracy and for sending observer delegations to witness the referendum and general elections of last year  as well as special missions to attend the inaugural ceremonies to which 1 have just referred.Although the referendum and the elections have indeed laid the basis for the recovery of a democratic  constitutional State  we realize that we still have a long way to go in order to attain a stable and fully-fledged democracy. For Suriname to develop into a mature democracy  the newly-established democratic structures will have to be nurtured by means of national unity and political  social and economic stability. In this context  it should be mentioned that my Government has inherited a number of serious social and economic problems which could become a threat to our national unity and political stability if not urgently addressed.Thus my Government has to deal with the problem of approximately 10 000 displaced citizens from the eastern part of Suriname  who fled the country for neighbouring French Guiana  seeking refuge from an internal armed conflict. My Government is soaking every effort through dialogue to end this insurgence  which has often resulted in violent acts of terrorism. It is faced  however  with the problem that the insurgents are aided and abetted by external forces whose chief aim is the continuation of violence through the provision  of arms  the recruitment and financing of mercenaries and so on. It is obvious that it will be most difficult to bring about an end to the violence as long as such external support is continued. My Government has therefore appealed to the Governments of France and the Kingdom of the Netherlands to assist us in preventing arms deliveries and the recruitment of foreign mercenaries. As a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention against the Recruitment  Use  Financing and Training of Mercenaries  we also call upon all peace-loving nations to support the Ad Hoc Committee in its endeavours to fulfil its mandate as soon as possible. Only international  concerted action against this evil practice can contribute to the eradication of the mercenaries. We are of the opinion that the international community in general and the developed countries in particular have a moral obligation not to delay the conclusion of such a convention.Meanwhile  the conflict has had a devastating effect on the already serious financial and economic crisis in our country. It has exacerbated the economic woes imposed on our country through such factors as the world recession  the withholding of financial development treaty resources and the absence of internal structural adaptation measures at the budgetary and monetary levels. It is hence self-evident that our economic and social development has been seriously affectedÂ·  this has become manifest in the decline of national production  the decrease in investments  the staggering rise of unemployment and inflation rates the deterioration of the balance of payments and  consequently  the near exhaustion of our foreign-exchange reserves. My Government is of the opinion that these challenges and difficulties should be faced unequivocally by a collective will to find just and proper solutions. To that end  the framework for a multi-year recovery programme has been developed.We are aware  however  that in the interdependent world in which we live  no nation can develop in total isolation from others  and we are aware that no Government can fully realize its development policy objectives without external co-operation. My Government is therefore conducting negotiations with some friendly nations and international organizations  in a spirit of equality  co-operation and mutual respect for one anotherâs sovereignty in order to obtain their valuable views  support and assistance for the solution of our social problems and the recovery  restructuring and sustained growth of our economy.We strongly believe in and adhere to a policy of dialogue and consensus aimed at the peaceful solution of problems  both nationally and internationally  and we therefore apply that policy in our relations and negotiations with the relevant Governments  organizations  institutions and individuals. Our policy is aimed at guaranteeing a stable and prosperous society based on a just and equitable sharing of human  natural and technological resources. We remain convinced that  with the support and co-operation of friendly nations  organizations and institutions  we shall succeed in overcoming all obstacles on the road to a fully flourishing democratic  peaceful  stable and prosperous Suriname. Aware of the extent to which our living destiny as a nation is influenced by the state of affairs in international relations  we  as a member of the international community  recognize our responsibility to contribute our share to the achievement of the primary goal of the United Nations. The achievement of a world with greater security for all nations  a world in which all can freely develop their potentials f lies at the heart of our Organization.Formulated more than four decades ago  the principles enshrined in the Charter of the Organization have nevertheless remained valid for us as a guideline to the government of the State. My Government will  therefore  in our relations with other nations strictly abide by those principles as well as by those embodied in the charter of the Organization of American States  while  as a member of the Non-Aligned Movement  we shall continue to place a high value on its lofty goals and principles. My Government recognises the importance of the contribution that can be made to the cause of peace by the promotion of greater understanding and appreciation among nations  in particular among States belonging to the same region. Regional integration and co-operation are considered by my Government to be more important for promoting that objective  as they are instrumental in promoting our economic and social development. Increased participation in the regional organizations of Latin American and the Caribbean will be our deliberate policy to that end. Consequently  we shall spare no effort further to develop and intensify our inter-American relations.Events that have recently developed on the international scene have rekindled the hope of my Government and of many others throughout the world that the purpose of the United Nations is indeed still viable. The positive turning-point in two major regional conflicts which clouded the international atmosphere for more than seven years has been welcomed by the international community. The cease-fire in the Gulf war is a source of great satisfaction to my Government  as it has relieved the international community of a dangerous conflict that could easily have widened into one with far-reaching implications for world peace. The continuation of that war for more than seven years  notwithstanding the numerous appeals of the United Nations to bring it to an end  has indeed been a senseless waste of the human and material resources of both nations.At this point we think it appropriate to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General of our Organization and to those who co-operated with him for their painstaking efforts and perseverance in bringing the two States to the negotiating table. It is now incumbent on both of them to utilize to the maximum the possibilities provided by our Organization to settle their dispute peacefully.It is gratifying for my Government to commend also the Secretary-General and his trusted assistants for their relentless efforts to free the territory of Afghanistan from the presence of foreign armed forces  thus removing from the international scene a major obstacle to the augmentation of international security. The restoration of  and respect shown by all countries for  the non-aligned status of Afghanistan will allow its people freely to settle their internal dispute in a manner they freely determine for themselves.Those developments augur well for the future of our Organization  and we are therefore confident that the United Nations will play an ever-increasing active and beneficial role in the peaceful solution of some grave regional conflicts that  unfortunately  still exist. In that context we should like to express our great satisfaction at the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces  a well-deserved tribute. We should like to add our congratulations in that respect. We are following with great interest another event on the international scene - namely  the armed conflict in South Africa  which has direct consequences for the long-standing question of Namibia. The United Nations has a considerable stake in the outcome of the ongoing negotiations  as it may be a determining factor in enabling our Organization to discharge its responsibility towards the Namibian people. We cannot allow the South African regime to use these talks as yet another of its widely known tactics to delay the independence of Namibia.	.In South Africa itself the policy of apartheid remains one of defiance of international opinion and ever-increasing repression of those who are fighting for their basic human rights. My Government unconditionally supports the struggle of the people of South Africa to eradicate the system of apartheid. Mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa remain the only option to enable the international community to exert credible pressure on the South African Government to abandon its criminal policies.My Government cannot but voice its dismay at the development in another area of a seemingly endless conflict which has occupied the attention of the international community for many years. The disregard which has been displayed by Israel for the resolutions of the United Nations over these years remains the main cause of the continued tension in that region. Understandably frustrated by the lack of any progress to end the illegal presence of Israeli forces in the occupied Arab territories  the population cannot but show its contempt for such injustice through campaigns of civil disobedience and protest. The repressive reaction of the Israeli authorities to the legitimate expression of outrage by the Palestinian people deserves the condemnation of our Organization. It should be emphasized once more that peace in the Middle East can be achieved only through a settlement which is based on the principle of justice for all nations of the region.The improved relations between the two States which play a key role in maintaining international peace and security offer new hope for our world that the threat against life on our planet will be removed. We welcome the tendency of increased mutual trust between those nations  which has led to a noteworthy breakthrough in our effort to halt the arms race and clear the way for further progress to end the greatest danger to the survival of mankind. Notwithstanding this significant step in the right direction  the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament has proved that deep-rooted differences are still to be bridged and that it will take more than one effort to overcome the threat of a nuclear holocaust.Suriname believes that changing the arms policy into a policy aimed at social development would release significant human and financial resources that could be utilized to promote worldwide development  prosperity and peace.My Government wishes to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for the way in which he has responded to the appeal by the General Assembly in its resolution 42/204 of 11 December 1987 to formulate a special plan of co-operation for Central American The plan identifies short-term and medium-term priority areas of co-operation and also sets out mechanisms for implementation and follow-up.According to the Esquipulas agreement  peace and democracy in Central America cannot be achieved without a commitment to improve the social and economic well-being of the population of the countries involved. Since the roots of tension in Central America lie in social and economic problems  it is evident that the special plan of co-operation for Central America can be considered a welcome response to the question of alleviating the tension in that region.The Government of Suriname considers drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking as a serious threat to mankind and will thus do everything possible  at both the national and the international level  to step up the fight against this evil scourge.The world economic situation is still critical and a prolonged crisis is permeating all areas of economic and international relations. In this connection I should like to draw the attention of this body to the growing debt burden that has become the meet visible manifestation of that crisis. The external debt constitutes a challenge to our joint co-ordinated actions and our solidarity is being put to the test.We feel that the strategy that has been followed so far is insufficient and of a short-term nature. Although the declaration of a moratorium by one or more countries is a possibility  the debt equity swap is a means  not a lasting solution. More them ever before the time is ripe for the developed and the developing countries to arrive at an equitable  lasting and mutually agreed solution on the basis of a developmental approach.It is our considered opinion that an attitude of low profile and neglect in finding a mutual solution to the debt crisis is not only short-sighted but also dangerous  since this matter is already gravely disturbing the social and political stability of democratically elected Governments. Hence ray Government is in favour of a dialogue between creditors and debtors  based on the principles of co-responsibility and the right to development. The attitude recently demonstrated by the developed countries during the Toronto summit in relation to the rescheduling of the debts of the least developed third world countries is only a small step in the right direction. It is obvious that much more will have to be done.Let me turn to a more positive note. My Government welcomes the recant concrete proposals containing a new approach in the policy of reunifying the Korean peninsula. It is the earnest hope of my Government that the suspended dialogue will be resumed on the basis of the new proposals. My Government furthermore hopes that in the not too distant future we will be able to welcome a unified Korea as a full Member of our Organization.Finally  my Government is highly pleased to note that the United Nations is regaining its well deserved place in the international community as a unique forum for dialogue  understanding and co-operation. Let us hope that this positive development will continue  so that peace and prosperity for all may be achieved in this world of ours. Suriname will contribute to help realize this lofty goal. "
"131",6534,"SWE",43,1988,"ï»¿Forty years ago this month  my compatriot Count Police Bernadotte was murdered during his mission as United Nations mediator on Palestine. His name reminds us of the planned political violence which  however meaningless  is still a reality. His name also reminds us that the practical work for peace and security has been a central task of the United Nations during its entire existence.The world's expectations of the United Nations have varied over the years. The United Nations role in recent efforts for peace has once again raised expectations.Last year we were many in this Assembly who discussed how the United Nations was to overcome the crisis that threatened its existence. The issue today is how the Organization can live up to the expectations  how the United Nations can best make use of the ""window of opportunity"" that has opened.Under the skilful leadership of the Secretary-General  the United Nations has contributed to creating new opportunities for solving conflicts and restoring peace. Strong support for the United Nations work for peace is called for. Such support would also contribute to making the United Nations the strong and effective organization that is needed if we are to meet the global challenges of the 199UsÃ­ halting the arms race  protecting the environment  safeguarding our resources and promoting development.The threats to our survival are coming from various directions. We are becoming increasingly dependent on global co-operation. It is the United Nations that must channel and organize this co-operation.The cease-fire between Iran and Iraq has brought to an end eight years of war with immense human suffering and immeasurable material damage. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and the Secretary-General's intensive work to implement the resolution have been important contributions. The negotiations that have been initiated have Sweden's strong and active support. Consequently  Sweden has responded in a positive way to the Secretary-General's request for participation in the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group. The Swedish Government was honoured that the Secretary-General  in consultation with the patties  appointed Mr. Jan Rliasson  Sweden's Ambassador to the United Nations  to be his personal representative at the peace negotiations. It is our fervent hope that the parties will show goodwill and succeed in achieving a comprehensive  just and honourable settlement.United Nations peace efforts have also made progress in the Afghanistan conflict. Sweden supports the endeavours to carry through the Geneva agreements  not least by participating in the United Nations Observer Group in the area.Peace has not yet come to Afghanistan. Continued warfare is delaying the enormous work of reconstruction that needs to be carried out. The millions of refugees cannot yet return in safety. It is of utmost importance that the United Nations be given a central and co-ordinating role in the repatriation of refugees and in the reconstruction of the country. In the past years Sweden has given humanitarian assistance to the war victims in Afghanistan. We also intend to give strong support to the assistance programme being prepared through the United Nations Co-ordinator of Humanitarian and Economic Aid to Afghanistan.In the Middle East  the uprising in the territories occupied by Israel has created a new situation. The people in the occupied territories have clearly shown that they no longer accept their plight. Israel's continued control over these areas rests on force. Ws condemn Israel's brutal oppression of the Palestinians. The occupation must cease and Israel withdraw from all the territories occupied since 1967. This is the path to the achievement of a lasting peace. A heavy responsibility rests upon Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). They must recognize each other as negotiating parties. Israel must recognize the right of the Palestinians to self-determination  including the right to establish a State of their own. The Palestinians must recognize Israel's right to exist within secure boundaries. Both the PLO and Israel have to accept and implement resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Both sides must renounce terror. An international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation of all the parties directly concerned  is the path that should be taken as soon as possible. To oppose this is to oppose the quest for peace. Progress has been made in the negotiations between Angola  Cuba and South Africa. The negotiations must lead to independence for Namibia based on Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  and also to peace for Angola. Sweden confirms its undertaking to assist the United Nations in this process through  among other things  participation in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group. Sweden is also prepared to enter into extensive development co-operation with a free and independent Namibia  as we did with the frontline States.Settlement of the Questions of Angola and Namibia will not eliminate the root cause of conflict in southern Africa  which remains apartheid. South Africa's apartheid policy and its destabilization of neighbouring countries continue to constitute a massive violation of human rights and a threat to international peace and security. Pending a United Nations decision on effective sanctions against South Africa  Sweden has introduced a ban on both trade with and investments in South Africa and Namibia. This is in accordance with a Nordic programme of action. We hope that our measures and those of other countries are the embryo of massive pressure on South Africa to abolish the apartheid system.The search for a peaceful settlement in Kampuchea is still at a preliminary stage. A peaceful solution requires that the Vietnamese troops be withdrawn and that the Kampuchean people be allowed to decide their own future. Also  guarantees must be given that atrocities of the kind that took place during the years 1975 to 1979 are not to be repeated.The best foundation for peace in Central America continues to be the peace plan signed by five Presidents of the region a year ago. Great efforts have been made to implement the peace plan  but the breakthrough has yet to come. Renewed efforts must be made by the Central Americans themselves and by the international community. The peace plan's principles of democracy and of international law must be respected by all  both in and outside the region. With its great influence  the United States bears a special responsibility. Development assistance is necessary if the countries in the region are to be capable of tackling the consequences of many years of economic and social injustice. Those are the primary causes of the conflict.In Cyprus and in Western Sahara  the Secretary-General has contributed to renewed hopes for progress towards a peaceful settlement. We also hope that the contacts that recently took place on the Korean peninsula will lead to reconciliation and a peaceful solution.While positive steps are being taken in several regional conflicts  human suffering has increased in the countries in and around the Horn of Africa. The United Nations has an important role to play in supplying aid to refugees and others in distress in that region. The political problems in the region are also in urgent need of a solution.Sweden has a long tradition of participating in United Nations peace-keeping operations. The most recent United Nations operation in this field illustrates the Organization's capacity to meet new demands expeditiously. It is all the more disquieting that the financing of the peace-keeping operations remains a grave problem. It is in the interests of all Member States that these operations rest on a solid financial foundation.Armed conflicts afflict people in a brutal and shockingly palpable way. There are  however  other kinds of threats  which develop slowly and less spectacularly  but which in time have come to constitute a danger to the entire planet. Among those are environmental degradation and its dramatic and large-scale effects. As a threat to our survival it is not inferior to the arms race.Alarming research reports tell us that the climate has begun to change as a probable result of the greenhouse effect. Life-giving resources are being destroyed by erosion  desertification and the devastation of forests. People's health is increasingly being affected by the poisoning of water and food chains and depletion of the ozone layer.The causes of these threats to the environment lie in excessive exploitation of natural resources  brought on by poverty  and in industrial pollution and waste of resources  not least in the field of energy. The impact of man on the environment may have reached the threshold of unknown environmental disasters.The United Nations is in a unique position to rally the world's Governments to action. Preparations should immediately be initiated for a global United Nations conference on environment and development in 1992. Such a conference must take concrete decisions on joint measures both to solve acute environmental problems and to achieve long-term changes in policy. This year's session of the General Assembly should decide on a conference and request the Secretary-General to present to its next session proposals on the aim and direction  organization and preparation of the conference. As I mentioned in the Assembly last year  Sweden is again prepared to act as host  if this is the general wish.The agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on the elimination of land-based intermediate-range nuclear weapons is historic. But it is essential that results be rapidly achieved in the negotiations on the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons and of conventional forces as well.The third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament ended without agreement on a concluding document. However  we must now look ahead and take as a starting-point what was achieved during the special session.We must quickly bring about negotiations on a comprehensive test ban within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament. The time is also ripe to investigate the possibility of the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons  based on international law. Continued attention must be given to naval armaments. The United Nations must be given an increased role in monitoring compliance with disarmament agreements. The nuclear powers must abandon their policy of neither confirming nor denying the existence of nuclear weapons on naval vessels visiting foreign ports. This would remove a cause of widespread anxiety among the general public. The United Nations reports on the use of chemical weapons in the war between Iran and Iraq have once again reminded us of the terrible effects of these weapons. We have also been greatly concerned by allegations that they are still being used by Iraq against the Kurdish population. Sweden and a number of other countries have requested that those allegations be investigated. The cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq must not be exploited for the persecution of the Kurdish minority.Chemical warfare is a violation of international law and must be condemned. The negotiations on a global convention banning chemical weapons must be concluded with urgency. Sweden looks favourably upon the initiative launched yesterday by the President of the United States on the convening of an international conference on the use of chemical weapons.One of the most important contributions of the United Nations has been to draw up rules within the field of human rights. Several conventions have come into existence over the last 40 years  but rules are of little use if they are not observed. In all too many parts of the world the task remains to translate the rules into practical use. Respect for the rights and personal integrity of the individual must not remain just empty words.The past decade has been a period of deepening crisis for many developing countries. The debt crisis  low domestic savings and falling investments are today among the most serious obstacles to development. The internal readjustments that have been necessary as a consequence of this have been distressing and have aggravated the social problems.The international community has an obligation to mitigate this crisis. It is disheartening to have to say that only a few among the most affluent have reached the goal of 1 per cent of gross national product for development assistance. Co-ordinated measures to alleviate the debt burden of the poorest developing countries are today an important task for international assistance.All United Nations activities concern peace and security in one respect or another  and they require an efficiently functioning Organization. The work on reforming and revitalizing the United Nations continues  largely thanks to dedicated efforts by the Secretary-General and his staff. This process must be carried further.Progress in the reform work depends on the loyalty of Member States to the world Organization. The United Nations must not be forced to struggle with an acute financial crisis at a time when great and urgent tasks require its attention. All Member States must fulfil their financial obligations laid down in the Charter. We are gratified to note that the United States intends to change its position on this matter  as did the Soviet Union some time ago.It is imperative that Member states establish a sound and lasting financial basis for the world Organization's activities. Sweden has actively participated in discussions with the Secretary-General on solutions to both the short-term and the long-term problems. We are prepared to continue these discussions and accept our share of the responsibility in order to overcome the crisis.Sweden earlier put forward ideas for a more even scale of assessment. This would be one way of making the Organization less vulnerable.No conflicts have been finally settled anywhere during 1988. We know how easily relapses into earlier conflict patterns occur and how quickly the international climate may change. But the global challenges we are facing are of such a scale that this time we cannot afford to return to the antagonisms that permeated and divided the world community for so long. The utmost efforts are required of all United Nations members to strengthen and develop the positive trend that has characterized 1988. Let us all contribute to making this year a turning point in the aspirations both to live in peace and to build a United Nations capable of upholding respect for international law and coping with the threats to our survival. In these endeavours there is no alternative to a strong global organization.In closing  I should like to quote the late Swedish Prime Minister  Olof Palme  who said:""we look at our world today and remain convinced that the United Nations is only at the beginning of its history.""

"132",6572,"SWZ",43,1988,"ï»¿Sir  it is my honour and privilege on behalf of the Government of His Majesty King Mswati III and the peace-loving people of the Kingdom of Swaziland  to convey our profound appreciation and congratulations on Mr. Dante Caputoâs well-deserved election to the presidency of this historic forty-third session of our Organization's General Assembly. This delegation is not only convinced of his outstanding diplomatic skills and sense of duty  but it is equally confident that under his stewardship our proceedings will indeed again be marked with historic excellence and constructive results.Our tribute and profound gratitude also go to his outstanding predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Peter Florin  a noble son of the German Democratic Republic  who safely guided the Assembly's affairs with rare excellence. Indeed  his tenure in office was characterized by some of the most problematic scenarios in the annals of contemporary international affairs.My delegation notes with a sense of pride and humility that the international situation in which the current session is being held is not only politically favourable but also holds some optimistic promises for mankind. It is an era influenced by new political thinking as well as by bold diplomatic initiatives to resolve current conflicts.We further take pride and draw inspiration from the fact that we are witnessing positive trends towards a new epoch of effective mechanisms for global political-crisis management  largely inspired by the United Nations system. My delegation therefore welcomes the current relaxation of tensions between the super-Powers and their initiation of a meaningful dialogue on numerous important global issues  especially in the field of disarmament  and including some hotbeds of conflict of both regional and international dimensions. We believe that to be fundamental and consonant with the United Nations Charter by promoting international peace and security. His Majesty's Government and the people of Swaziland have followed with keen interest the unfolding events in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf. We too share the sentiments of the international community  which  under United Nations auspices  has spared no effort in seeking an amicable political settlement to resolve one of the most protracted post-Second-World-War crises  whose dimensions have tested the strength of the Organization.We continue to share in the guarded optimism that United Nations initiatives to resolve the Spanish Sahara and Kampuchea conflicts will further enhance its future role and our resolve in multilateral diplomacy.At this juncture  I should like to pay a tribute and express gratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. His Majesty's Government and the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland continue to follow his reports and recommendations that chart out multilateral processes in international relations. We therefore note with pride the fact that the Secretary-General and all Members of the United Nations have brought their good judgement to bear on many international crises. In their continued search for solutions to some very intractable conflicts they have played a pivotal role. We further salute the apostles of peace for having made it possible to defend the cause of freedom and human dignity under the umbrella of the United Nations peace-keeping forces.On the other hand the delegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland is forced to note the painful analysis that for far too long has unfairly regarded the United Nations as a non-functional world body and characterized it as a talk shop. To the surprise of the prophets of doom  evidence that such is not the case has dramatically emerged. The United Nations has managed to initiate successful negotiations towards a solution in Afghanistan in the Iran-Iraq war  in Kampuchea  in the Angolan conflict and in Western Sahara.However  many other issues remain partly or totally unresolved in spite of the efforts of the United Nations. The Organization continues to struggle with the elimination of the last vestiges of colonialism from the face of the earth. The external-debt burden is worsening by' the day  and that is an indication of the gap that still exists between developed and developing countries. The United Nations is fully aware that millions are faced with hunger and starvation in many parts of the world. Many Member States  like our beloved country  Swaziland  are faced with an influx of refugees and displaced persons.At the end of 1987  Swaziland  which occupies an area of only 17 364 square kilometres  with a population of about 750 000  had 350 registered urban refugees and approximately 45 000 rural refugees. The numbers are increasing rapidly on a daily basis  and the critical situation faced by the refugees involves the shortage of food and the inadequacy of land  which limits the scope for productive agricultural activities.The complex situation in the Middle East is cause for great concern  for it has reached an explosive stage where strife between Palestinians and Jews continues to prevail. Swaziland encourages the United Nations to redouble its efforts towards the attainment of a peaceful solution to that critical issue.The Korean peninsula is still characterized by tension between the North and the South. That unhealthy atmosphere has promoted distrust and hatred in the peninsula  which was unfortunately divided by differences in ideology. We strongly recommend that all external forces cease forthwith from interfering in the internal affairs of both Koreas  and  in this regard  we believe that the people of the peninsula have the tremendous responsibility and capacity to enter into direct inter-Korean negotiations themselves.We also commend the efforts of the United Nations in bringing about speedy and genuine self-determination and independence to the people of New Caledonia. We wholeheartedly support United Nations initiatives to conduct an unbiased referendum  which will undoubtedly indicate the true aspirations of the people of New Caledonia.In Central America and the Caribbean we continue to note with great concern that a number of countries are increasingly strife torn by reason of their deteriorating economic situations  social unrest and political instability. Nicaragua and Panama  for example  have been and are still being subjected to pressure by military and paramilitary activities  as well as by economic embargoes. Consequently  the economies of those States  which are suspected of importing foreign ideologies  have been hard hit  to the social detriment of their peoples. We appeal to all Member States in the region to resolve their problems by peaceful negotiations  as advocated by His Majesty King Sobhuza II and currently by His Majesty King Mswati III of the Kingdom of Swaziland.This year marks the forty-third anniversary of the beginning of the arms race. The horrendous events that occurred at Hiroshima and Nagasaki  resulting in the deaths of millions of people and in massive destruction of property  are an indelible part of the annals of history. What mankind now faces is the enormous production of highly sophisticated nuclear weapons that are capable of destroying mankind many  many times over. My delegation views with utmost concern the currently escalating arms race which must oÂ£ necessity be stopped in order ""to save succeeding generations 'from the scourge of war"". The outbreak of another world war  which would certainly lead to nuclear holocaust ~ a situation that would mean unprecedented disaster for mankind - must be totally avoided.It is the responsibility of the international community to promote world peace and security for purposes of global development and co-operation by moving in the direction of complete disarmament. The Kingdom of Swaziland therefore commends the efforts of the United Nations in organizing three major conferences in 1978  1982 and 1988 aimed at sensitising Member States to the need to reach a common consensus in the area of disarmament. Although all these conferences have failed to attain this major goal  it must be realized that they have  to a great extent  already stirred the conscience of the world community. The seriousness of the arms race was demonstrated by the heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries at the seventh summit conference held in New Delhi in March 1983  at which it was observed thatÂ·.""... the greatest peril facing the world today is the threat to the survival of mankind from nuclear war. Disarmament  in particular nuclear disarmament  is no longer a moral issue it is an issue of human survival. ... Nuclear weapons are more than weapons of war. They are instruments of mass annihilation."" (A/38/132  para. 28)It is our humble view that the excessive expenditure on weaponry suffocates the development of the world economy  thus perpetuating the misery and poverty afflicting more than two thirds of mankind  we therefore call for the immediate conclusion of a convention on both chemical and conventional weapons  not only to prohibit their development  production  stockpiling and possible use  but also to provide for the earliest destruction of existing weapons. The people of the Kingdom of Swaziland has learned with great shock and alarm that certain nuclear-possessing States have resolved to dump their nuclear wastes on the continent of Africa. What we find disquieting in this rather sinister episode is their justification of this act by the following reasons: first that their nuclear garbage is devoid of potential chemical or toxic risks to the people and the environment they are not prepared themselves to dump it inside their countries; and  secondly  that compensatory financial aid follows the dumping exercise.We in the Kingdom of Swaziland remain ardent believers in the norms of international economic co-operation and in the positive spirit of multilateralism. However  my delegation continues to view with added concern the plight of our hard-hit fragile economies in the many developing countries  and particularly the grave agony of Africa's economic crisis. Indeed  it is our strangest observation that  in spite of the economic recovery experienced in some industrialized countries  developing countries continue to be confronted with an adverse external environment whose dimensions have devastated our strenuous efforts towards achieving the goal of economic self-reliance.These countries continue to suffer from a combination of serious economic problems  inter alia  declining commodity prices  sharp exchange rate fluctuations  a severe debt crisis prompted by excessively high interest rates  and stagnation of official development assistance.It may also be observed that studies conducted by world financial institutions do predict that the situation is extremely bleak for the sub-Saharan countries which  over the years  have been experiencing the worst economic declines in history  particularly in per capita income  investment and consumption. For instance  while growth in output was estimated at 3.2 per cent in 1987 compared to 4 per cent in 1986  the grim reality is that debt servicing has assumed crippling proportions  ranging from 30 per cent to 100 per cent of exports. The World Bank  on the other hand  also estimates an annual resource gap of more than $2.5 billion for these countries for the period 1986 to 1990  that is  if import levels of 1980 to 1982 are achieved and the necessary structural reforms are carried out. This is certainly not an encouraging scenario for North-South and South-South economic relations. We further wish to observe that the Kingdom of Swaziland is a small land-locked country whose economic development solidly depends on external trade. Thus  such unprecedented declines in commodity prices and the unfavourable international economic outlook represent a major collapse of our fragile economy.Above all  for us in Swaziland the agricultural sector plays an important role in our economic development. It generates 71 per cent of our export earnings and provides 75 per cent of our labour force. It is therefore the policy of His Majesty's Government to intensify our industrial base development in order to enhance the quality of life and the betterment of living standards for our citizens. Thus we are active members of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference  whose cardinal principles and purposes remain aimed at nothing other than the modest consolidation of our hard won sÐ¾Ñio-economic and political independence.My delegation has no illusions about the task that lies ahead  but we do have confidence in the modern technological institutions  headed by the United Nations system  that seek to harmonize the activities of our global village. We therefore  pay our highest tribute to the donor community  the United Nations system  and our partners in economic development for all the generous assistance rendered to improve our country  Swaziland. Respect for human rights is of cardinal importance in our world. It is a pity that we still learn of torture  disappearances and wanton killings in different parts of the world. His Majesty's Government strongly condemns such sinister practices  and urges the international community to reaffirm its fundamental duty and encourage respect for human rights and freedom. Practices such as racism and racial discrimination have no place in the evolution of international law and modern civilization. The Government and people of the Kingdom of Swaziland attach great significance to the long-drawn-out conflicts in southern Africa. In our view  they do not augur well for the progress of human civilization  and  as members of that volatile region  we certainly cannot afford the consequences of indulging in the luxury of standing by with folded hands when our future is at stake. Equally  we have no illusions when analysing the events unfolding in our political backyard  but we are fully determined to pursue resolutely our mission of peace. Swaziland is on record as having initiated some bold diplomatic steps in the now historic Manzana Diplomacy  whose fundamental aim and objective is to build bridges of peace in our region. Above all  it seeks the promotion of direct  peaceful dialogue among leaders in southern Africa.Furthermore  we note with great admiration the important role played by the Administration of the United States of America in bringing together the Governments of Cuba  Angola and South Africa in an attempt to find a peaceful solution to the Namibian and Angolan problems and consequently to the chronic problem inside South Africa.We equally applaud the continued United Nations diplomatic initiatives in seeking a genuine and permanent political solution for the problems facing southern Africa  and we urge all towards peace in our region. My delegation also wishes to reaffirm in the strongest possible terms that the policy of His Majesty's Government is based on concrete factors of pragmatism rather than narrow political and ideological expediency. We are  therefore  committed to the sacred principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and those of the Organization of African Unity and the Non-Aligned Movement  particularly the principles pertaining to the right of self-determination and independence of peoples under colonialism  neo-colonialism and other pernicious forms of human oppression. Above all  Swaziland is committed to the settlement of international disputes by peaceful negotiations and the non-use of force  as envisaged in Chapters I and VI  particularly Articles 1 (2) and 33  of the Charter.My delegation notes with satisfaction the tremendous role played by the United Nations in the comprehensive formulation  development and shaping of the law of the sea  which transcends the limits of national jurisdiction and accommodates the international uses of the sea and its resources. We are confident that the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea will continue to make effective progress  in the Interest not only of the common heritage of mankind but also of the maintenance of peace and justice for all peoples in the world. It is particularly heartening that even my small  developing country  Swaziland  stands to benefit immensely from the successful implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We in the Kingdom of Swaziland are greatly perplexed by the spread of international terrorism  whose victims are innocent people  including women and children. We humbly urge all parties concerned to exercise both moral and political restraint in resolving their differences.In conclusion  my delegation wishes to pay a glowing tribute to the evolution of the United Nations system. This Organization is unique and remains ""the last best hope for mankind"". The people of Swaziland are only too proud to be associated with this noble Organization that has galvanized mankind into new and fresh concepts  guiding our onward march to a more peaceful and stable world of multilateral diplomacy. Thus  only a few weeks ago  the Kingdom of Swaziland celebrated its twentieth anniversary as a sovereign State; and  like many new States In the family of nations  we cannot forget how grateful and indebted we are to the international community for having made our national dreams possible. We further salute and honour the men of vision and wisdom whose Yalta and Dumbarton Oaks negotiations ushered us into this new world of the United Nations.However  let us be realistic: the challenges that face us are daunting ones  but they are not beyond the ingenuity of humanity to surmount. We must  therefore agree that we have not done sufficient. We must  therefore  move from words to deeds and make sure that together we can create true common security and peace for our peoples.His Majesty's Government and the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland wish to reaffirm their faith in and adherence to the principles of the Charter. They look forward to continued and fruitful co-operation with the United Nations and its specialized agencies."
"133",6647,"SYR",43,1988,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. His country Argentina and mine  Syria  both of which are members of the Movement of the Non-Aligned Countries  have always maintained relations of friendship and co-operation. We are confident that his political skill in guiding the deliberations of the present session will ensure the success of our work.It is also a pleasure to express my appreciation of the outstanding success achieved by his predecessor  Mr  Peter Florin  in guiding the work of the forty-second session. To him and to his friendly country  the German Democratic Republic  we offer our best wishes for unceasing progress and success.The achievements of the Secretary-General and his assistants in reinforcing the role of the United Nations merit our deep appreciation and gratitude. We have especially high regard for the Secretary-General's personal initiatives and  participation in efforts to tackle a number of difficult regional problems. This year the United Nations has begun to take significant steps towards restoring its international stature  which was greatly affected during the cold-war years. A new and serious way of thinking has revitalized the role of the international Organization in finding solutions for pressing world problems  foremost among which are regional conflicts.There is no doubt that the Soviet-American dialogue has created an atmosphere of dÃ©tente in relations between East and West which has been reflected in one way or another in dealing with regional conflicts  which will make it easier to find just solutions for many of them. The climate of detente has been roost vividly manifested in the cease-fire in the Iraq-Iran war  the situations in Afghanistan  South West Africa and South-East Asia  and the important meetings conducted or supervised by the Secretary-General of the patties directly involved in the problems of Cyprus and Western Sahara.However  we must reiterate in this important international forum that the Arab-Israeli conflict continues to escalate  unaffected by the atmosphere of international detente  despite all the international efforts made lately by both East and West to arrive at a just and comprehensive settlement. There is not even a sign on the horizon that would indicate that the success of such efforts hinges on the results of the forthcoming Israeli or American elections. The conditions for a solution set out in the platforms of the two main rival political parties in Israel would not bring about peace in the Middle East. As for the United States of America  peace in the Middle East is not even on the agenda of either of the two candidates competing for the Presidency. Furthermore  if it were to be included it would be simply a matter of a race to win Israel's favour and stress the special relationship} it would have nothing to do with the way to achieve just and comprehensive world peace according to a clear and independent American perspective.It has now become more clear than ever before that the special Israeli-American relationship  as it stands  does not serve the cause of peace; instead  it has become an additional obstacle to the attainment of a comprehensive  just settlement in the Middle East. It is indeed regrettable that these special relations  with their dimension within the fabric of the American society  should be harnessed to increase tension in the area  destabilize it and deprive its peoples of the just peace that they aspire to achieve.We cannot now rule out the possible collapse of the convictions of those who have always pledged themselves to employ the special Israeli-American relationship to make peace  achieve Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories  and restore the national rights of the Palestinian people. Rather  it has become clear to them that such special relations provide Israel with sufficient influence on American policy to keep the Arab-Israeli conflict outside the atmosphere of international detente - an atmosphere that is not in tune with Israel's expansionist policy. On the other hand  the United Nations  which adopted a resolution establishing Israel  has so far failed to make Israel take one of the political options provided for in the Charter: either to implement United Nations resolutions relevant to the Palestinian question and the Arab-Israeli conflict  or to face comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter.That reference to the lack of ability of the United Nations in this field is not meant to minimize the complications surrounding the adoption of Security Council resolutions  nor does it signify lack of awareness of the big hurdles which stand in the way of implementing those resolutions once they have been adopted. What we want to highlight here is that the non-implementation of the political options provided for in the Charter has made the Israelis feel that they have an international mandate  besides the biblical one which they claim for themselves  to resort to military means to carry out their expansionist plans wherever and whenever they can.Since the early days of the Arab-Israeli conflict myths have been confused with truths and legends with facts. The rulers of Israel have been intent on magnifying their legends at the expense of the land and the tights of the Palestinian people. They have gone so far in their racist practices against Arab citizens as to be no longer willing to acknowledge the tights of the Palestinian people to their own land and home country  deluding themselves that Israel's military and technological superiority will go on forever  and that Israel will always be able to impose what it wants  anytime  anywhere Israel still occupies the West Bank  the Gaza Strip  the Syrian Golan and parts of Lebanon  but this occupation is no longer an easy task for Israel  nor should Israel take it for granted. In southern Lebanon the Lebanese resistance is still making sacrifices. Yet it is costing Israel considerable losses and it will continue its struggle until the liberation of the last inch of the Lebanese territory. In the Golan the Syrian Arab citizens are continuing their absolute rejection of Israeli identity cards and are clinging tenaciously to their Syrian identity. In the West Bank and Gaza Strip the Palestinian uprising is still bravely facing the Israeli occupying soldiers for the tenth consecutive month  despite all the barbaric practices perpetrated by those forces. The spirit of the uprising has pervaded Israel itself  where the Palestinians  who number about three quarters of a million  have started to revive their Arab identity  their attachment to their country  Palestine  and to express in one way or another their solidarity with their brothers in the other Arab occupied territories.The picture is grim in Israel  and for the future of Israel. Israel  a technological and military superiority can do very little to change that picture.The Syrian Arab Republic continues to call for the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations  and with participation of all the parties involved in the conflict  including the Palestine Liberation Organization and the five permanent members of the Security Council. Such a conference should be given the full and effective capacity to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East  based on the principles of the Charter and United Nations resolutions relevant to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian question  and on complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories  including Jerusalem  and the safeguarding of the national rights of the Palestinian people  including their inalienable right to return  their right to self-determination and the right to establish their own independent State on their national territory. Recent developments in Lebanon have taken that brother country once again into a dark tunnel  although hopes had been entertained for the emergence of a new era of national reconciliation  constitutional reforms and the election of a new president. Those who undermined the presidential elections during the prescribed constitutional period by blackmail  political manoeuvring  and threats and by preventing deputies from reaching the parliament building should be held responsible before the Lebanese people. Lebanon's unity  its Arab identity and its independence should never be the subject of blackmail or bargaining.The historical ties between Lebanon and Syria  their common destiny  their mutual interests and their interdependent security are deeply rooted in the people of both countries and not just in their Governments  it is self-evident that those historical ties  and nothing else  dictated for Syria all the great sacrifices it was prepared to make and the heavy burden it shouldered in assisting all the Lebanese people. Had Syria been otherwise motivated  the map and the realities on the ground would have changed since the first days of the Syrian forces' entry into Lebanon.We should like to emphasize  in this international body  that there is no alternative to national reconciliation in Lebanon. The attempts to partition Lebanon and all the other Israeli plans which Syria has been able to foil during recent years should not be allowed to succeed. All the sacrifices and efforts made by Syria for many years to help Lebanon should not be unavailing just because a small minority of the Lebanese decided to ignore the true interests of Lebanon and attempted to impose their will on the absolute majority of the Lebanese people.The national conference held in Lebanon last Thursday  in which most Lebanese political personalities  Muslims and Christians  took part  reiterated its belief in the unity of Lebanon and its Arab identity and its total rejection of all attempts at partition  and called for an end to the Israeli occupation. The conference also stressed the duty of all Lebanese to work together to reconstruct their country on the basis of equality and justice and to open a new page in its history  a page of national reconciliation. The conference called upon the government of Dr. Salim Al Hoss to continue to ensure the functioning of the country's institutions  in the whole of Lebanon  and to take the necessary measures to enable the presidential election to take place as soon as possible. Because of its strong historical ties with Lebanon and its deep awareness of the grave dangers posed to the unity and role of Lebanon in particular and Arab interests in general  Syria has been and will always be committed to offering all possible help to that brother country in order to overcome its current crisis  to { reserve the unity of its land and people and to maintain its security and independence.After the eight years of wide-scale killing and destruction between two neighbouring countries that for hundreds of years enjoyed historical and cultural relations  the cease-fire between Iraq and Iran certainly is a positive step. Syria condemned this unjustified war from its very outset and immediately welcomed Iran's official acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). Syria is well aware that that acceptance will have a positive effect on the tense situation in the Gulf region in particular and the Middle East in general. We wish the Secretary-General success  and  e express appreciation to him for the patience he has shown in his efforts to achieve the goal  which are hampered by great difficulties that should not be underestimated if the desired results are to be attained.International terrorism is a major source of tension in international relations. The Syrian Arab Republic participated actively in the drafting of General Assembly resolution 42/139  which is regarded as a significant and advanced step in the efforts to combat international terrorism and eradicate its evils and dangers and to distinguish between terrorism and the struggle of peoples for national liberation. The importance of that resolution is evident from its condemnation of international terrorism and  at the same time  its emphasis on the legitimacy of the struggle of peoples that are under racist or colonial domination or foreign occupation for liberation self-determination and independence. We stress once again that the convening of an international conference to define terrorism and distinguish it from the struggle of peoples for national liberation will significantly contribute to combating international terrorism. Such a conference would undermine the deliberate attempts being made to confuse terrorism  which we condemn  with the struggle of peoples  which we support.General and complete disarmament should be given the first priority on the agenda of the international community because this question is intrinsically linked with the continued existence of the human race and life on earth.The Syrian Arab Republic welcomed the conclusion by the Soviet Union and the United States of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles in Europe. We urge both those countries to move quickly towards the achievement of the goal of a 50 per cent reduction in strategic offensive missiles  as a giant step on the path to the total liquidation of nuclear arsenals in the world. Despite the set-back constituted by the inability of the General Assembly's third special session devoted to disarmament to achieve the hoped-for results  efforts should continue to be made to convince the nuclear-weapon States to make a solemn declaration not to use or threaten to use their nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States.The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in the world is an essential prerequisite to effective implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Syrian Arab Republic has fully supported the establishment of such zones and has urged the pursuit of efforts to turn the Middle East and other areas of the world into nuclear-weapon-free zones  as well as the taking of appropriate international measures for doing that. The nuclearization of Israel certainly undermines all the efforts to ensure the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. That objective cannot be attained unless Israel is compelled to submit to United Nations resolutions which demand that it adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and place all its nuclear facilities under the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency.Still on the issue of nuclear armaments  Israel's release of a military satellite would stimulate a new arms race in the region  which would expose it and the world to further dangers.The economic crises and social and political tensions witnessed in the world during the past few years should lead the industrialized countries to acknowledge that it is no longer possible to maintain a one-way system of prosperity and growth at a time when the peoples of the world aspire to establish international economic relations based on equal co-operation  mutual trust and common interests. The problems of the staggering  indeed astronomical  debt burden from which most developing countries of the world are suffering  the increase in already high interest rates  the decrease in the prices of commodities and the growing tendency of the industrialized countries to practice protectionism cannot be solved without the establishment of a just economic world order. The interdependence of international economic relations  despite differences in social and economic systems  requires that all countries co-operate in attempting to solve these international economic problems. There is no doubt that a serious resumption of the North-South dialogue would greatly contribute to providing a better climate and conditions for accelerating the process of development  to the benefit of all parties concerned. The important question of the protection of the environment must be addressed. The dumping of industrial and toxic wastes in developing countries poses the gravest dangers to their environment. The international concern over the problems of the environment requires that the General Assembly make joint effort to protect the environment and mankind from the dangerous consequences of these toxic wastes  and that it take the necessary measures to prevent the dumping of such wastes in developing countries.The continued occupation of Namibia is an act of aggression against the Namibian people  who are deprived of their right to self-determination and independence and are subjected daily to barbaric and oppressive practices. We support the efforts made by the Security Council and the Secretary-General to achieve the immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We lend our support also to the struggle of the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  for liberation and self -determination. The racist regime in Pretoria is still relentlessly committing barbaric crimes against the black African majority and is continuing its policy of apartheid  which has been judged by the international community to be a crime against humanity. There is no doubt that the Pretoria regime could not have persisted in challenging the international will had it not been for the support it receives from some - Western countries and its co-operation with Israel in many spheres  in particular the military and the nuclear. We consider it the duty of the international community to intensify its efforts to bring about the total eradication of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic society on the basis of equality and justice in South Africa. The most effective means of eradicating apartheid would be through the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter.As for the situation in Afghanistan  we say again that we welcome the Geneva Agreements reached in April 1988 and we stress the importance of implementing the provisions of those Agreements and of refraining from interfering in the internal affairs of Afghanistan  of preserving its territorial integrity and non-aligned status  and of achieving national reconciliation among its people.The problem of Cyprus  a neighbouring country with which Syria has always throughout history enjoyed friendly relations  still awaits a just solution. We hope that the ongoing contacts between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities will lead to a comprehensive settlement based on United Nations resolutions.We once again renew our support for the efforts being made by the Democratic Republic of Korea to bring about the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula through negotiations and the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea. We also support its call to make the Korean peninsula a zone of peace  free  of nuclear weapons and foreign military bases.In Central America  Nicaragua continues to be subjected to external pressures and interference in its internal affairs. We welcome the efforts made by the Central American states  the Contadora Group and the Support Group for the establishment of a true and lasting peace in Central America that would ensure the independence and sovereignty of all States in the area.The optimism arising from the announcement of a new phase of detente and co-operation in international relations after a period of tension and confrontation is a natural expression of the aspirations of people to solve the intricate problems from which they suffer and of an inclination towards a world in which peace and justice would prevail while injustice  oppression and aggression would disappear. Fulfilment of those great aspirations is not easy to achieve  but they are legitimate aspirations which could be satisfied if good intention and political will were to prevail. We hope that action will be taken to translate them into a tangible reality."
"134",6692,"TCD",43,1988,"ï»¿The delegation of Chad wishes to join previous speakers in expressing to Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina our most sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. The delegation of Chad is doubly pleased that he was elected; because of his wide experience in international relations  and  in particular  because  as Minister for External Relations of his country  he has shown his competence and diplomatic skill. My delegation is also pleased at the excellent relations that exist  very fortunately  between his beautiful country and Chad. The confidence of the international community has been placed in his country and in biro personally and I have no doubt that the work of this session of the General Assembly will be conducted tactfully ably and affectively. We can be assured of the whole-hearted co-operation of my delegation in the fulfilment of his heavy responsibilities.1 should also like to extend the thanks of my delegation to his predecessor Mr. Peter Florin who showed a great spirit of compromise in guiding the work of the forty-second session.Finally  my delegation wishes to pay a special and well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General Mr. Javier Peires de Cuellar for his tireless efforts in the service of peace and for the promotion of development.On 26 June 1945  when the founding fathers of the United Nations signed the United Nations Charter  their objectives  which were clearly defined in Article 1 were  in essence  peace and development.On 25 May 1963  the Heads of State and Government of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) followed that example by enshrining the same principles in the Addis Ababa charter.The combination of these peace ideals would normally have averted the disasters that our States have known  through irresponsible behaviour or because of the pursuit of immediate  selfish interests.Despite the fact that differences of view persist within the international community  in 1988 there has been a new development in international relations; a wind of peace can be felt here and there. If this trend continues  our world will experience a new era of the detente that had disappeared from the international scene in recent years. The new approach in relations between Chad and Libya is part of this new era. Representatives will recall the years of suffering that the people of Chad have known  the verbal and military battles that have characterized the relationship between two countries which history and geography have condemned to live side by side  which age-old relations as neighbours and brothers have united  and which should have known only relations of good-neighbourliness and co-operation as enshrined in the United Nations Charter and the charter of the OAU. The members are aware  Chad bas always shown a spirit of dialogue in trying to find solutions to the dispute between the two countries. This open attitude  which was disregarded for so long  finally met with a favourable response from our Libyan brothers in a statement by Colonel Qaddafi made in Tripoli on 25 May 1988.On this new basis  in its resolution AHG/174 (XXIV)  the OAU accordingly changed the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Chad-Libya dispute by assigning it  in paragraph 5  the following goals: the establishment of a climate of trust and a dynamism for dialogue through a rapprochement between the two parties to the dispute; normalization of relations between the two States  in particular in the political and diplomatic spheres and with regard to co-operation in all fields of common interest; the extension and consolidation of the cease-fire by appropriate means and measures.This process began with the bilateral meetings held at Libreville under the auspices of His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo  President of the Gabonese Republic and Chairman of the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on the Chad-Libya dispute. Friendly Governments also provided quiet mediation  which finally led  on 3 October 1988  to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Chad and the Libyan Arab Jamarahiye.In the joint communiquÃ© issued in this regard  the two countries reaffirmed their firm intention to respect scrupulously the cease-fire of 11 September 1987 and to resolve peacefully their territorial dispute in keeping with the principles of the United Nations and the OAU Charters and in accordance with resolution AHG/17Ã (XXIV) adopted at the twenty-fourth OAU Summit  and to co-operate with the OAU Ad Hoc Committee in a spirit of responsibility and understanding.The political will and the constant readiness of the Chadian Government  together with the persevering conciliatory efforts of friendly countries and of the OAU Ad Hoe CommitteeÂ·Â· on the dispute  haveÂ· thus effectively and positively contributed to theÂ· establishment of this new climate of rapprochement and peace between two fraternal States.Hence  on behalf of the Chadian Government and people my delegation would like from this rostrum to express our gratitude to these friendly countries for having spared no effort in bringing Chad and Libya to restore relations and to pay a special tribute to  and sincerely thank. President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo for the truly positive role he played in promoting the peace process. By their deeds they have all greatly assisted the Chadian people  which has always aspired to peace in order to devote itself fully to the struggle for development.We hope that this step will be followed up and strengthened in order to achieve lasting peace. Lastly  I wish to reaffirm that Chad is willing to pursue this new dynamism in order to normalise relations between the two fraternal countries and to provide a just  lasting settlement to our dispute with Libya with regard to the Aouxou Strip  in keeping with the process entered into within the framework of OAU resolution AHQ/17M (XXIV). To that end  my Government reaffirms its sincere co-operation and total support with regard to the tireless and laudable efforts of the OAU Ad Hoe Committee to succeed in its noble mission.The Chadian people profoundly aspires to peace in order the better to devote itself to fighting underdevelopment  which is a real battle for Chad owing to our unfavourable climate and the disastrous consequences of war. To the burden of war are added epidemics  desertification  drought  grasshopper and caterpillar infestations and floods. Those are the scourges from which my country has been suffering in recent years. With regard to the current agricultural season  there is very little chance that the harvest will be good  because the rains that came late were so heavy in August that several regions were flooded. Damages have been quite considerable; 68 816 people were affected  including 10 000 people in N'Djamena  our capital; 67 killed and scoreÂ· wounded; 3 416 cattle were reported Missing; more than 1S8 villages flooded; 20 539 homes destroyed; some 12 417 hectares of farmland completely flooded  something which will have adverse consequences on the harvest.The crops that were spared in the flooding are threatened by locusts. In several areas of the country there is a risk of famine. Even before the rainy season  the torrid heat in March  April and May posed a meningitis epidemic that killed many people  in particular children.These various calamities  together with the ravages of war  have dealt a serious blow to our national economy  which rests on fragile bases  such as cotton as the only export commodity and cattle-rearing that is still poorly managed. With world prices for cotton still low  the State had to do without earnings from exports of fibre  thus creating a serious budgetary deficit.Regarding cattle-rearing  the second mainstay of Chad  which is exposed to every calamity affecting the Sahel region  there is now significant improvement as regards the organisation of stock-breeders  controlling sanitary conditions  managing water facilities and pasture-lands  as well as improved management of livestock exports to neighbouring countries.The control of development factors involves education and health. The Government of the Republic of Chad is aware of this  and it is now seeking way  and means to achieve good health for all by the year 2000. In this regard  health care for mothers and children  first-aid care and prevention are the fundamental elements of our health policy.Education too is a priority for us. Chad  whose infrastructure was destroyed by war  is fully aware of the paramount role played by education in development. Despite our limited means  the Government has decided to breathe new life into the education system before tackling the rebuilding of the infrastructure. As in all other sectors  we have enjoyed significant financial and material assistance from both friendly countries and international organisations - that is to say  our efforts have always been supported by the donors  who have understood our difficulties and have trusted us.In this regard  it is fitting to recall that the November 1982 and December 1985 Geneva conferences on assistance to Chad  under the aegis of the United Nations Development Programme  as well as the sectoral follow-up meetings of December 1987 and February 198Ã  have made it possible for Chad to move from the rehabilitation stage to the reconstruction stage  and  hence  to contemplate development within the framework of our interim development plan. In the same context  and in keeping with General Assembly resolution 42/200  adopted on 11 December 1967  the Chadian Government will organise  on 14  15 and 16 December 1988  together with the United Nations Development Programme  a round-table meeting of donors for assistance in rehabilitation  recovery and reconstruction of the northern region of Chad  the Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti  which has been ravaged by war and natural disasters. On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Chad  I wish to invite members of the international community to participate actively and in large numbers in that round-table meeting to reconstruct that important area of the country. Chad  which has already enjoyed valuable assistance from the international community in the rehabilitation phase  knows that it can rely on its friends and partners.1 should also like to express sincere thanks to the friendly countries and other donors and to say how grateful we are to them. In emergency situations and in the financing of our reconstruction and development projects  their assistance and development loans were of great help. We shall always be most grateful to them.Despite the fact that the international economic situation is not very propitious and despite the Increasing deterioration of the terms of trade  Chad continues to hope for a better future  if the laws of the market stop responding to speculation and reflect only the true elements oÂ£ appreciation  real supply and real demand. This approach would doubtless help us to correct the fluctuations in commodity prices and to guarantee stable earnings for the developing countries. That too is a laudable effort that developed countries should make in addition to the assistance they have given to the third world. That would enable the developing countries to achieve real growth  which would doubtless help them in their development.The international economic situation is certainly a subject of serious concern. If we consider that the economic environment has improved somewhat  with  in particular  increased growth in the industrialised countries  there are still serious imbalances which hamper the chances of any recovery for most of the developing countries.Prospects are still grim for the countries of Africa  Asia and Latin America  whose future is seriously threatened by reason of the huge debt burden  instability and the low prices for commodities  which are their main resources. Despite the increasing cyclical difficulties and an unfavourable external environment  these countries have become net exporters of capital to the developed countries and international financial institutions. There is therefore a basic and urgent need for Governments - not out of humanism but in the light of their increased interdependence and in the best interests of all - to seek joint  just and lasting solutions to bridge the gulf between rich and poor.Despite the special attention that we were given two years ago by the adoption of the United Nations Programme of Action  Africa is still a continent that has been bypassed by development because of the combined effect of certain negative factors. Despite the heavy sacrifices that our countries have made to adjust our economies  the results we had hoped for in carrying out the terms of this contract have not lived up to the expectations we had based in this programme. Quite the contrary  living standards have dropped and poverty has increased its stranglehold  thereby causing serious political risks.Nevertheless  in the light of the recommendations of the session of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the General Assembly that has just concluded  there is reason once again to hope that Africa's partners will show the necessary political will to honour previous commitments  thereby helping to implement this inspiring common endeavour.In addition to the serious economic difficulties  Africa has suffered natural disasters. Either simultaneously or one after the other  these disasters have undermined every effort  systematically threatening the progress made  and wiping out any assets. I am referring to the drought of recent years  the floods and the plagues of insects. Thus  in some parts of the continent  rain  which is generally considered to be a gift from heaven  a divine blessing  particularly at a time when drought had taken such a heavy toll  has turned out to be a real nightmare for the people. The rainfall has  in fact had serious consequences at the human  material  economic and social level  and has had profound negative effects  even for crops.With regard to the States members of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS)  a combination of natural factors and factors that relate to the international economic environment has sorely tested their economies and hindered their development efforts. However  our countries are determined to work together in order to be better able to meet these challenges. Indeed  as His Excellency  President Al-Hadj Hissein Habre  the current Chairman of the CILSS  said: ""Drought should not be considered as a recurrent image of some incurable  fatal disease  but as an ongoing effort  a united struggle and a collective determination to overcome.""I should like to take this opportunity to address  on behalf of His Excellency Al-Hadj Hissein Habre  the current Chairman of CILSS  our gratitude to the countries and to the international and non-governmental organisations that have continued to give their warm and constant support to our efforts  both individual and collective. But the battle is not over and we are still threatened  particularly as regards agriculture and food.In keeping with the spirit and letter of the Plan of Action and the Final Act of Lagos  the countries of the subregion are committed actively to continuing their dynamic co-operation in the various special agencies such as the Commission of the Lake Chad Basin  the Niger Basin Authority  the Customs Union of States of Central Africa  which held its various meetings in Ndjamena in December 1987 and January 1988. However laudable and generous it is  the goodwill underlying these enterprises is not enough to enable us to make great strides in this regard.The Government of the Republic of Chad has followed with interest and encouragement the development of the international political situation  which has been marked by favourable prospects for resolving conflicts that represent a dangerous threat to peace in certain parts of our world. Appreciable progress has certainly been made here and there  thanks to the tireless efforts put forth by our Organization  particularly by our dynamic Secretary-General  with the effective support of the international community. The positive developments in the situation in Afghanistan and the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq are certainly specific and encouraging examples of this fact.My delegation welcomes the conclusion of the Geneva agreements on Afghanistan  and we hope that they will be respected and carried out in total so peace may be restored to that country. The many refugees will then be able to go back to their country and the Afghan people will be able to get down to the work of their future in full freedom. I have no doubt that many of will come to look upon the year 1988 aÂ· marking a positive turning-point in the deadly conflict between Iran and Iraq. The cease-fire of 20 August 1988 reflects the patient and persevering efforts made by the Organisation and by peace-loving countries. My Government sincerely supports those outstanding initiatives designed to bring about the effective and speedy implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) in order to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflict. To that end  my delegation urges Iran and Iraq to achieve peace through continued dialogue.Since no solution to it has been found  the General Assembly will once again this year consider the question of Kampuchea. Indeed  notwithstanding the efforts made by the international community in keeping with the provisions of relevant United Nations resolutions  no solution to that question has been found that will enable the Kampuchean people to exercise their right to self-determination free from any outside interference. My delegation hopes that the recent initiatives taken by the countries in the region will assist in finding a just and lasting solution to that question  which continues to be of concern to the international community. Chad supports  there and elsewhere  any effort designed to lead to a peaceful and definitive solution to the question. That is also the position of the delegation of Chad with regard to the Korean peninsula and Cyprus.Although there are glimmers of hope on the horizon with regard to some situations of concern to the international community  it is regrettable to note the lack of progress with regard to the Middle East  that other burning hotbed of tension and concern  the core of which remains the Palestinian problem. The deterioration of the situation in the occupied territories is becoming increasingly disturbing and dominates events in that part of the world. Chad  for its part  has always supported the cause of the Palestinian people  as was made clear in the statement made at the most recent summit conference in Kuwait by His Excellency Al-Hadj Hissein Habre  President of Chad  when he said:""The Republic of Chad expressesÂ· its solidarity with the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people and  accordingly  we support the idea of an international conference under the auspiceÂ· of the United Nation.""In Central America the delegation of Chad believes that the efforts of the countries of the region to achieve peace and co-operation should be encouraged for the benefit of the peoples in that part of our globe.Apart from its ecological  economic and debt problems  Africa is also faced with political problems and conflicts that are of constant concern. I refer essentially to the painful and intolerable problems in southern Africa in general and the fate of the Namibian people in particular  problems that continue to figure prominently on the Assembly's agenda. Indeed  a tragic situation continues to exist in that part of Africa  despite international public opinion. The vile racist regime in Pretoria is obstinately continuing to strengthen the odious system of apartheid  thereby denying the fundamental rights of the black majority. Whereas the international community has on many occasions reaffirmed that the elimination of the horrendous system of apartheid in South Africa and the independence of Namibia are its chief priorities  it has so far done so too little effect  for the anachronistic Power continues to resist and to prevent the rapid realisation of the unshakeable will of the civilised world.My delegation is therefore indignant to note the continuation of that grim situation end the perpetration of crimes against the majority. We therefore hope that peace-loving and justice-loving countries and the whole of the international community will bring to bear the absolutely indispensable pressures  both political and economic  needed to bring about the abolition of that barbaric crime against humanity and to bring about the realisation of a multiracial and egalitarian society in South Africa.With regard to the fate of the Namibian people  deprived of their right to independence and plundered by racist South Africa for so many years  my delegation places hope in the recent contacts and ongoing initiatives as a way to the speedy implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1987) calling for an independent and sovereign Namibia under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO)  its sole and authentic representative.Racist South Africa must also cease its destabilising activities and acts of aggression against neighbouring countries.Turning to Western Sahara  Chad encourages the efforts being made by the United Nations Secretary-General and the current Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to find an honourable and lasting solution.I cannot conclude my statement without conveying congratulations to the United Nations peace-keeping forces that have just been awarded the Nobel Peace Prise. In so doing  the Nobel Committee has reminded the entire world of the values we should attach to peace. Peace is essential and indispensable for each of us  whether individuals or States. Peace creates trust. Peace leads to security. Peace and security are inextricably linked and are  we feel  a guarantee for promoting development. Peace is  in and of itself  the bearer of hope and happiness. Peace is  as someone has quite rightly said  man's future. The atmosphere of peace  so indispensable  so sought after and so desired  is beginning to prevail here and there in our planet. My delegation hopes that the peace process that has been begun will continue without any let-up and that it will also extend to the peoples of Chad and Libya. Chad  as President Al-Hadj Hissein Habre so well stated in his statement at the twenty-fourth summit meeting of the OAU  ""profoundly aspires to peace. It is prepared to promote all conditionÂ· to that end. However  we  like other peoples  are deeply attached to our freedom  independence and sovereignty and to the integrity of our territory. Our only ambition is to enjoy  on that basis  the most cordial relations with all our neighbours. We sincerely believe that that is in line with the higher interest of our peoples and with the dignity and credibility of Africa.""Thus  once again  we should like to take this opportunity to address the Assembly to express the hope that the international community will effectively support the efforts of the Ad Hoc Committee of the OAU and peace-loving and justice-loving countries to bring about a peaceful and definitive solution to the territorial dispute between Chad and Libya  respecting the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State  in order to establish and develop a climate of good-neighbourliness and fraternal co-operation. "
"135",6738,"TGO",43,1988,"ï»¿I should like first of all to express the warmest congratulations of the delegation of Ito go to Mr  Dante Caputo on his election as President of this forty-third session of the General Assembly. That choice is certainly justified by his well-known diplomatic qualities and the firm devotion of his country Argentina  to the service of the noble ideals of the United Nations and the values of solidarity among peoples. These are all virtues aid assets that make it possible for us to predict success for the work that will take place under his presidency.Throughout the forty-second session of the General Assembly his illustrious predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic republic  demonstrated tact and competence in successfully guiding the work of the Assembly. My delegation would like once again to express to him its warm appreciation and esteem.My delegation would like also to congratulate very warmly the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  on the pragmatic and efficient way in which he continues to serve our Organization. I should like particularly to hail his constant efforts to increase the Organisation's capacity for action and to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes and the application of the United Nations Programme for the Economic Recovery and Development of Africa. I should like to assure him once again of the constant support of ray country in his work in carrying out his difficult and delicate responsibilities.	.The Nobel Prize  which has just been awarded to the United Nations Peace-keeping Forces  rightly honours the courage and devotion of the thousands of men and women mobilized in our common name to assure peace in the trouble spots of the world. This gesture of the Nobel Prize Committer honours before world public opinion the crucial role played by these forces in maintaining peace. Through me  my country  Togo  wishes warmly to congratulate them.The forty-third session of the General Assembly is taking place in an international climate characterized by both legitimate hops and grave concern. The hope arises from the will of the two greatest Powers to reduce and progressively eliminate the threat of war  particularly nuclear war  and to settle peacefully the conflicts still tearing apart certain regions of the world.Of course there are grave concerns as well as to the ways and means of overcoming the grave crisis which continues to shake the economies of the countries of the third world. It is time to launch international economic co-operation on a healthy and more equitable basis.We should like to express our sadness at the failure of the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament. Here and there rays of light do appear among the storm clouds  which in some areas of the globe seemed to make impossible any hope of peace. The will to undertake a dialogue which has finally been shown in those areas is indeed a miracle. Certainly there has always been a shorter  less painful way to succeed in bringing men to work together on a more equal basis  even if they have not loved each other as brothers. Thus one must ask  is it really necessary that losses of human life and human suffering must lead us to the very brink of exhaustion so that there can be recognition and acceptance  finally  of the basic truth of history that force is only dissuasion if it is not reason?Togo has always proclaimed its faith in the virtues of peace. It appreciates its benefits and has done so for almost a quarter of a century of political sterility. We would like to reaffirm here  in this year of the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  that the links between peace and human rights are indissoluble. That peace  which should underlie any development effort  constitutes the corner-stone of equilibrium in our respective societies and should be assured on the regional level by the implementation by each State of a policy of good-neighbourliness and peaceful coexistence and through the abolition of terrorism  particularly that clandestinely engaged in by States for the purpose of destabilizing their neighbours and thus diverting efforts from the only struggle that deserves to be waged - that for the social and economic development of our peoples. The search for peace should resolutely avoid all temptations of pressure or blackmail by terrorism  which sows grief and imperils progress and security for our populations.In our interdependent world  military victories are only intermediate stages which do not bring any definitive solutions to the problems of relations among States. We have to discuss  negotiate and understand each other. There is no alternative. Thus we hail with relief the establishment of the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq. This is a result of the efforts constantly and tirelessly made by the Secretary-General to ensure that the region of the Gulf and its peoples  afflicted by eight years of cruel war  can finally rediscover the benefits of peace.In Western Sahara peace efforts are being given a great impetus and a better chance  undoubtedly because of the need for integration that necessarily brings together the Maghreb States. This conflict  which has seriously and sorely tested bilateral relations in the region and significantly disturbed the evolution of the Organization of African Unity  will soon find its culmination in the referendum which will make it possible for the Sahraoui people freely to express themselves on their future and thus exercise their right to self-determination. The tensions which have disturbed relations between Chad and Libya are finally entering a phase of detente. Ito go  which follows with great interest this evolution  is pleased with the reaffirmed will of those two countries to seek peaceful means to solve their differences. We urge them to work towards the normalization of their relations so that a new era of good-neighbourliness and fraternal co-operation may open up for their respective populations.As for Namibia  after decades of hard struggle and intense efforts  it is now moving towards the application of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which stipulated the conditions for the achievement of its independence. It is to be hoped that the dialogue developing within the framework of negotiations between Angola  South Africa  Cuba and the United States will culminate in a just and true peace in that part of our continent. The agreements on Afghanistan reached in Geneva last March are a decisive contribution to the peace process in that region. Those agreements are based on the Afghan people's right - finally recognized - to choose  without any foreign interference  the political economic and social system they regard as being in conformity with their aspirations.The edifice of peace is being built also in Central America. We pay a tribute here to the five Heads of State of the region  who  by reaffirming their commitment to honour all the obligations resulting from the Esquipulas II agreement  have greatly increased the chances for peace in Central America. The international community should promote and encourage these efforts in order to achieve the hoped-for results.In Kampuchea the Kampuchean people should be enabled quickly to exercise the right to self-determination which they have been denied for a long time because of the invasion and occupation of their territory by foreign forces. My country  which has always supported the just liberation struggle of the Kampuchean people has taken note of the Vietnamese Government's intention to withdraw 50 000 soldiers. Of course  only the withdrawal of all the foreign troops will make it possible to find a final solution to this painful problem.In the Korean peninsula  the willingness of the two Governments  of the North and of the South  to engage in dialogue seems to be gradually taking hold and broadening. Togo supports the idea of the peaceful reunification of the two territorial entities and believes that the implementation of the three-point plan proposed by North Korea should be negotiated in the context of sincere and fraternal harmonization of views  taking due account of the free will of the Korean people as a whole.These harbingers of peace that are springing up here and there go hand in hand  unfortunately  with serious uncertainty  which makes it necessary for us to marshal our will and focus our efforts on methods that are worthy of our times and that can deal with the misery of millions of men and women who are still excluded from the community of free and sovereign peoples. That is true of the black majority in South African  which endures every day the suffering and humiliation caused by apartheid.In fact  the leaders in Pretoria  deaf to all the protests by public opinion  are obstinately perpetuating the practice of apartheid  this socio-political system that is inevitably condemned to disappear. Banning or assassinating anti-apartheid militants  prolonging the state of emergency without any reason to do so cannot stop the historic march of the black people towards their freedom.With regard to the Palestinian tragedy  Togo shares the concern about the situation in the occupied territories. The Palestinian people's right to a country and respect for the sovereignty of States are principles on which the settlement of this conflict should be based. My country advocates the idea of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations in which all the parties concerned would participate  including  of course  the Palestine Liberation Organisation.The third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament should have been a milestone in the long history of the efforts to maintain and strengthen international peace and security. Unfortunately the hopes aroused by the progress achieved since the first special session and by the recent positive developments concerning disarmament did not take concrete form in the re-launching of the process of general and complete disarmament. This special session  which adjourned without the slightest consensus  could well have aroused doubts about our Organization's ability to encourage and strengthen the multilateral approach to disarmament. Nevertheless  this failure should not overshadow the remarkable efforts made by the two great Powers  the United States and the Soviet Union  gradually to eliminate the threats of war  particularly nuclear war.The ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles has given concrete form to the two great Powers will for peace and true disarmament. At the same time  it has the advantage of opening the path to more numerous and more audacious initiatives. Hence  it is in everyone's interest that the two great Powers tirelessly pursue their negotiations to reach agreement on a reduction by 50 per cent in their strategic nuclear arsenals and their conventional forces in Europe.	The international economic situation  which has for almost two decades been in a state of general stagnation  remains disquieting.The uncertainty about world economic growth is even greater for the developing countries  and particularly for sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed  according to forecasts  real income of the countries of that region and the least-developed countries as a whole will increase by 2.5 per cent  and there will be no growth in per capita revenue  or even negative growth  during the period from 1987 to 1995.In addition to being contrary to the basic principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  the protectionist measures taken by the developed countries are preventing the developing countries from participating fairly in international commercial exchanges. Nevertheless  we must hope that the new round of multilateral trade negotiations under way in Uruguay will open the path to a considerable reduction in and the gradual elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers.It is true that the recovery of the world economy requires both concerted international action and the individual efforts of States. But it is even more true that the Draconian measures of structural adjustment imposed on the developing countries have a very high economic  social and political cost. They reduce the rate of development of those countries' economies. Because of the lack of provisions for increasing the prices of raw materials or reducing the excessive debt burden  our countries' economies are the greatest victims of the infernal process of increasing indebtedness  the continuing deterioration in the terms of trade and the reverse transfer of capital.In those circumstances  the determinations of the developing countries to put into effect coherent economic and social policies comes up against external constraints linked to the iniquitous and imbalanced international economic system. The measures for structural adjustment  in their present form  should be reviewed in order to enable our States to keep their foreign commitments and continue internal development. While the global figure for the debt of the Ñ developing countries has been constantly increasing - indeed today it amounts to more than $1 trillion - the controlled price index of the principal non-petroleum commodities exported by those countries has increased by an average of almost 5 per cent since 1980  and the reversal in the net transfer of resources caused them to lose more than $30 billion in 1986.The constant decrease in the available financial resources is a major obstacle to the third-world countries' efforts to ensure the recovery of their economies and development. We know that more than two thirds of those countries receive more than half of their export income from the sale of commodities. Hence  the international community must put into effect measures that can stabilize and fix the prices of raw materials at remunerative levels. It must also adopt a new international strategy for development based on greater justice and equity and providing for the harmonious growth of the world economy. That new strategy should envisage urgent and appropriate solutions to the questions of foreign debt and the constant decrease in the financial resources of the developing countries  in particular by a substantial alleviation of the debt  and even the cancellation of entire portions of it.In regard particularly to Africa  it is encouraging to note the increasing interest of our Organization in the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. That interest is clear particularly from two initiatives taken by the General Assembly at its forty-second session - that is  on the one hand  the decision to establish an Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the Assembly as the most appropriate mechanism to prepare the review and the appraisal of the Programme of Action and  on the other hand  the request made to the Secretary-General to submit to the forty-third session of the Assembly concrete recommendations for a speedy and full implementation of that Programme. We must however note with regret that the results hoped for during the meeting of the Committee of the Whole have not been attained. By establishing an advisory group on financial flows for Africa the Secretary-General has acted upon his intention to give priority to that continent's economic problems and to seek ways and means to hasten implementation of the Programme of Action. In this connection  we must see to it that new financial flows are carefully channelled  at both the bilateral and the multilateral level. Therefore United Nations bodies concerned with development should have access to additional resources enabling them to participate actively in the implementation of the Programme of Action  among other things by devising and putting in place projects specifically designed for sub-Saharan Africa.In fulfilment of their commitments  African States have undertaken major reforms to secure economic recovery and development  and it is therefore important that the international community to live up to its agreement to participate in implementing the Programme by providing Africa with all the assistance it needs.At a time when African leaders are tackling with courage and determination the economic and social recovery of their continent  it is especially revolting to see the various wicked attempts by some in the industrial and business circles of the North to turn Africa into a dumping ground lot nuclear and industrial wastes  thus gravely harming the health of our peoples and our environment. These operations are motivated by a cynical desire to exploit the current economic and financial difficulties of our countries. In the face of this grave threat to African interests  the Heads of State of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) unanimously adopted last May a resolution firmly denouncing and condemning the scandal of toxic wastes and undertaking to take the measures necessary to prevent the dumping of these wastes on African soil. In that same spirit  the eleventh conference of Heads of State or Government of the Economic Community of West African States adopted a resolution by which it was decided to enact laws in all 16 member countries making it a crime for any person  group of persons  business or organization to participate in any act involving the stockpiling of nuclear or industrial wastes. To spare our continent the torment of the irreversible deterioration of its environment  we call upon the International community  and especially the industrialized countries  to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to prevent the export of toxic wastes to our countries.This session coincides with the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and we must therefore vigorously reaffirm our total commitment to the humanitarian values that are indispensable in containing mankind's destructive impulses and suicidal passions.The favourable developments that have taken place in regions long torn apart by hatred and violence reassure us of the usefulness of our Organization and its authority in the sphere of the management and settlement of international affairs. In the light of these developments  we must not stand idly by  but participate in useful activities to ensure that frontiers be no longer barriers between peoples but open doors through which they can pass to meet  join together and ensure that the weakness of certain countries  instead of being a pretext for shameful exploitation  becomes an opportunity for sharing and solidarity."
"136",6784,"THA",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of the delegation of Thailand  and on my own behalf  I should like to convey to Mr. Dante Caputo our warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. As relations between Argentina and Thailand have been and continue to be very close  his election to his high office is a source of gratification for my country. We are confident that his great wisdom  vast experience and proven diplomatic ability will ensure that the Assembly will conduct its work in an effective manner  leading to the fruitful conclusion of this important session.I should also like to pay a tribute to His Excellency Mr. Peter Florin  President of the Assembly at its forty-second session  for the skilful and able manner in which he performed his tasks during his tenure.During the forty-first session of the General Assembly  in 1986  I stood at this rostrum and voiced my deep concern about problems and conflicts around the world. I said then with deep regret that it was hard to remain an optimist. I declared that we needed a new world order of peace and justice within which all nations could co-operate peacefully with one another and live in harmony. But today  two years after my somewhat pessimistic observation  the world appears to be a different place. In contrast to 1986 it is now easier for me to be an optimist. This year  1983  has marked a new and more encouraging trend in international relations  a trend towards peace and accommodationÂ·  a trend towards co-operation and even consensus among the permanent members of the Security CouncilÂ·  a trend towards a world in which peaceful relations between States is no longer an abstract dream but is gradually becoming a part of reality. My Government welcomes these new trends and this new momentum with enthusiasm.It is apparent to all that this momentum owes a great deal to the success of multilateral diplomacy. It owes a great deal to the dedication  perseverance and tireless efforts of the United Nations and its able Secretary-General.Thailand's faith in the United Nations has never been shaken. Over the years  even during less optimistic times  commitment to the United Nations has always been a cornerstone of Thailand's foreign policy. Now  with seemingly increased political will for accommodation and peace around the world  the United Nations chances for success in achieving its noble tasks have become greater.Events of recent months testify to the enhanced value and effectiveness of the United Nations when it is able to function in an environment of international accommodation between the super-Powers and of closer co-operation among the permanent members of the Security Council. The Afghan peace accords bring closer to reality the total withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan and the exercise by the Afghan people of their right to self-determination  as has been called for by successive General Assembly resolutions. The cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war offers renewed hope for peace in the Persian Gulf. Recent talks between the two Cypriot communities provide the basis for lasting peace and stability on that island. The acceptance by Morocco and the POLISARIO Front of the Secretary-General's peace plan could bring to an end the conflict in Western Sahara. The recent breakthrough in the Namibian question offers hope for the attainment of self-determination and Independence by the Namibian people.My delegation hopes that the breakthrough with regard to the Namibian question will have a spill-over effect on the prospects for the realization of peace and justice in the southern African region. We hope that this breakthrough will mark the beginning of the end of South Africa's apartheid system. Peace and justice in southern Africa will be possible only after the eradication of apartheid.It is expected that progress towards peace in the Persian Gulf and in other regions of the world will help revitalize the peace process in the Middle East. For a permanent peace in the Middle East to become a reality  the question of Palestine must be resolved. It must be resolved in such a way as to take into consideration the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people as well as the legitimate security concerns of all States in the region. My delegation hopes that all these encouraging trends towards peace and harmony in the various regions of the world will gain momentum in the days and months ahead.On the question of Kampuchea  this year also witnessed some movement towards a comprehensive political settlement of the problem. The most recent development was the Jakarta Informal Meeting held in Indonesia in July this year. It brought together for the first time the conflicting parties  including Viet Nam  the occupying Power. Representatives of other countries concerned in the region were also present.However  in spite of those new developments  many obstacles still remain. The main objectives of the United Nations concerning Kampuchea  as reflected in repeated United Nations resolutions on the subject  remain implemented. As we meet here today  Vietnamese troops remain in Kampuchea. The restoration and preservation of Kampuchea's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity has yet to be achieved. The Kampucheans have not been allowed to exercise their right to self-determination.Thailand and the other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) would like to see a comprehensive political settlement of the Kampuchean problem as soon as possible. Ito this end  we are again submitting a draft resolution on the item ""The situation in Kampuchea""  in which we have included elements which we believe are necessary components of such a comprehensive political settlement. We believe that it is a fair and balanced draft resolution worthy of the full support of the members of the Assembly.A first step in this process is the total withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Kampuchea. There must also be an effective international presence  perhaps including peace-keeping forces  to ensure the withdrawal of foreign forces and to help maintain law and order in Kampuchea. We also envisage the formation of an interim administering authority to oversee the transition period and to prepare for free elections  which we hope will lead to true national reconciliation among the Kampuchean people. We remain hopeful that the future Kampuchean nation will be neutral  independent and non-aligned  posing no threat to any of its neighbours. My delegation would like to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to the President of the International Conference on Kampucheaâ Mr. Leopold Gratz  for his continuing effort towards finding a lasting political solution to the Kampuchean problem.My delegation would also like to express its deep appreciation of the continuous efforts of the Secretary-General to find a lasting political solution to the Kampuchean problem. We hope that the international community will give the necessary support and encouragement in this another important mission for peace undertaken by the Secretary-General.	In East Asia  my delegation maintains a deep interest in the Korean question. Thailand supports the proposal for detente between North and South Korea and my delegation hopes that both Koreas  through dialogues and political settlement  can realize their aspirations for eventual peaceful reunification.The refugee problem in South-East Asia remains one of the most tragic consequences of the Indo-Chinese conflicts. With each passing year  the refugee problem has become increasingly complicated. Instead of genuine refugees  we have seen systematic migration of those seeking a better life. The alarming upsurge in boat arrivals from Viet Nam in 1987 and early 1988 and the unresolved dilemma of ""long-stayers"" warrant a more innovative and effective strategy to deal with this problem. When I met my ASEAN colleagues in Bangkok this past summer we called for the convening of a new international conference on Indo-Chinese refugees  under the auspices of the Secretary-General  by early 1989. Such a conference would provide an appropriate forum in which to set out such strategies. In this regard  the United Nations  in particular the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  should play a central role in persuading all concerned to participate in the common effort to meet this great and sad challenge to humanity.On the question of disarmament; there is no doubt in anyoneâs mind that genuine  symmetrical and verifiable arms limitation leading to general and complete disarmament is the means to achieve international peace  harmony and security. My delegation therefore welcomes the recent success in bilateral discussions and negotiations between the two super-Powers with a view to implementing a 50 per cent reduction of strategic weapons. My delegation also welcomes the ratification by the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Social is t Republics of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles. Those two events give a powerful momentum to the efforts to achieve general and complete disarmament. My delegation is hopeful that this momentum will provide a significant impetus to further progress in the multilateral disarmament process.In our interdependent world  bilateral diplomacy must be complemented by multilateral diplomacy  and vice versa. My delegation therefore firmly supports United Nations efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons and all weapons oÂ£ mass destruction. Although no immediate breakthrough was accomplished  the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament served a useful purpose. It brought the members of the international community together and focused their attention on disarmament. During the session extensive exchanges of views took place. Those exchanges will undoubtedly serve as building blocks for the future. In addressing ourselves to the question of general and complete disarmament we must always be mindful that this includes chemical and biological as well as conventional weapons. Thailand supports the tireless efforts of the United Nations and the members of the international community to reach a verifiable agreement to control and eliminate chemical weapons. In regard to the question of disarmament in general  Thailand has always been concerned about the diversion of financial  material and human resources from development and welfare to armaments. My delegation therefore welcomes the growing recognition of the linkage between disarmament and development. We are encouraged by the success of the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development.Another serious problem for mankind is that of narcotic drugs. Thailand has always been in the forefront in the global war against narcotic drugs. Drug abuse is destructive to our generation  and will be to future ones as well. The United Rations campaign against illicit drugs must be strengthened and sustained. To fight this global menace we need to act decisively and in a concerted way. We need an increased world-wide commitment and co-ordination within the United Nations framework to combat the international drug problem.Let us turn our attention to the question of human rights. A new world order of peace and justice cannot come about without universal respect for human rights. Indeed  faith in fundamental human rights is a corner-stone and a guiding principle of the United Nations. Lessons of history have shown us that disregard for human rights and fundamental freedoms has always been a major cause of international tension and conflict. As we mark the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this year  let us reaffirm our commitment to honour all the provisions of the Declaration.Turning to the subject of economic development  I cannot hide the fact that Thailand's economic growth rate of 7.1 per cent for the year 1986 to 1987 and expected rate of 8 per cent for this year are a source of gratification to my delegation. Although we are becoming increasingly industrialized  Thailand remains overall an agricultural society. The livelihood of approximately 80 per cent of Thailand's population depends on agriculture. Thailand's economic progress owes a great deal to the existence of a stable form of government  a sizeable domestic market and efficient economic measures as well as the endowment of a skilled and semi-skilled labour force. It also owes a lot to the practice of forward-looking planning. In all  hard work and responsible behaviour have contributed substantially to Thailand's economic success. It is hard-earned and indigenous.Thailand remains concerned with rising protectionist measures. The existence of trade barriers  farm subsidies and other support programmes in developed countries has adversely affected the export earnings of developing countries and the well-being of their peoples. That directly hurts Thailand  the majority of whose population is dependent on agricultural earnings. We join the world community in urging those countries to reverse these protectionist trends. In this connection  Thailand attaches great importance to the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations  which should bring liberalization of and better discipline in the world trade system.On agriculture in particular  Thailand  along with other free-agricultural trade advocates  especially the Cairns Group countries  is seeking comprehensive reform through liberalization. We also look forward to seeing tangible progress in negotiations on this important issue by the mid-term review at Montreal this December.On the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990  my delegation feels that it is important for the countries in Africa to pursue and deepen their reform processes. Moreover  the international community should try to mobilize additional resources to assist African countries during the remaining term of the Programme of Action. Thailand  for its part  will continue to do its best to facilitate the comprehensive implementation of the Programme of Action. The awarding of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is another reflection of international recognition of the valuable contribution by the United Nations to the maintenance of international peace and security. I should like to pay a warm tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. His tireless efforts to ensure world peace and justice have clearly borne fruit. We have our full support in the continued performance of his noble and difficult task. I once again salute him and the able members of the United Nations Secretariat for their hard work and dedication.Having reviewed the recent developments around the world  I can conclude that the general outlook is encouraging. It does seem that there is increased momentum towards a new world order of peace and justice. We must work hard together to keep this momentum alive. Each and every one of us must do what we can to contribute to the cause of world peace  justice and progress."
"137",6900,"TTO",43,1988,"ï»¿it is indeed a pleasure and an honour for me to convey to Mr. Dante Caputo  on behalf of the Government and people of Trinidad and Tobago  our sincere congratulations on his election as President of this forty-third session of the General Assembly. In the light of the political and diplomatic experience which he brings to this office  we are assured that the deliberations of the Assembly will be conducted in a manner that will redound to the credit of his own country  Argentina  as well as to our region of Latin America and the Caribbean.It is also with considerable pleasure that I commend his predecessor Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic  for the efficient manner in which he per sided over the forty-second session of the General Assembly and the third special session of the Assembly devoted to disarmament.Trinidad and Tobago fully shares the view which the President of the Assembly recently expressed on the role of the United Nations as an instrument of survival for the small and medium-sized countries of the world. For that reason  we attach a very special significance to our member ship in the United Nations. We remain firmly committed to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Indeed  we steadfastly believe in the sovereign equality of all States  in the peaceful settlement of international disputes  in respect for human rights  and in international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural or humanitarian character. We acknowledge that the Organization has not always lived up to the expectations which we harboured when Trinidad and Tobago joined the United Nations 25 years ago. Its role  clearly identified by the founding fathers in 1945  as the guardian of international peace and security and as the conscience of mankind has not always been fulfilled.However  there Is a mood of optimism which suggests that 1938 may well be recorded as the year in which the international community rediscovered the potential of the United Nations for solving seemingly intractable problems. The recent award of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces bears ample testimony to this resurgence of faith in the ability of the Organization to achieve its objectives.Trinidad and Tobago salutes the Important contribution made by the super-Powers in lessening international tensions. It also highly commends the work of our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whose Indefatigable efforts in the cause of peace have contributed to  and continue to influence positively  the current international climate.In this regard  I wish to allude to the signing of the Geneva Accords in April  which was achieved through the good offices of our Secretary-General and  in particular  the tireless efforts of Mr. Diego Cordovez  the former Under-Secretary-General for Special Political Affairs. We welcome most whole-heartedly the successful outcome of those negotiations between the United States  the Soviet Onion  Pakistan and Afghanistan  which has now set the stage for the resolution of the situation in Afghanistan. My Government wishes to place on record its appreciation of Mr. Diego Cordovez's services to the cause of international peace and security and to extend to him our congratulations and best wishes on his appointment as Foreign Minister of Ecuador. Lest his efforts be wasted  we urge the parties to the Accords to respect their terms and the spirit in which they have been agreed  so as to facilitate the work of the United Nations Good Offices Mission for Afghanistan.Yet mother event which has given us cause for optimism is the recently concluded cease-fire agreement in the Iraq-Iran war. The Secretary-General is to be complimented on his success in achieving this first step in what is likely to be a long and difficult road to a final settlement. My delegation assures the Secretary-General of its complete support in his efforts to implement Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  and takes the opportunity to urge both parties to do all that is possible to arrive at a permanent peace settlement.Further  in Western Sahara the Secretary-General's mediation efforts  conducted jointly with the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity  aimed at ending the war between the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARSO Front  appear to be bearing fruit. The recent agreement in principle between the disputants on a United Nations peace plan  which provides for a cease-fire  the deployment of United Nations peace-keeping forces and the conducting of a referendum on the future status of the Territory  is most encouraging. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago will continue to support this peace process  which should result in the just and permanent resolution of the Western Sahara conflict.These successes represent signs of encouragement for the peaceful settlement of disputes and generate an element of hope and optimism about the willingness of nations to co-operate in the resolution of their problems. Small States in particular welcome these developments  since invariably such States stand to benefit greatly from an improved international climate. But  while in these instances we have cause to rejoice  the situation elsewhere is far from  comforting. The disturbances in the Israeli-occupied territories have exposed the inevitability of change  as millions of Palestinians continue to be deprived of their basic human rights. We in Trinidad and Tobago strongly support the proposal for an international conference on peace in the Middle East  and feel that the terms of any settlement to emerge from such a conference should include a clear recognition of the right of all States to exist within secure and recognized boundaries  and the guarantee of a homeland for the Palestinian people.The problems posed by the racist regime in Pretoria continue to plague the lives of millions of black people in southern Africa. There the white minority seeks to perpetuate its virtual enslavement of the black majority by banning and imprisoning its leaders  incarcerating children and denying fundamental human rights on the basis of race and colour of skin. For us in Trinidad and Tobago  1 August 1988 brought poignant memories of the inhumanity of slavery  for we commemorated on that day the 150th anniversary of the emancipation of the slaves in the English-speaking Caribbean. As members of the Organization and of the world community  we cannot consider ourselves to have been truly emancipated so long as the black majority in South Africa is enslaved in the name of an absurd and discredited concept of ethnic superiority. For this reason  the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago once more calls upon the international community to bring about a speedy end to the system of apartheid by the imposition of a comprehensive regime of mandatory sanctions Trinidad and Tobago are encouraged by recent indications that implementation of Security Council Resolutions 43S (1978)  on independence for Namibia  may be imminent. However  the international community has too often witnessed the machinations of the Pretoria regime. We therefore view this development with guarded optimism  for we are painfully aware that many details of the process of withdrawal of armed forces from Namibia and preparations for the holding of elections in that Territory are still be to worked out. Many opportunities exist  therefore  for the South Africans to derail the process of implementation at any time. Trinidad and Tobago attaches great importance to the question of Namibia and will be paying close attention to progress in implementing the Security Council decision on the matter. We would like to think that at the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly we shall have the opportunity to join others in supporting the admission of a free and independent Namibia to this world body.Trinidad and Tobago recognizes the limited progress made in respect of the problems related to Kampuchea and Cyprus  and we hope that the new initiatives being taken at the present time by the parties concerned will lead to a peaceful resolution of these outstanding issues.In like manner  ray delegation has noted with some satisfaction that positive efforts are being made by both parties to bring about a settlement of the Korean problem through dialogue and negotiation. It is our fervent wish that this process will result in the resolution of the problem in accordance with the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of the Korean peninsula. Coming nearer to home  my delegation notes with regret that progress towards peace in Central America has slowed down somewhat during the past year. The delegation of Trinidad and Tobago is firmly of the view that the spirit of co-operation that resulted in the Contadora initiatives and  more recently  in the Arias plan and Esquipulas II is a demonstration of the ability of the peoples of Latin America to devise appropriate solutions to their problems. We believe that progress towards peace can be achieved only where mutual trust and understanding prevail. We would therefore urge the countries of the region to work assiduously to create those conditions in their continuing search for a negotiated and lasting solution.In this nuclear age  in which man possesses the capacity to obliterate life and civilization as we know it with his own weapons  the issue of nuclear disarmament will continue to be a major source of concern to all mankind  and rightly so. During the past year action in this critical area of international relations has produced decidedly mixed results.In many respects arms reduction and arms control are a litmus test  not only of bilateral relations between the two major nuclear Powers  but also of the present state of multilateralism. The signing and subsequent ratification of the Treaty between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - were encouraging developments which  it was hoped  would have had beneficial effects on both bilateral and multilateral negotiations on disarmament.Unfortunately  such has not been the case. The initial optimism brought about by the resumption of negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the reduction of their strategic arsenals has waned. Problems concerning verification procedures and differences over ""Star Wars"" testing still exist. In like manner  the high hopes invested in the success of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament ran afoul of unresolved political differences. The States Members of the United Nations failed to agree on the content of a declaration outlining a new programme for global disarmament.It is also a source of deep regret to my Government that  25 years after the signing of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water  the international community has not yet succeeded in reaching agreement on a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We continue to believe that such an agreement could be achieved if the requisite political will were to be displayed. In addition to curbing the qualitative spiral of the arms race  the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago believes that a test-ban treaty would have an incalculably advantageous effect on both bilateral and multilateral disarmament negotiations.Halting and reversing the nuclear-arms race should not prevent us from focusing greater attention on the issue of conventional weapons. These have become more sophisticated  more devastating  and certainly more costly. Their use in the developing regions of the world since the end of the Second World War has brought untold misery  destruction and death. Their procurement has burdened  and continues to burden  too many economies in the developing world.There is increasing awareness today that the accumulation of weapons  nuclear or conventional  does not guarantee security and that greater importance must be attached to social  economic  environmental and other factors that have hitherto been neglected. Is it not paradoxical that  despite this  we continue to squander stupendous amounts of financial  material and human resources on the development and acquisition of armaments?This waste of resources is all the more deplorable when sickness  starvation  malnutrition and deprivation  re still the daily lot of a large percentage of the world's population. It is the firm belief of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago that if only a fraction of the resources frittered away on armaments were to be devoted to developmental activities  it would result in a tangible improvement in the living standards of that vast proportion of humanity whose basic needs for food  shelter and health care remain unfulfilled.Many speakers from this very rostrum have reminded the Assembly of the dismal economic performance of the developing countries. That issue is of particular importance to Trinidad and Tobago  which  like roost other developing countries  is now threatened by rising levels of unemployment  falling export revenues  low commodity prices  and spiralling external debt. It is clear that in this decade the momentum of development achieved in previous decades by the countries of the South has been reversed. A great deal of the regression - and certainly of the stagnation ~ we have endured can be attributed to an international economic system that has not supported our efforts and that  at times  has even been openly hostile.In response  developing countries are now implementing structural-adjustment programmes with the objective of reviving their flagging economies through the rationalization of their economic structure. The individual and collective experiences of our countries have demonstrated that this process of structural adjustment is painful and  at best; difficult. It must be handled sensitively and sensibly so as not to sow the seeds of political and social instability and unnecessary discontent.To be successful ultimately  structural adjustment must be bolstered by a favourable international economic environment. An indispensable component of such an international economic environment is a free and open trading system that offers competitive prices for our products and allows us to exploit whatever comparative advantage we may possess. Trinidad and Tobago therefore looks forward to positive results emanating from the ongoing multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and  in particular  from the ministerial session in December 1988. We hope that the requisite flexibility will be displayed and will result in progress on issues of importance to the developing countries. We share the view that in the negotiations special attention should be given to completing the unfinished work of previous rounds before moving on to net; issues. The international community should take full advantage of this opportunity to restore discipline and equity to the international trading system.It is imperative that there be an increased flow of financial resources to developing countries. Flows of concessional resources in particular  which have stagnated in recent years  need to be increased if developing countries are to obtain new money for investment. Such action would contribute to a reversal of a situation in which some developing regions have become net exporters of capital as a result of their obligations to service their external debt.The Assembly must also address itself to the issue of debt  which is a major barrier to development and which  if neglected  will render futile all efforts at adjustment. Since the Assembly last met  there has not been any major breakthrough in the identification of a comprehensive strategy acceptable to debtors  creditors  commercial banks and multilateral financial institutions. In the interim  a series of new and innovative mechanisms  such as debt-equity swaps  exit bonds  secondary market trading  and conversion of debt into securities  have been introduced. Those new instruments  by themselves  will have little success in reducing the stock of debt and will merely reduce the exposure of some of the creditors. Clearly  such an anomalous situation cannot be sustained. The community of nations  therefore  has no alternative but to elaborate a new and comprehensive strategy that takes into account the capacity of debtor countries to repay their debt to developed countries and financial institutions  and at the same time allows room for economic growth. I suggest that the search for such a strategy is not beyond the collective imagination  capability and wisdom of this Assembly.The major multilateral financial institutions  particularly the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  must play a more constructive  supportive and progressive role in the global economy. They must critically examine their portfolios and disbursement practices. In keeping with their influence and prestige  they must respond to the demands of a constantly changing global economic environment.There is no doubt that for many countries of the South there would be increased access to financial resources if the question of graduation were reviewed favourably by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Bretton Woods institutions  using the most recent information available. Trinidad and Tobago  which saw its per capita gross national product fall dramatically by 69 per cent from over $US 7 Â£ 000 in 1983 to just over $US 2 000 in 1987  welcomes the decision of the World Bank to degraduate it. We call on the World Bank to review the graduation of other countries that we similarly experienced a fall in their gross national product. We call also on the UNDP to recognize the importance of using the most recent data available in its application of the concept of net-contributor status  and to follow the principle of the World Bank in identifying criteria which would ensure greater equity in the process of graduation.The interdependence of the global economy requires the major industrial countries to recognize that the co-ordination of their macro-economic policies is a responsibility which devolves on them  owing to the substantial power and influence they exert on the international system. It is therefore incumbent on these States to reduce and eliminate the imbalances in and among their economies which have created distortions in the international economy. My delegation welcomes the corrective measures that have so far been taken and urges that they be continued and strengthened.It is crucial for the community of nations to give form and substance to the reality of interdependence. It is necessary  therefore  to revive immediately the dialogue between North and South on the full range of issues encompassed in the concept of a new international economic order  To this end  the Trinidad and Tobago delegation supports the call for a special session of the United Nations General Assembly to address the interrelated problems of uneven growth rates  increasing protectionism  low commodity prices and the net transfer of resources from the South to the North.Among the countries of the South there has been a growing awareness that we need to reverse the roles that we have been assigned in the international economy and to become active participants in  and contributors to  our own development. Reinforced by a shared perception and a common desire for a just and equitable global community  we  the countries of the South  need to stand together to tap and explore our tremendous potential and strengths. Our aspirations have found expression in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  the Group of 77 and  recently  the South commission. Trinidad and Tobago has supported  and will continue to support  the efforts and initiatives of these groupings and to encourage other developing countries to make greater use of the South-South dimension and thus translate rhetorical allusions to co-operation into concrete action. In addition to the economic vicissitudes that developing countries have been encountering  we are faced with other threats to our sovereignty  security and well-being  in the form of cross-border criminal activities  including the traffic in illicit drugs and the highly immoral and reprehensible dumping of toxic waste.In recent times the dumping of toxic waste in developing countries  particularly those in the Caribbean and in Africa  has become a matter of great concern. It is unconscionable that industrial agencies from certain developed States  oblivious of the serious threat to the health and the environment of the peoples of the regions affected  seem prepared surreptitiously to use developing countries as a dumping-ground for highly toxic wastes which they find difficult and/or expensive to dispose of at home. Furthermore  these activities place an unreasonably severe burden on the slender technical and management expertise of developing countries in monitoring this illegal dumping. We therefore join with others in deploring in the strongest possible terms this irresponsible conduct on the part of those industrial enterprises which are engaged in this pernicious practice.My delegation has noted with appreciation the several international and regional initiatives being undertaken to address the dangers of trans-boundary movement of hazardous wastes. We urge the Assembly to request the competent specialized agencies  acting jointly  to take appropriate measures to formulate as a matter of urgency a comprehensive global convention to regulate and/or prohibit the trans-boundary dumping of toxic and other hazardous wastes. Pending the decision of an international convention  my delegation proposes for the Assembly's consideration that a moratorium be declared on further trans-frontier movement of hazardous and toxic waste. The second concern that Trinidad and Tobago has voiced on other occasions and in other forums relates to the illicit production of  trafficking in and abuse of drugs and to the interrelated trafficking in destructive weapons. My Government continues to be committed to the eradication of this scourge. We believe  however  that  in the strategies adopted to combat the drug problem  greater emphasis must be placed on efforts to reduce demand  as well as to improve facilities for treatment and rehabilitation. It will be necessary to continue to intensify and co-ordinate efforts to tackle this problem at all levels.It is with grave disquiet that my Government views the callous disregard with which international conventions prohibiting the use of certain types of weapons have been flouted. In this context the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago proposed  in June of this year during the third special session of the General Assembly on disarmament  that the United Nations commence discussion on the criminal responsibility of individuals who act in breach of relevant norms of international law. The Prime Minister also requested the Secretary-General to prepare  for submission to the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly  a report on the criminal responsibility of persons who use  or authorize the use of  prohibited weapons and weapons that cause unnecessary human suffering  or who engage in illegal drug trafficking across national frontiers. We are gratified that  at our request  an item dealing with this matter has been included on the agenda of this session. During the discussion of that item it will be necessary eventually to examine the existing international criminal codes and the possibilities of using international commissions of inquiry and of instituting  in the long term  an international criminal court. We are convinced that we can count on the support of other concerned delegations when the item is discussed. Over the last three years the United Nations has been in the throes of a financial crisis that threatens the viability of the Organization. There is no need to labour the point. The solution to the problem lies in the full and timely payment of all assessed contributions and the full payment of all arrears.More recently  the United Nations has been engaged in reform mandated by General Assembly resolution 41/213  and much of the focus has been on a tightening of expenditures. It would seem  however  that due attention should also be devoted to the income side of the balance sheet and  since United Nations income derives almost exclusively from the contributions of Member States  a re-examination of the present methodology for calculating the scale of assessments appears necessary. One of the major drawbacks of this scale is that it is based primarily on per capita income figures - data which were never intended as a measure of capacity to pay.My delegation believes that each country's gross national income is the Â· corner-stone of that country's budgetary process  in that it in effect finances the country's expenditure. Naturally enough  each country's pattern of expenditure responds to its own needs  including its basic requirements of food  housing  health  education  public utilities and transport. These are some acceptable basic requirements - that combination generally defined as the infrastructure. It is my contention that the degree to which a country must concentrate its resources on the provision of this minimum standard is a significant factor in determining its capacity to meet its other financial commitments. Furthermore  measures such as the percentage of one or a few main export commodities to total exports  food imports as a percentage of domestic use  and external debt as a percentage of export earnings  among other things  determine each individual State's capacity to pay. My delegation believes that the Committee on Contributions should focus on its consideration of the use of social and economic indicators with a view to devising a basket of minimum requirements which could be used to construct what I will loosely call a development index. This index  reflecting each country's developmental status along the continuum from least developed to developed countries  could then be used as a factor  a multiplier  convert caw per capita income into assessable income from which a United Nations rate of assessment could be calculated. The ultimate aim would be to adopt a simple  transparent formula for determining the scale of assessments  which it is hoped would be a straightforward process not requiring ad hoc adjustments or further resort to the mitigation process.The issue of a programme of action for small Island developing countries is of utmost Importance to Trinidad and Tobago. As early as 1976 the General Assembly issued a call for attention to be paid to the special needs and problems of such countries  as reflected in resolution 31/156 and others  the most recent being resolution 39/212.Among the catalogue of difficult problems faced by island developing countries the General Assembly identified their vulnerability to natural disasters - a vulnerability demonstrated very dramatically in the devastation wrought by hurricane Gilbert on our sister island of Jamaica. We therefore call on the United Nations to render all possible assistance to Jamaica and to accelerate the larger process by which the particular problems of these countries may be successfully addressed.In conclusion  the Trinidad and Tobago delegation wishes to note that the improved climate of relations between the super-Powers  the recent successes of the United Nations in bringing to an end a number of long-standing conflicts and the  improved administrative capability of the Organization have confined to restore in some measure the credibility of the United Nations. However  notwithstanding these achievements  this body still has a long way to go to achieve the goals of the Charter and fulfil the expectations of the peoples of the world  to do this  it must be provided with adequate resources. More important  Member States must conduct their relations in accordance with their obligations under the Charter. Heedless to say  at this moment all the ingredients are present for bringing about a revitalization of the United Nations.As we painstakingly pursue this formidable task  we must ensure that the basic principles that are the corner-stone of the Organization are strictly observed. We must seize the opportunity at this important juncture in the history of the United Nations  for it is only by continuous and universal adherence to the principles enshrined in the Charter that we shall truly embark upon a new and more positive phase in international political  social and economic relations and help to create a better civilization for all mankind."
"138",6946,"TUN",43,1988,"ï»¿It is a great pleasure for me  speaking on behalf of the Tunisian delegation and on my own behalf  to congratulate the Ambassador of Argentina on his election as President of the General Assembly at the forty-third session. We are convinced that  with his experience and wisdom  he will preside successfully over the work of this session of the Assembly. In entrusting him with this responsibility  the Assembly has paid a tribute to his ability and also to the important role played by his country  Argentina  on the international scene. It is also my pleasure to be able to assure him of my delegation's whole-hearted willingness to co-operate closely with him.I should like to take this opportunity also to express to his illustrious predecessor  Mr. Florin  our admiration and appreciation for the devotion  skill and patience with which he presided over the forty-second session  which underwent a period of intensive and continuous activity during the past 12 months. I should also like to express to the Secretary General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our deep appreciation of the noble work he continues to do to secure the influence of the Organization and its Charter. His determination and patience have earned him the trust and support of the international community  thus enabling the United Nations to play the pioneering role set out in the Charter for settling international problems and strengthening peace  security and co-operation among nations.Tunisia has always demonstrated its devotion to the spirit and the letter of the United Nations Charter. This is one of the pillars of our foreign policy and is the principle governing our bilateral relations and determining the position we take on the international scene. Tunisia has always worked to support the United Nations; it has always respected the Organizationâs principles and defended the noble objectives it espouses  in the knowledge that the purposes and principles laid down in the Charter and the values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are among the most valuable achievements in modern history.Guided by these principles  since the events of 7 November 1987 - the change of Government - we have totally redrawn Tunisia's political landscape  enabling our citizens to take part in the decision-making process and to exercise responsibilities under the Constitution. These changes are intended to meet the legitimate aspirations and the authentic civilizing values of the people.Consequently  Ð° whole series of legal and social measures have been enacted. These include an amendment to the Constitution to eliminate any provisions restricting the right of the citizen to exercise freedom of choice or his right to dissent; the promulgation of a new law governing political parties  to act as the legal basis for the creation of political organizations in a multi-party State; and the rehabilitation of the constitutional institutions - in particular  the Chamber of Deputies - so that they can properly carry out the tasks entrusted to them with respect for democratic norms  under the aegis of the Constitutional Council that has been established to ensure constitutionality.Likewise  we have adopted a series of bold measures relating to fundamental freedoms  intended to ensure freedom of opinion and expression  while safeguarding human rights. These measures include abolition of emergency courts  changes in the laws governing custody and preventive detention  and ratification of the international Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. In taking that step  Tunisia withdrew the reservations it had expressed with respect to a number of articles in the Convention. Aware of the noble mission of human rights bodies  the Tunisia of the new age has anted those bodies full freedom of action. Similarly  it has confirmed the political and social gains of Tunisian women - these gains being considered as the fruit of a fundamental and an irreversible national choice.At the international level  the new Tunisia has reiterated the fundamental tenets of its foreign policy - upholding law  justice and freedom - as well as its determination to honour its commitments  consistent with strict respect for its sovereignty and independence. In his statement of 7 November 1987 the President of the Tunisian Republic  His Excellency Mr. Zine Elabidine Ben Ali  stressed the importance Tunisia attaches to the strengthening of its Arab-Muslim identity and its determination to work resolutely to construct the Arab Greater Maghreb on a basis of commonality of interests and destiny. Together with its brother countries  Tunisia is continuing to make great efforts to improve and harmonize its relations with these countries  looking beyond past vicissitudes  in order to lend impetus to the process of constructing the Greater Maghreb and  thus  give concrete expression to the will of the peoples and the leaders of the countries in our region to bring about broad and varied co-operation with the ultimate goal of attaining organic complementarity within the framework of a Maghrebi community without borders or obstacles  a community that is solid and coherent.Thus we have managed to create a climate in which we can eliminate sources of tension and establish constructive dialogue. This has made it possible to meet the pre-conditions for launching the process towards constructing the Greater Maghreb in a spirit of understanding and concord.Our age is one of blocs and regional groups  which necessitate integrated action by our countries - the prerequisite for our survival  for safeguarding our sovereignty  and for managing our affairs in such a way that the Arab Greater Maghreb can become a factor for stability  peace and security in the region. In this respect  we welcome the outline of a just and lasting settlement of the question of the Western Sahara  and it is our hope that the efforts the Secretary-General of the United Nations continues to make will be crowned with success.The period since our last session has been marked by very positive developments in International relations. Hence this session is taking place in a more favourable climate  which augurs well for an age of understanding and dÃ©tente. There have been clear signs of dÃ©tente since the signing  on 8 December 1987  in Washington  of the Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  and the subsequent summit meetings between the leaders of the two countries. These developments have indeed contributed to a lessening of tensions and to containing the regional conflicts which had for a long time given rise to serious concern in the international community and caused instability in many parts of the world. We welcome this course of events  and it is our hope that efforts made in good will can help to resolve chronic  and heretofore insoluble  conflicts  dispel feelings of hate and bitterness  and open the road to peaceful coexistence and international understanding.It is strange  and regrettable that  despite the climate of dÃ©tente  the international community has said nothing about a policy based on continuous aggression  force  occupation  expansionism and domination that flouts all international laws and regulations  disregarding the strictures of morality. I refer to Israel's policy in the Middle East.The situation prevailing in the occupied Palestinian territories as a result of the repressive campaigns waged by the Israeli occupation authorities against defenceless Palestinians since the beginning of the heroic uprising in December 1987 gets worse every day. This is borne out by the number of dead and injured  the detainees and individuals reportedly as well as by the arsenal of coercive measures which the occupying authorities resort to daily in violation of United Nations resolutions and international instruments  including the Fourth Geneva Convention  of 1949.In recent months  the Security Council has repeatedly been called on to consider this dangerous situation  and has adopted resolutions condemning these practices. It has called on Israel to observe the Geneva Convention  and has emphasized the urgent need for a just and lasting settling to the Arab-Israeli conflict.The uprising by the Palestinian people has demonstrated to the whole world that this struggling people  this people aspiring to freedom and dignity  is more determined than ever  if necessary at the price of its own blood  to regain its rights and dignity  and even the most ferocious repression will be unable to dissuade it.The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  and all Arab countries have constantly reiterated their determination to work for a peaceful  just and comprehensive settlement based on international law  as set forth in United Nations resolutions  within the framework of an international conference on peace in the Middle East  organized under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation  on an equal footing  of all parties concerned  including the PLO  and the permanent members of the Security Council. The purpose of this would be to restore the Palestinian people's legitimate right to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State  guaranteeing the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories and the strengthening of international peace and security in the region. In the same part of the world  our brothers in Lebanon are experiencing a tragic situation which is the direct result of the colonialist policy practised by Israel since its creation. After occupying a part of its territory  and repeatedly violating its sovereignty  Israel has set out to sow dissension and discord throughout the territory  reviving internal quarrels and provoking massacres and destruction.We welcome the signing of the Geneva agreement on Afghanistan and its entry into force  especially since that demonstrates the special role the United Nations has to play as the framework for dialogue and the settlement of conflicts on the basis of law; it has also rewarded the great efforts made by the Secretary-General and his assistants  as well as the efforts made by all peace-loving forces which have greatly contributed to the rapid conclusion of this agreement. In this regard  Tunisia has always called for respect for the sovereignty and independence of Afghanistan  and it has always called for the people of Afghanistan to be able to exercise their right to choose their own system of government. By noting with satisfaction the continuing withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan  in keeping with the Agreements signed by the Government of the USSR  Tunisia also hopes that all the parties concerned will manage to find the best possible way to implement the Geneva Agreements under the best conditions.We find deep satisfaction in the fact that our Organization has been able to resume its proper role in establishing peace and settling regional conflicts. Indeed  after having contributed to the settlement of the Afghan question  the United Nations has succeeded  with great effort and imbued with the same spirit  in putting an end to the confrontation between Iran and Iraq. Tunisia has been saddened to see these two brotherly countries  with which it is linked by religion  tear themselves apart in that destructive war. Within the framework of the League Arab states and its Committee of Seven  within the framework of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIS)  of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United Nations  Tunisia has constantly called upon of the two parties to resort to dialogue to settle the conflict with a view to a just and honourable peace  in keeping with international law and United Nations resolutions.We welcomed with satisfaction the acceptance by Iran of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  a resolution which Iraq had accepted from the very time of its adoption. This is what we have constantly called for as a means to establish the necessary conditions to bring about peace and security and to preserve stability in the region. We hope that the two parties will succeed in overcoming all the obstacles so that they can turn a new page and build fraternal links and good-neighbourliness  while respecting each others sovereignty and the political choices  thus restoring peace and security in the region  and thus opening up the way for sincere and fruitful co-operation  and eliminating the spectre of upheavals and the waste of energies.We also observed with deep satisfaction the talks which the leaders of the two Cypriot communities held in Geneva under the auspices of the Secretary-General  We consider them a positive step  one which will strengthen confidence between the two parties and which will prompt them to redouble their efforts to succeed in bringing about a final settlement of the Cypriot problem. We welcome the fact that the leaders of the two communities have decided to undertake new negotiations in order to reach a negotiated settlement before 1 June 1989. We are convinced that the two parties are sincerely seeking to realize this goal while respecting legality and justice.Similarly we have noted with hope and optimism the signs of detente resulting from the agreement among the Angolan  South African  Cuban and United States Governments to end the aggression of the racist regime of Pretoria against the countries of the region and to work for a settlement of the question of Namibia. We are very hopeful that this agreement will contribute effectively to facilitating Namibia's accession to independence.The Security Council played a decisive role in the search for a settlement that would bring about an end to the occupation of Namibia when it adopted resolution 435 (1978)  which remains a model of objectivity and fairness. The time has come for the Namibian people  who have suffered so much from colonialist occupation  oppression and aggression to rejoin the community of independent nations.Faithful to its principles  and faithful to its sacred duty to give unfailing support to the just cause of peoples  to the cause of liberty and to everything that might contribute to preserving dignity and human rights throughout the world  Tunisia reaffirms today its unreserved support for the peoples of South Africa and Namibia in their struggle to regain their legitimate rights and to shake off the yoke of bondage and colonialism. Tunisia calls upon the international community to redouble its efforts to eradicate this evil and to put an end to these practices  which are immoral and contrary to the rules of international law. Proud of belonging to Africa  Tunisia  which itself had to fight fiercely for its independence  reaffirms its commitment to the Charter of the Organization of African Unity  which has spared no effort to carry out its role and its responsibility in the search for solutions to the problems facing the African continent. We are persuaded that the United Nations has a pre-eminent role to play in strengthening the climate of confidence and dÃ©tente between the two super-Powers. This is done by committing them to intensify their efforts to bring about disarmament  especially nuclear disarmament  in order to create new possibilities for lessening the tensions created by certain international conflicts. This is also done by allowing other countries to commit their natural resources  human resources  and other resources  to the service of social progress  in response to the aspirations of people to live in dignity and in peace; and this is also done by promoting international co-operation in the areas of the economy  science and useful technologies.Such has always been the noble mission which we have undertaken constantly to achieve  within the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  a movement which makes tireless efforts to build international relations on safe and fair principles. This Movement has spared no effort in undertaking initiatives to settle the main problems haunting the present and the future of mankind  so that the non-aligned countries have become an important partner  enjoying a weight and a prestige which are acknowledged on the international scene.The success in the struggle on the part of peoples for their emancipation and liberty  and the signs of understanding and dÃ©tente visible on the international scene would remain fragile and would be unable to bring about an irreversible process if there were not to be a complete restructuring of the international economic order. The situation with regard to international economic relations calls for a radical change in certain factors related to development  such as protectionist policies  the deterioration in the terms of trade  inflation and the debt burden. The road leading to the revival of our economies  therefore  is still filled with obstacles. Tunisia has made a number of proposals as its contribution to the search for a solution to the crisis. Indeed  in a message which he addressed to the most recent summit held in Toronto  President Ben Ali proposed first  the partial or complete cancellation of the public debt of the least advanced countries? secondly  limitation of the debt service of the other countries to 15 to 25 per cent of the export earnings; thirdly  the elimination or the reduction of the interest on all public loansÂ·  fourthly  the establishment  in favour of the most indebt African countries  of a system which would allow them to convert their medium-term loans into bonds payable over a period of 10 to 20 years. Furthermore  an in-depth study of the world situation should be undertaken  with a view to establishing a new international monetary order. While the structural adjustment programmes which the crisis has imposed upon us certainly strengthen our credibility  it none the less remains true that our people have been called upon to make enormous sacrifices.The industrialized countries  which to a large extent are responsible for the occurrence and for the persistence of the crisis  must therefore seriously examine  along with us  the means for restructuring international economic relations  as well as restructuring their own economies. Those countries should not limit themselves to occasional interventions when the crisis worsens. Indeed  it is evident today  for everyone  that the future of the industrialized countries is to a large extent linked to the development and industrialization of the third world.We still consider that the adoption of the final text of the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) demonstrated the willingness to pursue and to establish this dialogue seriously. In this regard  we also consider that the proposal made by the developing countries at the last summer session of the Economic and Social Council offers an excellent opportunity for 4 beginning such a dialogue within the framework of a special session of the General Assembly at the highest level  in order to examine the world economic situation and to revitalize it by reactivating the economic growth and development of the developing countries. Such a session should  in our view  lead to a consensus which would serve as a basis for international economic relations. Moreover  the convening of such a conference in the near future would allow them to benefit from the trade negotiations which are to take place in December 1988 in Montreal as part of the Uruguay Round.All the peoples of the world are looking to our Organization for the establishment of an international order based on law  justice and equality of opportunity  for  in the final analysis  the United Nations remains the last hope for a happy future for all of mankind."
"139",6993,"TUR",43,1988,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to extend warmcongratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina on his election to the presidencyof the forty-third session of the General Assembly. We are meeting at anauspicious time when there are encouraging developments on the world politicalscene. I am confident that under his guidance this session will contribute to thefurther improvement of the international atmosphere by addressing the issues beforeit with vision and wisdom.I should like also to pay a tribute to the President of the forty-second session  Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic  who presided over aparticularly busy session  as well as the fifteenth special session of the GeneralAssembly. This year we are witnessing a growing and more effective role for the United Nations in the peaceful settlement of regional problems. We hope that the momentumfor peace-making efforts will be maintained  so as to contribute to the achievementof lasting solutions based on realism and justice.In this connection I should like to pay a special tribute to theSecretary-General  whose diplomatic skill  patience and resolve we admire. I should like to reaffirm our full support for his untiring efforts in the service of the United Nations. We rejoice at the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations in recognition of the contribution of the Organization to wor1d peace. The positive implications of the ongoing dialogue between the United Statesand the Soviet union underline the impact of East-West relations on theinternational atmosphere. The international setting today is much more favourablein comparison with the early 1980s for making progress on international issues. Itis important to maintain and build on this trend.In the past 12 months the negotiations between the United States and theSoviet Union have started to yield concrete results. The conclusion andratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range andShorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - has been a historic step resulting in the elimination of an entire class of nuclear weapons. An agreement on the substantial reduction of strategic arms between the United States and the Soviet Union would be another fundamental development in the process of nuclear arms control. We welcome the progress made during the Moscow summit meeting with respect to those issues and hope that the entire range of arms control and disarmament issues will continue to be seriously and effectively addressed.The convening of the third special session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly devoted to disarmament last June also provided a welcome opportunity forextensive consideration of the issues involved in the arms control field. Thisexercise has been useful in identifying various approaches to the disarmamentprocess and the different perceptions  interests and priorities of Member States.It has confirmed the close relationship between disarmament and the security concerns of all States and the maintenance of international peace and security. Arm control and disarmament constitute a comprehensive process  encompassing nuclear as wall as conventional and chemical weapons. We hope that a convention banning chemical weapons on a global basis  accompanied by effective verificationmeasures  will be finalized soon. We welcome President Reagan's constructive andtimely proposal for the convening of an international conference on this question.It is imperative to keep in sight the integrated nature of the endeavours in thevarious fields of arms cont.ro1- The asymmetries between the conventional forces ofthe two major alliance systems under line the need for addressing the question ofthe overall strategic relationship in a more comprehensive way_ In this connectionwe hope that agreement will soon be reached on the mandate of the conventionalstability talks to be held between the 23 members of the two military alliances.The success of arms control initiatives depends in the first instance on theestablishment of an environment of confidence among the parties concerned. Ishould like to underline in this connection the significance of the measuresundertaken within the framework of the process of the Conference on security andCo-operation in Europe (CSCE). Turkey attaches great importance to the confidence andsecurity-building measures adopted at the Stockholm Conference in 1986. Wehope it will be possible to agree on the mandate of future negotiations among the35 States participating in the CSCE in order to expand the results of the StockholmConference.Considering the growing need to extend those efforts to other regions of theworld  in order to reduce tensions and enhance stability  a resolution envisaging asimilar process adapted to the special requirements of the Islamic countries was approved at the 17th session of the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers heldrecently in Amman.I would be remiss if I did not stress that arms control agreements andconfidence-building measures will not suffice if they are not effectivelycomplemented by respect for fundamental human rights on a global scale. Turkey isproud of its record in this respect and on the fortieth anniversary of the adoptionof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights I am glad to say that Turkey has beenthe first country to ratify the European Convention for the Prevention of Tortureand Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishments  of the Council of Europe. Wehave also ratified the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.We attach particular importance to cultivating peaceful and friendly relationswith all our neighbours and the countries of our region. Fully aware of theinterrelationship between security and prosperity  we wish to develop closer andbetter relations and mutually beneficial co-operation with all of them. We arefully committed to the peaceful settlement of existing differences through aprocess of substantive and meaningful negotiations.For the first time in history  the Foreign Ministers of the six Balkancountries came together in Belgrade last February to consider the possibilities fordeveloping lasting multilateral co-operation. Inter-Balkan friendship andco-operation have always been a priority foreign policy objective of Turkey sincethe early days of our Republic. we are therefore determined to continue to play aconstructive and dynamic role in order to contribute to the creation of anatmosphere of confidence among the Balkan countries. As we stressed in Belgrade respect for human rights is a prerequisite for the emergence of such an atmosphere.With this understanding we have initiated a dialogue with Bulgaria. TheProtocol that the two parties signed sets out the prerequisites and the mechanismfor the normalization of Turkish-Bulgarian relations. Our relations are heavilyaffected by the situation of the Turkish Muslim minority in Bulgaria  ahumanitarian question also involving contractual obligations. Both Turkish andworld public opinion await a prompt and satisfactory solution to this problem. Theongoing process has not yet brought about any concrete results. Improved prospectsfor the Turkish Muslim minority will certainly lead to a new era of friendly andco-operative relations between the two countries. We continue to hope thatBulgaria will take the necessary action to ensure the creation of an atmosphereconducive to this end.During the past year important steps have been taken for bringing regionalconflicts to an end.The Afghanistan talks were successfully concluded with the signing of theGeneva Accords in April. Foremost among many factors  the perseverance and thesacrifices of the Afghan resistance and the patient efforts of thesecretary-General and his Personal Representative made that achievement possible.Pakistan has sheltered millions of Afghan refugees and has been instrumentalin the shaping of international reaction to the situation in Afghanistan for thepast eight years. The international community is greatly indebted to Pakistan forthose efforts. The creation of the necessary objective conditions for thevoluntary return of the Afghan refugees is another important task which has to befaced.Grievous devastation has been inflicted upon Afghanistan. A majorinternational effort will be required for the reconstruction of the country. Wewelcome the initiative taken by the international community to come to theassistance of Afghanistan  and salute the efforts made by Prince Sadruddin Agha Khanto co-ordinate international action that has been taken. Turkey intends tocontribute substantively to the reconstruction and the economic revitalization ofAfghanistan following the establishment of a representative Government.The cease-fire which has put an end to eight years of suffering between Iranand Iraq came as a great relief to the whole world. A special tribute should bepaid to the secretary-General for his dedicated efforts  which have substantiallycontributed to bringing about the cease-fire between our two friends andneighbours. We welcome the holding of talks between Iran and Iraq and fullysupport diplomatic efforts aimed at restoring peace between them. We know thatthis will be a long and arduous process. As a country which maintains a sustainedand continuous dialogue with both parties  we are ready to contribute to the bestof our .ability to the progress of the peace process and to the prohibition of anatmosphere of understanding and mutual trust.The effects of this conflict have not been limited to the warring parties buthave been seriously felt in the whole area. In order to avoid the occurrence ofsimilar conflicts  intensive efforts should be deployed to create an atmosphere of mutual trust in the region and to re-establish a climate of confidence among the countries there.As a country respectful of fundamental human rights  Turkey has recently accepted  on purely humanitarian grounds  tens of thousands of persons coming from Iraq and has provided them with food  shelter and medical care. This is not the first time that we have welcomed large numbers of persons on our soil. Our history abounds with similar examples.Since the end of last year Palestinian resistance in the occupied territories has dominated developments in the Middle East. We regard this continuing popular resistance to Israeli occupation as an expression of the long-standing frustration and suffering of the Palestinian people and of their desire to achieve their national aspirations.We believe that the ongoing uprising is a constant reminder to all the parties concerned  including Israel  and to the world of the urgent need to find a just and lasting solution to the Middle East question. Turkey believes that such a solution can be brought about only on the basis of the withdrawal by Israel from the territories occupied since 1967 and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians  including their right to self-determination with all that this implies. Such a solution should also recognize the right of all States in the region to 1ive with in secure and recognized boundaries. We recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian peop1e. For the peace process to be viable  Palestinian participation is indispensable.We are closely following the developments engendered by the recent statementof His Majesty King Hussein about the severance of the administrative and legal ties between Jordan and the west Bank. That is likely to have an important impact on the Middle East peace process. We shall continue to support all Middle Eastpeace initiatives along the lines I have just mentioned. In this context  Turkeywould welcome the convening  with the agreement of all the parties concerned  of the International Peace Conference. We are prepared to shoulder our responsibilities in that regard  if so requested.The situation in Lebanon continues to be another source of instability andconcern in the Middle East. We are particularly concerned about the difficulties encountered in the Lebanese presidential election. We are hoping that this latest crisis may be overcome by the Lebanese themselves  through legal means and without endangering the country's territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty.I should like to stress also the importance we attach to a prompt solution ofthe situation in Kampuchea. We are glad to note the positive developments whichhave taken place in the past few months. The Jakarta Informal Meeting is certainlyan important beginning and a significant step aimed at putting an end to the armedconflict in Kampuchea through the complete withdrawal of foreign troops  so as toenable the people of Kampuchea to exercise their right to self-determination andachieve national reconciliation. Turkey supports diplomatic activities aimed atachieving that objective and pays a tribute to the members of the Association ofSouth-East Nations (ASEAN) for their efforts; they have worked so hard for thereaching of a political settlement in Kampuchea.In order to remove confrontation and reduce tensions in eastern Asia  we continue to attach importance to the ongoing search for a meaningful dialogue in the Korean peninsula. The humanitarian approach can be an excellent way to createthe favourable climate necessary for achieving progress. Peaceful solutions to the questions between the two sides will  we hope  lead to their eventual representation as full Members of our Organization.The deteriorating situation in South Africa  resulting from the inhuman systemof apartheid  continues to be a source of grave concern. Unfortunately  thepolitical situation in South Africa has not improved during the past 12 months.Tensions and violence continue to cause widespread human suffering in that country.We believe that so long as South Africa has not totally abolished itsinadmissible racial policies  and has not embarked upon a real process of peacefuldemocratic change  the international community should maintain its efforts. Morethan ever before  the situation in South Africa requires firm conviction andresolute action on the part of the united Nations.The continuation of the South African occupation of Namibia  an affront to theprinciple of self-determination  is another deplorable aspect of the situation insouthern Africa. It is a matter of the deepest regret that the people of Namibia 20 years after the adoption of the United Nations plan for the independence of thatTerritory  have not been able to exercise their inalienable right toself-determination.My Government is encouraged by the progress reported in the quadripartite talks concerning this question. We welcomed the cease-fire on 10 August 1988 as avital first step in the right direction. We earnestly hope that this developmentwill lead in the near future to the long overdue settlement of the Namibianquestion through the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 a founding member of the United nations Council for Namibia  Turkey will continue to give its full support to the legitimate struggle of the people of Namibia forindependence. In this regard  my Government subscribes to the main thrust of the Istanbul Declaration and Call for Action adopted at the end of the Seminar on theInternational Responsibility for Namibia's Independence  held in March in my country.In Central America  the time that has elapsed since the signing of the peaceplan put forward by Costa Rica  and the proposals by other Central Americancountries last year  demonstrate the difficulties and obstacles that exist in thesearch for peace. However  we must not lose heart. The search for a peacefulsolution must go on. This search began with the Contadora process  the most comprehensive framework for addressing the political and economic problems of that region. We believe that a viable solution must emanate from the region  and Iwould like to reiterate our support for all the regional efforts towards peace in central America. We have always supported the search for a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question through direct negotiations between the Turkish Cypriots and the GreekCypriots  under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General. Following the agreement reached in August through the secretary-General's mission of goodoffices  the two sides have embarked upon a new negotiating process. We welcome this development and express our hope that this new round of negotiations will bethe beginning of the process of the achievement of a lasting settlement in Cyprusthrough the establishment of a bicommunal  bizonal federation based on thepolitical equality of the two peoples of the island. We shall pursue ourconsistent policy of supporting the efforts towards a just and lasting settlement.As we have previously  I wish to stress here also that it is important for allthird parties to refrain from taking positions that may undermine the negotiatingprocess in Cyprus.The situation of refugees throughout the world has assumed alarmingdimensions. The problem is especially severe in Africa and South-East Asia  andurgently needs attention. The plight of the Afghan refugees is still a sombrereality despite the Geneva Agreements. Other parts of the world are also plaguedby similar calamities.In dealing with this problem  a comprehensive approach should be adopted taking into consideration of the needs of both the refugees themselves and thecountries of first refuge. Appropriate international mechanisms to this end shouldbe devised immediately. In this context  I would like to pay a special tribute tothe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for his untiring efforts.In view of the importance that Turkey attaches to effective internationalcooperation in action against illicit trafficking in and abuse of narcotic drugs we welcome and support the initiatives undertaken by the United Nations in thiscrucial area  especially during the last year. In this connection  we subscribe tothe proposal made by my colleague Sir Geoffrey Howe to the effect that theinternational collU'll1nity should consider adopting measures for the seizure of theassets of drug traffickers wherever they are  thus preventing the diversion offunds to the support of such other evils as international terrorism and armstrafficking.As an outcome of ongoing efforts in this field  a major step will be taken atthe end of this year when the conference of plenipotentiaries adopts the newconvention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.Turkey welcomes this development and expects the convention to be signed andratified by a large number of Member states.I have to state with profound regret that the threat posed by terrorism toevery society and to all facets of international relations has not abated. On thecontrary  acts  methods and practices of terrorism  which have been repeatedly andunequivocally condemned by this world body  have continued to claim human lives onan increasing scale. I feel obliged to remind the Assembly that Turkey has formany years stressed the necessity of effective international co-operation againstterrorism in all its forms. I have to point out  however  that internationalco-operation is not yet satisfactory.I also want to reiterate that there can be no double standard on terrorism.Attempts to differentiate between various forms of terrorism can only encourage theculprits and lead to new acts of outrage. Those who support or tolerate terrorismassume a grave responsibility  whatever their motives. History has shown thatthose who support  tolerate or provide a haven for terrorism are bound to regrettheir short-sighted policies eventually.Let me now turn to international economic issues. As the decade of the 1980sdraws to an end the time has come for us to concentrate our efforts on policies forthe next decade. Careful planning for the 1990s stands out as a necessity for theinternational community if it is to fulfill the expectations of coming generations.Since the early 19808 the world economy has gone through very seriousdifficulties. The critical external debt problem  efforts towards structuraladjustment  widespread protectionist practices and major economic imbalances have been the chief features of this period. The severe problems we have had to face inthis decade remain essentially unchanged. However  this rather dismal situationshould not cause us to give way to pessimism for the coming years. As economicindicators demonstrate  the international outlook is better on balance than it wasin the early 1980s. The international community is more experienced and has betterinsight regarding the underlying causes of the current problems.Regarding the external debt problem  which has acquired serious dimensions the increased efforts on the part of debtor and creditor countries  multilateralinstitutions and banks to improve the situation are encouraging. On the otherhand  the shortcomings in the structural adjustment policies of the developingcountries  the social costs of such policies and the need to consider them in amore realistic manner are better understood. It is now evident that debtorcountries are in need of adequate external financial support as well as easy accessto international markets to boost their growth on a sustained basis. In thisrespect  the launching of the Uruguay Round and the ongoing endeavours tostrengthen the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are good opportunitiesthat must be seized. Nevertheless  we are convinced that the fate of both thetrade negotiations and indebtedness depends to a great extent on the expansionarynature of the global environment  and this  in turn  depends on the elimination ofinternational imbalances and the restoration of higher growth in the industrializedcountries.The erosion of multilateralism over the past decade has been highlynoticeable  despite the growing need to make the international framework moreeffective. In view of the increasing interdependence that transforms national andregional economic issues into global issues  we believe that both North and Southhave much to gain from the rapid restoration of effective multilateral co-operationand dialogue on development questions.We regret to see the divisions between North and South. Overcoming thosedivisions should be the major task of the international community. We know thatevery country has its own special circumstances as well as different priorities inthe implementation of development policies. Many developing countries have avaluable accumulation of experience in the development process  which they canusefully share among themselves. In that respect  the middle-income countriesdeserve special attention. In our view  those countries are in a position to playa much more helpful role in contributing to the development process of others.Since the beginning of this decade 'fur key has been in the process .ofimplementing measures of economic reform. This new course of action has meant aradical departure from previous economic policies away from inward-lookingapproaches g import substitution and excessive State intervention towards a greaterplay of market forces and increased liberalization of the economy. Despite thedifficulties and costs inherent in such programmes  the outcome of this new policyorientation has been highly encouraging.Within the framework of this new approach  while trying to expand ourrelations with the developed nations  we have also set a good example of increasingSouth-South co-operation. In that context  efforts have been made to enhanceeconomic co-operation among the Islamic countries. There has been a substantialincrease in our trade with the Middle Eastern and North African countries.In that connection  we have allocated funds for financing technicalco-operation with 12 African countries. We have also conducted in-plant grouptraining programmes and provided undergraduate and graduate fellowships in Turkey.We are pleased to see a sharper global focus on African development problems  andwe hope that the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recoveryand Development 1986-1990 will bear tangible results. For its part  Turkey willcontinue to strengthen its co-operation and its economic ties with the Africancountries.The protection and preservation of our environment is a major task facing theinternational community. It is not only an urgent and pressing problem confrontingus now; it is also a heavy responsibility that we all bear towards futuregeneration I regret to say that  despite all official and voluntary efforts  thedestruction of the environment continues.Recently  another alarming development has become increasingly evident. HereI refer to the dumping of industrial wastes in developing countries. Various formsof waste  including toxic and chemical products and even nuclear waste  have beenshipped through various channels to developing countries where public opinion isthought to be less sensitive to environmental questions. Illicit ways and meanshave frequently been resorted to in this deadly transfer.Even the oceans have not been spared this modern plague. A new kind of piracyhas developed  in the form of dumping waste in the high seas where coastal andinternational controls cannot easily be exercised.We believe that international conventions with effective control andverification measures should be speedily adopted within the framework of theGeneral Assembly and competent international organizations such as the UnitedNations Environment Programme."
"140",7055,"TZA",43,1988,"ï»¿I should like to begin by congratulating Mr. Dante Caputo on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. His election is a tribute to- the important sole that Argentina  with which Tanzania enjoys excellent relations  continues to play on the Latin American and international community scenes in furtherance of international co-operation  understanding and peace. Mr. Caputo brings to the office a great wealth of' political and diplomatic skills and experience. I assure him of my delegation's support in bringing those skills to bear fully on the critical agenda before this session. I wish  at the same time  to convey the deep appreciation of my Government to his predecessor  who  with such dedication and competence/ so effectively guided the work of the last session. We greatly distinguished himself as we tackled the various major and pressing problems of our time. I wish him good health in the continued service of his country.Allow me also to pay a deserved tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and to the Organization as a whole. The last few months have been as engaging as they have proved challenging. The perseverance  dedication and sheer energy involved deserve commendation. It takes imagination  resourcefulness and commitment not only to ensure the smooth operation of the Organization but also to tackle the challenges before it  especially when it is experiencing such daunting financial problems.I should like to welcome enthusiastically the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for this year to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. The main mission of the United Nations is the safeguarding of peace and the prevention of war in the world. The award of this Prize serves as a timely reminder of this United Nations 'role. May it give hope and encouragement to the thousands of uniformed men and women involved g often in desolate places and on hazardous missions to keep belligerents fit bay  and facilitate dialogue between adversaries conducive to peaceful coexistence. The Peace Prize is a deserved  noble and global tribute to this United Nations work.The activities and programmes of the United Nations system can be fruitful only if they are promoted from a strong financial basis. The current financial crisis of the United Nations works directly towards reducing its authority  operations and reputation. My delegation therefore appeals to Member States to honour their legal obligations under the Charter and make timely payment of their assessed contributions to the regular budget of the Organization. If we do not undertake these corrective steps we shall be rightly judged as retreating from the spirit and the cause of multilateralism  which is the corner-stone of the United Nations.Since last year we have witnessed the evolution of a new political atmosphere world-wide. There is an air of political optimism in all regions of the world. The thaw in the international climate is in large measure a result of the improved relations between the two super-Powers. The signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - last year  together with the follow-up summit in Moscow in June  has proved instrumental in acting as a catalyst to negotiations on a broad global agenda for resolving many regional problems. We note as a sign that the super-Powers are now willing to undertake co-operative action in the interests of peace. Whether it be in southern Africa  the Persian Gulf  Afghanistan  Cyprus  Western Sahara or  Kampuchea  there is hope built around the conviction that the parties involved are now prepared to try the peaceful alternative  and that the super-Powers are willing not only to encourage them but also to make the political choice of guaranteeing that the peace will hold. We commend all those involved in the ongoing contacts and negotiations in all the regions. We wish to underline  however  the need to address the root causes of the problems. It would be an exercise in futility to address ourselves only to the symptoms of the diseases and gloss over the diseases themselves.Perhaps nowhere is such attention more called for than in southern Africa. While we are encouraged by the current contacts regarding the settlement of the Namibian question and the restoration of peace to Angola  we need to emphasize that these developments and contacts must serve as a curtain-raiser to an overall settlement in the region. They should not  therefore  be interpreted as a process of negotiating permanent arrangements for  coexistence with apartheid.The genesis of conflict  war and general chaos in southern Africa is apartheid. The fact that  today  the apartheid regime has been forced to talk should not be taken as meaning that the South African Government has decided to abandon apartheid in South Africa or the politics of force against its neighbours. Rather  the apparent change of stance is a direct result of military defeats of its occupationist forces in Angola and the resulting political and economic pressures inside South Africa  and of the relentless pressure of external sanctions against the apartheid regime. The uprising by the black majority and some enlightened white elements  including those who now refuse to be drafted  has exerted combined pressure on the regime to abandon the war in Angola. This is the reality. We must remain vigilant and not fall prey to the apartheid propaganda or to that of the regime's allies and benefactors  which claim that it is on the road of reform. The regime remains racist; it remains aggressive. Its victims inside South Africa have seen no respite from its violence. Its victims in the neighbouring countries continue to suffer from acts of destabilization and outright military aggressionsTanzania is deeply disturbed that the detractors of African freedom are seizing on the Current artificial atmosphere of movement in southern Africa to give solace to the apartheid regime and to undermine international political pressure against it. The situation in southern Africa represents the negation of our common humanity  which we seek to protect and foster by our subscription to the Charter and ideals of this Organization.There can be no neutrality over apartheid  and we cannot leave the fight against it to the people of South Africa alone. The United Nations in particular must not just distance itself in pronouncements from apartheid; it must take concrete action to undermine it. It is equally important that it do everything possible to give encouragement to those inside South Africa struggling for the destruction of apartheid and victimized by its perpetrators. Now is the time to widen and deepen our reach into South Africa and to South Africans.For this reason  my delegation is distressed at the prospect of the United Nations information system reducing its programmes targeted at the oppressed people of South Africa. It is the contention of my delegation that such curtailed programmes by the Department of Public Information  (DPI) on apartheid and on Namibia should not be implemented without the approval of the Assembly  which  in the first place  gave the mandate for the present DPI programmes on apartheid and Namibia. That the apartheid regime is ready to talk to Angola and Mozambique and solicit the embrace of leaders of independent African States far from South Africa should not blind us to the reality that it continues to refuse to change its internal policies and to talk to the genuine leaders of the African majority in South Africa. Its peace overtures to Angola and Mozambique are not matched by similar overtures to its victims inside South Africa. Moreover  South Africa's aggression against its neighbours has not diminished. It follows  therefore  that if the regime wants to talk peace it should not talk peace only to Mozambique and Angola  but must seek fundamental peace with the black majority inside South Africa. Ito this end  it must repeal its apartheid laws  lift the state of emergency  end the ban on political parties and release Nelson Mandela and other political detainees  with whom it should discuss the future of a democratic  non-racial South Africa.South Africa's sudden enthusiasm for dialogue and negotiation should not induce an international relaxation of the various pressures mounted against that evil regime. Readiness to talk by the apartheid Government does not herald a conversion to civilized principle. The so-called new mood of the South African Government  therefore  calls for a stiffening of sanctions. The South African regime has exposed the hollow equivocation of those who  in their unbridled pursuit of profits  claimed the inefficacy of sanctions against South Africa.Only last week the head of the apartheid regime expressed the hope that his latest diplomatic dissembling would serve to avert or blunt sanctions against South Africa. South Africa is saying that sanctions do work. It is the responsibility of the international community to make them work better. For this reason  my delegation calls on the Security Council to undertake a better enforcement of the arms and oil embargoes against South Africa and on  individual Governments to broaden  intensify  and-make more effective the sanctions they have put in place nationally. There is no question but that comprehensive mandatory sanctions would be the quickest  most .effective and least hurtful pressure on South Africa  and my delegation renews its call on the Security Council to impose them.The damage done to property and infrastructure in the countries neighbouring South Africa by its active pursuit of a policy of destabilization has been estimated at between 325 billion and 330 billion. Those countries need substantial assistance to rebuild their infrastructures and economies. A number of countries have been forthcoming in this regard  and I wish to place on record my delegation's appreciation of this support. It helps those countries to reduce their dependence on South Africa and to increase the isolation of the apartheid regime.But assistance to the front-line States  necessary though it is  should not be made a substitute for practical measures to fight apartheid. There are those who in giving aid to the front-line and other neighbouring States portray that assistance as a substitute for involvement in the anti-apartheid struggle. We in the front-line States resent being used as an excuse for inaction and as an apology for policies of economic self-aggrandizement. A balanced policy to combat apartheid must combine measures directly aimed at its dismantlement in South Africa with measures aimed at alleviating the burden borne by the front-line and other neighbouring States. Tanzania has followed with keen interest the various rounds of talks regarding the future of Namibia and the security of Angola. We welcome those talks  while regretting that South Africa did not give way sooner. The people of Namibia have been denied their independence for too long. The uniqueness of the Namibian situation lies not only in the United Nations responsibility for the Territory  but also in the host of factors which have converged to complicate the situation. Namibia is a case of colonialism  institutionalized racism  economic plunder and military occupation. Namibia's freedom and independence continue to be made hostage to ill-conceived political judgements on the part of South Africa and the United States administration.As we meet here  and even as the talks continue  South Africa continues to entrench the apartheid system Inside Namibia. There is evidence of stepped-up direct police and military action against the civilian population. Including indiscriminate detentions  imprisonment without trial  and even summary liquidation of those suspected of sympathizing with the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). Even as talks about practical steps to Implement Security Council resolution 43S (1S78)  embodying the plan for the independence of Namibia  continue. South Africa has not relented in its bid to assemble a coalition of internal surrogates  with a view to fraudulently denying SWAPO victory in the elections.Even as we nurture guarded optimism over the prospects of a Namibian settlement we should not be complacent. Agreement on Implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is still predicated on meeting many extortionist demands. Linkage is still in place and Namibia remains in colonial bondage. South Africa remains obdurate and its allies remain unwilling to prevail on it. The history of the negotiations reveals South Africa as a past master at prevarication and duplicity. It is not  10 years since  resolution 435 (1978) was adopted. They have been years of raised expectations and frustrations  as the apartheid regime and its allies have constructed one impediment after another  with such a history of diversions  procrastination and retreats  we cannot pretend that all is well. Whatever the outcome of the ongoing negotiations  let me underline that Tanzania considers the talks as primarily aimed at negotiating modalities for implementing resolution 435 (1978) and guaranteeing the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Angola against South African expansionism. We urge the Security Council  and in particular the United States  which is serving as broker for the talks  to ensure that South Africa does not seek to undermine those basic legal and internationally promulgated goals. We salute the gallant forces of the People's Republic of Angola and the internationalist Cuban forces  who have triumphed over the racist regime's occupationist forces and have decisively determined the source of the war  culminating in the defeat of the South African army of invasion in southern Angola.As in southern Africa  there is optimism in other areas. We welcome the acceptance by Morocco of United Nations mediation in an effort to bring peace and settlement of the Western Sahara problem. We hope that the Secretary-General will be given all the necessary support in putting into place arrangements for implementing the United Nations formula for the self-determination and independence of the Sahraoui people. For this process to succeed  we urge the parties to the conflict to muster the necessary political will and enter into direct negotiations  as provided for in the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations  Every effort must be made to ensure that the projected referendum in Western Sahara is  and is seen to be  an unqualified process of decolonization.In the Middle East  we are outraged at the carnage being perpetrated by the Israeli forces against the Palestinian and Lebanese people  in contravention of Security Council resolutions and the Fourth Geneva Convention. Tanzania believes that  ultimately  the long-term interests of the region will be better served by political real ism on the part of all the parties concerned  a comprehensive and lasting peace can be ensured only by an unconditional withdrawal by Israel from all occupied Arab territories and recognition of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination  including the right to establish an independent State of their own. Equally  a secure peace must be built upon the inviolable right of all States in the region  including Israel  to live within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.In expressing our unyielding solidarity with and support for the Palestinian people  we commend the role played by the Palestine Liberation Organization in guiding the struggle for freedom. The uprising  intifada  which has lasted for a year new  demonstrates once more that no price is too dear to pay for freedom and liberty. The situation remains explosive  it calls for urgent action. We endorse the call for an international conference on the Middle East  as we must insist that such a conference stands a better chance of securing peace for the region if only it recognizes the centrality of the Palestinian question in the overall Middle East problem. And  with this objective in view  the Palestine Liberation Organization must be allowed to play a key  definitive part in the Conference. Tanzania welcomed the acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1988) and the cease-fire agreement between Iran and Iraq. We are gratified that a destructive war  which has claimed millions of lives and billions of dollars in property  is now finally being brought to an end. We commend the political courage of the leaders of both countries in agreeing to give a chance to a peaceful settlement of their dispute. By accepting a United Nations mediation role  the two countries have rekindled the spirit of the United Nations Charter and ushered in a new era of tolerance and  we hope  negotiations in the near future on permanent arrangements for peace and co-operation. We must urge them to remain committed to the restoration of peace and stability in the Gulf. The road to reconciliation and economic reconstruction will not be easy. We urge perseverance and call upon the international community to assist in these efforts  especially in ensuring that the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (1Ð¨1Ð0Ð¡) discharges its responsibilities effectively.We are encouraged by the resumption of the in intercommunal talks in Cyprus within the framework of the good offices of the Secretary-General  The continued division of that country and the mounting tension can only precipitate fratricidal conflict. We call upon the leaders of both the Turkish and the Greek communities to exercise restraint and assist the Secretary-General in his mediation efforts to bring about a lasting solution within the framework of the territorial integrity  independence and n on--aligned character of Cyprus.We note that in Afghanistan the withdrawal of foreign troops has continued as scheduled. We hope that the same spirit will be demonstrated in the coming and more complex task of elaborating mechanisms for national reconciliation  national economic reconstruction and the restoration of peace  territorial integrity and the country's non-alignment. Ws urge the parties to the Geneva agreement  as well as the guarantors  to ensure that the agreement is implemented in its entirety and that permanent peace quickly returns to that country.The Korean peninsula continues to be an area of simmering conflict. Occupation forces remain  yet 40 years of occupation have not diminished the fighting spirit and longing for unity of the Korean people. Tanzania calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the area and the promotion of a climate which will lead to the reunification of Korea.Regarding Kampuchea  my Government has been encouraged by the resumption of dialogue as evidenced by the recent Jakarta Informal Meeting. In commending the efforts of the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  we call upon the different factions involved to place first Â¿he interests of their country and people and agree on a Government of national unity.The problems of Central America continue to defy solution. Conditions in the region have continued to deteriorate as internal conflicts  foreign interference and aggression have increased. Indeed  despite sustained diplomatic efforts by the countries of the region and the international community  peace is not in sight; rather  we are witnessing the flame of hope lit by the signing of a cease-fire agreement in Nicaragua  and the understanding on a comprehensive peace settlement in the region early this year  flicker in the face of opposition by the United States Government. Naturally we share the anxiety and anguish of the Central American people for they have been unduly subjected to gratuitous suffering and deprivation for too long. In the search for peace it is imperative that the politics of force and threats of confrontation and war to abandoned. The countries of the region must seek solutions that take into account the real nature of their problems and reject prescriptions grafted from outside or imposed through economic pressure and military or other force. We note positively that those countries  through the Contadora process and in particular the Guatemala peace plan  have recognized the importance of a regional approach to the problems of the region. By rejecting the ideological fixations which place the problems of the region in the arena of East-West confrontation and seeking instead solutions more in tune with their needs  those countries have taken a new direction towards a more stable and lasting peace. We commend the perseverance of all parties involved and call upon the international community to help these countries sustain the dialogue that has been initiated. In particular we call upon all those interested in the region to desist from actions which undermine the peace process and place its future in jeopardy.As the world attempts to grapple with these regional problems  other problems of an economic and security nature have persisted  and while in some areas we have recorded encouraging signals the situation overall regains delicate.In the field of armaments the world stands to record the highest military expenditures  at a time when the majority of the world population is threatened by economic problems  arising from a multitude of economic factors  a handful of countries are spending more than a trillion dollars on instruments of war alone.Last year the world was at one in welcoming the signing between the United States and the Soviet Union of a Treaty on the elimination of their intermediate-range and shorter-range nuclear forces - the INF Treat/. It did so because of the promise the Treaty held for the future. Insignificant as it was in terms of the numerical count of the warheads covered  the Treaty was applauded for Its political value. It was judged to be important in enabling the two super-Powers to cross an important psychological barrier. The Treaty demonstrated that  given political will  it is possible not only to halt the arms race but also  in a sense  to begin the process of reversing it. Given the optimism generated by the INF Treaty  much was expected of tee Moscow summit meeting. But despite what was obviously a favourable political climate It proved impossible to expand on the gains of the Washington summit meeting and agree on more concrete and substantial reductions. â note none the less that there was an expression of commitment want to a 50-per-cent reduction in strategic offensive systems and to the negotiation of a nuclear test-ban regime - even though on a phased approach   a urge the two super-Powers to take advantage of the current political warmth to negotiate deeper cuts and to broaden the scope of their negotiations to cover other areas.My country  together with Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico and Sweden  continues to co-operate in the six-nation peace initiative. Our countries have united in a common belief that the non-nuclear-weapon States have a duty and a right to demand a halt to the arms race. We can no longer be satisfied by repeated promises  which have only moved the world closer to a nuclear war. In their Stockholm Declaration of January this year the leaders of the six countries reiterated their call for a comprehensive nuclear-test ban and the prohibition of the extension of the arms race into outer space.We believe that verification has a central role to play in all disarmament agreements. In particular if such a role were entrusted to the United Nations it would enhance mutual confidence among the parties and encourage the exploration of expanded areas of agreement. The proposal of the Six for the establishment of an integrated multilateral verification body within the United Nations system remains. We hope that more countries will come around and accord it the necessary support.While there has been co-operation on the bilateral level we regret that the multilateral forum - namely the Conference on Disarmament - has been hamstrung. The paralysis now gripping the Conference  largely camouflaged behind the rule of consensus  has prevented the initiation of negotiations on crucial matters such as a comprehensive test ban and the prevention of the arms race in outer space. We must express our deep regret that despite public expressions of support some countries have steadily undermined the efficacy of the United Nations multilateral- negotiating forums on disarmament Tanzania believes that our pursuit of peace  is closely linked to the struggle for development. These two ideals  which are among the pillars of our political philosophy and foreign policy cannot be fruitfully pursued independently of each other. We need peace to develop  as we need development to preserve peace. That is why we continue to affirm that there is an organic link between disarmament and development.	..In June this year the General Assembly convened in a third special session devoted to disarmament. I need not labour the point that the failure of the session was the direct result of active Opposition on the one hand and permissive silence on the other by some developed countries. But the smokescreen of the so-called new realities cannot avail and procrastination simply multiplies the risks of an escalating arms race. Disarmament cannot be prescribed as the prerogative of a few countries  however powerful their arsenals. Certainly effective disarmament can be realized only by the participation and co-operation of the whole community of nations.	Â·	We have in recent months witnessed the phenomenon of the dumping of nuclear and industrial toxic waste in the African continent. We deplore the callous action of those companies or individuals from the industrialized countries who have sought to turn Africa into a garbage dump for hazardous toxic and radioactive  wastes. It is morally wrong to take advantage of the economic weakness of the least developed countries  the majority of which are in Africa  and we call upon the international community  and in particular the International Atomic Energy Agency  to institute a regime of measures end norms to arrest this dangerous development not only in Africa but throughout the world. From Tanzania's standpoint  it is a matter of regret that the progress witnessed in the last few years on the diplomatic and political fronts has not been reflected in the world economic climate. This continues to be characterized by the imbalances and instabilities illustrated by growth in the industrial economies' and decline in the third-world economies. The sum result of these trends is the accelerated impoverishment of the third world. Africa provides the starkest contrast. As the mid-term review of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  1986-1990 indicated  African countries are generally poorer today than they were two years ago. Their debts continue to rise as do the interest rates attendant upon them  commodity prices continue to fall and there is the incredible spectacle of a net outflow of resources from Africa.We in Africa can no longer be faulted on the old grounds. As the Secretary-General's report has indicated  many African countries have embarked upon the necessary policy reforms and financial adjustments. We have bought all the prescriptions but our health has further deteriorated. The facts and the logic are incontrovertible. The internal factors inexorably called for Africa's Priority Programme for Economic Recovery. We believe the experiences of the last two years just as inexorably call for the tackling of the external factors. There is now a clear case for a global structural adjustment programme leading to a new international economic order - or whatever we may choose to call it. Third-world economic disenfranchisement cannot for long sustain first-world development. There is yet opportunity to correct these imbalances and inequities. In addition to individual national adjustment programmes calling for external support; African countries have called for the holding of an international conference on African debt. The initiative of last June's economic summit on the debt of the poorest developing countries needs to be carried further. The Uruguay Round roust be negotiated with greater concern for the trading needs of the developing countries. Effective attendance at the debt conference and the Uruguay Round negotiations will produce solutions which will not only arrest the decline in the economic fortunes of the poor countries  but will also give a human face to the concept of international co-operation and interdependence.Attempts to monopolize the search for solutions of global and regional problems in the last few years have failed. This experience underscores all the more the centrality of the United Nations in world affairs  for it has reminded us that the United Nations offers a unique forum within which to evolve strategies for coexistence  accommodation and mutually beneficial co-operation. In this worthy and common enterprise Tanzania will continue to give its unqualified support to the United Nations and its agencies.	'"
"141",7098,"UGA",43,1988,"I should like most sincerely to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election as President  which is a well-deserved recognition of his personal qualities and record of great distinction in the service of his country and the international community as well as a fitting tribute to the role and stature of Argentina in world affairs. We bring to the presidency a wealth of wisdom and political and diplomatic experience. We are confident he will make a decisive contribution to the success of our deliberations.I wish also to place on record our sincere appreciation of Mr. Peter Florin  who presided over the forty-second session with impartiality and great distinction.I should also like to take this opportunity to express my delegation's gratitude and admiration to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier PÃ©rez de Cuellar. In recent years this Organization has faced many challenges and daunting problems  including a clear retreat from multilateralism  which threatens its very viability. But the Secretary-General never wavered from his resolve to ensure that the Organization would play its rightful role. With patience and tenacity he provided the requisite leadership and successfully reversed this trend and restored the United Nations to the centre of the world stage. The Secretary-General took initiatives to involve the United Nations in the resolution of many conflicts ranging from the Iran-Iraq war  to Afghanistan  the Western Sahara and southern Africa  to mention just a few. The peace agreements mediated by the United Nations have given a critical boost to the Organization's capacity to face the multiple challenges facing the world. They have resulted in the renewal of confidence and indeed of a realization that the United Nations is an irreplaceable multilateral forum for harmonizing international actions to handle the global problems of our time. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces last month is testimony to this climate. Today the international scene shows signs of improvement which offer us both challenges and opportunities. The relations between the super-Powers  which often have great impact on the international political environment  have relaxed. On the horizon we can see a faint outline of a peaceful world. The scientific and technological developments achieved  if well utilized  could help mankind to tame nature  conquer poverty and promote development. Yet amidst these encouraging developments  the world continues to be plagued by a number of political and multi faceted economic crises. These dismal realities that still plague us and the dangerous anomalies existing in the present international situation serve as a warning to us that all is not yet well in spite of our optimism.In South Africa  we have an oppressive system and a Government whose callousness and viciousness is unparalleled in human history both in its intensity and the length of time it has endured. The regime poses three major challenges to the international community  namely  the independence and freedom of Namibia  apartheid in South Africa and the destabilization of the neighbouring African countries.The right of a people to self-determination  sovereignty and independence is a fundamental non-negotiable human right and the universal quest of mankind. Regrettably  in Namibia this right continues to be trampled on by South Africa in arrogant defiance of the international community and the United Nations. It is now 22 years since South Africa's mandate over Namibia was terminated. The adoption by the Security Council of resolution 435 (1978)  which contained the only universally agreed plan for the independence of Namibia and which was sponsored by the Contact Group of five  gave us hope at the time that the independence of Namibia was imminent. Resolution 435 (1973)  however  remains unimplemented. Right from the onset  the implementation of the United Nations Plan was undermined  frustrated and scuttled by South Africa's intransigence and duplicity. The South African regime hatched on  pretext after another  as it carried out provocation after provocation against the neighbouring States to create ostensible excuses to remain in Namibia and ignore the obligations it had undertaken to abide by resolution 435 (1978).Successive attempts to finalize arrangements for the emplacement of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia have since then been blocked by South Africa's continuing to hold Namibia's independence hostage to linkage with the extraneous issue of the presence of Cuban troops in Angola. The question of Namibia is essentially a decolonization problem  whereas the presence of Cuban troops in Angola is purely a bilateral arrangement  legitimately entered into between Angola and Cuba under Article 51 of the Charter. Angolan and Cuban troops have never crossed over to South Africa. On the contrary  it is South African forces which invaded the southern part of Angola and for a long time occupied that territory. It was in the first instance due to this invasion and occupation by the South African army that Angola had to seek the assistance of Cuba. It is  therefore  ridiculous to put the victim in the dock  or to equate him with the aggressor  or to demand that the victim must not be entitled to seek assistance in self-defence for its survival. The General Assembly  in its numerous decisions  and the Security Council in resolution 566 (1985)  categorically rejected the linkage concept. Yet even at this time p linkage continues to be propagated both expressly and implicitly as a pretext to slow down the emplacement of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group and deny the Namibian people their independence.In his report the Secretary-General struck a note of optimism in regard to the current talks on Angola and Namibia when he stated: ""There has been an improvement in prospects for the independence of Namibia. Recent diplomatic activity has made a significant contribution to the peace process in southern Africa  which should facilitate a settlement in Namibia without further delay. The date of 1 November 1988  has been recommended for beginning the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). In the light of these developments  the Secretariat has undertaken a review of its contingency plans in order to hold itself in readiness for the timely emplacement of the United Nations Transition Group in Namibia. It is my hope that current efforts will finally succeed in bringing independence to the people of Namibia."" (A/43/1  p. 3)My delegation welcomes the report in the hope that this time the parties involved  in particular South Africa  are taking the Secretary-General seriously and are not giving him and  through him  the entire international community  false expectations.Caution here is necessary  given the past conduct of the South African racist regime  which once raised the hopes of the international community only to have them suddenly dashed. This was the case at about this time of the year in 1980  when presidential elections in the host country  a member of the Contact Group of Five  were about to take place. As the pre-implementation talks of February 1981 demonstrated  South Africa's promise to begin the implementation of resolution 435 (1978) turned out to be a hoax. It is our sincere hope that we are not being made the victims of yet another hoax  but that we are about to witness the emplacement of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) as the beginning of the complete and immediate decolonization of Namibia.Much as we would like to be optimistic about Namibia's independence  we must realize that the whole South African problem derives from apartheid. We continue to witness the South African regime's hostility towards its neighbours  and to wonder whether the apartheid regime will allow Namibia to be truly independent.It is our view that the international community  the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and its allies should guard against the challenge in the likely event that the apartheid regime again pulls the rug from under us. To this end my delegation fully endorses the efforts of the Secretary-General to set a well-manned UNTAG in place in Namibia  and urges the international community to support all necessary steps aimed at guaranteeing the sovereignty and viability of independent Namibia.Namibia is a unique responsibility of the United Nations. It is therefore imperative that any negotiations regarding the implementation of resolution 435 (1978) should be within the framework of the United Nations. It is equally important that SWAPO  as the legitimate representative of the Namibian people  should be directly involved in such talks.In South Africa itself the people continue to suffer under the inhuman practices of racism  repression  deprivation and State terrorism. For the last three years the South African regime has stepped up terror. South Africa is under a state of emergency which in effect amounts to martial law intended to muzzle the press  escalate arbitrary mass arrests  carry out detentions without trial  torture and the killing of many innocent South Africans  including women and children. However the much-touted military superiority of the racist regime is clearly under serious challenge and stress. We have seen for the first time whites revolting against conscription into the South African Defence Force. Draft evasion among whites has reached a level that has begun to worry the Pretoria regime. Recently  the leaders of 143 draft evaders declared their determination to stand firm against compulsory military service and identified the South African Defence Force as the linchpin of the system of apartheid. They realize that serving in the South African Defence Force is not the way to contribute to peace in their country and the region as a whole. The Dutch Reformed Church which gave apartheid its philosophical underpinning has been forced to disavow the system as being incompatible with Christian beliefs and morality. The increased divisions within the Afrikaner establishment in South Africa are a manifestation of the continued success of the liberation struggle. The racist regime is at war with its own people.We are often warned that if the South Africans continue to fight this war of resistance  the South African apartheid regime ""will continue its descent into a siege mentality and become a garrison state in which all South Africans will be losers"". Of course there is a price to pay for freedom. The Charter of the United Nations was bought for such a peace. People in the whole world  including those who didn't know exactly what was at stake  were mobilized to fight the Second World War. The loss and human suffering were great but the ultimate achievements were worth the resistance. In South Africa  however  we are told this is different even to mention sanctions is taboo.The international community can no longer stand by and let the South African racist regime  directly or through its surrogates  continue to commit acts of aggression and economic sabotage against neighbouring States  with the clear intent of intimidating them into perpetual subordination. My delegation takes this opportunity to put on record Uganda's appreciation of the front-line States for the immense sacrifice they continue to make in the struggle against apartheid. We appeal to the international community to increase economic support for the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC).The conflict occasioned by apartheid has given rise to a tragedy of enormous proportions resulting in a massive displacement and exodus of people as refugees. UNICEF in its report entitled  ""Children on the Frontline - the impact of apartheid  destabilisation and warfare on the children in southern and South Africa"" chronicled and portrayed this grim reality. This August in Oslo  Norway  an international conference was convened to address this very problem. We are very appreciative of those who have provided relief assistance to the refugees and displaced persons. However  this assistance can only be a palliative: as long as apartheid remains  the tragedy will continue to unfold. Our obligation is to put an end to this crime against humanity.The fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a timely reminder that the apartheid system is the very essence of the practices against which the Declaration was directed. That such a system flourishes in our midst is a strong indictment of all those who  through their actions or omissions  have contributed to its survival.It is 50 years since that infamous Munich conference where  in face of the danger posed by the Nazis to the rest of the world  a fragile peace agreement was signed in 1938 in order to appease Hitler. It turned out to be a costly mistake and the price paid was the Second World War. The lesson learned then was that it does not pay to appease a bully or  more so  a group which believes in the idea of a superior race. It is instructive to note that when the world realized the danger the Hitler regime posed  it took up arms against that sea of troubles and by opposing it  ended it. The apartheid regime in South Africa poses a precisely similar danger and calls for concerted action by the international community.We submit that apartheid cannot be reformedÂ·  it must be dismantled. The conduct of the Pretoria regime; within South Africa  as well as in Namibia  and its acts of aggression against the front-line States clearly fall within the purview of Article 39 of the Charter. The imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions is clearly an imperative and it may be the only peaceful way left to eradicate apartheid.We welcome the positive developments in another crisis area in Africa  namely  Western Sahara. The peace Agreement which both Morocco and POLISARIO have accepted should pave the way to ending a situation which is fraught with conflict and thus complete the process of the decolonization of Western Sahara. We hail the efforts of the Secretary-General and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in this regard. We call on the international community to support the Secretary-General and the OAU in implementing the Agreement.We also welcome the accord and normalization of relations between Ethiopia and Somalia  on the one hand  and between the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Chad  on the other. These are indeed positive developments in our region. We equally welcome the cease-fire and the silencing of the guns between Iran and Iraq. The war has exacted a heavy toll on the lives and resources of the two countries. The task of reconciliation is enormous. We urge the parties to ensure that the truce holds and that they move speedily to the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). Uganda remains concerned with regard to the situation in the Middle East. The people of Palestine continue to languish without a homeland of their own. In flagrant defiance of the international community  Israel continues to consolidate its hold on the occupied Arab territories. The people of Palestine  in the face of oppressive measures by Israel  refuse to be cowed. They have continued to fight against and challenge the occupation. The uprisings that have been going on since December 1987 are clear testimony to their resolve to defend their inalienable rights. Instead of heeding the call of the international community to vacate the occupied Arab territories  Israel has chosen to respond with brutal force. All this constitutes a sad chapter in the seemingly endless tragedy of the Palestinian people. Israel needs no reminder that General Assembly resolution 181 II  which set up the State of Israel  also set up a Palestinian Arab State. The United Nations has a duty to implement that resolution.As always  Uganda calls for Israel's unconditional withdrawal from the Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem. The people of Palestine  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization their sole and authentic representative  have an inalienable right to self-determination and to an independent State of Palestine.I wish to stress our continued support for General Assembly resolution 38/58 C which calls for the early convening of the International Conference on the Middle East. We are convinced that such a conference would provide a unique opportunity and platform for the achievement of a just and lasting solution of the crisis.With regard to Afghanistan  Uganda welcomes the Geneva Agreements  which offer the Afghan people an opportunity to resolve their problems. All the parties concerned ought scrupulously to abide by the provisions of the Agreements.We are likewise encouraged by developments in Kampuchea  where one can discern a movement towards resolving the conflict by peaceful means. Our position with regard to the division of Korea has never changed. We fully support the aspirations of the people of that divided country for peaceful reunification without outside interference.We have also been encouraged by the Secretary-General's report on the question of Cyprus  in which he indicates that there are good prospects for success in the inter-communal talks. I wish to reiterate Uganda's continued support for the sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of Cyprus.With regard to Central America  we believe that the Arias plan contained in the Guatemala agreement of last year  provides a basis for the resolution of the conflict in that region. The people of the region should be left to negotiate the solution of their problems without outside interference or intimidation. The sovereignty and independence of each country in the region must be respected.One of the most pressing issues of our time is the prevention of war  particularly a war involving the use of nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons pose a danger to all countries since there can be no sanctuary for any State in the case of nuclear fall-out. Therefore the calls for general disarmament and for the elimination of nuclear weapons remain issues of great importance to all countries. There have been promising developments over the past year. Perhaps the roost significant development in this area is the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty. The agreement was readied after over a decade of dangerous tension in super-Power relations  which had rendered our planet a more dangerous place. We therefore welcome and applaud this agreement.However  we must caution that the INF Treaty  has only a small quantitative effect on the nuclear threat. The number of weapons to be eliminated by both sides is less than 5 per cent of the total number of nuclear weapons deployed. The main significance of the Treaty is not military rather it represents a substantial concession on the political and strategic postures of the two super-Powers. If the Treaty is to fulfil its significant historic meaning  it should provide a springboard for more bilateral and multilateral negotiations and for the improvement of world security. It is Imperative to pursue negotiations for the gradual reduction of strategic weapons and ensure the prevention of an arms race in space.Nuclear disarmament and conventional weapons disarmament are complementary aspects of the objective of general and complete disarmament. The global prevalence of conventional weapons  the high incidence of their use since the Second World War  coupled with the demands they make on the resources of developing countries  require urgent action to curb them. At the regional level  we can create the necessary climate for the reduction of conventional weapons by adopting appropriate confidence-building measures.We had hoped that the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament would agree on a programs  that would accelerate the momentum of the disarmament process. Regrettably  at that session the Assembly was not able to agree on a final document. That should not  however  deter us from making further efforts Inasmuch as there was agreement on many issues.We  in Africa  have opted for a nuclear-free zone and most of our countries are States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. But our efforts to that end have been frustrated by the continued nuclear collaboration between the racist regime of South Africa  Israel and certain nuclear countries. South Africa has admitted publicly that it is now capable of producing nuclear weapons. As I have had the occasion to state before  collaborating with South Africa in this regard is indefensible. We believe that nuclear energy should be used for peaceful purposes only. We therefore continue to hope that the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Economic Commission for Africa will join with the Organisation of African Unity in facilitating the holding of the seminar on this subject planned to take place in Uganda next year.The manufacture  supply and use of chemical weapons is  in our view  a criminal offence and a violation of fundamental human rights  particularly the right to life. Those weapons kill indiscriminately. We urge all the Members of this Organization  individually and collectively  to adopt concrete measures to ban the production  supply and use of those deadly weapons.For a considerable period of time  toxic waste  including nuclear waste  produced in the industrialized countries  has been dumped in developing countries. We  in Africa  refuse to accept that our continent be used as a cesspool for this dangerous Industrial garbage. We support the enactment of a convention to make such dumping an international crime. Those who engage  collaborate or conspire in this practice should be condemned and punished.It should by now be self-evident that disarmament is inextricably linked with development. It is a sad commentary on our times that we live in a world that spends over 31 trillion a year on armaments. That amount is equivalent to the total indebtedness of the developing countries with its attendant deprivation and misery. That the resources of the world are being used to destroy rather than to improve the welfare of mankind is an eloquent summary of human folly. It is our hope that the recent relaxation of tension will usher in a period in which those resources will be diverted to development.The contours of the world political landscape seem to have changed for the better over the past year in total contrast to the picture with regard to the economic situation. The international economic system remains inherently iniquitous. The grim reality is that the present world structure preserves and perpetuates the oasis of privilege and affluence in the desert of dearth and deprivation. It is a situation that causes concern and has grave implications for the future. The developing countries continue to be confronted with harsh circumstances. They are faced with an astronomical debt burden  the contraction of world trade and deteriorating terms of trade.Most developing countries have hitherto relied on the export of primary commodities for their income. But over the last 10 years prices of these products have continued to decline and have now almost collapsed. Yet the prices of imports of manufactured goods from industrialized countries  required as production inputs  continue to escalate. The net effect is a scandalous net outflow of resources from the impoverished South to the affluent North resulting in further balance-of-payments difficulties  unfavourable terms of trade and the inescapable resort to borrowing from the North. Those of us from the South should also take â serious note of the fact that as long as the North continues to fix the prices of our products as well as the prices of their products the sea of poverty  hunger  disease and malnutrition is likely to continue to enlarge. It is therefore incumbent upon us to unite for existence. We can no longer tolerate a situation where the reward for the hard work of our people is hunger. To address the problem  developing countries have been asked by the North and its financial institutions to undertake structural adjustment measures. The measures they have been forced to take are severe. They adversely affect their development prospects in the face of the harsh economic environment. Governments have to face the social and political tension arising therefrom. These measures have not yielded the desired results. They are  moreover  frustrated by increased protectionism in the developed countries  sharply reduced returns from our export commodity earnings and the ever-mounting debt trap. This is a critical economic situation in Africa.When the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990  there were great expectations as to the impact of the programme. But to date the economic situation in Africa continues to deteriorate despite the economic reform efforts that have been undertaken at heavy social and political cost. Available financial resources continue to be insufficient to ensure sustained economic recovery and growth in our continent. The inappropriately designed and externally driven short-term stabilization/structural adjustment programmes have become the hallmark of internationally supported reforms in Africa. Meanwhile  net resource outflows from Africa have increased due to the interrelated problems of dealing with export earnings  diminishing real resource inflows  and the crippling debt-servicing burden.	.We are now witnessing the ugly indicators of the scourge of reduced investment in the social sectors: a substantial fall in school enrolment  especially at the primary level  combined with a sharp increase in the brain drain  the highest incidence of infant mortality in the world and countless millions of lives at risk due to the re-emergence of diseases long thought to be extinct. Indeed  in the absence of positive economic growth  adjustment programmes in Africa have become politically inexplicable  socially unacceptable and economically unattainable.For Africa or any other developing region  it is inverted logic and inadmissible practice to sacrifice real long-term development and prosperity to theoretically perceived short-term and short-lived macro-balances. While the role of market forces in the efficient allocation of resources is critical ideologically based policy generalizations distort reality and should never be allowed to influence the direction of economic reforms.We believe that for the long-terra structural transformation of Africa the need for viable alternatives to the traditional adjustment must be addressed. lb build viable economies in our continent it is imperative to base such growth on the transfer of science and technology  reliance on favourable trading arrangements  the effective deepening of subregional and regional economic integration  and establishing the supremacy of the human being in economic development.At $200 billion  Africa's outstanding debt looks relatively small compared to the estimated 01.2 trillion total debt stock of developing countries. Africa's average debt-service ratio  however  estimated at 60 per cent average  exceeds 100 per cent for a number of countries. In December 1987  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) extraordinary summit meeting set out a common position on specific measures and modalities for tackling the African debt problem  within the framework of an integrated and co-operative development-oriented strategy  based on a dialogue of co-operation and shared responsibilities. We hope that the creditors and the international community as a whole will give the necessary support to the African initiative for a North-South dialogue on all pressing issues.We should carefully restructure our trade and financial linkages so that our own markets can act as a motor for our own development. We are therefore encouraged by the global system of trade preferences scheme which has been adopted by the non-aligned countries and the initiatives being undertaken by the South Commission. In our own subregion of eastern and southern Africa the preferential trade area has deliberately embarked on the path of regional economic co-operation to this end. The United Nations has a vital role to play in the world of tomorrow. It should therefore be strengthened for this purpose. We accept reforms where these are intended to achieve the rationalization and better use of resources. Member States of the Organization should  however  be on guard to see that reform is not used to weaken the Organization  or to challenge and compromise the multilateral role assigned to it by the Charter  In his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General has eloquently cautioned: ""For a country  large or small  to turn its back  to whatever extent  on the United Nations would be to surrender a good part of its actual or potential influence. To follow a two-track policy - at one level  to owe allegiance to the Charter and  at the other  to seek to marginalize the United Nations - would be to act contrary to the goal of harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of their common ends "" (A/43/1  p  8)As we mark the fortieth anniversary of that immutable Universal Declaration of Human Rights  we commend the Secretary-General for his efforts in promoting human rights through the creation of advisory services which Governments  including that of Uganda  have taken advantage of. It is important to remind ourselves that a cardinal objective of the United Nations spelt out in the Charter is to ensure the full enjoyment of fundamental human rights  the respect  dignity and worth of the human person and the promotion of social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. The Declaration proclaims in Article 25(1): ""Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family  including food  clothing  housing and medical care and necessary social services  and the right to security in the event of unemployment  sickness  disability  widowhood  old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control "" Article 28 further states:""Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized."" As we prepare to enter the next millennium  the fulfilment of these objectives remains the challenge facing us in the next decade. It is imperative for us to ponder whether we shall bequeath to coming generations an international order that guarantees the total fulfilment of the rights proclaimed  in their entirety. The perpetuation of underdevelopment leads to lack of job opportunities  to poverty  disease and social deprivation. That situation becomes a breeding ground for dicta tots  for conflicts and wars and for violations of human rights. It is at this stage that the international community starts to deal with the symptoms - refugees  famine relief  and so on. The whole scene becomes a tragicomedy in which the poor keep chasing the mirage called development.The United Nations is currently formulating a development strategy for the 1990s. It is imperative that that strategy be people-oriented. It should aim at bringing about development with a human face and the international order envisaged by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We maintain that the right to development is a fundamental human right. We should not construct the edifice of the world of tomorrow in such a way that we end up with a few people moving towards a post-industrial revolution while the overwhelming majority remain trapped in a state of underdevelopment and poverty. Such a configuration would be a recipe for perpetual insecurity  for a world without peace. That is the challenge to the Unite d Nations."
"142",7145,"UKR",43,1988,"ï»¿I should like  through you. Sir  to extend to Mr. Dante Caputo our congratulations on his election to the important post of President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session and our sincere wishes for all possible success in carrying out his responsible and difficult duties.I wish to pay a tribute to the representative of the German Democratic Republic  Mr. Peter Florin  for his able guidance of the work of the General Assembly during the past year.The general debate has been going on for nearly two weeks. The diverse and varied conclusions and assessments expressed by delegations in their statements describing present-day international relations share one common feature: the present state of these relations is characterized as encouraging for the achievement of new  real and positive results. Joint efforts have fulfilled the first prerequisites for limiting the arms race  reducing the threat of nuclear war and settling protracted regional conflicts.The will and readiness of the USSR and the United States to begin actual nuclear disarmament are of paramount importance.Progress in nuclear disarmament has undoubtedly given an impetus to the working out of specific measures for the limitation and elimination of other means of warfare. It is impossible to deny the relationship between disarmament and the strengthening of international security. New political thinking is increasingly becoming the dominant reality of today's world and steadily making headway through the barriers of enmity and suspicion.In his address to the session of the USSR Supreme Soviet on 1 October 1988  the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  Mikhail Gorbachev  said:""Our policy in international affairs is clear. It is aimed at eliminating the threat of nuclear catastrophe  normalising international relations  establishing equal and mutually beneficial relations among countries and peoples of the world  achieving broad-bas e d co-operation in various areas and ensuring each people the right to a free choice of its future ... We shall continue to follow this policy unswervingly.""While emphasizing the significance of peaceful coexistence as the highest universal principle ensuring mankind's progress in security  we believe that the Internationalisation of the efforts of States faced with global challenges and the joining of their forces for the protection of common human values constitute another pillar of universal security. Ito act from positions of reason and realism and to strive persistently to find generally acceptable solutions  no matter how difficult that may seem - that is the imperative of our time. Pluralism of Interests  the principle of freedom of choice  the priority of shared human values and the primacy of international law cannot be ignored in international affairs.In this sense  the importance of the United Nations can hardly be overestimated. Throughout the existence of the Organization  the Ukrainian SSR has consistently supported the most effective implementation of its function of maintaining peace and security  as enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Our delegation believes that the enhanced role and authority of the United Nations will make it possible to move successfully towards a comprehensive system of international security  thus providing for a gradual process of demilitarization  democratization and humanisation of international relations and the achievement of the security of States on the basis of political interaction and unconditional compliance with international obligations in all spheres - military  political  economic  ecological and humanitarian. A comprehensive system of international security should be worked out on the basis of the Charter and in strict compliance with Its principles.The extensive discussion of these problems in the United Nations testifies to their urgency and importance. The concept proposed by the socialist countries is not a dogma. We are open to all constructive proposals on the subject from any State.The Ukrainian delegation believes that the forty-third session of the General Assembly can make a substantive contribution to a businesslike discussion of the concept of comprehensive security. We hope that this session will step-up the search for common approaches by states to specific aspects of world security. The objective is to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations and its principal bodies  to enhance the role of the Secretary-General  inter alia in the settlement of conflicts between States through negotiations  good offices and mediation  and to make better use of military observers and United Nations peace-keeping forces. United Nations actions in this area should be developed and expanded. It was with great satisfaction that we learned of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. We believe that these forces will continue to be worthy of this trust and this honour. We are firmly convinced that the United Nations should play a decisive role in mankind's progress towards a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world. It is important to ensure in practice that the United Nations and its bodies are effective in implementing their function of maintaining peace and security. It is our view that the political conditions now exist for the full realization of the peace-making potential of the United Nations in accordance with its Charter.The main road to comprehensive security lies through disarmament. We note as a very positive sign the emerging understanding of the need to adopt a comprehensive approach to disarmament issues  combining a strengthening of confidence and the establishment of an affective verification mechanism with the preparation of realistic programmes for the reduction and elimination of specific types of armaments  based on a balance of Interests rather than a balance of forces. Nuclear disarmament is the most important part of the disarmament process. An early agreement on a 50 per cent cut in the strategic offensive arms of the Soviet Union and the United States is among the urgently necessary measures leading to this goal. Unquestionably  this problem is not a simple one. It is probably the most complicated problem in the post-war world politics. However  given the necessary political will on both sides  a treaty could be concluded in the near future.The world community should concentrate on making nuclear disarmament a continuous  ever-growing and deepening process. Only through joint efforts by all States will it be possible to eliminate nuclear weapons completely and guarantee that they will never reappear. We believe that to this end the potential of the United Nations  especially of the Security Council  should be used to the maximum extent  and that better use should be made of all existing negotiating mechanisms  including that most important body  the Conference on Disarmament.In practical terms  it is necessary to concentrate on implementing United Nations decisions on key problems associated with curbing the arms race - particularly those measures adopted by consensus. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR shares many of the ideas contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization in 1988 and considers particularly pertinent his comment that""... the great Powers need to show a sensitivity to the expressed wishes of the majority of Member States."" (A/43/1  p. 8)The noble goal of ridding mankind of weapons of mass destruction will remain an empty dream if weapons are not effectively barred from outer space. Therefore  no attempts to establish a need for the strategic defence initiative can be accepted  from either the moral point of view or that of strengthening security. Much has been said  at this rostrum and elsewhere  about its non-defensive and destabilizing nature and its serious dangers for all mankind.The Ukrainian SSR believes that compliance with the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems (ABM)  signed in 1972  and the commitment not to withdraw from it for specified period guarantee world stability  the successful solution of the problems of strategic offensive weapons and greater international security. It is important that this be reflected in the agreement currently being negotiated in Geneva between the Soviet Union and the United States  in strict conformity with the Washington understanding of 10 December 1987.We also favour supplementing the bilateral negotiations between the USSR and the United States with effective multilateral efforts  in the framework of the Conference on Disarmament  to prevent an arms race in outer space. Today the interests of common security dictate that we work actively on agreements to ban all anti-satellite weapons  ensure the immunity of artificial earth satellites  and institute an international system to verify that no arms of any kind are placed in outer space.	'At the same time; international mechanisms should be established within the framework of the United Nations which could specifically address the issue of multilateral co-operation in outer spice. A number of initiatives have been advanced in this regard the task now is to implement them. The proposal to set up a centre for international co-operation on the peaceful uses of outer space on the basis of the Krasnoyarsk radar station deserves special attention.A ban on nuclear testing is a key aspect of nuclear disarmament. It is necessary to take one more decisive step to achieve an agreement on a comprehensive and total test ban. If the ongoing negotiations between the USSR and the United States are supplemented by appropriate multilateral efforts in the framework of the Conference on Disarmament  this could bring us very close to completion of an agreement in the Interest of all countries. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR believes that a combination of bilateral and multilateral efforts in this manner will lead to an early  successful solution to this important question.The atom must be used only for peaceful purposes. The socialist countries  rejecting nuclear intimidation  have proposed the concept of using nuclear energy for the benefit of mankind. That concept  in its most concentrated form  is expounded in the programme for the establishment of an international regime for the safe development of nuclear power put forward by the Soviet Union. Implementation of this programme would promote closer international co-operation in the area of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy arid make the work more systematic and purposeful. In this context  the Ukrainian delegation believes that it is important to strengthen further the existing relevant international instruments  while strictly enforcing non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.The international community has come close to resolving the vital question of the conclusion of a universal convention on the complete and comprehensive prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons. This is one of the priority objectives in the field of disarmament. The elimination of chemical Weapons would be a real contribution to ensuring genuine and equal security for States. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR hopes that the General Assembly  at its forty-third session  will direct the efforts of the negotiators towards the early conclusion of the drafting of the convention  and will promote opposition to chemical weapons and their use.	.In our view  the process of disarmament becomes pointless if  at the same time as certain types of arms are eliminated  steps are taken to build up military power or introduce so-called compensation measures. This runs  counter to basic logic. That is why  while giving understandable priority to the elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction  we favour significant cuts in conventional arms and armed forces.On the basis of principle  the position of the socialist countries on the issue was formulated as far back as 198S  in Budapest. It was supplemented and made more specific at a recent meeting in Warsaw of the Political Consultative Committee of the member States of the Warsaw Treaty Organization. The documents of that meeting stress that the interests of European and common security make it imperative to move towards significant cuts in armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe  from the Atlantic to the Urals. Negotiations on this could get under way this year. Their primary objective must be radically to reduce the military potential of both alliances  and to create in the continent a situation in which the countries of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Treaty Organization would retain the forces and means necessary for defence  but insufficient for launching a surprise attack or conducting offensive operations.The more real the disarmament process becomes  the greater the importance that must be given to verification mechanisms  as a vital means of ensuring security. At the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament a number of socialist countries put forward specific proposals for the establishment of broad international verification procedures  under the auspices of the United Nations  to monitor compliance with agreements  reduce international tensions  limit arms and review the military situation in areas of conflict. In our view  we should proceed immediately to develop the main parameters of the future verification mechanism. Confidence and openness are major factors in establishing security in the military sphere. It is necessary to promote a transition from individual confidence-building measures and openness to broad-scale policy in this area. The Ukrainian SSR supports the appeal of the General Assembly to ensure the widest possible dissemination of objective information on military questions. It is time to begin to work out  in the framework of the United Nations  objective criteria and parameters to ensure openness and thus facilitate the process of real disarmament. We actively support disarmament and we believe that demilitarisation will have tangible results for mankind as a whole. Among other things it will help to release vast material and intellectual resources for the purposes of social and economic development.Finding solutions to regional conflicts is a matter of the highest priority and immediate concern for our Organization. We are pleased to note that in recent months there has been a positive movement in some of these areas.A genuine breakthrough has been achieved in resolving the Afghan problem. A precedent has been set that goes far beyond the framework of that question. The prestige of the United Nations has been considerably enhanced and its effectiveness and great potential for settling regional conflicts have been demonstrated.The provisions of the Geneva Agreements elaborated under the auspices of the United Nations must be strictly observed by all parties. As is well known  the Soviet Union fully complies with those Agreements. We expect others to do likewise. The United Nations  and in particular the present session of the General Assembly  is called upon to play an important role in securing a comprehensive and all-round solution to the Afghan problem.The eight-year-long tragic and destructive war between Iran and Iraq has been halted. Thanks to the efforts of the United Nations  its Secretary-General and the members of the Security Council  it has been possible to begin to implement Security Council resolution 598 (1987). It is our hope that the people of Baghdad and Tehran will never again have to look up to the sky with fear or to hear the sound of artillery fire. We hope that tankers will no longer be going up in flames and that fishermen and innocent passengers will no longer be victims of the concentration of naval forces in the waters of the Persian Gulf. The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic welcomes the readiness of the five permanent members of the Security Council to contribute to settling the conflict  with the mediation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.Serious progress has been made in resolving the situation around Kampuchea. It is based on realistic  specific proposals made by the Governments of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Indonesia and other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations  proposals that are aimed at a political settlement of the conflict in the spirit of national reconciliation. In this context  recognition of the Kampuchean people's right to a free social and political choice is of fundamental significance. It is incumbent on all States to promote a favourable political climate for the continuation and fruitful completion of the negotiating process on this issue.There have been certain changes in the situation in southern Africa. The Ukrainian SSR looks for the successful and early completion of the quadripartite negotiations with a view to settling the situation in the region. The international community should exert pressure on the South African racist regime and ensure the implementation of appropriate United Nations resolutions  ' particularly Security Council resolution 435 (1973). The Ukrainian SSR firmly supports the speedy eradication of the shameful system of apartheid.The transition from confrontation to the political settlement of conflicts with the active participation of the United Nations could and must become an important feature of the late 1980s.We believe that during this session of the General Assembly the adoption by consensus of a declaration on the prevention and elimination of disputes and situations that might threaten international peace and security  and on the role of the United Nations in this area  could become a landmark for progress in this direction.At the same time we must note that some regional conflicts have not yet reached the stage of practical settlement and continue seriously to threaten international peace and security. We are particularly concerned about the situation in the Middle East. The conflict in that region can be resolved only through political means. The International Peace Conference on the Middle East could become an effective instrument for a Middle East settlement and  within its framework  a solution to the key Palestinian problem. The Conference should be attended by all parties concerned  including the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  the PLO  and the permanent members of the Security Council. We call on the world community to speak out unambiguously  in the course of the present session of the General Assembly  in favour of the prompt convening of that Conference.The situation in Central America remains a complex one. Interference in the affairs of the States of the region obstructs positive trends towards a peaceful settlement on the basis of the efforts of the Contadora Group. The validity of this conclusion is widely recognized throughout the world  including the United States. The main responsibility for tensions in the region rests with the United States Administration. It should indeed give serious thought to this fact  rather than lecturing others on how and which God to worship. The Nicaraguan people must be given the opportunity to exercise their right to a free choice of their path of development. As in the past  we support the peace-loving initiatives of the Korean People's Democratic Republic. The realization of the Republic's proposals with regard to turning the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-weapon-free zone and with regard to seeking large-scale  stage-by-stage reductions in armed forces and withdrawing United States troops from South Korea would make a tangible contribution to strengthening peace on the Korean peninsula. We strongly oppose intentions of perpetuating the division of Korea.Today there is no need to prove that the elimination of existing crisis situations and the prevention of new ones is the highest priority task of the world community.Another imperative of our time is the prevention of irreversible changes in the environment and the preservation of the planet's natural resources for succeeding generations. This has become an urgent matter both for the international community as a whole and for each of its individual members. The Earth  together with Nature and its resources  is a common heritage. That is why it is essential immediately to change ways of thinking and conduct at national and international levels in order to protect the environment.These objectives could be served by the concept of international ecological security set forth by the socialist countries  which has a clear and practical orientation; to utilize the median ism of the United Nations and begin the elaboration of the norms of ecological behaviour of States and basic guidelines for co-operation in the area. We hope that the United Nations will play a decisive role in mobilizing the efforts of the international common to resolve the task of preserving the environment. The expanding political dialogue on numerous vital problems of concern to mankind creates a rather encouraging background for the development of international economic relations. The state of the world economy continues to be extremely unstable. Of particular concern is the worsening economic situation of the developing countries  which suffer both from their unequal status in the world economic system and from the ever growing volume of foreign debt.The existence of difficulties in international economic relations  which are being further exacerbated  is indicative of the need to democratise the entire system of world economic ties  to establish a new international economic order and to ensure the international economic security of States.In the context of the growing internationalisation of world economic ties and the interdependence of national economies  there is a need for joint action by all countries and peoples to develop stable and predictable international economic exchanges   as well as broad co-operation on an equitable and just basis  in order to ensure for all countries a way of life worthy of man. The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic is in favour of intensifying universal dialogue on international economic policies in the United Nations.The Ukrainian SSR is prepared to co-operate actively with all those who are striving to contribute to the democratization of international relations and to the strengthening of comprehensive security. The profound processes of perestroika  now under way in the Ukraine  as in the entire Soviet Union  envisage intensification of our foreign policy activities on the basis of realism and take into account the diversity of interests and priorities of values common to all mankind. According to First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine  Vladimir V  Shcherbitsky ""perestroika ... is exerting an ever-growing influence on developments in the modern world and  primarily  is creating a favourable situation for the strengthening of international security"".We hope that efforts to create a world founded on reasonable and civilized relations between States and peoples will be supported by all delegations. We believe that the forty-third session of the General Assembly will give a fresh impetus to mankind's progress towards a safer future and will help transform the United Nations Into an effective instrument of peace."
"143",7191,"URY",43,1988,"ï»¿I should like to begin by extending our warmest and most heartfelt congratulations to the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Argentina  Mr. Dante Caputo  upon the occasion of his election to the post of President of the forty-third regular session of the United Nations General Assembly. We consider him to be a friend of our Government and of our people and we recognize his great experience and ability. We can therefore say that his presidency represents an assurance that the work of this Assembly will proceed in an orderly fashion.It is also my pleasure to think Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic for his brilliant and efficient work as President of the Assembly during the previous session. I should also like to express our admiration for the Secretary-General for the efforts that he has been making for peace. His activities  intelligent  prudent and  at the same time  bold  notwithstanding the institutional and financial constraints upon the Organization  have represented an invaluable contribution to the resolution of various regional conflicts and they sure eloquent testimony to the value of the United Nations as a forum and instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security. The lengthy agenda of this session of the General Assembly reflects all the major issues of concern to mankind today. Taken as a whole  it shows that in fulfilling the purposes and principles laid down in Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter 43 years ago  we are continuing resolutely to search for and to safeguard international peace and security  which continue to be the raison d'Ãªtre of the Organization and which determine all its other activities and objectives.Peace has been declared to be a human right. Consequently  all the efforts made to preserve and to restore it are simply the consequences of this right  and the attainment of its objectives becomes a duty for the Organization and all its Member States.Today  as in the past  the efforts for peace call for direct action by the United Nations  which presupposes  in turn  that States must respect certain principles  such as non-intervention  renunciation of the use or threat of force  self-determination  and the peaceful settlement of disputes.Ever since the early years of the United Nations  Uruguay has complied strictly with those principles which underlie the Organization and has promoted respect for them. It has also done everything within its modest means to contribute to the success of the United Nations peace efforts. At this time  as we celebrate the well-deserved awarding of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces  I cannot but recall with pride that Uruguayan officers have been present since 1948 in the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UMOGlP)  and recently in the Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG). Our effective participation in these efforts reflects our unswerving faith in the Organization as an instrument for peace. The progress that the United Nations has made in the cases of Afghanistan  Angola and Namibia  in the Iran-Iraq conflict  and in the question of Western Sahara  must be hailed as a happy resurgence of the capacity for action and the negotiating ability of the organs and mechanisms operating within the framework of the United Nations. We earnestly hope and trust that the processes currently under way will culminate in a just and lasting peace for the nations currently embroiled in conflict.Unfortunately  we cannot be so optimistic with respect to the present situation in Central America and that in the Middle East. In the case of Central America  Uruguay believes that only by full compliance with the Esquipulas II agreements and the Arias Plan  and by strict compliance with the principles of non-interference  self-determination and non-use of force  combined in a process of international democratization in the countries in conflict  will it be possible to achieve a stable peace in the region.Our country has participated in the efforts of the Contadora Support Group with sincere enthusiasm  encouraging the parties to comply with the Esquipulas II agreements  and it is willing to continue to do so because it feels that the pacification and democratization of Central America are essential objectives for the harmonious development of all of Latin America  which is  in the end  an objective that is shared by all.As for the Middle East  it is clear that there can be no lasting peace in the region without recognition of the right to exist of all the States in conflict  and without recognition of the full validity of the principle of self-determination of peoples. But at the same time  we must remember that the rights of those peoples are inexorably linked to the establishment of adequate safeguards  that the borders that have been set  or are to be set in the future  will be duly respected by all. Likewise  the continuation of artificial political divisions  such as those affecting the Korean people  do not contribute to the attainment of lasting peace in the region. At the special session devoted to disarmament  Uruguay confirmed its conviction that the arms race could lead to a world war  and that we must continue the efforts already under way to bring about general and complete disarmament. This is essential for the creation of a climate compatible with the search for peace  in the hope that when this is achieved the resources that today are spent on weapons may be put to constructive uses  such as the economic development of the non-industrialized countries and their technological modernization.Latin America has given the world the example of the Treaty of Tlatelolco  which proscribes the proliferation of nuclear weapons among developing countries  without affecting the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes and scientific and technological progress  in this respect  we emphasize our support for the Declaration of the South Atlantic as a Zone of Peace and Co-operation  and we hope that the zone of peace in the South Pacific will soon become Ä reality as well. We think that the establishment of these zones of peace constitutes a promising attempt to preserve vast stretches of sea and ocean free from the tensions and conflicts that arise from the threat or use of force or from the dangers resulting from the deployment of nuclear weapons.Among the conflicts that are still unresolved  we should like once again to emphasize our position with respect to the Malvinas Islands. Uruguay has supported Argentina's claim of sovereignty over the Islands. But we also are mindful of our historic ties with the United Kingdom  with which Uruguay has maintained relations of friendship and co-operation for over a century. We should like now to reaffirm our willingness to co-operate in the search for solutions to a conflict that  with its recent military events  opened a painful breach throughout Latin America. The wounds must as a matter of urgency be healed through negotiation and dialogue.The world is currently undergoing an unprecedented process of rapid change. We have fully entered the information age and are witnessing the end of the so-called industrial age with no sense of loss. The United Nations must adapt to this process of change in order to be able to continue to fulfil its mission and to ensure the equitable distribution of technological resources and the enjoyment of their benefits by all States. The monopoly of advanced technologies in the hands of a few countries is turning a majority of nations into compulsory purchasers of imported technology. As a result of this  their political sovereignty is as much endangered as it would be by an act of war. Consequently  we need to universalise the availability of the new resources that are being produced through science and technology. This means an attitude of universal openness  on the part of all countries of the world  industrialized and developing  to the free circulation  not only of goods and services  but ultimately of ideas and knowledge.If this objective is not faced with all its political implications  any attempts to overcome the world's current economic and financial crisis will be impossible.Today  we cannot think of the work of the United Nations without thinking of the question of human rights. These never were - and certainly are not today - a matter within the jurisdiction of States. The international promotion and protection of human rights  on the basis of the Charter and of many international instruments is an objective to which mankind as a whole is committed. In this context  we once again repeat our condemnation of apartheid  a shameful doctrine based on inequality and racial discrimination  which is a clear  institutionalized violation of human rights. In this connection there are other scourges in the world today such as terrorism and drugs. Terrorism is not merely a factor that contributes to - international insecurity and a form of action that violates fundamental principles of civilized coexistenceÂ·  it is essentially a flagrant violation of human rights  an attack upon the freedom and dignity of man  and especially on his right to life. Ws consider that the action by the United Nations against terrorism must be firm and clear  based on the view that terrorism is a crime against humanity  one that calls for the co-operation of all States. As for the fight against the illegal use of drugs  international action roust be greatly expanded in order to confront this plague  which is particularly severe today. The United Nations is the appropriate setting for the adoption and promotion of economic  social  cultural and legal measures for its prevention and sanction. But such measures should not be considered as negating the responsibility of producer countries  nor of consumer countries since  if there were no large consumer market  there would not be any drug-producing market. We should also call attention to the responsibility of the countries that allow their territory to be used for drug trafficking. Our country confirms its determination to co-operate in the International fight against the narcotics trade and pledges its support to any co-ordinated effort at the regional or international levels.Conservation of the environment is a matter of growing concern for the international community. The quality of man's life on Earth and his very existence are at stake.We reaffirm our support for the recommendations in the report entitled ""Our Common Culture""  prepared by the World Commission on Environment and Development  and we agree with the basic principles of maintaining the steady productivity of the ecosystems and the biosphere as a whole. We are convinced of the need to increase efforts and to act in a co-ordinated fashion to avert the grave danger of altering the ecological balance and the progressive and rapid physical and chemical deterioration of the environment that is affecting the infrastructure of planetary life.The achievement of full economic development has been the basic challenge of the last years of our century. Without balanced and global economic development  there can be no firm and lasting peace; the existence of both highly industrialized countries and countries hindered by underdevelopment is  over the medium- or long-term  a constant source of instability and tension and a threat to world peace.Even if one recognizes that development is also the responsibility of the developing countries themselves  at this time in our century it seems clear that  even in those developing countries that are willing to absorb the social and political costs of painful adjustments in their economies  there eventually comes a time when national instruments of economic rationality are exhausted.Hence there arises the indispensable need for greater international solidarity  which starts with clear and stable trade regulations - free from irritating protectionism - and greater flexibility and co-operation in solving the financial problems caused by the current foreign debt crisis  the weight of which is frustrating the efforts of the debtor countries to promote their economic growth and placing the stability of their democratic institutions at risk.Nevertheless  it must be said that the overwhelming debt burden is monopolizing international attention  pushing into the background the urgent need to discuss new resources necessary to promote the scientific and technological modernization and development of the non-industrialized countries.Naturally  the problem has transcended the mere economic nature of the issue. It is now time to recognize that the world's financial problems - the past debt and the future debt - are also political problems that must be faced from an international perspective based on a faithful and honest commitment by creditors and debtors alike  in which both recognize their due share of responsibility for the past and the future. To this end  I believe that it is constructive to highlight the recent commitment of the President of the Spanish Government at the close of the twenty-fifth meeting of Latin American Governors  Spain and the Philippines before the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. It is useful to recall this here because it shows that the sensitivity which we have been calling for is starting to emerge among the leaders of industrialized creditor countries as well.President Felipe Gonzalez began by recognizing the failure of the strategy thus far pursued to resolve the debt crisis and recognized that from 1982 to date the situation of the banks and creditor countries has improved sufficiently for them to assume a more realistic and flexible attitude in this matter . Consequently  he feels that the time has come for the creditors to redefine their debt strategy by specifically proposing the capitalization of interest and the reduction in outstanding debt  along the lines  I suppose  of explicitly recognizing the devaluation of the debt in the securities market.I believe that this is the appropriate forum and time to welcome views such as the one expressed by the President of the Spanish Government  which tend to bring balance into international attention by recalling that  in spite of the progress in political terms observed at the international level  at this level there still persist serious problems - with no clear solutions - affecting not merely the quality of life of millions of inhabitants of the world but also the possibility of building a world at peace.Soon  two international events will occur expressing our active commitment - Uruguay's - at the regional and international levels.The first is the meeting of Latin American Presidents of the Group of Eight to be held at Punta del Este. This group  which was created in Rio de Janeiro  emerged out of the conviction of its democratic Governments that it is important for Latin America as a whole that there be a mechanism for co-ordination and consultation enabling it to harmonize its international activities  promote regional democratization and act in unity in analysing all the problems affecting the region. There can be no doubt that this group has acquired clear international standing and can now play its part in maintaining relations with other international organizations and countries outside the region. The forthcoming summit meeting at Punta del EstÄ will undoubtedly provide a timely opportunity to analyse what has been done since the Acapulco Declaration and to define a realistic plan of action to pursue in the future in the political  cultural  educational and technological fields.The second is the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  a result of the Punta del Este conference  where discussions were held which  we hope  will serve as an example of international wisdom  promoting international trade free from discrimination and protectionism and capable of promoting international trade exchanges on the basis of which the shared objective for development of all States on Earth can be solidly established.Within this broader picture  the importance of multilateralism and the transcendental role of the United Nations is clear. But for our Organization to be active and respected  it is necessary that it have the wherewithal necessary for the attainment of the goals assigned to it by the Charter and the resources efficiently to conduct the operations for which its machinery was established.We recognize  therefore  that in order to revitalize the Organization once and for all  we need to start with honest self-criticism aimed at eliminating inefficiencies  lessening bureaucracy and improving existing systems.In saying that  we also realize that the way to achieve this objective is surely not by suffocating it financially to the point of undermining not only its functioning but also its very existence. Hence it is the duty of all Member States particularly the large industrialized countries  to reconsider their position as contributions to the United Nations budget and to make the necessary efforts to keep the Organization going and functioning. In summary  my country reaffirms its commitment to the United Nations. Uruguay is today living in peace  free from conflicts with other States. It maintains relations of friendship and co-operation with States of all political and economic systems in the world> it has developed a strong democratic life that fully respects human rights and is governed by leaders elected through the free expression of the will of the people.That is why we come before the Assembly today and express our views on foreign policy as the result of national consensus on the basis of which the country is participating at the regional and international levels in the search for the reaffirmation of the fundamental principles that gave birth to the Organization. In closing  while confirming my country's confidence in the results of this session  let us recall that the difficult challenges we are currently facing and will have to face in the future can only be overcome through decisive and clear international action without unrealistic rhetoric or expressions of one-sided intent.This call for pragmatic and rational action includes strict observance by all Members of the Organization of the fundamental principles of the San Francisco Charter  because these principles are not merely rhetorical phrases but rather inescapable legal duties that all States must observe in order to ensure the credibility and efficiency of the United Nations in accomplishing its basic objectives."
"144",7239,"USA",43,1988,"ï»¿Half a world away from this place of peace  the firing  the killing  the bloodshed in two merciless conflicts have for the first time in recent memory diminished. After terrible new names  names such as Halabja  Maidan Shahr and Spin Buldak  have been added to the toll-call of human horror  there is today hope of peace in the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan.So too  in the highlands and coastal cities of southern Africa  places of civil war  places of occupation by foreign troops  talk of peace is heard  peace for the tortured nation of Angola. Sixty-five hundred miles east  in the South-East Asian country of Cambodia  there is hope now of a settlement and the removal of Viet Nam's occupying forces. Finally  in this hemisphere  where only 12 years ago one third of the people of Latin America lived under democratic rule  some 90 per cent do so today. And especially in Central America  nations such as El Salvador  once threatened by the anarchy of the death squad and the spectre of totalitarian rule  now know the hope of self-government and the prospect of economic growth. Another change  a change that if it endures may go down as one of the signal accomplishments of our history  a change that is cause for shaking the head in wonder  is also upon us; a change going to the source of post-war tensions and to the once seemingly impossible dream of ending the twin threats of our time - totalitarianism and thermonuclear world war.For the first time  the differences between East and West - fundamental differences over important moral questions dealing with the worth of the individual and whether Governments shall control people or people control Governments - for the first time these differences have shown signs of easing  easing to the point where there are not just troop withdrawals from places such as Afghanistan  but also talk in the East of reform and greater freedom of the press  of assembly and of religion. Yes  fundamental differences remain  but should talk of reform become more than that  should it become reality  there is the prospect of not only a new era in Soviet-United States relations but a new age of world peace; for such reform can bring peace. History teaches  and my country has always believed that  where the rights of the individual and the people are enshrined  war is a distant prospect. For it is not people who make war; only Governments do that.I stand at this rostrum  then  at a moment of hope; hope not just for the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union  but for all the peoples of the world  and hope too for the dream of peace among nations  the dream that began the United Nations. Precisely because of these changes  today the United Nations has the opportunity to live and breathe and work as never before.Already  Mr. Secretary-General  you  through your persistence  patience and unyielding will  have shown in working towards peace in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf how valuable the United Nations can be. We salute you for these accomplishments. In Geneva at this very hour there are numerous negotiations under way: multilateral negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament  as well as bilateral negotiations on a range of issues between the Soviets and ourselves. These negotiations  some of them under United Nations auspices  involve a broad arms-control agenda: strategic offensive weapons  strategic defence and space  nuclear testing  and chemical warfare - whose urgency we have witnessed anew in recent days.And the negotiators ate busy. Over the last few years they h iv/e been engaged in more than an academic exercise. There is movement; the log-jam is broken. Only recently  when the United States and the Soviet Union signed the intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) agreement  an entire class of United States and Soviet nuclear missiles was eliminated for the first time in history. Progress continues on negotiations to reduce strategic weapons in massive number  with effective verification  and talks will begin soon on conventional reductions in Europe.Much of the reason for all this goes back  I believe  to Geneva  to the small chateau beside the lake where I and the Soviet General Secretary had the first of several fireside chats - exchanges characterized by frankness  but friendliness too. I said at the first meeting in Geneva that this was a unique encounter between two people who had the power to start a third world war or to begin a new age of peace among nations. I also said that peace conferences  arms negotiations and proposals for treaties could make sense only if they were part of a wider context  a context in which we sought to explore and resolve the deeper underlying differences between us. I said to Mr. Gorbachev then  as I have said to the Assembly before  that nations do not mistrust each other because they are armed; they are armed because they mistrust each other. In that place  by that peaceful lake in neutral Switzerland  Mr. Gorbachev and I did begin a new relationship based not just on engagement over the single issue of arras control but on a broader agenda about our deeper differences  an agenda of human rights  regional conflicts and bilateral exchanges between our peoples. Even on the arms-control issue itself we agreed to go beyond the past  to seek not just treaties that permitted building weapons to higher levels  but revolutionary agreements that actually reduced and even eliminated a whole class of nuclear weapons.What was begun that morning in Geneva has shown results: in the INF Treaty? in my recent visit to Moscow; in my opportunity to meet there with Soviet citizens and dissidents and speak of human rights; and to speak too  in the Lenin Hills of Moscow  to the young people of the Soviet Union about the wonder and splendour of human freedom. The results of that morning in Geneva are seen in peace conferences now under way around the world on regional conflicts and in the work of the United Nations here in New York as well as in Geneva.But history teaches caution. Indeed  that very building in Geneva  where important negotiations have taken place - those on the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan  and the Iran-Iraq negotiations  for example - we see today as stone-like testimony to a failed dream of peace in another time. The Palais des Nations was the headquarters of the League of Nations  an institution that was to symbolize an end to all war. Yet that institution and its noble purpose ended with the Second World War; ended because the chance of peace was not seized in the 1930s by the nations of the world  ended because humanity did not find the courage to isolate the aggressors  to reject schemes of government that served the State  not the people. We are here today determined that no such fate shall befall the United Nations. We are determined that the United Nations shall succeed and serve the cause of peace for humankind.So we realize that  even in this time of hope  the chance of failure is teal  but this knowledge does not discourage us: it spurs us on. For the stakes are high; do we falter and fail now  and bring down upon ourselves the just anger of future generations? Or do we continue the work of the founders of this institution  and see to it that  at last  freedom is enshrined and humanity knows war no longer  and that this place  this floor  shall be truly ""the world's last battlefield""?We are determined that it shall be so. So we turn now to the agenda of peace. Let us begin by addressing a concern that was much on my mind when I met with Mr. Gorbachev in the Kremlin as well as on the minds of Soviet citizens I met in Moscow. It is also an issue that I know is of immediate importance to the members of this Assembly who  this fall  commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.That Declaration says plainly what those who seek peace can forget only at the greatest peril that peace rests on one foundation; observance of the ""inalienable rights of all members of the human family"". In a century where human rights have been denied by totalitarian governments on a scale never before seen in history  with so many millions deliberately starved or eliminated as a matter of State policy - a history  it has been said  of blood  stupidity and barbed wire - few can wonder why peace has proved so elusive.	Well  let us understand. If we would have peace  we must acknowledge the elementary rights of our fellow human beings  in our own land and in other lands. If we would have peace  the trampling of the human spirit must cease. Human rights is not for some  some of the time. Human rights  as the Universal Declaration adopted by this Assembly in 1948 proclaims  is ""for all peoples and all nations"". And for all time.This regard for human rights as the foundation of peace is at the heart of the United Nations. Those who starve in Ethiopia  those who die among the Kurds  those who face racial injustice in South Africa  those who still cannot write or speak freely in the Soviet Union  those who cannot worship in the Ukraine  those who struggle for life and freedom on boats in the South China Sea  those who cannot publish or assemble in Managua - all of these are more than just an item on your agenda. It must be a first concern  an issue above others. For when human rights concerns are not paramount at the United Nations - when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not honoured in these halls and meeting rooms - then the very credibility of this Organization is at stake  the very purpose of its existence in question.That is why  when progress is made in human rights  the United Nations grows stronger and the United States is glad of it. For example  following a two-year Â¡ effort led by the United States  the United Nations Commission on Human Rights took a major step towards ending the double standards and cynicism that had characterized too much of its past. For years  Cuba  a blatant violator of its citizens' human rights  has escaped United Nations censure or even scrutiny. This year  Cuba has responded to pressure generated by the Commission on Human Rights by accepting an investigation into its human rights abuses. Fidel Castro has already begun to free some political prisoners  improve prison conditions  and tolerate the existence of a small  independent national human rights group.More must be done. The United Nations must be relentless and unyielding in seeking change  in Cuba and elsewhere. And we must also see to it that the Universal Declaration itself is not debased with episodes like the resolution ""Zionism is racism"". Respect for human rights is the first and fundamental mission of this body  the most elementary obligation of its members. Indeed  wherever one turns in the world today  there is a new awareness  a growing passion for human rights. The people of the world become united: new groups  new coalitions form  coalitions that commit: government  that work against discrimination  that fight religious or political repression  unlawful imprisonment  torture or execution. As those I spoke to at Spaso House said to me last June: Such movements make a difference.Turning now to regional conflicts  we feel again the uplift of hope. In the Gulf War between Iran and Iraq - one of the bloodiest conflicts since the Second World War - we have a cease-fire. The resolution and the firmness of the allied nations in keeping the Persian Gulf open to international shipping not only upheld the rule of law  it helped prevent further spread of the conflict and laid the basis for peace. So  too  the Security Council's decisive resolution in July a year ago has become the blueprint for a peaceful Gulf. Let this war - a war in which there has been no victor or vanquished  only victims - let this war end now. Let both Iran and Iraq co-operate with the Secretary-General and the Security Council in implementing resolution 598 (1978). Let peace come.Moving on to a second region  I would recall that when I first addressed the United Nations General Assembly in 1983  world attention was focused on the brutal invasion and illegal occupation of Afghanistan. After nearly nine long years of war  the courage and determination of the Afghan people and the Afghan freedom fighters have held sway - and today  an end to the occupation is in sight. On April 14  the USSR signed the Geneva Accords  which were negotiated under United Nations auspices by Pakistan and the Kabul regime. We encourage the Soviet Union to complete its troop withdrawal at the earliest possible date  so that the Afghan people can freely determine their future without further outside interference.In southern Africa  too  years of patient diplomacy and support for those in Angola who seek self-determination are having their effect. We look forward to an accord between the Governments of Angola  Cuba  and South Africa that will bring about a complete withdrawal of all foreign troops - primarily Cuban - from Angola. We look forward as well to full implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and our longstanding goal of independence for Namibia. We continue to support a growing consensus among African leaders who also believe there can be no end to conflict in the region until there is national reconciliation within Angola.There are new hopes for Cambodia  a nation whose freedom and independence we seek just as avidly as we sought the freedom and independence of Afghanistan. We urge the rapid removal of all Vietnamese troops and a settlement that will prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge to power  permitting instead the establishment of a genuinely representative government - a government that will  at last  respect fully the rights of the people of Cambodia and end the hideous suffering they have so bravely and needlessly borne.In other critical areas  we applaud the Secretary-General's efforts to structure a referendum on the Western Sahara. In the Mediterranean  direct talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriot common ties hold much promise for accord in that divided island nation. Finally  we look to a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. So  too  the unnatural division of Europe remains a critical obstacle to Soviet-American relations. In most of these areas  then  we see progress and  again  we are glad of it. Only a few years ago  all of these and other conflicts were burning dangerously out of control. Indeed  the invasion of Afghanistan and the apparent failure of will among democratic and peace-loving nations to deter such events seemed to cause a climate where aggression by nations large and small was epidemic  a climate the world had not seen since the 1930s. Only this time  larger war was avoided - avoided because the free and peaceful nations of the world recovered their strength of purpose and will. And now the United Nations is providing valuable assistance in helping this epidemic to recede.And because we are resolved to keep it so  I would be remiss in my duty if I did not now take note here of the one exception to progress in regional conflicts. I refer here to the continuing deterioration of human rights in Nicaragua and the refusal of the tiny elite now ruling that nation to honour promises of democracy made to their own people and to the international community. This elite - in calling itself revolutionary - seeks no real revolution; the use of the term is subterfuge  deception for hiding the oldest  most corrupt vice of alls man's age-old will to power  his lust to control the lives and steal the freedom of others.That is why  as President  I will continue to urge the Congress and the American public to stand behind those who resist this attempt to impose a totalitarian regime on the people of Nicaragua; that the United States will continue to stand with those who are threatened by this regime's aggression against its neighbours in Central America.Today  I also call on the Soviet Union to show in Central America the same spirit of constructive realism it has shown in other regional conflicts; to assist in bringing conflict in Central America to a close by halting the flow of billions of dollars worth of arms and ammunition to the Sandinista regime; a regime whose goals of regional domination  while ultimately doomed  can continue to cause great suffering to the people of that area and risk to Soviet-American relations unless action is taken now.With regard to the arms reduction agenda  I have already mentioned the importance of the INF Treaty and the momentum developed in the strategic arms reduction talks (START). The draft START treaty is a lengthy process filled with bracketed language designating sections of disagreement between the two sides. But through this summer in Geneva  those brackets have diminished; there is every reason to believe this process can continue. I can tell this Assembly that it is highly doubtful such a treaty can be accomplished in a few months  but I can tell you that a year from now is a possibility - more than a possibility. But we have no deadline. No agreement is better than a bad agreement. The United States remains hopeful  and we acknowledge the spirit of co-operation shown by the Soviet Union in these negotiations. We also look for that spirit to be applied to our concerns about compliance with existing agreements.So  too  our discussions on nuclear testing and defence and space have been useful. But let me here stress to the General Assembly that much of the momentum in nuclear-arms-control negotiations is due to technological progress itself  especially in the potential for space-based defensive systems. I believe that the determination of the United States to research and develop and  when ready  deploy such defensive systems - systems targeted to destroy missiles  not people - accounts for a large share of the progress made in recent years in Geneva. With such systems  for the first time  in case of accidental launch or the act of a madman somewhere  major Powers will not be faced with the single option of massive retaliation  but will instead have the chance of a saner choice: to shield against an attack instead of avenging it. So  too  as defensive systems grow in effectiveness  they reduce the threat and the value of greater and greater offensive arsenals. Only recently  briefings I have received in the Oval Office indicate that progress toward such systems may be even more rapid and less costly than we had at first thought. Today  the United States reaffirms its commitment to its strategic defence initiative and our offer to share the benefits of strategic defences with others.And yet  even as diplomatic and technological progress holds out the hope of at last diminishing the awful cloud of nuclear terror we have lived under in the post-war era  even at this moment another ominous terror is loose once again in the world  a terror we thought the world had put behind  a terror that looms at us now from the long-buried past  from ghostly  scarring trenches and the haunting  wan faces of millions dead in one of the most inhumane conflicts of all time.Poison gas; chemical warfare: the terror of it; the horror of it! We condemn it. The use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war  beyond its tragic human toll  jeopardizes the moral and legal strictures that have held those weapons in check since the First World War. Let this tragedy spark reaffirmation of the Geneva Protocol outlawing the use of chemical weapons. I call upon the signatories to that Protocol  as well as other concerned States  to convene a conference to consider actions that we can take together to reverse the serious erosion of this treaty. We urge all nations to co-operate in negotiating a verifiable  truly global ban on chemical weapons at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.It is incumbent upon all civilized nations to ban  once and for all - and on a verifiable and global basis - the use of chemical and gas warfare.Finally  we must redouble our efforts to stop further proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world. Likewise  proliferation in other high-technology weapons such as ballistic missiles  is reaching global proportions  exacerbating regional rivalries in ways that can have global implications. The number of potential suppliers is growing at an alarming rate  and more must be done to halt the spread of these weapons. This was a matter of discussion last week between Secretary Shultz and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze. Talks between American and Soviet experts begin on this today; and we hope to see a multilateral effort to avoid having areas of tension like the Middle East becoming even more deadly battlegrounds than they already are.Rut in most of these areas we see not only progress but also the potential for an increasingly vital role for multilateral efforts and institutions like the United Nations. That is why now more than ever the United Nations must continue to increase its effectiveness through budget and programme reform. The United Nations already is enacting sweeping measures affecting personnel reductions  budgeting by consensus  and the establishment of programme priorities. These actions are extremely important. The progress on reforms has allowed me to release funds withheld under congressional restrictions. I expect that the reform programme will continue and that further funds will be released in our new fiscal year.Let me say here that we congratulate the United Nations on the work it has done in three areas of special concern. First  our struggle against the scourge of terrorism and State-sponsored terrorism must continue; and we must also end the scourge of hostage-taking. Second  the work of the World Health Organization in co-ordinating and advancing research on AIDS is vital. All international efforts in this area must be redoubled. The AIDS crisis is a grave one; we must move as one to meet it. So  too  is the drug crisis. We are moving now toward a new anti-drug-trafficking convention. This important treaty will be completed in December. I am confident that other strong United Nations drug-control programmes will also follow. The American people are profoundly concerned and deeply angered. We will not tolerate the drug traffickers. We mean to make war on them - and we believe this is one war the United Nations can endorse and participate in. Yes  the United Nations is a better place than it was eight years ago - and so  too  is the world. But the real issue of reform in the United Nations is not limited to fiscal and administrative improvements; it includes also a higher sort of reform  an intellectual and philosophical reform  a reform of old views about the relationship between the individual and the State. Few developments  for example  have been more encouraging to the United States than the special session on Africa that this body held two and a half years ago - a session at which the Members of the United Nations joined in calling as one for free-market incentives and a lessening of State controls to spur economic development. At one of the first international assemblies of my presidency  in Cancun  Mexico  I said that history demonstrates that  time and again  in place after place  economic growth and human progress make their greatest strides in countries that encourage economic freedom; that individual farmers  labourers  owners  traders and managers are the heart and soul of development. Trust them  because where they are allowed to create and build  where they are given a personal stake in deciding economic policies and benefiting from their success  societies become more dynamic  prosperous  progressive and free. We believe in freedom; we know that it works.This is the immutable lesson of the post-war era: that freedom works; that  even more  freedom and peace work together. Every year that passes  everywhere in the world  this lesson is taking hold - from the People's Republic of China to Cameroon  from Bolivia to Botswana  and  yes  in the citadel of Marxism-Leninism itself. No  my country did not invent this synergy of peace and freedom  but  believe me  we impose no restrictions on the free export of our more than two centuries of experience with it. Free people  blessed by economic opportunity and protected by laws that respect the dignity of the individual  are not driven towards war or the domination of others. Here  then  is the way to world peace. But we Americans champion freedom not only because it is practical and beneficial but because it is also just  morally right.Here I should like to note that I have addressed this assemblage more often than any of my predecessors and that this is the last occasion on which I shall do so. Therefore I hope that I may be permitted some closing reflections.The world is currently witnessing another celebration of international co-operation. At the Olympics we see nations joining together in the competition of sports  and we see young people  who know precious little of the resentments of their elders  coming together as one.One of our young athletes  from a home of modest means  said that she drew the strength for her achievement from another source of wealth. ""We were rich as a family"" she said about the love she was given and the values she was taught. I dare to hope that in the sentiment of that young athlete we see a sign of the rediscovery of old and tested values; values such as family - the first and most important unit of society  where all values and learning begin  an institution to be cherished and protectedÂ·  values  too  such as work  community  freedom and faith  for it is here we find the deeper rationale for the cause of human rights and world peace.Our own experience on this continent  the American experience  though brief  has had one unmistakable encounter  an insistence on the preservation of one sacred truth: it is a truth that our first President  our founding father  passed on in the first farewell address made to the American people; it is a truth that I hope you will permit me to mention in these remarks of farewell  a truth embodied in our Declaration of Independence: that the case for inalienable rights  the idea of human dignity  the notion of conscience above compulsion  can be made only in the context of higher law  only in the context of what one of the founders of this Organization  Secretary-General Dag HammarskjÃ¶ld  called ""devotion to something which is greater and higher than we are ourselves.""This is the endless cycle  the final truth to which humankind seems always to return - that religion and morality  faith in something higher  are prerequisites for freedom  and that justice and peace within ourselves is the first step toward justice and peace in the world and for the ages.Yes  this is a place of great debate and grave discussion. Yet I cannot help but note here that one of our founding fathers - the most worldly of men  an internationalist  Benjamin Franklin - interrupted the proceedings of our own constitutional convention to make much the same point.I cannot help but think this morning of other beginnings - of where and when I first read those words ""and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares"" and ""your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams"". This morning  my thoughts go to her who gave me many things in life but whose most important gift was the knowledge of the happiness and solace to be gained in prayer. It is the greatest help I have had in my presidency  and I recall here Lincoln's words when he said""Only the most foolish of men would think he could confront the duties of the office I now hold without turning to someone stronger  a power above all others. ""I think  then  of her and others like her in that small town in Illinois  gentle people who possessed something that those who hold positions of power sometimes forget to prize. No one of them could ever have imagined that the boy from the banks of the Rock River would come to this moment and have this opportunity. But  had they been told that it would happen  I think they would have been a bit disappointed if I had not spoken here for what they knew so wells that when we grow weary of the world and its troubles  when our faith in humanity falters  it is then that we must seek contort and refreshment of spirit in a deeper source of wisdom  one greater than ourselves.So  if future generations do say of us that in our time peace came closer  that we did bring about new seasons of truth and justice  it will be cause for pride. But it will be a cause of greater pride still if it is also said that we were wise enough to know that the deliberations of great leaders and great bodies are but an overture  that the truly majestic music  the music of freedom  justice and peace  is the music made in forgetting self and seeking in silence the will of Him who made us.Thank you for your hospitality over the years. I bid you now farewell  and God bless you."
"145",7309,"VCT",43,1988,"ï»¿On behalf of the Government and people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  I have great pleasure in offering sincere congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. We ate very confident that in the discharge of his duties  his illustrious career and his fine statesmanship will contribute significantly to the progress and success of the work of this session.Permit me to express my appreciation to the outgoing President Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic  for the manner in which he performed the task entrusted to him during the forty-second session. During his presidency he demonstrated great faith in the Organization and contributed significantly to the successful conclusions of that session and of the several resumed sessions. Once again  I should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his untiring efforts and his stalwart performance during the recent turbulent years of our Organization's history. His devoted efforts to the pursuit of peace and security and his firm defence of the principles of the Charter are characteristics of his commitment to the preservation of the goals and ideals of the United Nations The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces is tangible recognition of the effectiveness of the United Nations system. My delegation wishes to pay a tribute to all those at present serving and those who have served for their achievement and their contribution to the United Nations peace-keeping operations and  by extension  to world peace and security.This session takes place against the background of improved relations between the super-Powers and some decrease in the level of global tension. The recently concluded Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America  the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan  the cease-fire in the Gulf war  and the progress towards the peaceful solution of conflicts in Western Sahara  Kampuchea  Namibia and Cyprus have all attested to this fact. A great deal of the credit for these achievements undoubtedly belongs to this Organization. In spite of the retreat from multilateralism on the part of some  the Organization has not wavered in its commitment to seek solutions within the global framework. The Secretary-General must be complimented on his indomitable will and the sincerity of purpose displayed in the execution of his mandate.In his address at the commemorative session of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  the Right Honourable James Fitz-Allen Mitchell  Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  reminded this body that the purpose and principles of this Organization remained as valid then as they were in 1945. The Charter  he said  had withstood the test of time  and  whatever the shortcomings in its implementation or the limitations of the United Nations institutions  they did not derive from the Charter. We called for a rededication to the principles so ably set forth by the founding fathers of the Organization. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines remains committed to this position.It is my firm belief that we ate at the threshold of a new era  an era in which the differences that have divided us for so long are less significant than the difficulties we have to face together. Man's greatest hope today is to live in a secure world with a protected common environment. The INF Treaty between President Â¡Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev is a historic achievement in the process of disarmament. That is why Saint Vincent applauds this agreement.Disarmament and arms control are matters of global concern. Our Prime Minister  in his address to the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  supported the view that savings from disarmament should be channelled into development  and proposed that funds thus saved should  as a matter of priority  be devoted to reforestation in Africa. While we welcome what has been achieved so far  we realize that international peace and security is the common concern of all mankind  so that the United Nations has an indispensable role to play in this regard. We cannot rest on our laurels) the hope for a nuclear-free world is our ultimate goal.In other areas of conflict progress is desperately needed. Independence for Namibia comes readily to mind. In this direction  we have always supported Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We remain cautiously hopeful  however  for a positive outcome of the talks between the Governments concerned to bring an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia. It is our fervent hope that  come 1989  this time around  Namibia will be a fully-fledged Member of this Organization.On the question of South Africa can anything more be said  except of course  to reiterate that the diabolic system of apartheid continues to be paramount among the human rights concerns of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The movement in favour of human dignity is now irreversible. There can be no doubt that fundamental change will come to South Africa. The only questions are  when and how and at what cost in human life.The problems of the Middle East have preoccupied this Assembly since the creation of the United Nations. Peaceful solutions have proved elusive and in their absence violence and extremism have increased. But that is an argument for redoubled effort  not for despair. There is today growing support for a properly structured international conference based ort Israel's right to exist and recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.As we reflect on the problems which beset the troubled regions of the globe  and our own region  Latin America and the Caribbean come readily to mind. We continue to support the efforts of the Contadora Group. We also believe that there is much merit in the Esquipulas agreement and all other regional efforts aimed at bringing peace to that afflicted region. We believe that socio-economic deprivation is the root cause of the conflict  and any effort aimed at finding a solution must take cognisance of this factor.We are heartened by the welcome news coming out of Seoul to the effect that the Government of South Korea is willing to end the situation of confrontation between it and its brother to the north so that the way can be paved for the establishment of relations between the two countries based on a spirit of co-operation. We hope that this welcome gesture can be built upon so that the process of accession by both countries to membership of the United Nations can be expedited.My delegation applauds the Government and people of the Republic of Korea on the successful completion of the Seoul Olympics  which were conducted in an atmosphere of friendly rivalry and peace. We trust that the co-operative spirit generated throughout the games will contribute to the relaxation of tension in that region.The view is held in some quarters that the economic recovery in the powerful economic centres of the world could provide the stimulus for renewed economic growth in the rest of the world. But the evidence to the contrary is there for all to see. The accompanying view that the remedies for the economic ills of the South lie in individual national efforts cannot be substantiated. Third-world development efforts have nothing to do with the unfavourable terms of trade  the capricious nature of the markets for the primary products of the South  the high interest rates levied by banks and the fluctuations in the parity between the major currencies. All of these are variables which have an adverse impact on our fragile economies and over which we have absolutely no control. Add to this our vulnerability to natural disasters and one gets a true picture of economies in danger.While we are thankful to those that assist in alleviating the difficulties faced by these economies we ate mindful that the assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product is not met by all those that are eligible.My Government realized quite early that Vincentians had to make painful sacrifices  and embarked on a programme of structural adjustment aimed at avoiding cost over-run on its recurrent budget so that there could be funds available from local revenue to be utilized in the capital budget sector. This had to be done because the Vincentians are proud people who do not wish to rely solely on the generosity of others.It is a fact of life that the problems faced by poor and developing countries are the more harsh and intractable the smaller the country. These problems have been frequently reiterated and roust by now be familiar to everyone. Allow me to repeat by way of reminder  however  that they are a mixture of the problems emanating from smallness in general and island characteristics in particular.These characteristics can be identified as non-viable internal markets  diseconomies of scale  a narrow range of resources  and lack of opportunity to take advantage of external economies by way of linkage with the service networks of neighbouring States and thereby reduce the relative costs of infrastructure. There is the further disadvantage that many of these States  like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  ate archipelagic - a phenomenon which poses enormous problems  accompanied by their consequential economic and social costs. In view of their small overall size and the relatively small size of their commercial debt  these States do not constitute a priority group for private commercial banks. The simultaneous ineligibility for commercial and concessionary financial flews poses the real possibility of these countries' losing whatever advances they have made towards improving their standard of living and raising their economies from the category of the poorest. In order to save them from the economic retrogression to which they may be doomed  it is important that adequate resources be made available to them on appropriate terms.We are living through an era of rapid change. Generally speaking  the peoples of the industrialized countries have experienced a rapid improvement in their living conditions. For the developing countries that is not so. While the 1980s may be a remarkable decade  marked by real progress in respect of international peace and security  the decade can be considered as one of lost opportunities for the third world. Very little has been done to prevent the gap between the rich and the poor countries from widening. As we approach the twenty-first century we are faced with the major challenge of overcoming the global development crisis. We must fight the battle against poverty together.Poverty undermines security  compromises equality and denies hope and opportunity. Alleviating poverty must be given a new priority on national and international agendas. We must work to achieve social justice for the poorest of our world and initiate economic growth where there has been stagnation  revitalization where there has been despair  hope where there has been hopelessness. There must be a spirit of sharing  of giving where there have been surpluses.The future will depend on how successful we are in harnessing our common attitudes with our limited resources to combat the common challenges. Stability  prosperity and social and economic justice are coming to different parts of the world at different speeds. We must implement corrective measures so as not to create an irreversible imbalance. The challenge is economic and political as well as ethical. We can safeguard the future only by working together. We cannotsafeguard it at each other's expense.The critical economic situation for the developing world is characterized by unsustainable external debt. It is obvious that the heavily indebted low-income countries will never be able to repay their debts. We must fully recognize the nature of the problem and create the solutions to deal with it. The lending policies of our institutions should not be cast in stone so that they run the risk of bringing about political destabilization which might ultimately lead to increased human suffering and degradation. The dangers which are likely to be caused through short-sightedness or deliberate environmental practices are many and varied. The issues of toxic wastes  deforestation  desertification  acid rain  the widening gap in the ozone layer  the climatic changes and the greenhouse effect are some of the environmental hazards which must be addressed by the international community before irreversible damage is done to the environment. These issues mast be placed on the priority list of the United Nations and swift and workable solutions must be found if mankind is to survive. They must not be relegated to the back burner  as time is not on our side. The world must be preserved for succeeding generations.As an archipelagic State and a link in the Caribbean chain  with its unprotected borders on the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines must be conscious of its vulnerability as a potential transhipment point for drug traffickers. We are also conscious of the ever-increasing use of illicit drugs the world over  especially among the young. My Government  in  co-operation with our neighbours  our friends and the international community  will never relent in its efforts to eradicate the illicit trafficking in narcotics and to end the tragedy of drug abuse.The next decade will be crucial. The United Nations role will be to harness the irreversible forces of change to ensure a more peaceful  more prosperous and more humane world. Vital and difficult decisions will have to be taken. We have the capacity to destroy life on this planet  but we also have the capacity to make this world a better place for all future generations. We look in the future for a more humane world in which the rich nations will be more generousÂ·  where the strong nations are just  the weak nations are regarded as equals  the poor nations are treated as crown jewels and human dignity is enshrined in the image of our Divine Creator  because together we must preserve this earth for all our children's children."
"146",7356,"VEN",43,1988,"ï»¿It is a happy and memorable coincidence that at this forty-third session two Latin American citizens hold posts of honour: one is President of the General Assembly and the other is Secretary-General. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Argentina  Mr. Dante Caputo  and the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  are distinguished representatives of our people  heirs to the best ideological and republican traditions which created the Latin American nationality.When we joined the international community  after the historic changes generated by the French Revolution - now nearing its bicentennial - there was in our continent a feeling of identity  unity  mutual interest in solidarity  and brotherhood in the face of the sufferings of the war of emancipation and of outside threats.Today  after many difficult years of being divided by foreign interests  of inflamed prejudices among ourselves  of painful interruptions to our expression of the democratic will as peoples  Latin America  almost in its entirety  is able to present itself to the world once again  as it is doing at this Assembly  with a feeling of solidarity and a community of ideals. I have no fear that I may be mistaken  or arrogating the right of another  when I affirm that we  the nations of America  are undergoing a period of far-reaching changes which we cannot  nor shall  this time leave to the vagaries of circumstance.""Security"" is usually defined in terms of custody  preservation and promotion of a country's basic interests. For Venezuela  together with what is inherent in our national being  its security also means democracy  by virtue of the provisions and mandate established by its Constitution. It means the freedom of its citizens to dissent  under the rule of law  to be able to prosper and satisfy their material and spiritual needs with autonomy and independence. Nevertheless  in a contemporary world such as ours  our security and the security of our countries are threatened from outside. So it is high time to make this charge  and there is no more appropriate forum in which to do so than this  at this rostrum open to all the peoples of the world.Today  the legitimacy of our fundamental tights as nations and peoples  as communities and individuals  is being challenged. There is no other way to explain the lack of definitive solutions to problems such as the problem of external debt  which drains our countries' economies and deprives them of the tight to a stable future.The external debt problem acts as a stranglehold today on the economic and social development of the vast majority of the peoples of the world. It is essential to overcome it if we ace to achieve more just and humane social development. We must begin to tackle it recognizing that we shall find a lasting solution only when we face up to its true causes and admit the failure of the strategies so far followed in our attempt to manage it. Among the basic causes of the external debt crisis are the serious errors made by banks and lenders when they set aside the very principles on which private credit activities operate and try ineffectually to supplant the development financing institutions and take over the functions assigned to them.Secondly  immediately following this  there occurred another very important change: the Governments and monetary authorities of some of the countries in which the creditor banks operated  to defend their currencies and fight inflation  took the political decision to raise interest rates to levels far above the average inflation rates  without taking into account the devastating effect that this step would have on the debtor countries.The result has been that some loans that were contracted at interest rates at a level in balance with inflation rates have to be serviced at an almost impossible level of interest  because there is no economic activity that can generate enough wealth to cover that imbalance  which is the result of a political decision taken by the Governments of developed countries.The logic of international financial capitalism is unethical and immoral. An economic system cannot function indefinitely on the basis of such a mechanism. Nor can it be claimed that it is reasonable for the expectations of our peoples to be subordinated to the covetousness of the most crass mercantilism. And it is far less reasonable that nations which profess to be our allies and friends should seek not only to justify but to impose such logic  using the most blatant euphemisms.We have seen  in the schemes so far presented  one refinancing negotiation following another  with adjustment policies in the debtor countries and protective policies for the financial systems in the creditor countries; interventions by the International Monetary Fund  the World Bank and the regional development banks; one international conference following another  with specific plans from developed countries - all with no practical result. The fact is that for both the countries that have paid and those that have not  the situation is untenable.Debt can never be repaid by means of more debts. The traditional scheme is bankrupt and the old timetable appears to us now to be a harmful and grotesque ritual.Where do we expect this road to lead us? Let us remember that there are limits which cannot be crossed with impunity  and the limits include that concept of security and that right to development and social justice which we shall never tire of claiming to be inalienable. The dramatic  compelling fact of the matter is that social problems are becoming more acute and that there are no more adjustments to be made; the net flow of capital from debtor to creditor countries continues; countries service their commitments and  with very few exceptions - and so far Venezuela has been one of them - debts rise  interest is paid on interest  and the dilemma of the debt is further compounded.The policy of gaining time  hoping for a financial miracle that will make it possible for the debt to be serviced under current terms  has had its day. We have to grasp this fact and act accordingly  and very quickly. Let us recall the crisis of the 1930s when more than half the countries which were then in the League of Nations filed for moratoriums on their debt; and let us also remember all the consequences  with the world-wide effects that sprang from not having acted in time. It is therefore our duty to try agreed solutions that will lead to international agreements under which the debtors will obtain conditions that are reasonable in relation to the size of their debts; and real schedules and interest rates will be established that will enable them to pay and at the same time develop their economies.There is no other solution. Let us not delude ourselves. If we are not able to devise a multilateral mechanism to meet these objectives  we shall become passive witnesses to an economic and social disaster that will embrace all countries  whether developed or not.It is not possible to remain wealthy for long if that wealth is based on the ruin of others; far less so in today's interdependent world.The economist and university professor Carlos Diaz Alejandro once said:""To blame the victims is a tempting way to shirk responsibilities  especially when the victims themselves are far from virtuous."" We have repeatedly maintained that debt is a joint responsibility and that  accordingly  seeking solutions to overcome its traumatic effects must necessarily also be a joint decision  one that is rational and equitable  agreed to by creditors and debtors.We  the developing countries  are the victims: of that there can be no doubt. It is likewise true that we are not virtuous. We are not virtuous victims. Yet  in this case  the sins are not the sins only of just some but the sins of one and all. We cannot therefore accept that our people should bear the punishment. They most certainly are not to blame.Nor is this a unilateral plea for our peoples. We are certain that the perils of the future will not spare those who now have the power to take the major decisions. This is the message that Ã wish to place on record here before this forum on behalf of the people of Venezuela  a message which is  or should be  the sum and conscience of mankind.A few days ago  meeting at the Regional Conference on Poverty  Latin American representatives observed that 61 million Latin Americans lived in a state of poverty which did not even allow them to satisfy their basic need for food. Faced with this reality  which could easily be observed even more dramatically in other developing regions  it is fitting to ask oneself: What right can be invoked  what obligations can be adduced  that transcend fundamental human rights? It can  of course  be argued that it is up to each Government to deal with the problems of the society it represents and that its responsibilities cannot be transferred to others. True  yes  but only when those responsibilities are theirs alone.No one can claim that it is so. The existing interrelationship between the development of our economies and the international economy is a fact of life which  instead of leading us on to progress  seems to lead us to backwardness. Is this  or is it not  a collective responsibility?	 A very recent diagnosis of the Latin American economic situation produced by the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA)   indicates that since the region has had to make thorough adjustments which give priority to the balances in external accounts  the end result is that we may be in a position to overcome the stagnation in growth and recover greater price stability; but in order to so  it is vital to put an end to  and reverse  the transfer of resources to which our economies have been subjected. In our view  this situation can be achieved only if the debt problem is approached and managed in a radically different way.Venezuela - and I am saying this on its behalf with full moral and political authority - considers that the efforts made have been more than enough.We cannot envisage staying where we are as the scenario for our society in the future. We have reached the point at which development and foreign debt have become the antithesis of each other in a contradiction which we cannot evade indefinitely.Venezuela has made praiseworthy efforts to restore to its economy a stable and predictable frame of reference. The internal reorganization and adjustment which it has carried our have been beneficial in so far as they have been able to stimulate the strength and reserves of our society. To be able to bring this to fruition now  we must avoid the risk of inflation  reactivate investment processes  improve productivity  and raise the standard of living of our people  all of which depend on the level of resources we can invest in our own progress and on whether or not we are able to guarantee stability and predictability  which every economic activity and social advance require. Like the majority in our region  we stand a chance of coming out of this crisis successfully. It is accordingly imperative that we should not allow ourselves to slump in inertia and that we should take advantage of this transition. In order to do this  we need full understanding on the part of the international community and of the developed countries in particular  of what is at stake. It is impossible to imagine that their exercises in co-ordinating their economic policies are in themselves efforts which we could consider to be consonant with the circumstances facing the rest of the world; nor to imagine that our problems will be solved in this way.We welcome the apparently greater clear-sightedness of the discussion at the Toronto meeting regarding the realities facing the developing world  but since there has been no constructive dialogue or short-term operational measures  we believe that we are entitled to reserve for ourselves the right to explore the possibilities that may prove to be needed.In Latin America a group of countries have been thinking along these lines. The Acapulco Commitment to Peace  Development and Democracy  which we eight Latin American Presidents signed last year  is the expression of our shared concerns and our common purposes. We have set ourselves the necessary goals in the three fields covered by our commitment  and we intend to further and enlarge them. We shall soon be meeting again in fraternal Uruguay to refine our perceptions and take note of the degree of acceptance and understanding which our assessments have received.Venezuela is prepared to make its contribution to ensure that Latin America will not be relegated from the world which  it seems  is being forged at the current time.The relaxation of tensions and the beginnings of solutions to grave international conflicts in various parts of the world are not fortuitous  just as the tensions and confrontations which provoked them were not.The great Powers have entered into a process of dialogue and disarmament. We congratulate them and trust that this will be sustained. Countries in confrontation  zones in conflict  ate beginning to feel the results of those agreements  and at last recourse is being made to the multilateral institutions which were created to promote peace. In this context  allow me to congratulate the Secretary-General for his efforts and convey our sincere wishes that they may be supported and sustained by all in this Organization.From this process  which we trust will be successful  there will emerge once again the possibility of channelling more resources to development. It is inconceivable that material backwardness and human misery should continue to exist; and there is no possible justification for their increasing in a world whose global wealth is unprecedented. Will the international community ever be able to channel its resources in a constructive direction? When we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  we all had in mind the tragic economic  social and political conflicts from which the Organization was born. To date  however  we have for the most part been incapable of overcoming the lack of understanding which prevails as to how to bring prosperity within the reach of all.The economic conflict still remains unchanged and is growing steadily worse. Imbalances in the world economy will lead us to disaster if the main countries involved do not assume their responsibilities with a full sense of obligation towards the international community. Perhaps the time has also come for the Secretary-General to take in hand the quest for a dialogue that will ensure that the international community takes a definite course of action to meet this unsatisfied need  a course of action in which external debt would occupy a prominent place. We certainly cannot go on having these kinds of parallel monologues in which the developed and the developing worlds have become entrenched. Perhaps we should renounce our traditional procedures and  through the Secretary-General's activity  bring the item before the highest political bodies and attempt to revive the philosophy and practice of co-operation to ensure development through joint agreement.Economic problems are not unrelated to a host of others which we could begin to tackle in the same context. It has been said that Latin America is being absorbed by the underground drug economy. Radical measures have been required to deal with the crop areas  and  with increasing emphasis  relations between countries are to be made conditional on the eradication of this activity.Venezuela  which has earned an authoritative position in the anti-drug struggle  is determined to act on all fronts  as we demonstrated in 1984 when we placed before the General Assembly the idea of adopting a convention against the traffic and consumption of illicit drugs - a convention that was subsequently approved unanimously. But we notice that no-one has taken the trouble to point out the existence of and to act against an economic situation that is nourished by and profits systematically from the drug economy  which fosters the creation of economic power centres and consolidates them and  in practice  serves as its financial agent.It would certainly be relevant for the United Nations to reveal the linkage between some members of the international financial world and the underground drug economy. We might likewise explore the traffic in toxic wastes  which has now taken on special dimensions in that attempts are under way to transport to earth-based reservoirs - for the most part in the territories of developing countries - the garbage of a wasteful consumer society imposed on us as a model j transferring  hand in hand with that  habits of corruption to facilitate the continuance of this illicit  repugnant business.As members will have been able to appreciate  my message to the General Assembly endeavours to take up again  on an ethical basis  some of the challenges we face. We should never lose sight of this  because civilization and its progress are inconceivable if they are not linked with the most intimate aspirations of our Individual and collective being. In this constant pursuit of the most elementary rights of States and men  we have all relied on the United Nations - as the appropriate forum not only for conveying our concerns but  what is more important  for channelling resources and establishing competent bodies and mechanisms.United Nations efforts have made progress possible in matters to which we are particularly attached. I should like to mention some items which perhaps the distortion of priorities has downgraded to routine questions but which are still fully valid from our point of view. As is well known  Venezuela recognizes and promotes the interdependence of all human rights; political  economic  social and cultural. There are situations which constitute a permanent threat to those principles. Venezuela confirms it rejection of racial discrimination in South Africa - of which the classic example is Mandela's martyrdom - and affirms its solidarity with the people of Namibia  while urging that the talks and negotiations now under way should bring about the independence of that country.For all those reasons  and because of the outstanding role the United Nations has played in bringing about peaceful solutions to international disputes  I reaffirm our solidarity with the Organization  express renewed faith in its principles and offer our best efforts in the service of the cause of peace and the coexistence of peoples.Along those lines  I should like to emphasize the achievements of the United Nations in its endeavours to put an end to conflicts in regions that are particularly dear to us - such as the peace agreement in Afghanistan and the end of hostilities between Iraq and Iran  countries with which we maintain cordial and constructive relations.It has been made evident that it is only the resolute will of the States involved that is capable of ending conditions favouring the attainment of specific objectives. For that reason  noting that in other regions there are definite prospects for peace  we urge the five Central American countries signatories of the Procedure for the Establishment of a Firm and Lasting Peace in Central America to devote themselves to complying with their commitments  regardless of the interference of elements alien to the area. The political dialogue between them should be restored genuinely and promptly  with a large dose of determination and with each party doing its share to put an end to a conflict that is being needlessly prolonged. We trust that reason will prevail  that peace and friendly coexistence in freedom and democracy will be the symbols of that cherished region.We know that all United Nations organs are prepared to continue performing the tasks entrusted to them and to face in a constructive way any situation that threatens the well-being of mankind. Nevertheless  it is fitting to recall the serious financial difficulties which the United Nations has undergone - difficulties that require our utmost attention. It is clearly understood that it is the duty of all its Member States to contribute to supporting it on a permanent basis. My final words today  as the representative of a country that is democratic in spirit and in action  ace to wish the United Nations success in its primary purpose of ensuring peace and security for the world. Venezuela will always stand by the United Nations  devised and created for the sake and the benefit of universal mankind."
"147",7395,"VNM",43,1988,"ï»¿The delegation of Viet Nam would like to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo on his election as President of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are confident that under his guidance our session will leave an imprint commensurate with the watershed significance of the present period.We also take this opportunity to express our great appreciation of the major contribution of Mr. Peter Florin  President of the forty-second session  to the success of that session.The delegation of Viet Nam wishes to join previous speakers in expressing high appreciation of the indefatigable efforts made over the past year by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  in the service of peace and security in many parts of the world.Since the forty-second session we have witnessed far-reaching developments in both the world and the regional situation which give rise to hopes for those who are striving for a world of peace  friendship and co-operation among nations.The two summit meetings between the Soviet Union and the United States  the ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - and the progress  albeit modest  made in the negotiations on a 50 per cent reduction  in strategic weapons constitute important breakthroughs which open up a real opportunity of achieving still greater results in the long struggle to free mankind from the nightmare of a nuclear war of annihilation. The strengthening and broadening of international co-operation at the global and regional levels - an objective necessity of our time - and especially the signing for the first time of an agreement establishing official relations between the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) and the European Economic Community (EEC)  gives a significant impetus to the process.These encouraging events have contributed to the improvement of the international political atmosphere after ' years of tension and confrontation. They have not only enhanced more than ever before the possibility of safeguarding peace and averting the danger of a war of extermination but also ushered in a new era in international relations  an era of struggle and co-operation in peaceful coexistence among countries with different social and political systems. As a result  all the nations of the world are in a better position to meet together the challenges facing the whole of mankind  which today cannot be met by any one country alone  no matter how large or rich. I refer to such challenges as are posed by pollution of the environment  the demographic explosion  the world food problem and the problem of sources of raw materials.Important though they may be  the positive developments in the world situation are but a beginning. Mankind is still faced with the danger of a frenzied arras race in outer space. It is still witnessing the wasteful channelling of huge natural resources to the arms race or to regional conflicts  while two thirds of mankind are living in poverty because of the heavy legacy of a long colonial past and the unfair international economic order. Never before has mankind had such a strong common will to accept and overcome these serious challenges. From years of fierce struggle and untold sacrifices and losses  the peoples of the world are new all the more aware of tine indivisibility of world peace and detente and  furthermore  of the close link between peace and detente  on the one hand  and independence and development  on the other. There can be no peace and detente in the world unless the independence  security and development of nations in every region are guaranteed. Conversely  the independence  security and development of nations are a decisive factor in the preservation of a solid and lasting peace on earth. In that context  the initiative for a comprehensive system of international peace and security designed to encourage international dialogue based on respect for the independence and sovereignty of nations is certain to win the approval and support of a broad segment of world public opinion.The initial successes having been scored  the international community is new stepping up its efforts in the struggle for peace and development. The Ministerial Meeting on disarmament held in Havana by the non-aligned countries  the third General Assembly special session on disarmament and the world-wide movement in response to the ""Peace Wives"" campaign in 1988 have given powerful expression to the earnest aspirations of nations to live in peace  free from the use of force in international relations  and to enjoy the benefits of the relaxation of world tension and genuine security in every region  so that they can concentrate all their efforts on the long-terra development of their respective countries The broad movement towards the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones is spreading across Europe  Asia  Africa  Latin America and Oceania; it reflects the peoples' determination to continue their struggle to reverse the costly and dangerous arms race in outer space and to secure a complete ban on nuclear tests and a prohibition of the testing and production of other weapons of mass destruction.  The need to struggle for peace and disarmament cannot be dissociated from the nationsâ struggle for independence and development. The serious economic difficulties now facing the developing countries require common efforts by the international community to bridge the ever-widening gap between the developed and the developing countries. External debt  the flow of capital resources from developing to developed countries  protectionism and unequal terms of trades these are serious problems requiring urgent and effective solutions that would contribute to the establishment of a just and equitable new international economic order. The expansion of bilateral and multilateral economic co-operation and  especially  the promotion of regional co-operation in order to tackle the major challenges more effectively  as well as the need for a readjustment of the economic development strategies of nations - which is required by the scientific and technological revolution - are the real imperatives of our times.The new developments in regard to peaceful coexistence in the world and the persistent endeavours of nations in various regions to achieve peace  independence and development have revealed the real possibility that many regional problems can be solved peacefully through dialogue. Although  for various reasons  the results obtained vary in degree  peace talks have aroused high hopes about the search for a political settlement of regional conflicts. We are witnessing vivid and diverse manifestations of that trend in various parts of the world - from Afghanistan to southern Africa  from the Gulf region to the Korean peninsula  from Cyprus to Western Sahara.In keeping with its unswerving position  Viet Nam extends its constant solidarity and strong support to the heroic peoples of Cuba  Nicaragua and Panama in their staunch struggle against the imperialist forces that stubbornly continue to engage in interventionist and hostile policies  and for the defence of their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. We value highly the good will shown and the major efforts made by Afghanistan and the Soviet Union in implementing the Geneva agreements and strongly urge the other parties concerned to implement these agreements scrupulously in order to put an early end to the conflict and enable the Afghan people to live in peace and national harmony.Like the rest of the international community  Viet Nam supports the correct position adopted and the good will shown by Angola and Cuba in order to ensure progress in ongoing quadripartite negotiations towards a solution that would guarantee Angola's sovereignty  security and territorial integrity as well as Namibia's genuine independence. The South African authorities must implement strictly the agreements reached and put an end to their warlike policy  so that peace and security can soon be restored to that region.For the sake of peace in the Middle East and the legitimate rights of the heroic Palestinian people  Viet Nam fully supports the convening of an international conference - with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization on an equal footing with the other parties concerned - for the purpose of finding a fair and realistic settlement.We whole-heartedly welcome the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and hope that their bilateral talks will soon bring about lasting peace for the peoples of those two countries. As for the Korean peninsula  we hope that in the not-too-distant future the United Nations will be able to welcome in its midst a peaceful  reunified Korea  free from the presence of foreign troops.With regard to regional questions  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has a consistent position of supporting the trend towards the peaceful settlement among the countries of each region of the disputes and conflicts in that region on the basis of respect for the independence and sovereignty of each country as the legitimate interests and equal security of all the parties concerned  and of supporting all processes designed to achieve national reconciliation without outside interference. That Vietnamese position is in conformity with the view of the Non-Aligned Movement  as expressed most recently in the Final Document of its Ministerial Meeting in Nicosia  Cyprus. South-East Asia has of late witnessed positive developments that are in keeping with universal trends and the earnest aspirations of the peoples of that region  particularly since Viet Nam  with the agreement of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  recently announced the withdrawal of 50 000 troops and the command of its volunteer forces from Kampuchea. For the first time in that part of the world  which has been a theatre of constant tension over the past 40 years  favourable factors have emerged for mutual understanding and trust and friendly co-operation among the countries of the region  which are so necessary for them to find together a fair and reasonable political solution to the Kampuchean question and to build South-East Asia into a zone of lasting peace and stability.On the basis of the agreement readied in Ho Chi Minh City in July 1987 between Indonesia and Viet Nam  representing the two groups of countries in South-East Asia  the four parties of the two opposing sides in Kampuchea and the two groups of countries in South-East Asia have for the first time  after 10 years of intense confrontation  come to engage in dialogue at the Jakarta Informal Meeting in discussions on a political solution to the Kampuchean question  with the prospect of a peaceful and stable South-East Asia.The Jakarta Informal Meeting took the Kampuchean question out of deadlock because that meeting did not follow the beaten track of the past 10 years  in which the will and interests of one side were imposed on the other. Its success constitutes a victory for regional co-operation  mutual understanding and respect for each other's interests  and first and foremost the legitimate interests of the Kampuchean people.It was thus possible in Jakarta  for the first time  for a consensus to be reached among the parties directly concerned in the region on recognition of the two interlinked key issues of the Kampuchean problem  namely the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Kampuchea and the prevention of the return to Kampuchea of the genocide Pol Pot regime. Besides this extremely important achievement of the Jakarta Informal Meeting  in Jakarta Prince Sihanouk and Chairman Hun Sen readied an agreement to resume their talks in Paris to discuss further the internal problems of Kampuchea in a spirit of national reconciliation.The results of the Jakarta Informal Meeting and the agreement reached between Prince Sihanouk and Chairman Him Sen have not only broken the stalemate of the past 10 years but have also created a framework for a political settlement of the Kampuchean question in both its internal and its international aspects. They have thus opened up the prospect of solving the Kampuchean issue i""1 the not too distant future.	.That is precisely why the consensus readied at the Jakarta Informal Meeting has been widely welcomed and supported by world public opinion from the East to the Hest  which regards it as movement in the correct direction  to be further encouraged and supported. The Non-Aligned Movement in particular  with its constructive initiatives  has extended valuable and timely support to the common endeavours of the South-East Asian countries to find an early solution to the Kampuchea  question  thus contributing to turning that region of confrontation and tension into a zone of lasting peace  stability  friendship and co-operation.In this very forum  all the countries that are concerned about the Kampuchean question and peace and stability in South-East Asia  and sincerely desire to make a constructive contribution  have noted with satisfaction that  given the recent profound changes in South-East Asia  there now exists a real possibility of achieving a political settlement of the Kampuchean question.Regrettably  however  despite this cannon trend  some in this forum are still trying to swift against the tide. After 10 years  they have tried by any means available to distract world opinion in an attempt to cover up the appalling crimes committed between 1975 and 1984 by an utterly inhuman regime against an entire nation  and to blur the all too real danger of the scourge of renewed genocide in the land of Angkor.With their one-sided arguments and their distortions of the realities in Kampuchea  they attempt to represent the genocidal clique as pitiful victims whom foreign troops have unjustly deprived of their freedom to commit genocide. Is it by way of compensation that this genocidal clique has been allowed to retain the right to represent the Kampuchean people at the United Nations? As for those who  together with their fellow Kampuchean  have made every effort over the past 10 years to resurrect from the ruins and the killing fields left behind by the Pol Pot regime a new Kampuchean State full of vitality and having a political  economic and social life  they are denied that legitimate right.Such is the shocking reality  despite the existence since 1948 of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.Worse yet  in the face of world opinion's strong condemnation of the genocidal Pol Pot clique  the latter's sponsors have taken up an odd line of reasoning  putting on an equal footing the danger of the genocidal Pol Pot clique and the existence of the Administration of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  which enjoys the full support of the Kampuchean people and Has done its utmost to overcome the terrible legacy of the genocidal Pol Pot regime.These same people also claim that they pursue no self-interest in their approach to the Kampuchean question. If that is so  why do they make a series of demands that are tantamount to imposing their will on the Kampuchean people  including on matters pertaining to Kampuchea 's purely internal problems? They demand that the future Administration of Kampuchea be like this  and its army like that. Is that the way to respect the Kampuchean people's right to self-determination? Or are these demands only aimed at serving their purpose of preserving and legalizing the genocidal Pol Pot forces as part of a solution of the Kampuchean question?I have been compelled to express the aforementioned views in order to reply to assertions that cannot remain unanswered. It is not my intention to engage in polemics in this forum. I only wish to engage in constructive exchanges of views here in an atmosphere of goodwill  with a view to contributing usefully to world peace as well as to peace and stability in our region.Once again  Viet Nam reaffirms its full support foe and active contribution to all efforts to find an early political solution to the Kampuchean problem. We are of the view that a political settlement of the Kampuchean question should ensure the legitimate interests of the Kampuchean people first and foremost  their right to live free from the danger of another genocide  while duly taking into account the security interests of all parties concerned  including the People's Republic of China. Like many other regional problems  the Kampuchean question has two aspects: the internal and the international. Viet Nam wishes to secure a comprehensive settlement that would solve both aspects. If that is not yet possible we think that the international aspect of the Kampuchean question could be solved first  as has been clearly indicated by the Jakarta Informal Meeting. As for the internal aspect of the question  it should be left to the Kampucheans themselves to settle this without outside interference. All other countries should respect the Kampuchean people's right to self-determination and the agreements reached by the Kampuchean parties.For its part  Viet Nam  in a spirit of regional co-operation and together with other South-East Asian countries  will do its best to make the forthcoming session of the Jakarta Informal Meeting a success. In keeping with the spirit of regional co-operation  Viet Nam will strictly carry out its announced withdrawal of 50 000 of its troops from Kampuchea in 1988. The remaining Vietnamese forces will be completely withdrawn in 1990  as has been stated earlier. If a political solution  either comprehensive or partial  is reached  the total withdrawal will be affected sooner. The timetable for the troop withdrawal will be closely linked with the timetable for the cessation of all forms of outside interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea  in the spirit of consensus reached at the Jakarta Informal Meeting.Viet Nam's consistent wish is for a fair and reasonable settlement of the Kampuchean question. This  however  depends  not on the resolve of one side alone  but rather on the common goodwill of all the parties involved  and  in particular  on the determination of the countries of the region to continue to co-operate in the solution of the problem on the basis of the Jakarta consensus  especially at the meeting of the working group of the Jakarta Informal Meeting on 17 October. Desiring as we do an early  fair and reasonable political solution that guarantees the Kampuchean people a peaceful and happy life  with national reconciliation  in fulfilment of the common aspirations of all South-East Asian countries to peace and development  we fully support the seven-point proposal put forward at Jakarta by the People's Republic of Kampuchea. These points are the following. First  the aim is to build a peaceful  independent  democratic  sovereign  neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea.Second  by December 1989  or at the latest by the first quarter of 1990  all the remaining Vietnamese volunteer forces will be completely withdrawn from Kampuchea  along with the simultaneous ending of all foreign aid and sanctuaries provided to the genocidal Pol Potists and opposing Khmer forces and cessation of the use of Khmers in refugee camps against the Kampuchean people and of all foreign interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea.Third  the internal problems of Kampuchea must be settled by the Kampuchean parties themselves on the basis of national reconciliation  the exclusion of the criminal leadership of Pol Pot's genocidal regime and the inadmissibility of the Khmer Rouge armed forces.Fourth  the status quo in Kampuchea will be maintained until the completion of general elections to the National Assembly  which will then adopt a new constitution and form a coalition Government.	.Fifth  a national reconciliation council will be established made up of the four Kampuchean parties and headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. This council will be entrusted with the following duties; to implement all the agreements readied between the various Kampuchean parties; to organize general elections to the National Assembly. Sixth  an international control commission will be set up to supervise the implementation of all the agreements concluded.Seventh  a international conference will be convened  with the participation of Kampuchea  Laos  Viet Nam  the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  the Chairmen of the sixth  seventh and eighth summit Conferences of non-aligned countries  the Soviet Union  China  France  the United States of America  the United Kingdom and other countries that have contributed to the process of peace in South-East Asia  as well as the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The purpose of this conference will be to guarantee the independence  sovereignty  neutrality and non-alignment of Kampuchea  as well as peace and stability in South-East Asia.We welcome the Secretary-General's continued efforts aimed at promoting the implementation of the agreements reached at the Jakarta Informal Meeting and supporting the 5 November meeting between Chairman Hun Sen and Prince Norodon Sihanouk so that it may be a success.The period between now and 1990 offers us the best possible opportunity to bring the Kampuchean question to a close and to turn a new page in the history of relations among South-East Asian countries. Viet Nam sincerely wishes to build up mutual trust and relations of co-operation with all countries in the region in accordance with the spirit of the seven-point proposal on the principles governing the relations among South-East Asian countries  put forward by the Lao People's Democratic Republic at the Jakarta Informal Meeting. Relations of mutual trust and co-operation among South-East Asian countries are an essential factor in the creation of a favourable atmosphere for the settlement of the Kampuchean question. In the long run  this will provide a sound basis on which to assure the security and development interests of each country in South-East Asia. Only through regional co-operation can regional problems be solved.The world is moving away from confrontation towards dialogue and co-operation. The positive changes in the world situation in this direction in the last few years of the twentieth century have engendered hope for a world in which nations can live on an equal footing in peace and friendship without the threat of a nuclear war of extermination  in which regional conflicts can be solved not by the use of forces but through dialogue  and in which ideological differences do not hinder co-operation for the well-being of mankind. It is hoped that  with the emergence of these premises  this lofty aspiration will become a reality in the not-too-distant future for all the regions in the world  including South-East Asia. "
"148",7429,"VUT",43,1988,"ï»¿I have the honour to convey to Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina our congratulations on his election to the high office of President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. We has our best wishes for success and the assurance of our full co-operation  as he presides over what promises to be one of the most historic and far-reaching sessions of the General Assembly. We also has our appreciation for the very efficient manner in which he has thus far presided over our deliberations and otherwise piloted the business of the Assembly. In this respect  he has given us a great deal to be pleased with.It is appropriate  we believe  to gay a tribute also to Dame Ruth Nita Barrow  Permanent representative of Barbados  who was also a candidate for the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. This outstanding daughter of the Caribbean has given her country  her region  and her friends much to be proud of. It is rare for one region to present two such eminently qualified persons for the same office at the same time. In so doing this region has once again  as it did five years earlier  enhanced and encouraged the development of democratic processes within the United Nations itself. For this we commend them both and we thank the Assembly.Mr. Caputo is known as a man who cherishes democracy. His Government is one which is committed to democratic principles and ideals and which has worked hard to nurture and consolidate the restoration of his country's democracy. Thus  under his presidency  there can never be too many reminders of the importance of fostering and encouraging democracy  particularly in international relations and within international organizations. To us in Vanuatu  a small island developing State  the enhancement of international democratic processes is far more than a nice-sounding slogan  an interesting theory  or a remote abstraction. We view this as an essential element of our development as an independent State. Our very survival as a nation depends on universal respect for the most basic and fundamental principles of international law  particularly respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every country regardless of its size  its location  or the health of its economy.Unfortunately  in international relations there have always been a few who occasionally forget to live by these important principles. Like small countries in every region of the world we have in recent year Î± become very distressed by the rapidly accelerating tendency of some larger States to forsake calm and rational dialogue as a solution to international problems. They seem to favour instead an escalating arms race  threats  and the actual use of military force.In some instances  economic coercion and intimidation have been substituted for military force  but the results have been the same - international chaos. The chaos that has resulted may  on the surface  have appeared to be less violent than that which occurred during the two world wars earlier this century. However  to those who have been the victims of the chaos  the consequences have been as severe and as tragic as those of the two world wars. After all  how large is the world of a frightened refugee fleeing his or her home in a desperate attempt to save his or her life in southern Africa  in South-East Asia  in Central America  or in the Middle East? Therefore smaller countries# such as our own# often view with a sense of urgency the need for the international community to strengthen democratic processes and truly recognize the inherent equality of all human beings and by extension the sovereign equality of all nations - large and small  rich and poor. While we cannot comprehend are those who proclaim that all people are equal  or that all nations are equal# but who then act as if might - be it military or economic - makes some ""more equal"" than others.Thus# today  as hopes are being revived for genuine political dialogue to be a vehicle for resolving so many of the world's problems and as so many dreams of democratic freedoms are being born in so many places  we view this assemblage of nations as more relevant and potentially more dynamic than any other time in its brief history.Like so many others  we are encouraged by the possibility that hostilities and tensions may be diminishing in so many parts of the world and that peace may finally become a reality for so many beleaguered and besieged peoples. Military conflict between the world's two great super-Powers now appears less likely for this the entire world can breathe a collective sigh of relief. The war between Iran and Iraq may finally be coming to an end. The Soviet Union is demonstrating how great a Power it is by withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan as it promised it would. There are also faint glimmers of hope that the long and costly conflicts in Kampuchean Western Sahara  Chad  Namibia and Central America may possibly be resolved and the people of those countries left to choose their own future  free from outside interference. Furthermore  tentative steps have been taken to lay aside old antagonisms and differences in focus  the Korean peninsula  the Balkans  the Maghreb and the Horn of Africa. Every day former rivals are discovering that there is more that unites them than that divides them.However  we must be realistic and understand that the road to peace is still paved with a great many obstacles. In every one of the areas where there is new hope  we must understand that there is little that is certain. The process of finding workable solutions and then implementing those solutions remains fragile and extremely delicate in every one of the previously mentioned situations.Despite what some might like us to believe  dialogue itself is never the sole answer for resolving any conflict. For dialogue to succeed there must also be a willingness to work together and to change the past antagonistic relationships and actions which led to existing contradictions and hostilities. In certain instances  circumstances dictate that there will be no rational dialogue until there has been a political struggle.In this respect we are reminded once again of the words of Frederick Douglass  a leader of the anti-slavery movement during the nineteenth century and a great orator. As he most aptly put it ""Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will."" Had he been alive today he might very well have been examining life in South Africa under the heel of the apartheid regime  or the motivation of the Palestinian resistance  when he said: If there is no struggle  there is no progress. Those who profess to favour freedom  yet deprecate agitation  ate men who want ... rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.""We might do well to recall those words during our deliberations  particularly our deliberations on those items of our agenda which relate to pleas for justice from those who have for fat too long been denied justice.We believe that rational dialogue is the preferred way of conducting international relations and resolving disputes between nations. However  we also understand that dialogue is only possible when there is sin appreciation of its basis  and when there is common ground on which to meet.There is not likely to be a meaningful dialogue in South Africa until the illegitimate apartheid regime recognizes the humanity of the African majority  frees from prison all those it should be negotiating with and allows others to return from exile. There is not likely to be a successful dialogue on the question of Palestine until all the interested parties are brought together at an international conference. In our own region  the question of East Timor will not be resolved until the people of that Territory are part of the process of dialogue and are allowed to choose freely for themselves who they are and what they wish to be.Dialogue is not diatribe. The word carries within its meaning a willingness to listen and at least to understand the perspective of the partner in the dialogue. Perhaps the roost difficult notion for some to grasp is the notion that sincere dialogue does not necessarily entail claims that one party  but not the other  has seen the error of its ways and is now committed to change and to adopting the values and beliefs of its former adversary.  The largest and seemingly most intractable political problems between modern States can probably best be resolved by a convergence of views and a convergence of values. Mutual respect is the key  not domination or empty claims of triumph. As we all knew  in this nuclear age  this age of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction  there are few instances in which any particular State can claim outright victory and impose its will on another.New Caledonia is a case in point with respect to the effects of reasonableness and dialogue. During the last two General Assembly sessions  few items were as heatedly debated as the colonial status of our South Pacific neighbour. Our own relations with France  and those of our other Pacific neighbours  could not help but be affected by what we viewed as insensitivity to the legitimate aspirations of the colonized indigenous Kanak population of New Caledonia. We are pleased that today things are calmer in New Caledonia. This is due in part to the wisdom  the sensitivity and the courage of the current Government of France. It is also due to the courage and vision of New Caledonia's people and to their desire not to see their land torn further apart by civil inter-communal strife. There are still many difficult issues to be resolved in New Caledonia  but France deserves credit for changing the emotion-charged atmosphere in the Territory and taking measures to bring New Caledonia's people together in peace for a dialogue on the future.No one can predict with certainty what lies ahead. We recall what happened more than 14 years ago when another European country  which was then a colonial Fewer in Africa  underwent a change of Government. It then put forward various proposals and options which prompted the leadership of what was then a liberation movement and is now an African Government to issue a reminder that ""there is no such thing as democratic colonialism"". Those words ring as true today as they did in 1974. The South Pacific Forum  the Non-Aligned Movement and the united Nations have all contributed to the current hopeful state of affairs in New Caledonia  through their consistent support for well-established principles of self-determination and decolonization. However  the candid approach of the French Government and the patience and statesmanship of New Caledonia's people have been like a breath of fresh air.We believe that no possibility for further dialogue and peaceful evolution with regard to New Caledonia should be left unexplored. Therefore  we were encouraged by the consensus reached by the Special Committee on decolonization when it considered the question of New Caledonia in August. We hope that the General Assembly will encourage the parties to continue to work together by reaching the same consensus on the recommendations of the Committee of 24.My Government understands and supports the principled position of the African States on the issue of dumping nuclear and industrial waste in Africa. It was not too long ago that we raised the same issue with respect to our own region. We hope that that problem will be considered in its true global perspective rather than merely on a regional basis  which could lead to other regions' becoming dumping grounds for dangerous waste materials from the industrialized countries. We also hope that the views of the countries of the South Pacific on nuclear testing in our environment will similarly be understood and supported. What is at stake in Africa is also at stake in the South Pacific.The name of the country doing the testing or shipping the waste to be dumped is irrelevant to us. The stated purpose of the testing is also irrelevant  as is the money paid for the dumping. What matters to us is the harm being done to our waters  to our lands  to our atmosphere  to our sources of food and sustenance and to our unborn children. Please try to understand our concerns. It is ironic that many of the world's industrial countries became developed countries at the expense of what is now called the developing world. We  the now less-developed countries  were once forced to export cheap raw materials - and in some cases even our people  against their will - to help fuel the development of other countries. In return we were forced to accept certain manufactured goods  and agencies  in some cases even ÑÐµÐ¾Ñ1ÐµÐ³ in a reverse migration that was  again  against our will  against our own political and economic interests and ultimately against our own sovereignty.Now  we are still exporting raw materials. Today  they are called commodities  and we have little more to say about their prices than we did yesterday. Developing countries still export people as well. Some  of course  are refugees who have been made homeless and socially marginal. Others are not refugees but instead tend to be the most capable and best trained  with skills that are in great demand in developed countries and that ace in short supply in developing countries. However  owing to adverse economic conditions  those skilled individuals usually cannot be as highly compensated or recognized in our developing countries. Often  therefore  developing countries wind up with smaller long-term returns on expenditures for higher education and advanced training. Paradoxically  we sometimes find ourselves in a sense subsidizing developed countries  which  on a proportional basis  might actually spend less on education but which are able to offer far greater financial rewards to those trained by other societies.Developing countries also export something else  namely  capital  in the form of debt-servicing. That phenomenon has now appreciably widened the gap between have and have-not nations and created extremely dangerous social conditions in many debtor nations. It is almost incomprehensible that there is not a greater appreciation of the potential danger among the foremost decision-makers in the creditor States and financial institutions. It is also ironic that  while some were encouraged to borrow excessively  others found it almost impossible to borrow at all.The manner in which some countries were encouraged to burden themselves with excessive debt is somewhat similar to the manner in which individuals were encouraged to acquire other well-known addictions. The habit is proving to be just as difficult to break  and the social consequences just as severe.We offer those observations without bitterness  rancour or recrimination. We do not know of any easy solutions. However  we believe that we cannot adequately face the future without an understanding of the past. We cannot work together in finding answers until we know what questions we want answered.The recent natural disasters that have brought death  destruction and new hardships to the peoples of Jamaica  Mexico  Bangladesh and India have shocked the world. Humanitarian assistance has been mobilized to help speed recovery.However  we ask once again: why does the world always wait for disaster to strike before going to the aid of those who ate roost vulnerable?The specialized agencies of the United Nations system  particularly the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (PAO) do an excellent job with the resources they have at their command. Many private social and philanthropic organizations are also deeply committed and Involved in the development process. However  adverse environmental and climatic conditions  as well as the follies of mankind  are strong and persistent adversaries. They will not easily cease their assaults on the efforts to bring a better life to every corner of the globe. Thus  my Government joins with those who appeal greater international co-operation in United Nations development activities and disaster-relief efforts. We join with those who appeal for an end to the arms race and arms trafficking. We join with those who work relentlessly to end drug trafficking and the social devastation it brings in its wake. We applaud initiatives to study and address the serious threat posed to life on this planet by the destruction of the Earth's protective ozone layer. It appears that in the years to come no issue will be more vital to mankind's survival. The gravity of this issue is reflected in the fact that even as we meet here today more chlorine and other chemicals are being released into our atmosphere. These will cause even more depletion of the ozone shield well into the next century.Mankind has been blessed  we believe  with a high form of intelligence and a wide range of emotions. Occasionally we utilize this blessing as if it were a curse on our fellow human beings.We have created horrible weapons of mass destruction  ranging from large stockpiles of conventional arms to chemical and bacteriological agents and nuclear devices. Unfortunately  those who have such weapons are seldom satisfied with their mere creation and possession.The use of these instruments of death has always been among the saddest chapters of the human experience  lb day more than ever before the international community should speak with one loud and clear voice against the manufacture  stockpiling and use of all these instruments of unholy terror. Our failure to do so can only result in greater human tragedy and irreparably rupture the thread that binds us all together.During last year's general debate we expressed our sadness that inter-communal strife was plaguing every corner of the globe. Unfortunately  the plague seems to have worsened during the past year. Once again  it is not necessary to recite names  dates or placesÂ·  we are all painfully familiar with them. Nor do we wish to single out any particular country or region. The problem is universal. Once again we note that much of this inter-communal of ethnic strife has its roots in colonial history  during which colonialist practices often appeared to favour one ethnic group over another. However  some of today's inter-communal or ethnic conflicts either pre-date or are not at all related to colonialism. These are  rather  the result of ancient antagonisms and rivalries that all Governments should find unacceptable in the contemporary world.While we are concerned at the growth and proliferation of these conflicts  we firmly adhere to the well-founded principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States and respect for the territorial integrity of every internationally recognized State.We are aware that from time to time Internal and external opponents of particular Governments have incited or helped fan the flames of inter-communal or ethnic strife. However  that does not mean that we should close our eyes or our ears and pretend that the problem does not exist. This is a major problem which Is likely to become worse unless the nations of the world exercise strong moral leadership.Many people in the world look to the United Nations for such leadership. Generally speaking  we do not fail to exercise this leadership in a responsible fashion. The general subject of inter-communal or ethnic relations is one on which we believe that the international community should exercise its moral leadership by its example. We despair when we note that no region of the world and no country anywhere is completely Immune from this problem. Even the largest and wealthiest countries in the developed world have had to face this difficult issue  and still face it today. Those that face the issue with the greatest candour will make the greatest advances in stemming ethnic fears and bettering human relations. For developing countries  our failure to recognize that the problem exists can only have disastrous consequences. We wish to see no society torn asunder  no country dismembered  no people displaced or disenfranchised and no Government embarrassed. We wish  rather  to encourage peoples everywhere to respect the cultures  customs and history of others. We wish to encourage greater understanding of what has divided people in the past and what can unite them in the future. We wish to see a broad international consensus appealing for an end to inter-communal strife  better inter-ethnic relations  and social progress and economic development for all peoples in every corner of the world.Perhaps this vision of ours is a dream. However  it is a dream we are proud to possess and be possessed by. We pray that others share this dream and will be willing to join in making it a reality. What could possibly be more consistent with the ideals that have brought us together? What could possibly be more consistent with our own pronouncements on the evils of apartheid and other forms of institutionalized racism? What better way to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?I conclude by conveying our appreciation of the efforts of the President of the last session  Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic  and those of our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. Their dedication  their patience and their successes on our behalf have in many ways helped to make the future far brighter than it was one year ago.The recent award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations for its peace-keeping operations is very appropriate recognition of the fact that  through his tireless efforts and with the able assistance of a Secretariat of which we should all be proud  the Secretary-General has at last succeeded in narrowly opening the door to the very long corridor to peace  justice and harmony. Now we  the nations of the world  must do our best to play our part by opening the door further and taking the next important step. It rests with us to cross the threshold of that door and begin the long walk down that corridor together  hand in hand.Let us draw strength from our unity. Let us draw courage from the realization of our common fate should we fail or should we falter. Let us be nations that are  in purpose and objectives  truly united."
"149",7463,"WSM",43,1988,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is my great pleasure to extend to you the congratulations of my government on your election to your high office. It is a recognition not only of your personal qualities but of the important role you have played in the re-emergence of democratic traditions in your country  and of the esteem that Argentina enjoys in the world community today.We must also record our thanks to Mr. Peter Florin for the impeccable manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the forty-second session of the General Assembly.Samoa has constantly sounded notes of hope and optimism lit our statements since we joined the United Nations 12 years ago - notes of hope that were often drowned out by the more despondent tones of doubt and the dire predictions of the doomsayers. However  we were not disheartened  and our faith and belief in the United Nations as the great hope of  particularly  the small nations  has never dimmed. It is  therefore with a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction that we feel able today to say with confidence that our optimism was not unjustified. After some years of international introspection and critical self-examination  we have arrived at a time when a certain amount of congratulation is in order  and when it can be said that the international community is becoming aware of the importance of the United Nations once again. There are  indeed  successes for all to see.These successes  which we must acknowledge  mark in most cases the fruition of long and often frustrating efforts on the part of all concerned  and owe much to the dedication  patience and persistence of the Secretary-General and our international civil servants. Through the difficult times  morale has been maintained  the quest for international peace has continued  and progress has been achieved.It is  then  most timely and fitting that the Nobel Peace Prise should have been awarded this year to the United Nations peace-keeping forces  which are indeed a symbol to the world of the United Nations and its aims. We congratulate the Secretary-General  his staff  the troop-contributing countries  and  of course  the troops themselves. Their heroic stoicism and quiet sacrifice have too long gone unsung.Let us then applaud the progress made in so many areas of the world where the problems had seemed insoluble. It is remarkable that across the world  from one far-flung trouble spot to another  settlements are slowly beginning to emerge  and world tensions are lessening. There is little doubt that major factors in this change are the lessening of tension between the great Powers and a new willingness on their part to work through the United Nations  thus enabling it more successfully to do the work envisaged by the framers of its Charter. We acknowledge and applaud this most encouraging development in international relations. We hope to see it grow and expand. If it does  then much credit will be due the leaders of those great nations for their enlightened statesmanship and the realisation that much of the world's well-being depends on them and the actions of their countries.We turn  then  with hope in our hearts to a brief consideration of developments in the troubled regions of the world.The Iran-Iraq cease-fire is an excellent example of the co-operation of the great Powers with one another and with the other members of the Security Council. Under the leadership of the Secretary-General  the Security Council has persisted with patience and diplomacy in pursuit of a settlement. How a cease-fire has been achieved  a result which seemed impossible a year ago. United Nations peace-keeping forces are in place and the expansion of the peace-keeping function to posts both there and in Afghanistan testifies to the important role those forces are able to perform world-wide if given the requisite goodwill. Now  for Iran and Iraq  the focus must b  on the full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  and on the healing of the wounds they have inflicted on one another.In Afghanistan  the Geneva Accords were achieved  once again  as the result of steady and persistent effort under the auspices of the United Nations  with the Secretary-General and his personal envoy  Mr. Diego Cordoves  playing vital roles. The Soviet Union has withdrawn 50 per cent of its forces  as promised. While this is encouraging  it must complete its troop withdrawal as scheduled to enable the process of self-determination to take place within Afghanistan. While problems remain  the progress towards the restoration of peace to that shattered land continues. It must remain on track  for it is only when the fighting ceases  the refugees are enabled to return home and dialogue begins among the various groups in Afghanistan that the people of Afghanistan will be able finally to begin to put their lives together again and choose at last the form of government under which they wish to live.We welcome the progress made in the negotiations on the problems in south-western Africa and are much encouraged by the improved prospects for the independence of Namibia. It is very good news that an advance team can now go to Namibia to prepare for the United Nations military and civilian presence in the Territory. At last  perhaps  the United Nations can play its appropriate role in Namibia  and the United Nations Transition Assistance Group can expedite the Territory's peaceful transition to independence.Also showing promise  assisted by the good offices of both the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  is the situation in Western Sahara. There  as the Secretary-General says in his annual report on the work of the Organisation ""an appropriate climate has been established for a just and durable solution of the problem."" CA/43/1. p. 3>Once again  we understand  the United Nations will be significantly involved both in a military and in a civilian capacity  and a referendum supervised by the United Nations will give the people of Western Sahara the opportunity to make a genuine choice about their future.When we consider the problems of Cyprus  we see that once again perseverance has paid off; the leaders of the two sides have agreed to meet for talks without any pre-conditions  and those meetings are under way. They will try to achieve a negotiated settlement of the problem by 1 June 1989. The Secretary-General's good offices have been instrumental in this process and have justified the faith the Security Council placed in him when it entrusted his mandate to him. In our own region  developmentÂ· in Now Caledonia in recent months give us reason to be greatly encouraged about peace and good-neighbourliness in the South Pacific. Initiatives embarked on by France  resulting in the Matignon and Oudinot accords have brought about dramatic change in New Caledonia. Where there was serious likelihood of a real tragedy  there is now optimism and a genuine spirit of realistic accommodation and reconciliation. The South Pacific Forum applauds the efforts and commitment of the administering country  France  as well as the courage and leadership that have been in evidence within the major groups in Mew Caledonia itself in making possible the progress so far achieved.Western Samoa strongly supports the process now in train to produce a genuine and meaningful act of self-determination for a reconciled New Caledonia in a manner that will accommodate the legitimate interests of all its people  including its indigenous population. That is true of the Kampuchean situation  for instance  which is showing promising signs but where there are some difficulties yet to be resolved. The members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASSAM) have shown diplomacy and leadership in the region on this issue. They have recently successfully brought the parties concerned together at the Jakarta Informal Meeting  convened by Indonesia. We trust that this has prepared the way for the convening of an international conference  preferably under the auspices of the Secretary-General. The Vietnamese must be held to their commitment to withdraw all their forces by 1990 and the country must then be readied for an act of self-determination. For this  national reconciliation is necessary and it should take place under the leadership of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk  with the quadripartite arrangement  representing all the parties concerned  in place. There must also be effective arrangements to ensure that there is no return to the universally condemned policies and practices of a recent past. During these processes there should be a role for United Nations peace-keeping and supervision.There are some encouraging initiatives on the Korean peninsula. President Roh has recently proposed a meeting of the Presidents of the North and the South and  indeed  a direct dialogue is essential to any peaceful path to a solution. Once again  we feel that the United Nations environment is often the best for reconciliation and  in the interests of the universality which we strongly support  we would hope that North and South Korea will be represented in our Organisation in the near future. The Republic of Korea must be congratulated on the manner in which it served as host to the Olympic Games  so successfully concluded a fortnight ago - evidence indeed of South Korea's competence in the international arena.There is a definite role for the United Nations to play in regard to the Middle East. Here the problems remain intractable  with tensions recently aggravated by the uprisings on the Nest Bank  fuelled by years of frustration  and the manner in which they have been handled. The violence of these developments has made it clear that vigorous efforts must be made to find a solution for this increasingly volatile situation. An international conference under the auspices of the United Nations  with all concerned parties participating  would seem to us the best approach. It is imperative that Israel recognise the right of the. Palestinians to self-determination and their right to establish a State of their own. Conversely  the Palestinians must recognise Israel's right to exist within internationally recognised and secure boundaries. Both sides must renounce violence and must resort  for a change  to dialogue.Another area which shows little promise of peace at the moment is Lebanon.That tragic country is still devastated and divided  and the situation gives little cause for optimism. Once again we call on others to cease taking advantage of Lebanon's crisis and refrain from interference in its affairs. Also  the troops of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in place there must be allowed to carry out their duties without harassment and the threat of death.In Central America the progress towards peace seems  sadly  to have stalled. There were promising signs - with blueprints for peace painstakingly laid out in the regional peace plan  Esquipulas II  adopted by the five Presidents of the Central American countries. That plan is based on the Arias plan formulated by President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica. For his efforts President Arias received the Nobel Peace Prise  and we had hoped that that would stimulate the peace process in  the region. We look to see a rekindling of enthusiasm and a revival of the dialogue so that eventually the aspirations of the peoples of Central America to live in democratic and peaceful conditions may be achieved.In South Africa there can be no possibility of a solution until the South African Government is made to realise that it must abandon apartheid in any of its evil forms or manifestations. That Government must realise that there is no way that apartheid can be reformed: its total abolition is the only answer. The situation is constantly deteriorating  with increasingly repressive actions keeping the tensions at boiling point. The South African Government must release Nelson Mandela  now 70 years old and in poor health  and the other political prisoners; it must lift the bans front the prohibited organisations which oppose apartheid and thereby create conditions conducive to dialogue. Dialogue and the eschewing of violence and repression are the only case preliminary paths to the creation of an atmosphere where a solution can be sought.In spite of international condemnation the South African regime remains determined to maintain  with whatever means at its disposal  its abhorrent total disregard for basic human rights. This intransigence  in Western Samoa's view  justifies the intensification and expansion of economic sanctions against South Africa.While South Africa certainly stands out as the most blatant instance of the denial of human rights we have to contend with  we should not allow it to divert our attention from other abuses of human rights around the globe. The Organisation must ensure that the suffering and inhumanity that go hand in hand with abuses of human rights are addressed  and eliminated wherever they occur.Human rights is one of the areas where we hope to see the United Nations role grow and expand  for we feel there is much potential for a United Nations in which the world has more confidence to operate more actively in this field. On 10 December we shall celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Sights. But there is little to celebrate when we consider the actual practices around the world. While human rights instruments have been proliferating  so have inhuman practices. This grim irony is further exemplified  by the recent re-emergence of chemicals as weapons for one people's use against another. This practice mocks the very dignity of mankind and must be banned for ever. We are pleased to note President Reagan's proposal made here for the convening of a conference of the parties to the 1925 Geneva Protocol and that this proposal was also supported by Mr. Shevardnadse. Of course it is imperative also that the drafting of a convention banning chemical weapons be continued and completed as soon as possible.One of the brightest hopes we have this year is the likelihood of the dawning of a whole new era in disarmament. Despite the lack of concrete results from the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  we are much encouraged that the relaxing of tensions between the super-Powers has led to their agreement to dismantle an entire class of nuclear weapons under the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty. We trust that this breakthrough will herald a new attitude to disarmament. Much progress has already been made towards the conclusion of a START Treaty which would cut the super-Powers' strategic nuclear arsenals by 50 per cent. Both countries have accepted verification procedures that would have been anathema to them in the past. The two countries have gone so far as to exchange visits of military personnel at Chief-of-Staff level. This new-found flexibility and reasonableness must not only pave the way for future reductions of their own still awesome arsenals but will  it is hoped  encourage other nuclear-weapon States to begin the process of nuclear disarmament. Similarly it is hoped that those States that do not have nuclear weapons but might aspire to them will see the futility of acquiring such unusable and ultimately useless tools of war. We hope there will be a renewal of confidence in the Hon-Proliferation Treaty  a Treaty that deserves the support of all nations dedicated to a nuclear-weapon-free world. This is of crucial importance  especially to the small and vulnerable States of the world. This year is the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Treaty; and it has served as an effective barrier to the acquisition of nuclear weapons by more States. In its 20 years of existence  no new nuclear-weapon State has emerged and more than 130 States have become parties to the Treaty and committed themselves not to acquire nuclear weapons. 2t must be strengthened and adhered to.There is still an urgent need for the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty prohibiting all nuclear tests by all States in all environments for all time. As we learn daily how ignorant we have been about the destruction we have already wrought on this Earth  we are alarmed and realise with more certainty than ever before that all nuclear testing must cease. It must cease  not only because the further development of nuclear weapons is undesirable but also because of the damage to the Earth testing is causing  much of which may as yet have gone undetected by scientists. After all  scientists themselves have admitted how often they have been wrong in the past and how much there is still to learn about our environment.We in the South Pacific have wondered and worried for years now about the effects of the French nuclear testing in our region. Once again we ask that it be stopped. We do not believe in the whole premise on which such testing is based; so why should we be subjected to its effects? We do not believe that nuclear weapons should exist and we believe that those in existence should be destroyed. We believe that the preservation of our God-given environment in as pristine a condition as possible is of paramount importance not only to our region but to the world as a whole.Recent events have made us realise that we are all ecologically connected; events occurring in one part of the world can have ecological consequences on the far side of the world. Plastic bags thrown into one ocean choke sea creatures in another ocean; fumes from industrial pollution in one country cause acid rain to kill forests in another country thousands of miles away; deforestation the world over can not only cause erosion and floods miles from where it occurs  but is occurring on such a large scale that it threatens to change the climate of the entire world for ever.It is certainly Ironic that just as we saw developments that give us reason to believe that we may be able to avoid the nuclear holocaust we have all feared for years we begin to realise that we may have irrevocably sown the seeds of destruction for this Earth in many other ways and that it may be too late to reverse much of the damage already done.Scientists tell us that the thinning of the ozone layer and resultant greenhouse effect are the cumulative results of our pollutants. What is truly terrifying is that some scientists think that the damage we see today is the consequence of what we did 30 years ago when pollutants were fewer and less potent  and that it is our children who will feel the much greater damage resulting from our activities today.How tragic for our children  or their children  to inherit an Earth enshrouded in a deadly pall of pollutants; awash with waters full of poison; fouled with animals dead or dying; stripped of timber; with soils exhausted  devoid of nutrients desertified or dangerously laced with toxins; and with valleys  rivers and lakes piled full of garbage. For it may come to this if we do not soon realise that the catastrophes we are experiencing are sighs from an ailing and weary Mother Earth moaning that she is just ""not able to take it any more"".We sympathise with those nations - Bangladesh Jamaica Mexico the Dominican Republic and the Sudan - which have suffered the most recent tragedies; but it is at our peril that we ignore these warnings and all the other signs we have received. The World Commission on Environment and Development chaired by Prime Minister Brundtland put it to us squarely and we must act. Both rich and poor nations  both North and South are guilty. Development in the future must be in harmony with the environment.No are pleased to welcome Prime Minister Mulroney's announcement here that Canada will establish a centre to promote the concept of environmentally sustainable development internationally and also Canada's support of a feasibility study on a World Conservation Bank to work with the World Bank  for environmental concerns MUST be an integral part of any development efforts. We strongly support the calls for a high-level United Nations conference on environmental matters  and the sooner the better. While I said both North and South are guilty of environmental rape and pillage  the reasons are usually different in the two regions. In the developed countries misuse of the environment most often to provide comfort and convenience  and sometimes purely for sport or greed. Greed and expansion were certainly motives in recent attempts to export toxic wastes from North to South. While the countries of the South are certainly not free from base motivations  very often their populations are merely trying to survive.Thus  we must urgently confront the inequities of the world's economic situation. The least developed feel these inequities most keenly  but all developing countries suffer from slow or negative growth  commodity price declines and adverse terms of trade  to name but a few problems. It is to be hoped that the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade and other international initiatives will address more effectively the economic plight of the poorer nations of the world.We began this address with a reaffirmation of our confidence in and commitment to the United Nations and its work. For there is no doubt that loyalty to the United Nations on the part of all its Members is the key to the Organisation's ability to carry its urgent work forward. Further progress in the reform and revitalisation of the United Nations depends on Member support  both moral and financial. Now is the time to encourage the progress begun. We are pleased that both the United States and the USSR now intend to pay their past dues and meet their financial responsibilities to the United Nations. We urge all Members to meet their obligations as well.The spirit of multilateralism certainly seems to have been reborn and must be nurtured  for it must finally be apparent to all nations that the time for rhetoric and propaganda is past and the time for co-operation is at hand. The Secretary-General in his report last year said that it was as if ""the sails of the small boat in which all the people of the earth are gathered had caught again on a light but favourable wind"" (A/42/1  p. 2) - indicating that there was hope  though it might be faint. This year he is able to report that ""With careful and patient navigation  the vessel has come within eight of large sections of the shore"". (A/43/1  p. 2) That is Î± much more hopeful future. Indeed  we agree  and while there are still sane reefs to negotiate  a safe arrival seems much more likely  for with the present international climate the sailing weather is good  or  as we say in Samoa: ""A favourable wind is felt on the body. Let the boat be guided by an experienced and competent helmsman."" "
"150",7504,"YEM",43,1988,"ï»¿I wish first to congratulate Mr. Dante Caputo  on behalf of the delegation of Yemen and on my own behalf  on his election as President of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am certain that his generally recognized qualities as an experienced diplomat will prove invaluable for the success of this session. I can assure him that my delegation will do its utmost in working closely with him as he endeavours to carry out the tasks assigned to him and in the Interests of satisfactory results for this session.I am pleased to thank warmly his predecessor  Mr. Peter Florin  who guided the proceedings of the previous session and of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament with great confidence and dedication. It is also a pleasure for me to congratulate warmly the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  on his praiseworthy efforts to resolve many problems In keeping with the objectives of this Organization and In the maintenance of International peace and security.On this occasion I cannot fall also to congratulate the Secretary-General and his associates  especially those who are devoted to peace and security and who have devoted their lives to the preservation of peace In many areas of the world. I refer in particular to the peace-keeping forces  which most assuredly deserved the award of the Nobel Peace Prize. Those forces  which are active in many areas of the world  unquestionably reflect the unanimous will of the world community represented here to see real dialogue established where the sounds of war are heard. We thank the Nobel Prize Committee on Its choice  which reflects the confidence of the international community In the peace-keeping forces and In their humanitarian mission. I am pleased also to praise the valuable report submitted by the Secretary-General on the work of the Organisation  an eminently positive role it plays within the context of the general trend to find solutions to the chronic problems which threaten international peace and security  and whose main aspect is the maintenance of international peace and security. Our Organization has given the international community proof of its effectiveness as a result of its efforts in Afghanistan  the Arab Gulf  South-East Asia  South-west Africa and Western Sahara. Those efforts not only prove that the Organization is playing an invaluable role in maintaining international peace and security but also show that success or failure in peace-making efforts all largely depend on the conduct of the Member States and their determination to find solutions - through peaceful means and by refusing recourse to force even when one of the parties enjoys marked superiority - to the problems the world faces  for problems there will be as long as the world exists. Whenever when one party to a conflict has a marked superiority  efforts must be made to bring about peace.This session is being held in a general atmosphere of optimism and dÃ©tente the result of the progress that has been made and the relaxation of tension between the two major Powers  a concrete expression of which was the signing of a treaty reducing intermediate and long-range missiles. That is a first step towards general and complete disarmament as my country said when the treaty was signed. My country expressed its great pleasure at the signing but we believe that what has been achieved so far applies to only a tiny fraction of the nuclear arsenals it is just a start.The international community urgently calls for general and complete disarmament. Only when it is achieved can mankind's hopes for peace and understanding be realized. That is why we call on the international community; particularly the nuclear-weapon States - to make the Middle East and The Indian Ocean nuclear-weapon-free zones.I cannot fail to express the deep concern of the countries of our pact of the world about the present situation there. A State born of aggression and usurpation - Israel - and another country whose policies are based on racial discrimination and racial exclusivity South Africa - refuse to have their nuclear facilities inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as the international community desires.The relaxation of tension between the two super-Powers augurs well for a future free from tension  on the basis of co-operation. Peaceful solutions to problems can be found in keeping with the right of peoples and free of outmoded policies based on efforts to gain illicit advantages which are likely only to bring the world to the brink of disaster. That is why my country supports the proposal to abolish nuclear weapons by the end of the century. We would also support any attempt to end nuclear tests and to strengthen the role of the United Nations politically and financially  in order to devote the sums poured into the arms race today to economic and social development  the kind of development that the least advanced countries sorely need and that is needed to create a world of peace  stability and justice in which we are all free from domination and exploitation.My country believes that the militarization of outer space is a new threat to mankind  for mankind wishes to be free from the threat of the use of weapons and it would like to use outer space not for military but for peaceful purposes serving the interests of all mankind.My country reaffirms its refusal to accept any military presence in the Indian Ocean. We should like to see a nuclear-free zone in that part of the world and in the Mediterranean basin  where there continue to be serious threats caused by the actions of a State born of aggression and colonial expansion. I refer to the Zionist entity in occupied Palestine.The problem of the Middle East has existed now for more than 40 years. It was 40 years ago that Israel emerged as a racist  expansionist entity in the Middle East. For the past 40 years the region has been ravaged by successive wars which have seriously threatened regional peace and security and  even more  world peace and security. That has all been the result of Israel's aggressive policies and of the occupation of Palestine and other Arab territories since 1947.There has been a refusal to recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  and Israel has engaged in aggression against the Palestinian and other Arab peoples. Time and time again we have called on the international community in this Assembly to discharge its responsibilities and face up to the situation in the Middle East  to force the Zionist entity to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and to recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. But  despite the international community's recognition of the legitimate rights of Palestinian people  in particular its right to return hone and to establish its own independent State on its own land  Israel continues to pursue a policy of tyranny  repression and terrorist against the defenceless Palestinians  thereby violating United Nations resolutions and defying the unanimous will of the international community  and thus defying all humanitarian values.During the past 10 months  the world has witnessed an uprising of Palestinians in occupied lands and crimes perpetrated by Israel in an attempt to deal with the uprising. I refer  of course  to the killing  torture  arrests and deportations engaged in by the Israeli forces against the Palestinians  the old and the young  men  women and children  in defiance of the will of the international community and resolutions adopted by it  including resolutions adopted by the Security Council and other international bodies.Israel's intransigence is matched only by the arrogance of that country  which has the support of certain Member States of the Organization. But we have every reason to hope that the popular uprising in the occupied territories will make it possible to draw a distinction between what is true and what is false. All of us who are members of the United Nations must follow the proper course of action. For the truth is now clear for all to see. I call on those who still hesitate to recognize the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people to realize that it is high time for all of us to work together and put an end to Zionist occupation  so that we may respect the promises  the commitments  we entered into when we members of the Organization. It is dismaying indeed to see some States which would have us believe that they are champions of human rights and which have imposed sanctions against certain other States which have allegedly committed acts against those rights  suddenly changing course when it is a question of their own affairs and Israel's actions against the Palestinian people. That is why we believe our relations must be based on well-established humanitarian principles and values  and not on duplicity  we must not apply a double standardÂ·  we must view matters fairly.That is why we believe the United Nations is now beginning to play an important role  owing to the relaxation of tension between the two super-Powers. We also believe that the Organization  and particularly the Security Council  will now be able to take proper action against Israel's inhuman acts against the Palestinians  committed daily for all the world to see. Everyone knows full well that the failure of the international community to find a solution to this problem is due to Israel's stubborn refusal to implement the United Nations resolutions. My delegation believes that the only framework within which a just and lasting peace can be established in the Middle East is that of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (Ð LO)  the sole  authentic representative of the Palestinian people. If the rights of these people are not recognized  then failure will be inevitable I wish now to stress the gravity of the situation in Lebanon. The situation is serious because of the failure of the efforts to elect a president of the Republic. My country warns against any attempt to partition Lebanon or to divide the people there. My country also reaffirms its desire to see peace and independence in Lebanon  a fraternal country. Yet my delegation believes that all this will be possible only if the Lebanese leaders  political and religious  understand that social and political equality will remain meaningless as long as they fail to reach a national consensus transcending psychological  religious and regional obstacles. From this rostrum we express our hope that our Lebanese brothers will succeed in overcoming their present difficulties  which only serve the interests of the enemy and frustrate their friends. We wish them every success in their endeavour.I should also like to reaffirm my country's position of principle in favour of the prompt implementation of the Security Council resolutions calling for the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces of Israel from Lebanese territory.My country has expressed its deep satisfaction over the fact that Iran has accepted Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  a resolution which Iraq accepted as soon as it was adopted. We are pleased that both parties have agreed to the cease-fire and have accepted direct negotiations under the auspices of the Secretary-General but we know that these negotiations will indeed be arduous and that success will depend largely Ñ the patience shown by both parties. Patience is needed if we are to achieve a just honourable and lasting peace  one that recognizes the legitimate rights of both parties and removes the nightmare and spectre oÂ£ war for future generations a settlement that will re-establish good-neighbourly relations  fruitful exchanges  and peace and security for the region of the Gulf. Moreover  that would bring prosperity to the region and would put an end to the suffering and hardship caused by war.We wish to thank all those who have contributed  directly or indirectly  to the efforts that have led to the acceptance by Iran of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). That has led to a cease-fire and direct negotiations between the two countries. We hope that the Security Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations will be able to continue their efforts to bring the views of the two parties closer together in the current talks between them. We hope also that a genuine  just and lasting peace will be established and that the two countries will devote their efforts to national reconstruction and will restore everything that the war has destroyed. We hope that the developed countries will be able to provide both countries with whatever assistance may be needed for their task of reconstruction On the problem of Afghanistan my country has followed with interest the results achieved through the Geneva Agreements conducted under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General. We would be very happy to see these Agreements implemented so that the Afghan people might be allowed to enjoy stability and so that the Afghan refugees may be allowed to return home. We trust that all the Afghan parties will be able to reach agreement on national unity and on the choice of a government  an agreement that will satisfy the desires of the Afghan people  who wish to preserve their independence  neutrality and non-alignment.Furthermore  my country welcomes the efforts that have been made by the Maghreb countries  and foremost among them the fraternal countries of Morocco and Algeria  to reach a just and lasting solution to the problem oÐ Western Sahara under the auspices of the United Nations. That problem has always been a serious obstacle to the building of the greater Maghreb  and a resolution of the problem should lead to closer co-operation among the countries of the area  and to the greater Arab unity of which every Arab dreams.My country is following with interest the Secretary-General's efforts to reconcile the differences between the two Cypriot communities. We wish for the fulfilment of the aspirations of the two communities  with respect for the rights of the Cypriot people to independence and to freedom of religion  which will guarantee their unity and independence.I must also refer to the relaxation of tension in certain regional conflicts. I am referring to the conflict between Somalia and Ethiopia. Both countries have declared their desire to settle their problems through fruitful dialogue and in accordance with the rules of international law. We hope that the dialogue between these two neighbouring countries  with which my country has historic economic and cultural ties  will be successful. That is important if peace and security in Africa and in the Red Sea area are to be maintained.As regards South Africa  my country has often expressed its strong condemnation of the acts of aggression of that regime and the terrorism and repression practised by it against the South African people and the Namibian people  not to mention the repeated acts of aggression against the front-line States. My country welcomes the negotiations which have begun between the parties to the conflict and we hope that the visit by the United Nations Secretary-General to South Africa  which is part of the efforts made this year in the interests of peace in many areas of the world  will make it possible for the Namibian people to enjoy freedom and will lead to the end of the policies of apartheid pursued by thePretoria regime. We are anxiously awaiting the practical steps that are to be taken to put into effect Security Council resolution 435 (1978) pertaining to the problem of Namibia and its independence and we believe that the forthcoming independence of Namibia is a victory for its fighting people and for all those who condemn colonialism and racism. It is also a victory for all peace-loving and justice-loving people in that part of the world and it is a further success to the credit of this Organization.Yemen believes nothing can replace dialogue and negotiation in the resolution of regional and international conflicts. Thus we have been following with keen interest regional and international efforts to resolve the problem of Kampuchea.My country has also been paying close attention to the contacts begun recently between the two Koreas and the agreement on a formula for the resolution of the Korean problem  which we hope will lead to the reunification of Korea with full respect for peace and democracy.My country is deeply concerned by the political problems of the world  to which we have referred at length. We feel equal concern about its economic problems  which remain as urgent and important as ever.Our highly developed world continues to be based on an unfair economic order. As has been emphasized  there is great need for change in this regard  and a new international economic order must be found  one based on equal opportunities and the interests of all parties concerned. That order roust be capable of resolving the pc obi eras of the third world and reducing the gap between the industrialized rich countries and the impoverished areas of the world  which continues to grow day by day. My country believes that the current crisis and the stifling situation of the third world  which is characterized by imbalances  inequality and recurring acute conditions  poses a threat to the entire world economy. The implementation by third-world countries of measures to rationalize their imports - given the debt and reduced revenues that have resulted from the collapse of prices for their primary commodities and the protectionism their products encounter - could lead to an even more severe paralysis of the world economy and further widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots. Here I should like to welcome the decision of some developed countries to cancel the debts or the debt servicing of many developing countries. We hope further such measures will reduce the debt burden of the developing countries. We also hope that the world will be able to emerge from this crisis  this impasse  and establish a new international economic order allowing for the transfer of technology under the beat possible conditions with full regard to the sovereignty of the developing countries over their natural resourcesTo that end  we must strengthen the role of the United Nations in the area of international economic co-operation  which would encourage us to make further efforts to establish a new international economic order that recognizes the equality of all States in all areas.Economic and social development is the paramount concern of our country and in this regard we have made remarkable progress in spite of our meagre resources. A few days ago we celebrated the twenty-sixth anniversary of our Great Revolution  and on that occasion we launched a number of vital projects. Prior to that we had held free  direct elections to the Council of State  in keeping with the Constitution of my country and with full respect for law  democracy and the equality of all Yemeni citizens.I might also refer to the Agreement of 17 May 1988 which paved the way for the eventual reunification of the two parts of Yemen through democratic  peaceful means. This Agreement establishes freedom of movement between the two parts of Yemen for citizens solely on the basis of possession of an identity card  without any restriction or administrative procedures. Our people reaffirmed their confidence in their leader.Colonel Abdallah Salah  who had just been re-elected to a new five-year term of office as a result of the successes he has brought about for our countryâs prosperity  development  peace and stability. This was achieved by 10 years of dedication and self-denial for the glory of Yemen and the enshrinement of democratic principles in an egalitarian and just republican regime.I hope that this session will be crowned with success  and that future sessions will witness a further reduction of tensions in a world free of conflicts  injustices  exploitation  suffering and hunger  where justice  co-operation and human solidarity will reign."
"151",7551,"YUG",43,1988,"ï»¿First of all I should like to congratulate you  Sir  a good friend of ours and an outstanding diplomat and politician of Argentina  on your election as President of the forty-third session of the General AssemblyMy appreciation goes also to Mr. Peter Florin  the Deputy Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic  for his successful guidance of the forty-second session.The deep changes on the world scene in the past year provide in themselves a different  much better atmosphere for the work of this session of the General Assembly. Yet they impose on it an additional obligation as well: to assess the real scope of these changes and outline the further mission - the peace mission - of the Organization. The Nobel Peace Prize that has just been awarded to the United Nations peace-keeping operations represents a significant recognition of the achievements of the Organization.The Secretary-General's report was couched in guarded optimism. That is understandable and realistic in the present-day world. I wish to express to Mr. Perez de Cuellar my gratitude for and recognition of the successes that the world Organization has achieved in the past year.The fact is that the forty-third session is beginning its work in auspicious circumstances. The process of negotiations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America continues. It has a positive impact on almost all aspects of international relations. Improvement in their relations could bring about progress in the quest for solutions to almost all the crises in the world  since there is evident interdependence between the accommodation of the super-Powers and overall developments in international relations.For the first time it may appear that the dangerous spiral of the arms race has ceased.These processes are a consequence not only of direct relations between the super-Powers  but also of the awareness of the international community that dialogue is inevitable. What is the role and contribution of the policy of non-alignment and of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in fostering such awareness? Since its inception the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has striven to overcome bloc divisions and all other divisions in the world. For almost 30 years it has called upon the great Powers to stop confrontation  proceed to negotiations and establish co-operation. I think that we can say that the ongoing positive processes affirm the principles of the policy of non-alignment. The Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Countries  held at the beginning of this month in Nicosia  demonstrated the Movement's determination to continue to exert an active influence on the development of international relations. What of importance in the perception of the present-day world  in Yugoslavia's view  came out of Nicosia?First  in welcoming the rapprochement between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  the non-aligned countries continue at the same time to draw attention to the serious problems standing in the way of this process  and will  for these reasons  and in a desire further to promote and deepen the climate of detente  do their best to ensure that the present atmosphere may be maintained. The efforts that ate being made  and the results achieved  should be translated into a lasting and comprehensive process benefiting all countries and peoples. Secondly  super-Power bilateralism is a reality of our time. However  it does not  of itself  ensure the settlement of world problems. Co-operation between the super-Powers is an absolute prerequisite; yet genuine and lasting solutions can be achieved only with the participation of all interested parties.The non-aligned countries are prepared to contribute actively and constructively to the efforts aimed at resolving regional and global problems. That was stated very eloquently the day before yesterday by our Chairman  the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe; Mr. Robert Mugabe. The successful initiatives taken recently by the United Nations have confirmed its irreplaceable role. The past year has testified to the fact that progress in dealing with world crises is achievable through direct  or at least indirect  United Nations involvement. It is of course a two-way process. The easing of tension makes the great Powers more willing to rely on United Nations mechanisms. This leaves room for the world Organization to take freer and more creative action and for its Member States to put forward initiatives. We should like to believe that the time is behind us when it was necessary to fight attempts to marginalize the United Nations  and that the task ahead is to focus our efforts on its even greater and more decisive participation in the solution of world problems.Although they constitute the majority in the United Nations  the non-aligned countries have neither an interest in advocating majority rule  nor the need to do so. They realize that this is not a viable way to resolve problems.The process of the adjustment of the United Nations to present needs and the rationalization of its activities should be accelerated. At this point  solving the current financial problems of the United Nations and financing its future important undertakings for peace is the matter of the greatest urgency.The world Organization is facing a number of challenges; to continue and speed up the resolution of existing hotbeds of crisis and  perhaps even more important  to initiate steps in that direction in the areas where they are still lacking.It is also necessary to follow up and strengthen the process of disarmament as well as to start to deal with international economic problems.After eight years of bloodshed the peoples of Iran and Iraq can look to the future with more confidence. Negotiations have replaced war. We hope that a just solution to the conflict will be reached through the consistent and integral implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). That is in the interest of those two countries  as well as of peace and security in the region and beyond.After so many years of illegal occupation by South Africa  Namibia is today closer to becoming an independent and sovereign State  as envisaged by the United Nations plan.We welcome the process of negotiations between Angola  Cuba and South Africa. Ending the conflict in southern Africa and Namibia's accession to independence will greatly contribute to security and co-operation in that region. We believe that the end of the abhorrent system of apartheid - against which resolute international action  including comprehensive sanctions  continues to be required - will then not be far off. Compliance with the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan  and their integral implementation  are of the utmost importance if peace  independence  non-aligned status and free development ate to be assured to that country and its people. The constructive engagement of the various elements in the region raises the hope that the people of Kampuchea  one of the founding members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  will at long last enjoy their right to peace  independence and sovereignty of decision on their own destiny.We also believe that continuance of the mission of good offices of the Secretary-General and the resumption of the talks between the two Cypriot communities will bring about progress in resolving the problem of Cyprus.Similarly  we hope that  through the involvement of our Organization and the countries of the region  the problem of Western Sahara will be solved in the near future in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).However  the improved atmosphere in the world has as yet had no effect on some of the existing crises. Implementation of the peace plan of the five Central American countries has encountered serious difficulties and obstacles. We must continue to support the efforts to bring about a just solution of the situation in Central America  as well as Nicaragua's right to safeguard its sovereignty and integrity.It is high time for the international community to make it possible for the Palestinian people to enjoy their right to self-determination and statehood. Together with a large number of other countries  Yugoslavia supports the early convening of an international conference  under United Nations auspices and with the participation of all parties directly concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (Ð LO)  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. This is the realistic way to bring about a comprehensive solution to the Middle East crisis and to ensure that all countries of the region may live in peace and security on their own territory. The broadest section of the international community demands that a new momentum be added to the process of disarmament that has begun. This was particularly highlighted at the third special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to disarmament  at which  with stronger political will and greater efforts  we could have achieved more. We hope  however  that the numerous proposals put forward at that session  including those presented by Yugoslavia  will be taken into account at the current session. Peace and security cannot be anybody's monopoly  much less an exclusive right. The destiny of mankind is the concern and responsibility of all of us alike.If our aim is the complete elimination of nuclear arms  the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test ban is one of the most urgent tasks. Nuclear disarmament is  of course  of priority importance. Yet other weapons should not be overlooked. We consider that work on chemical-weapons convention should be completed with the utmost urgency.The continuous sophistication  stockpiling and use of conventional weapons explain tellingly why we demand the launching also of conventional arms negotiations at the bilateral  regional and multilateral levels.I believe that the time is ripe for broad-based and well considered action by all countries to promote improved international economic relations and co-operation. The international community must not miss the historic opportunity offered by the trend of relaxation and negotiation. Top priority should be accorded to the interrelated problems of debt  trade  finance  technology and development. It is important to note that the debt problem of the developing countries is increasingly perceived as a most serious global problem. There is agreement in principle that solutions should be sought through an agreed  development-oriented strategy. Effective reduction of the level of indebtedness of the developing countries would remove one of the major obstacles not only to their development but also to expansion of the world economy as a whole. We assess positively the decisions of the Toronto summit concerning the debt of the least developed countries. We hope that those decisions will prompt further action encompassing broader aspects of debt problems. The vicious circle in which the developing countries are locked with regard to international trade has to be broken. The demand that debts should be duly repaid cannot be met if restrictions are imposed on exports  which provide the sole source of funds for debt servicing. We remain committed to the open multilateral trading system  but we are increasingly convinced of the urgent need to eliminate the dangerous anomalies that have accumulated with respect to it. A prerequisite for the successful continuance and completion of the ongoing Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations is the cessation and rollback of protectionism and consideration of new areas  such as services and trade-related investment measures and other measures in the context of development requirements.The increasing attention being devoted to environmental problems is entirely legitimate. There can be no progress without industrial and technological development  but it can be ensured only if the necessary timely protective measures are taken. The very survival of the human race on a planet worthy of human beings is in question. The continuing active involvement of the international community in the promotion and protection of human rights is a prerequisite for any real democratization of international relations and for safeguarding world peace  These noble goals are no less threatened by the phenomenon of terrorism.Whatever is undertaken in the world Organization should serve man in building peacefully  and in freedom  the present and a better future. To that end the Nicosia declaration states that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries should pursue a policy of respect for  and promotion the attainment of  the rights of individuals and peoples.In addition to the work of this Organization  multilateralism is being promoted through a number of in our opinion very useful forms of regional co-operation. Through such co-operation the participating countries authentically and directly express their preoccupations and aspirations. The very first meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Balkan countries was held in Belgrade last February. It strengthened our belief that the Balkan countries will make a significant contribution to the processes of improving international relations. At the Vienna follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  Yugoslavia  along with other non-aligned and neutral countries of Europe  has been endeavouring to bring about a successful outcome of that meeting.The historical and political experience of this generation shows that neither the noble and enduring principles upon which this Organization is built nor the legitimate aspirations of the international community can be realized without the wide-ranging democratization of international relations.Unlike the times when freedom  independence and peace were high ideals but an almost unattainable goal  genuine conditions are gradually being created now for the establishment of a new international order that previous generations  particularly those who lived through the horrors of the two world wars  could only have dreamed of.The increasing interdependence is an objective basis for the reintegration of the world  which is transforming itself from bipolar into multipolar so that it may one day become genuinely pluralistic. A single and secure world is conceivable only with the full participation of all. For that reason we are rededicating ourselves with even greater enthusiasm to the fulfilment of the tasks facing the United Nations  tasks which are paving the way for a better and more just world order  in which all the participants will be able fully to pursue their national as well as the common interests.The dangerous injection of ideology into international relations and the imposition of âeternal truths"" seem to be gradually fading away. This facilitates the endeavours to lay  step by step  the foundations of a more secure and stable future. Such a world could not be based on the balance and domination of power and on the exclusion of the Â¡majority of countries from the process of economic and technological development. In our opinion  it should be based on the full affirmation and implementation of some principles and processes which are being strengthened at the present time. They are: independence within increasing interdependence; multipolarity instead of bipolarity of the world; pluralism of socio-political systems  their co-existence and co-operation based on a footing of equality; human rights as universal values; peaceful settlement of all conflicts and disputes; universal participation in economic-technological development in the interest of mankind.All this means in actual fact the democratization of international relations  that is  the participation of all countries in dealing with and in resolving international issues.The necessary and  in our view  inevitable process of the world's future integration can be based on those foundations. This implies the gradual elimination of all the barriers that still divide the world today. Only in a world integrated in that way can a solid two-track relationship exist between the development of the world as a whole and the development of its component parts and individuals - countries and people.With full respect for the principles of freedom  independence and equality  we should aspire towards a world in which not a single pact will be left out of the prosperous development. We still need the belief out of which our Organization was born  so that  through the joint efforts of all  our visions may become a reality. Viewed from today's perspective  this may appear to be an ideal the realization of which seems uncertain and  in any case  to belong to the distant future. Nevertheless  we believe that we must strive for that future. "
"152",7615,"ZMB",43,1988,"ï»¿Allow me to start by congratulating Mr  Dante Caputo of Argentina on his election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. This attests to his proved diplomatic skills and tact as a statesman and to the important role that his country  Argentina  continues to play in promoting international understanding  peace and co-operation. With his wisdom and experience  I have no doubt that he will guide our deliberations with distinction.Last year we elected Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic to preside over the meetings of the Assembly. We discharged his onerous duties with outstanding competence and dedication. I should like  therefore  to take this opportunity to thank him for his contribution to the work of our Organization.I wish also to express Zambia's appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier PÃ©rez de Cuellar  for the leadership he has provided to the United Nations and for his patience and tenacity in bringing peace to areas of tension.Until recently  the United Nations  and indeed the entire multilateral system  have been subjected to severe strains and challenges because of the continuing threat of nuclear war  regional conflicts and the most difficult economic crisis facing the developing countries.However   as we move closer to the beginning of the 1990s  hope and promise are beginning to emerge in the sphere of international political relations. The most important indication of changed perspectives and policies is the improvement in the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States signified by the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - in a concrete and significant step towards disarmament.The hope that we all now share is that the United States and the Soviet Union will build on this foundation and cut back on the remaining nuclear stockpiles  on chemical and biological arsenals and on conventional arms  with a view to their eventual elimination in pursuance of general and complete disarmament under effective international control.The convening of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament here in New York earlier this year represented yet another multilateral effort to advance the cause of disarmament. The failure of that session was a source of great disappointment to many of us because it was a blow against multilateralism as well. We had hoped that progress at that conference would give further encouragement to the Soviet Union and the United States to undertake further disarmament efforts. We should  however  not relent in our efforts to bring about general and complete disarmament under effective international control. It is our considered view  therefore  that another attempt should be made in the not-too-distant future to hold a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament to address the urgent issues facing mankind today.Another area where there has been co-operation between the Soviet Union and the United States is the Treaty negotiated by the United Nations aimed at ending the conflict in Afghanistan. It is a matter of regret  however  that although the Treaty was intended to bring peace to that long-suffering country  the reality is that the provisions of that Agreement are not being fully observed. Zambia urges all those involved to give teal and practical meaning to the Treaty so that peace may quickly return to Afghanistan. Zambia also wishes to compliment the Soviet Union for observing its side of the Agreement.	.For a long time  we have been greatly distressed by the war between Iran and Iraq. The heavy loss of life and property  the danger that the war might spread beyond the borders of the two combatants and the presence of foreign fleets in the Gulf have all underlined the gravity of the situation. We are delighted that both Iran and Iraq have now accepted Security Council resolution 598 (1987) which provides for ending the war. Zambia commends both countries for their courage and statesmanship in adopting diplomacy as a substitute for war. It is a historical fact that conflicts end at the negotiating table. For this reason we are encouraged by the recent report that the two parties met in direct talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General at United Nations Headquarters. We urge them to move rapidly towards the implementation of the remainder of resolution 598 (1987).In urging Iran and Iraq to move towards the cease-fire  the United Nations has played a singular role demonstrating since again that the world body and its Charter remain important instruments of peace.The United Nations has also been active in Western Sahara. The fact that the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic and Morocco have accepted in principle the Secretary-General's proposal that a referendum be held to determine the future of the territory is an important step towards resolving this problem. However  a number of important issues remain to be resolved. Only when these are resolved can there be a free and fair referendum in the territory. Furthermore  in carrying out this process  it is important to ensure that the credibility and image of the United Nations remain untarnished.The Middle East remains an area of tension. The central issue has always been whether the Palestinian people will be free  like any other people  to attain and exercise their inalienable rights  their self-determination and their right to national independence. But there are  in addition  the questions of occupied Arab lands and the status of Jerusalem  in our view  these issues require to be addressed if peace and security for all are to return to the Middle East.Recently the Palestinian people stepped up their resistance to Israeli rule and occupation. Instead of resolving the underlying problems  Israel has responded with an iron hand  resulting in great loss of Palestinian life. It is our belief that a just and comprehensive peace in the region can only come out of an international conference on peace in the Middle East in conformity with paragraph 6 of the Geneva Declaration  General Assembly resolutions 38/58 C of 1983  42/66 D of 1987  and other relevant resolutions.The Palestinian people and the people of Israel both desire peace and security. That is why it is important that both peoples be represented at the proposed conference by their genuine leaders. The Palestine Liberation Organization (Ð LO) represents the Palestinian people and must therefore attend as a full member. The security of Israel lies in negotiating peace with the genuine leaders of the Palestinian people.Last month I joined my colleagues of the non-aligned countries at out conference on the island of Cyprus. We saw for ourselves the reality of the division of the island into two separate communities. My delegation to that conference was heartened by the Secretary-General's efforts which culminated in the Geneva meeting last August between the President of Cyprus  Mr. George Vassiliou  and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot Community  Mr. Rauf Denktash.Zambia hopes that the negotiations under way will result in the reconciliation of the two sides  the withdrawal of foreign troops and settlers  and the voluntary return of refugees to their homes. May I be permitted to make a few remarks about Kampuchea and the Korean peninsula? Zambia welcomes the recent statement by Viet Nam about the withdrawal of its troops from Kampuchea. We also support the results of the Jakarta informal meeting by the various factions of Kampuchea  We believe that the road to peace lies in the withdrawal of foreign troops from that country and in a political settlement by the various factions.Tension continues in the Korean peninsula. The issue is the peaceful reunification of that land through dialogue and consultation between the North and South. Zambia welcomes the recent moves aimed at reducing tension and increasing trade between the two sides. These must be seen as initial steps towards the political reunification of Korea.Central America is another troubled region that requires serious attention. Peace will never return to that region until foreign interference and destabilization cease.-. Nicaragua  in particular  is one country that has been and continues to be a victim of externally sponsored acts of destabilisation.Zambia welcomes' and supports the Peace Agreement signed by the five Presidents of the area in Guatemala in August last year and calls upon the rest of the international community to endorse those efforts whose aim is to bring peace to Central America. At the same time  we urge the Governments of the region to continue their efforts by complying with the terms and conditions provided for in the Agreement. We also appeal to the United States to cease its support to the contras and efforts to undermine the economy of Nicaragua. This will enable the process of dialogue between the Government of Nicaragua and the contras to move forward and make progress. The situation in southern Africa continues to be grave. The South African apartheid regime  though still entrenched  is shaken by the general opposition to apartheid by the international community and by the courage and determination of the black population in the fight against the evil system.State terrorism against the black population remains the cornerstone of apartheid  with the South African army playing the leading role in the campaign of repression and violence. The number of organizations and individuals banned keeps growing as the opposition to apartheid increases.Evidence available indicates that the economic and financial sanctions already in place are working. South African leaders have themselves admitted this  thereby disproving those who have said that sanctions do not work. There is  however  evidence to show that a small number of countries in the Far East  Europe and Latin America  is taking advantage of the situated created by the sanctions. We appeal to them to cease aiding South Africa and to join the rest of the international community in opposing apartheid. In this respect we commend those countries which are faithfully observing the existing sections against South Africa. We appeal to the rest of the international community to apply more sanctions and to tighten the existing ones. In this regard we commend those countries and institutions which have taken and are taking measures to further isolate South Africa economically.There is also evidence to show that arms in various forms are still flowing to racist South Africa in contravention of the arms embargo against that country. South Africa must be denied the means to wage war against its own people and its neighbours. We appeal to the Western countries involved to strictly observe the mandatory United Nations arms embargo against South Africa enshrined in United Nations Security Council resolution 418 (1977) and in subsequent resolutions. We appeal to the United Nations Security Council finally to give real meaning to its resolution 421 (1977) and make the Committee established under that resolution more effective. As a further means of isolating the apartheid regime  we also strongly urge the strict observance and enforcement by the international community of the United Nations oil embargo against South Africa. The time has come for the United Nations Security Council to institute a mandatory oil embargo against South Africa. Moreover  in order to intensify dissemination of information against apartheid  the United Nations should expand its anti-apartheid programmes to combat racist South Africa's censorship measures and disinformation campaign.The additional pressure on South Africa we are calling for is intended to persuade the regime to hold talks with the genuine leaders of the black population so that together they can chart a new future for their country and their people. It is our firm belief that the best way of moving forward is for the genuine leaders of the oppressed majority and their white counterparts to be present at the negotiations. That is why we have called for the release from prison of Nelson Mandela and his colleagues and the unbanning of the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azanla (PAC).Ten years after the adoption of United Nations Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  the situation in Namibia remains unchanged. South Africa continues its illegal and armed occupation of that territory despite the efforts of the international community to end such occupation and the gallant efforts of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAFO)  the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people. We continue to reject ""linkage"" as irrelevant to the issue of Namibia's independence.As in South Africa  the apartheid regime employs terrorism as the cornerstone of its policy in Namibia. The regime also uses the territory of Namibia for the purpose of carrying out aggression against the neighbouring independent African States  especially Angola and Mozambique. We call on the international community to Intensify its pressure on the Pretoria regime until Namibia is free. We also call on those concerned to cease exploitation of the natural resources of Namibia.South Africa's aggression against the neighbouring independent States continues unabated. Angola and Mozambique have suffered the most from this aggression  which has been perpetrated in collaboration with local bandit groups. The rest of our countries in the region have also suffered direct aggression by South Africa.The economic cost of apartheid to us has been extremely heavy. An estimate of physical damage in Angola between 1975 and 1985 totals $US 17 billion. Mozambique has estimated its losses between 1980 and 1985 at 3US 5.5 billion. If damage in the rest of the region were added  the total estimated cost would be between $US 25 billion and $US 30 billion. Against this background the front-line States and other neighbouring independent African States need urgent assistance  including military assistance  to enable them to withstand the effects of South Africa's destabilization and aggression.Last August  in Oslo  we tried to address the humanitarian dimension of destabilization. At the International Conference on the Plight of Refugees  Returnees and Displaced Persons convened by the Organization of African Unity and supported by the United Nations we discussed how the international community can best assist the more than 1.3 million refugees  5 million displaced persons and the countries of refuge. The immediate requirements are basic: food  medicines  water  sanitation  shelter and clothing. Parallel with the provision of these necessities  is the need to resettle all these people and to rehabilitate the economic and social infrastructure  mainly in Mozambique and Angola. One aspect of destabilization that continues to concern us is the ongoing supply of arms to the UNITA bandits. We appeal to the United States to end this support so that the Angolan people themselves can commence the process of restoring peace to their country. Let me refer briefly to the ongoing negotiations involving Angola  Cuba  South Africa and the United States. While we welcome these developments  we remain cautious about South Africa's credibility in negotiations involving self-determination and the peaceful settlement of disputes. South Africa's record is replete with failed commitments to international agreements. The Nkomati and the Lusaka Agreements come readily to mind. With regard to the recent diplomatic offensive by South Africa  it is our conviction that this is merely a ploy designed to buy time for apartheid and to enhance South Africa's tarnished image in order to pre-empt further sanctions.At the outset I referred to the crisis facing the third world economy. Let me now turn to that issue and speak specifically about the economic crisis facing Africa.This session of the General Assembly is taking place against the background of a continuing economic crisis in Africa despite the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. This crisis has revealed itself in poor economic performance and falling standards of living among the people of Africa. The political and social consequences of the crisis are alarming.A combination of domestic  external and natural factors accounts for this situation. The domestic factors are essentially structural and include the following: low saving ratios  narrow export base  shortage of key skills and rapid growth of population. Under the ongoing reform programmes in many African countries  these problems are being addressed  often at a very high social and political cost. However  it is in the external sector that Africa's problems are greatest. The fundamental issue is the unequal economic relations between the rich North and the poor South and the persistent refusal by the former to establish a new international economic order based on the principles of equity and mutual interest. The fact that the South has no role whatsoever in fixing the prices of its exports and imports is the central problem.The inevitable outcome of these relations is that invariably the prices of our conditions are almost permanently depressed while those of industrial goods are always on the rise. No wonder our terms of trade are always against us. This  in turn  affects our capacity to import the raw materials and spare parts we need. Nor has this trade imbalance been made up by sufficient capital flows to Africa. During the early 1980s  deficits in our current account were financed by net capital flows. These flows have since declined and what we now have is net outflow of resources mainly to the multilateral financial institutions.The debt problem has contributed very significantly to the economic difficulties of Africa. The debt burden  as measured by such indicators as the ratio of debt-service payments to export receipts  has readied alarming proportions. In an increasing number of African countries  such ratios are well in excess of 100 per cent. In such countries  the resolution of the debt problem is a necessary condition for the resumption of growth. That is why Zambia expresses its thanks and appreciation .to those countries that have agreed to forgive part or the whole of the outstanding debt by African countries.A number of other proposals have been made on ways and means of assisting Africa to overcome its economic difficulties and especially the debt problem. While these proposals are welcome  it is necessary to observe that they have often been made without any input from Africa itself. As a result  many proposals have not taken into account the political and social conditions prevailing in our respective countries. These conditions affect our capacity to implement the proposed solutions.It is against this background that Africa has proposed a meeting with the creditors on the issue of the external debt so that measures to resolve the problem take into full account the realities of the situation.Another external factor that has affected some of our economies is political and economic destabilization such as that carried out by South Africa against the neighbouring independent African States. As I have shown  the cost of destabilization is very high indeed.In addition to these domestic and external factors  Africa has suffered from natural catastrophes. The most important of these ace floods  drought  desertification  and more recently  locusts. All these impact our economies negatively. In these circumstances  Africa's plea has been that its reform programme be supported by greater inflows of real resources  from Africa's own exports  from increased bilateral and multilateral assistance and from debt relief. In this way  the international community will be responding adequately to Africa's current economic crisis.Finally  with the lowering of tension between the East and the West  the world has an opportunity to create a safer and better future for all through genuine disarmament and co-operation in resolving all other global  regional and indeed the economic crises facing the third world. As has been demonstrated in recent years  the multilateralism that the United Nations represents remains the key to world peace and progress. Therefore  it is my country's fervent hope that all Member States will renew their commitment and continue to render full and unconditional political and financial support to our Organization for the common benefit of mankind as a whole. "
"153",7649,"ZWE",43,1988,"ï»¿First  I should like to congratulate you  Mr. Dante Caputo  upon your election to the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly  Your elevation to that high office is a reflection not only of your proved diplomatic skills  but also of the esteem in which your country  an important member of the Non-Aligned Movement  is held internationally. We are confident that under your able guidance our endeavours will meet with success. Mr. Peter Florin had a remarkably busy watch. Apart from the forty-second regular session  he was called upon to preside over several resumed and special sessions of the Assembly. He more than justified the confidence that the international community had reposed in him. We are grateful to him.The Secretary-General is  of course  the very personification of the internationalist ethic itself. Throughout these turbulent and anxious years that have marked his second term  only Mr. Perez de Cuellar's steady and resolute determination has restored the Organization to its present high esteem  even among some of its detractors. Although the fortunes of the United Nations have not quite turned around  we have nevertheless passed the point where the Secretary-General feared he would preside over the dissolution of the United Nations. Instead  he now presides over peace talks  from the Gulf war to Afghanistan  Cyprus and Western Sahara  ail under the auspices of  or in terms defined by  the United Nations. It is a remarkable achievement  a culmination of that patient and careful diplomatic choreography that has characterized Mr. Perez de Cuellar's tenure as Secretary-General  We of the non-aligned countries derive great satisfaction from the achievements of one of the outstanding diplomats of PeruÂ· a key member of our Movement.The outbreak of peace in places of seemingly intractable conflict and a resurgence in the fortunes of the United Nations are the central features on the international stage today. In the Gulf war  perhaps the most painful and destructive war since 1945  the guns have fallen silent. The former belligerents now sit together in Geneva  talking peace. The basis of that peace continues to be Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  in whose evolution and balanced formulation the caucus of the non-aligned countries in the Security Council played no small role. This cessation of hostilities not only puts an end to the anguish of the peoples of Iran and Iraq and affords those countries an opportunity for reconstruction and development  but also eliminates a dangerous threat to international peace and security. We therefore urge the two non-aligned countries  also Member States of the United Nations  to co-operate with the Secretary-General in the effort to find a durable solution to the conflict.Pursuant to the Geneva accords on Afghanistan  negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations by the Secretary-General's Special Representative  Mr  Diego Cordovez - then Under-Secretary for Political Affairs and now the Foreign Minister of Ecuador  another key non-aligned country in Latin America - thousands of foreign troops have already left Afghanistan  That not only paves the way for the Afghan people to decide their future free from outside interference but  again  removes a threat to international peace and security. We urge all parties to respect the letter and spirit of those accords to ensure that nothing is done which can cause them to unravel. In southern Africa also  we have seen the tripartite agreement which involves Angola  Cuba and the Pretoria regime and which provides for the withdrawal of South African troops from Angola and possible implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia. We welcome the declaration of a cease-fire and the end of South Africa's illegal occupation of the sovereign territory of Angola. It is our earnest hope that South Africa will live up to the letter and spirit of the tripartite agreement and will proceed to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978).Elsewhere in Africa  thanks to the United Nations a breakthrough also appears imminent in the 13-year war over Western Sahara. In particular  we note the proposal by the Secretary-General last month whereby a cease-fire would be declared  followed by a referendum of the citizens of Western Sahara  including those living in refugee camps. It is also satisfying to note that Morocco and POLISARIO  the two parties to the conflict  are soon to engage in direct talks as called for by the Organization of African Unity. We hope it will now be possible to resolve  once and for all  the central question of self-determination for the Sahrawi people.On Kampuchea too there are signs of movement. Viet Nam has promised to pull out its troops from Kampuchea and the parties involved have held the Jakarta informal meeting and are in constant contact on the nature of the post-settlement order in South-East Asia. We in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries shall continue to prod the parties concerned to quicken their search for an honourable solution to the problem.On the vexed question of divided Cyprus  we have recently witnessed some promising stirrings  thanks to the efforts of the Secretary-General. We hope that here too progress can be made. The recent relaxation in tension on the international scene has not altered the essence of the problems we face in our region of Africa. The Non-Aligned Movement has always maintained that apartheid is the root cause of conflict and that peace and security cannot be obtained in southern Africa until that system is eradicated. The destabilization of the economies of the front-line States continues unabated. Millions of displaced persons  innocent men  women and children  tragic refugees of the evil system of apartheid  are constantly on the run in search of food and security. Only a month ago I had the privilege of attending in Oslo  Norway  the International Conference on the Plight of Refugees  Returnees and Displaced Persons in Southern Africa. That was the first conference of its kind devoted entirely to the problem of refugees in southern Africa. The Conference established that the number of persons uprooted from their homes by the apartheid regime's acts of destabilization had reached the tragic figure of 5.4 million. Thousands of old men and women  the sick and little children  the weakest in our societies  who cannot make it to safety  perish as victims of the harsh elements or the bayonets of Pretoria's financed bandits. In South Africa itself  the majority population continue to be victimized by the apartheid police for no crime other than the colour of their skin. Thousands are incarcerated in apartheid gaols. The world must take note and do something. Apartheid cannot be wooed into oblivion; it can only be forcibly taken out by the roots. The only means of doing that  short of war  is the imposition by the entire international community of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter. The arguments of those who oppose sanctions sound increasingly hollow and self-serving. Sanctions may cost some blacks and some whites jobs  but there is no doubt that they do weaken apartheid. The non-application of sanctions leaves apartheid intact. Apartheid kills. Sanctions can have a powerful psychological effect on the white minority in South Africa. For no man is an island  nor is a nation for that matter  not even a nation of unreconstructed racists.The Middle East is another long-running sore where movement towards peace has been elusive. As Israel has continued to occupy captured Arab and Palestinian lands  the citizens of those occupied territories have met Israeli armour with their bare hands  sustaining many casualties. The uprising of the past nine months in the occupied territories is not a simple matter of bravery. No one wants to die. It is a matter of desperation. The Palestinian people  like all human beings  want to exercise their right to self-determination. Israel must withdraw from the occupied territories and let go of the Palestinian nation. It is our view that only the holding of the international peace conference  under the auspices of the United Nations  to address all aspects of the Middle East problem can bring peace and security for all in the region.In Central America  the Arias plan has provided a concrete and viable framework for peace. Negotiations continue  even if intermittently  in countries with an insurgency problem. We note in particular that the Government of Nicaragua has continued to extend its hand to the opposition  asking them to continue negotiations. The cease-fire that was called for by the plan has repeatedly been extended and is still holding. It would be irresponsible to call for  or cause  the abandonment of that cease-fire. Countries should not resort to the politics of intimidation or diplomacy of violence in the region. It is essential  for the sake of the people and Governments of Central America and also for international peace and security  that the Arias plan be given a chance to succeed.Foreign troops remain on the Korean peninsula  prolonging the unjustified division of that land and resulting in increased tensions  therefore we demand the removal of all foreign troops and call for talks on reunifying the peninsula.In an age of apocalyptic destructive power  co-operation to reduce the means of war has become a categorical imperative. The international community has set itself clearly defined priorities in disarmament as contained in the Final Document of the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  held in 1978. At the top of the list is the need to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war. Non-aligned States have already stated that the use of nuclear weapons  besides being a violation of the Charter of the United Nations  would also be a crime against humanity. To this end they have urged all nuclear-weapon States  pending the achievement of nuclear disarmament  to sign a binding instrument forswearing the use of nuclear weapons. It would also be desirable  in the interim  for the nuclear-weapon States to make a solemn declaration that they will not be the first to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons. At the same time  the Conference on Disarmament must seek ways of fulfilling its mandate with regard to the item on the prevention of nuclear war with which it has been charged by the General Assembly.Clearly  for as long as the nuclear arms race persists and nuclear arms remain in the arsenals of States  the risk of nuclear war remains with us. For this reason urgent measures must be taken to effect the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and proceed to nuclear disarmament. We welcomed the Treaty on the elimination of medium- and short-range missiles concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States late last year. The conclusion of that Treaty  while of great symbolic importance as representing the first significant step of disarmament in our time  should not obscure the fact that it accounted for a mere 4 per cent of nuclear warheads and that the remaining 96 per cent  constantly being modernized and made more accurate  lethal and usable  is still with us. The occasion should be one not for mere self-congratulation  but for renewed efforts to eliminate the remaining  far greater arsenals of nuclear weapons. To this end  we urge the United States and the Soviet Union to move quickly towards the goal of a 50 per cent reduction in strategic offensive arsenals which they have set themselves.While the bilateral negotiations on disarmament are important  success in that forum should not be used to curb the role of the United Nations in that field. The United Nations  as the sole universal forum  has a central role to play in all issues that affect the generality of mankind. To that extent  we profoundly regret that the momentum generated by bilateral negotiations last year was not translated into concrete achievements during the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. The non-aligned countries have always believed that bilateral and multilateral negotiations on disarmament should mutually reinforce and complement  not hinder or preclude  each other. This is particularly so of such disarmament topics of vital importance to all States as a comprehensive test-ban treaty  the prevention of an arras race in outer space  nuclear disarmament  chemical weapons  conventional weapons and the elaboration of a comprehensive programme of disarmament. My country is particularly perturbed by the continued nuclear collaboration between South Africa on the one hand and certain Western States and Israel on the other. As we have all along warned  Pretoria has now publicly admitted that it has the capability to produce nuclear weapons. We therefore hope that those responsible for transferring the know-how to the apartheid regime will now desist from any further collaboration with it in this and related spheres. The nuclearization of South Africa not only poses a direct danger to our part of the continent  hut also hinders the implementation of the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa  and is a threat to international peace and security as well. The Security Council has a responsibility  under paragraph 63 (c) of the Final Document of the first special session on disarmament  to ensure that the implementation of the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa is not hindered. That body should move at once to institute measures that curb South Africa's continued nuclearization. Furthermore  we believe that South Africa's offer to the three Non-Proliferation Treaty nuclear-weapon States to enter into negotiations on the possibility of its adhering to the Treaty is only a ruse to delay its suspension from the International Atomic Energy Agency. For that reason  we do not see the need for any negotiations and urge the Agency's General Conference to suspend South Africa immediately.While still on the issue of Africa and nuclear weapons  I wish once again in this Hall to protest indignantly at the callousness shown by the industrialized nations in dumping their nuclear and toxic wastes in Africa. Africa already has enough problems of its own without becoming the garbage-bin of the wealthy northern nations. It is not fair that the poorest nations should be the ones to suffer the worst effects of ""progress"" in which they do not share. The Indian Ocean is another region of vital concern to the littoral and hinterland States of the area. Seventeen years after the Assembly's adoption of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean is still mired in fruitless squabbles about procedures and methodology. Meanwhile  great-Power militarization of the Ocean is proceeding apace  and the envisaged Colombo Conference is repeatedly postponed. Since those who have spoken against the Conference used to cite the focal points of tension around the region as the reason why the Conference could not go ahead  the solutions in Afghanistan and the Gulf should now pave the way to Colombia. It is our fervent wish that the Conference should not be postponed again beyond the present target date of 1990.The acute crisis affecting the international economy has not shown any signs of abating during the past year. Growth has continued to be either sluggish  non-existent or even negative in most developing countries. Commodity prices remain well below acceptable levels. External indebtedness continues to exact a heavy toll on the economies of the developing countries. High interest rates have drastically increased the burden of debt service. In addition  resource flows continue to go from the poor of the South to the rich of the North.The reality of interdependence makes those problems the concern of every country. A solution requires the adoption of a comprehensive set of measures that addresses all aspects of the problem and is geared towards the resumption and acceleration of growth in the developing and debtor countries. The official development assistance (ODA) target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product in financial-resource flows from developed to developing countries  which was agreed in. the International Development Strategy  must be reached soon  as must the ODA target of 0.15 per cent of gross national product for the least developed countries  as agreed in the Substantial New Programme In 1986 the General Assembly adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. Great hopes had been attached to that Programme  but up to now we have not yet seen any African economic recovery  despite the enormous sacrifices the countries of the region have made during the past two years.Only a year ago we were reminded by the World Commission on Environment and Development that poverty was one of the major causes of environmental degradation today. People may be forced to cut down the rain forest by economic necessity in the tropics  but the effects will be felt equally in New York  in London and in Tokyo. There was much talk of the greenhouse effect this year. The Commission on the environment told us that a plausible way of reversing that trend may be to raise the standards of living in the third world.Unilateral solutions are impossible. What is needed is global dialogue. We of the Non-Aligned Movement have consistently argued for the multilateral approach. We have called for the resumption of the North-South dialogue. We have called for the convening of an international conference on money and finance with universal participation aimed at meeting the development and financing requirements of the international economy  particularly with regard to the economies of the developing countries. We have also stated that international negotiations on the debt problem  involving creditor and debtor nations  multilateral financial institutions and international private banks  were a necessary step in the search for a lasting resolution of the current debt problem.For our part  we in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries stand ready to contribute in any way possible towards the real launching of dialogue. Earlier this year  the Non-Aligned Committee on Economic Co-operation met at Harare to assess the state of North-South dialogue and to formulate proposals for its revitalization. I commend the important document espousing those proposals for your close study and serious consideration.However  the Non-Aligned Movement forms only part of the family of nations. A comprehensive resolution of the current crisis in the international economy needs the participation of all members. It is our hope that the climate of dialogue that has been made by possible by the new thaw in super-Power relations will spill over into the economic sphere. It was therefore with a sense of hope that we noted the gentle breezes blowing from the Group of Seven summit meeting at Toronto. The proposals from Toronto  though limited  envisaging the cancellation of the official debt of the least developed countries of sub-Saharan Africa  reflected a sensitivity that we hope will become part of the approach of the industrialised countries to the entire question of the developing world-debt crisis.Later this year the mid-term review of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations will be carried out at a high-level meeting to be held at Montreal. That meeting provides a unique opportunity for both the developed and the developing countries to assess the development in the current Uruguay Round and to renew their commitment to the search for lasting solutions to the malaise affecting the present international trading system. In these negotiations it is imperative that approaches that seek to negate the spirit of international co-operation or the mutuality of interests between the developed and the developing countries be avoided at all costs. Attempts to derogate or deviate from long-standing principles and the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for self-interest should be resisted.Great strides have already been made in recent years in the conceptual appreciation of the threat those economic problems pose for international peace and security. The time has come to move these concepts to the realm of policy. We of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries stand ready to participate constructively in that process. We trust that others are ready to join with us.I wish to return to the subject of the United Nations and the concept of multilateralism. The 1980s will go down in the history of this century as the decade of a retreat from multilateralism. Many of us would like to believe that this phenomenon of the 1980s has not peaked and is on the wane. But  sadly  the reality is less reassuring. The United Nations is still mired in a financial crisis deliberately engineered. The Secretary-General has been reduced to a virtual street beggar passing the hat to keep the Organization from closing its doors. This is most unseemly. Coming at the very time when the United Nations role in defusing threats to international peace and security has been on the rise  it is doubly intolerable I appeal to all Member States to rally behind the Secretary-General by fully honouring the legal obligations they solemnly undertook under the Charter.On that note let me conclude by reaffirming the commitment of the Non-Aligned Movement to the lofty ideals of this body. As you carry out your difficult duties  I wish to assume you of the continued support of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. "
