"1",42,"AFG",67,2012,"﻿As we speak today  the worldis being shaken by the depravity of fanatics whohave committed acts insulting the faith of more than1.5 billion Muslims. We strongly condemn suchoffensive acts  whether they involve the productionof a film  the publication of cartoons or indeed anyother insults and provocations. Such acts can neverbe justified as manifestations of freedom of speechor expression. Equally  they cannot become a reasonfor genuine protests to be used to incite violence andterrible losses of innocent lives.It is a matter for grave concern that our worldremains strewn with daily outbreaks of violence  hatredand injustice. In particular  the menace of Islamophobiais a worrying phenomenon that threatens peace andcoexistence among cultures and civilizations. I call on leaders in the West  both among politicians and in themedia  to confront Islamophobia in all its many formsand manifestations. It is incumbent on us all to advancethe cause of dialogue and cooperation  to fight theforces of division and hatred and to fulfil the promiseof a better and brighter future for future generations.We must work to defeat the forces that foment conflictsamong civilizations  and to support the voices oftolerance and understanding.My country  Afghanistan  is testament to thebenefits of multilateral cooperation and internationalsolidarity. It was a little over a decade ago that manycountries from around the world joined the Afghanpeople in our struggle for peace and against the forcesof extremism and terrorism. At the time  Afghanistanwas a country decimated in every way. For decades wehad suffered  unnoticed  from violence  deprivationand sinister foreign intervention. Long before terrorismbecame a security threat to the whole planet  Afghanswere victims of atrocities inf licted by terroristnetworks from various parts of the world that had madeAfghanistan their haven.Looking back 10 years  Afghanistan has undergonea remarkable transformation. Democracy has takenroot; health services are accessible to the majority ofthe population in every corner of the country; millionsof students  boys and girls  are enrolled in primary andhigher education. Our achievements have not comeabout easily  though. The aspirations of the Afghanpeople for security and peace have yet to be realized. Asthe global fight against terrorism continues unabated the Afghan people continue to pay a bigger price thanany other nation  in both life and treasure.Terrorism is not rooted in Afghan villages andtowns; it never was. Its sources and support networksall exist beyond Afghanistan’s borders. Thus whilethe security of the international community is beingprotected from the threat of terrorism  the people ofAfghanistan must no longer be made to pay the priceand endure the brunt of the war. It is in deference to theimmense sacrifices of the Afghan people  and to theprecious lives lost from the international community that the campaign against terrorism must be taken tothe sources of terrorism and be results-oriented.Today in Afghanistan  we are pursuing the cause ofpeace and an end to violence as a matter of great urgency.Since peace is the greatest desire of the Afghan people and since we are convinced that military efforts aloneare not an adequate strategy for ensuring security  we have initiated a peace and reconciliation process  whichaims to induce all elements of the armed opposition totake up peaceful lives in our country.At this time last year  my visit to the GeneralAssembly was cut short by the tragic assassination ofProfessor Burhanuddin Rabbani  the then Chairmanof the High Peace Council. A terrorist posing as apeace emissary took his life  and by doing so dealt ourpeace process a serious blow. This year  however  andfortunately  the late Professor’s son  Mr. SalahuddinRabbani  who stepped up to take the Chair of the HighPeace Council  is part of the Afghan delegation andpresent in the Assembly today.I have often said that our hand of peace andreconciliation remains extended not only to the Talibanbut also to all other armed opposition groups who wishto return to dignified  peaceful and independent livesin their own homeland. What we ask of them in returnis simple: bringing an end to violence  cutting tieswith terrorist networks  preserving the valuable gainsof the past decade and respecting the Constitution ofAfghanistan. To help facilitate the peace process  I amasking the Security Council to give its full support toour efforts. In particular  I urge the Security CouncilCommittee established pursuant to resolution 1988(2011)  the Taliban sanctions committee  to make moreactive efforts to delist Taliban leaders  as a step towardsfacilitating direct negotiations.In pursuing the path of peace  we remain hopefulabout the critical role that our fraternal neighbour theIslamic Republic of Pakistan has to play. Over recentyears  we have engaged our brothers in Pakistan in aclose dialogue in support of the Afghan peace process.It is a dialogue that we believe is critical for Pakistan’sown security and for the security of the wider regionand beyond. We are deeply committed to our brotherlyrelations with Pakistan  but we are aware of thechallenges that may strain our efforts to build trustand confidence. Such incidents as the recent shellingof Afghan villages risk undermining the efforts of bothGovernments to work together in the interest of ourcommon security and prosperity.For the past two years  our national priority hasbeen to have Afghanistan’s own security forces assumefull responsibility for the security of our country andour people. The transition process will be completedby mid-2013 and NATO and International SecurityAssistance Force forces withdrawn from our countryby the end of 2014.Apart from advancing transition and pursuing thepeace process  the past year has been one of significantprogress for consolidating international commitmentand partnership. In Chicago in May  we received thelong-term commitment of NATO and other countries totraining  equipping and ensuring the sustainability ofthe Afghan National Security Forces. In Tokyo this pastJuly  the international community reaffirmed its strongcommitment to Afghanistan’s social and economicdevelopment during the transformation decade  forwhich we are grateful.The Mutual Accountability Framework adopted inTokyo sets in place a clear structure for a more results-oriented partnership and cooperation. We welcome theinternational community’s readiness to align aid withour national priorities and channel assistance throughthe Afghan budget. For our part  we have reiterated ourdetermination to improve governance and to collaboratewith our international partners to wipe out the cancer ofcorruption  whether it is in the Afghan Government orthe international aid system.We recognize that Afghanistan’s destiny is tied tothe region that surrounds it  with respect both to ourcommon threats  such as terrorism  extremism andnarcotics  and to the opportunities we must grasp togrow and prosper. In that context  the Istanbul Processpresents a new agenda for security  confidence-buildingand cooperation across the region of which Afghanistanis the centre. We will spare no effort to build strong andlasting relations with our neighbors near and extended.Turning to the international arena  Afghanistanviews the situation in Syria with much concern.Over the course of the past year  thousands of ourSyrian brothers and sisters have lost their lives dueto an escalating cycle of violence. We welcome theappointment of the new Joint Special Representativefor Syria of the United Nations and League of ArabStates  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. We know him very well.Mr. Brahimi is well respected in Afghanistan  and hebrings vast experience and a unique ability to the taskbefore him. Here  I say to the people of Syria that weAfghans have experienced violence ourselves  and weknow what it takes to rebuild a country. I hope verymuch  on behalf of the Afghan people  that the Syrianswill sit down together as soon as possible and find away to end the violence  since it will be not easy torepair.The continuing plight of the Palestinian peoplehas been a source of deep distress for Afghanistan andthe rest of the international community. The people ofPalestine have suffered immensely for far too long. Weremain in full support of the realization of the rightsof our brothers and sisters in Palestine  including theirright to an independent Palestinian State. The time hascome for an end to the occupation and for realizing thejust aspirations of the people of Palestine.Finally  reform of the United Nations remains animportant item on the international agenda. Since itsinception in 1945  the United Nations has exerciseda key role in promoting a safer and more secureworld  improving the lives of citizens worldwide and safeguarding and promoting human rights.Nevertheless  in view of our ever-changing world  wecannot deny the fact that the Organization is in direneed of comprehensive reform  enabling it to betterreflect the new challenges and realities of our time.The reform of the Security Council is long overdue.Achieving a reformed Council that is more inclusive representative and transparent must remain a priority.We welcome the ongoing progress within the frameworkof the intergovernmental negotiations."
"2",81,"AGO",67,2012,"﻿On behalfof the Government of the Republic of Angola  I availmyself of this opportunity to congratulate Mr. VukJeremić on his election to preside over the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session and to assure himof the support of my country in the fulfilment of hismission. It is our belief that under his leadership thissession will confirm the importance and role of the General Assembly in finding solutions to the burningissues affecting humankind  thereby helping to makethe world safer and fairer. I would also like to expressour gratitude to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser forthe exemplary and wise manner in which he conductedthe work of the Assembly at its previous session. Ifurther salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon forthe dynamism he has invested in the work of ourOrganization. In this connection  I would like to thankhim for his visit to my country in February of thisyear  during the celebration of the tenth anniversaryof the advent of peace in Angola. During that visit he had the opportunity to familiarize himself with theprogress made in the reconstruction of the country andconsolidation of democratic institutions.This session of the General Assembly is taking placeat a time of profound international political  economicand social transformations  which reaffirm the relevanceof the central theme of our discussion: maintaininginternational peace and security  eradicating poverty promoting development  protecting the environmentand ensuring a better future for generations to come guaranteeing the rule of law in international relations and promoting and ensuring the protection of humanrights. These are indeed the main challenges facing ustoday.In addition to these  there are further challengesrequiring priority attention from our Organization including disarmament  the fight against organizedcrime  the implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  and the persistence of armedconflicts and their impact on people’s lives. Havinghad the painful experience of war  which still hasmajor consequences for the lives of our people  Angolareiterates that dialogue and negotiation are the way toa peaceful resolution of conflict. Angola will continueto meet its obligations and fulfil its responsibilitiesat the international level  in particular with regardto Africa as a whole  as well as in the context of theregional economic and political groups to which itbelongs  including the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity  the Community of Portuguese-speakingCountries  the Economic Community of CentralAfrican States and the International Conference of theGreat Lakes Region.The international economic and financial crisisthat is affecting all countries in the world continuesto demand solutions  including the reform of theeconomic  financial and international trade system in order to serve the interests of all countries in a globalperspective. In this regard  my Government reiteratesits support for initiatives aimed at liberalizinginternational trade in line with the Doha Round. Thereform of the international economic and financialsystem’s regulatory institutions is of crucial importanceto ensure greater flexibility and transparency inallocating capital to the least developed countries — acategory that includes the majority of African nations.It is also essential to take appropriate measurestowards strengthened support for international actionon sustainable development and increased financialcontributions to the United Nations to enable ourOrganization to fulfil its mandate efficiently. It mustdo so by renewing its commitments to the sustainabledevelopment issues contained in Agenda 21  adoptedat the United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The UnitedNations Conference on Sustainable Developmentprovided a solid framework for creating national andinternational policies to ensure the social  economicand environmental welfare of our peoples.We note that despite the progress made  there isa continued need for the international community totranslate commitments into action in order to achievesustainable development. Africa in general  and mycountry in particular  believe that intensive efforts onthe part of the international community are needed totackle the phenomena that threaten to reverse progressmade with respect to development. Drought anddesertification  climate change  natural disasters  lossof biodiversity and rapid urbanization are just some ofthe factors that adversely affect development effortsworldwide.The Security Council plays a key role in preventingand resolving conflicts  and in peacekeeping efforts  inaccordance with the powers conferred upon it by theCharter of the United Nations. The central theme atthe heart of our debate calls for reform of the SecurityCouncil  as well as ensuring the fair representationof all regions and the broadening of its permanentmembership in order to adapt it to contemporary reality.Allow me to refer to a set of conflicts that are ofcritical concern to my country. In the Great Lakesregion  the conflict in the Democratic Republic of theCongo continues to worry the international community.My country reaffirms its support for the decisions ofthe third extraordinary summit of the InternationalConference on the Great Lakes Region  held in Kampala  as well as the efforts of the African Unionand the Southern African Development Community.Angola welcomes the normalization of the legaland constitutional order in Somalia as a result of thecompletion of the transition process  including theinauguration of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud.Given that the situation remains unstable  Angola urgesthe international community to continue to support thestabilization process in that country.The situation in the Sudan has seen positivedevelopments. Angola welcomes the recent agreementsbetween the sisterly Republics of South Sudan and theSudan  with a view to the settling of their disputes.Angola urges stakeholders to engage with one anotherand to show the political will necessary to implementthe commitments undertaken.With respect to Mali  Angola deplores theworsening humanitarian situation resulting fromthe crisis prevailing in that country. Angola callsupon the international community to demonstrate itsdetermination to preserve the unity  sovereignty andterritorial integrity of Mali.In the sisterly nation of Guinea-Bissau  weadvocate a comprehensive solution and the permanentnormalization of the constitutional order  in accordancewith the relevant resolutions of the Security Council  theAfrican Union  the Community of Portuguese-speakingCountries and the Economic Community of WestAfrican States  as well as the wishes of all the internalactors  in order to stabilize the country and establishpeace.We remain concerned about the lack of progressin resolving the issue of Western Sahara. We call onthe parties involved to continue negotiations underthe auspices of the United Nations so that the peopleof Western Sahara can exercise their right of self-determination.The prevailing situation in the Middle East ingeneral  and the Palestinian territories in particular is one of the most serious problems facing theinternational community. Angola supports the creationof an independent Palestinian State living side by sidewith the State of Israel in peace and security and withinsecure internationally recognized borders  in line withthe position of the international community.The conflict in Syria poses a grave threat tointernational peace and security and will seriously exacerbate the humanitarian situation in the region.Angola urges the international community to supportthe efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  Joint SpecialRepresentative of the United Nations and the Leagueof Arab States for Syria  to seek a negotiated solutionto the conflict.The embargo imposed on Cuba violates internationallaw and for decades has been a major impediment to thatcountry’s development and improvements in the livesof its citizens. Angola reiterates its principled positionaffirming the need to end the embargo in accordancewith the relevant United Nations resolutions.Angola’s foreign policy will continue to be based onmutual respect  mutual benefit  good-neighbourlinessand the strengthening of regional economic integration.Angola will continue to comply with all the internationalcommitments and international instruments to which itis a party.Ten years after achieving peace  Angola hasrecorded significant progress in consolidating itsdemocratic process. General elections were held on31 August in a civil and peaceful atmosphere  thusdemonstrating the maturity of its people. The resultsexpressed the sovereign will of the Angolan people as verified by international observers who closelyfollowed the election.Currently  Angola is joyfully celebrating theinvestiture of its organs of State sovereignty  includingthe President of the Republic and the National Assembly as well as the assumption of office by members of theGovernment. It is experiencing a dynamic reconstructionand development process marked by the consolidationof macroeconomic stability that has had positiveeffects on the stabilization of the national currency.In addition  the rehabilitation and modernization ofmajor productive and social infrastructure  namelythe reconstruction of roads  railways  electricitysupply and distribution systems  water supply systemsand sanitation and telecommunication networks  arecontributing to the progressive improvement of theliving conditions of Angolans.Political stability and the strengthening ofinstitutional capacity have enabled the Angolaneconomy to grow at an average rate of 9.2 per cent overthe past five years  while the non-oil sector has grownat an average rate of 12 per cent. Those growth rateswere due to effective measures by the Governmentaimed at stabilizing the fiscal  monetary and currency macroeconomic indicators and thereby facilitating therevival of the economy.The fi ght against hunger and the struggle to reduceand eradicate poverty are two of the biggest challengesbeing addressed by the Angolan State owing to theirimpact on people’s lives. Indeed  their resolution iscrucial if we are to build a more prosperous society andachieve social justice.Despite Angola’s successes in the last decade it was not possible to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals as we had wished. However  thecountry’s macroeconomic development indicators havepermitted the Committee for Development Policy ofthe Economic and Social Council to consider Angolaeligible to graduate from its least developed countrystatus starting in 2015.On behalf of the Angolan Government  we wouldlike to express our gratitude for the trust that investors have shown in us and for the assistance provided byinternational partners which  added to investment fromnational sources  has allowed us to achieve the level ofeconomic growth the country has been experiencing.We are aware that there is still much to do to ensurethat the high growth rates the country has seen in therecent past are reflected in an effective  systematic andgradual increase in the standard of living of the Angolanpeople  through a better distribution of national incomeand higher employment levels  especially among youth and increased and better investment in the area of socialwelfare.In conclusion  I must reiterate Angola’s commitmentto the purposes and principles embodied in the Charterof the United Nations and state that we will continueto engage in the search for solutions to the challengesfacing the international community."
"3",128,"ALB",67,2012,"﻿We gather here every year toshare our analysis  our views and comments on thecourse of world events. We also take this opportunity toshare our concerns and to meet  interact and try to offerour best commitment to finding appropriate solutionsto current and future challenges.A year has passed since the last session  and theworld has continued to change. Development andeconomic growth in many countries have raisedhundreds of millions of people above the povertyline. Societies throughout the world are taking a standtoday  demanding more rights and asking for effectivepolitical participation. Democracy  human rights andincreased participation by women in public and social life have all globally improved. Despite unprecedentedglobal awareness  climate change remains a majorsource of concern. The continuing deterioration of theglobal economic climate is also a permanent sourceof anxiety everywhere. Threats to peace and securityin various parts of the world show how far we stillare from achieving the global security we want. It istherefore only fair that we expect the United Nations the Organization we have placed at the centre of ourinternational architecture  to be more responsive efficient  effective and transparent.This year Albania celebrates the one hundredthanniversary of its independence. As we mark thatimportant date and survey our history for the past 10decades  we note with satisfaction that for more than halfof that time the State of Albania has enjoyed successfulcooperation and active participation in the life of theUnited Nations. Our commitment has grown over theyears and has embraced almost every aspect of UnitedNations activity  including peacekeeping operations. Inrecent years we have devoted particular attention to theongoing efforts to reform the Organization’s system.As that system has developed and its activities havebecome more complex  the need for greater coherenceand efficiency within the Organization as a whole hasgrown pressing. That is particularly evident in the areaof United Nations development assistance.In June  as one of the pilot countries for theDelivering as One approach  we hosted the fifth High-level Intergovernmental Conference on Deliveringas One. The Tirana Conference adopted an outcomedocument with concrete and  we hope  valuablerecommendations in the light of the approachingquadrennial comprehensive policy review. We knownow that what started as a test idea has come a long wayin a relatively short time. A growing number of countriesare looking more clearly and closely at the benefitsof seeing the United Nations operate and implementits assistance programmes with more coherence andefficiency. Delivering as One has convincingly shownin practice how the operational activities of the UnitedNations can be delivered with greater efficiency andhow the system can do more and better and more withless in its efforts to help countries reach nationally andinternationally agreed development goals.I am proud to represent a country and societywidely known for their broadmindedness  tolerance andacceptance of others. Albanians are probably unique toour region in that  despite having endured centuries of difficulties in our history  we have always preservedand cherished the values of freedom and respect forthe other that are fundamental to the modern conceptof human rights. Albanians’ respect for one another’srights and individuality is expressed first and foremostin an exemplary religious harmony. They have shownan outstanding acceptance of  and respect for  othercultures  ethnicities and civilizations  and have devotedspecial care and attention to those who have comeseeking safe refuge from the horrors of war. Albanianshave risked their own lives and far outspent theireconomic capacity in order to rescue and save those inneed who came knocking at their door.It is against that backdrop that Albania remainsa strong believer in dialogue among civilizations andcontinues to engage actively in bridging the differencesamong the wider membership on issues pertaining tothe human rights agenda. That is why Albania  whichcurrently presides over the Council of Europe  has chosen“United in diversity” as its theme. The dialogue amongdifferent cultures and civilizations should be seen asan ongoing process requiring dedication  goodwill andcare. We cannot allow the sporadic reckless actions ofdisruptive groups to prevent us from making a genuineeffort to reach a better understanding of one another ina world that is becoming more globalized every day.Although we were saddened and embittered by theworthless video that deliberately targets what Muslimseverywhere consider sacred  Albanians  Muslims andChristians alike have expressed their indignation bysimply ignoring such nonsense. We regret that thereaction to it in some parts of the world was different used instead to fuel blind violence by angry  hopelesscrowds  with fatal consequences. We must be clear:any form of terrorism or extremist act on the part ofisolated  malevolent groups should never be confusedwith the position or identified with the attitude of anentire society or Government. No legitimate angercan excuse illegitimate violent acts that Governments societies and political and religious leaders shouldfirmly oppose. We condemn with indignation theterrorist act against American Consulate staff andpremises in Libya and demand that the perpetratorsbe punished. We also condemn any act of violentprotest against the Western embassies  whose missionit is to promote understanding and cooperation amongcountries and nations.With a foreign policy based on peace and goodrelations with all nations  its modest but importantcontribution to international missions aimed atsafeguarding peace and human rights through a policyof good neighbourliness  as well as its efforts to play amoderate and constructive role in the region  Albaniahas become a direct contributor to stability and securityon the regional and global levels. We are determined tomaintain and further build on that record.Today  Albania participates in peacekeepingmissions in several international operations within theframework of the United Nations and other regionalsecurity organizations  including in Afghanistan Bosnia and Herzegovina  Iraq and more. My countryacknowledges and supports every effort towards globalpeace and security and will continue to support theefforts of the United Nations  NATO and other actors topromote peace  stability and security around the world.Global peace and security continue to be challengedby tyranny and oppression in various parts of the world.We reiterate our strong condemnation of the ferociousrepression of the freedom-loving people of Syria  whoseblood is being shed through the primitive attacks onthe part of a regime that has irretrievably forfeited itslegitimate right to lead and represent the Syrian people.Let me join all those calling on the Security Council tostep up and comply with its duty  as mandated in theUnited Nations Charter  to preserve peace and security.It is hard to believe that one can remain indifferentto events such as the terrible ones that have beenunfolding every day in Syria for a year and a half  withtens of thousands of human losses and the widespread deliberate destruction and suffering that have alreadyset the country back by decades.Have we not already learned the hard lessons ofsimilar mistakes in the past tragedies in Rwanda andBosnia?Albania fully supports the peace process betweenPalestine and Israel. Albania reiterates its positionin support of the two-State solution: a secure Stateof Israel and a viable State of Palestine  living sideby side with each other in accordance with UnitedNations resolutions and the road map. The peoples ofboth Palestine and Israel are exhausted by that never-ending conflict  and their leaders should shoulderthe responsibility of undertaking a legitimate questfor freedom and peace  with long-term vision andgoodwill  and against extremists. The world longs tosee the peace process in the Middle East shift from a pattern of stagnation and become an inspiring exampleof difficult yet indispensable compromises.Albania remains deeply worried by the Iraniannuclear programme  which continues to raise seriousquestions as to its nature instead of providing answersand guarantees  as requested over the years. We mustprevent Iran from becoming a nuclear threat.In November this year  my country will celebrate thecentenary of its independence. We will commemorate acentury that saw a diversity of events  which were notalways among the happiest ones.Many have described the Albanian people assurvivors of harsh chapters of history. They are notwrong: the Albanian people have suffered unwantedwars  forced movement from their lands  assaults andattempts to annihilate them  unjust partitions and during the second half of the twentieth century  bravelyresisted five decades of communism. All this has comeat a stiff price. Today we look to the future with hope in a spirit of deliverance  and with strong confidencethat the coming century will be marked by continuouspeace  economic progress  and cultural and intellectualrevitalization.Our region  which was once a troubled hotspotand a sick area of Europe  has been profoundly andpositively transformed. Six new States have been bornout of the former Yugoslavia in the course of the pasttwo decades.We all know that it has not been easy  and we allknow why. But what matters most is that everywherein the region societies have evolved  the ghosts of thepast have ceded their place to new realities  and people in particular the young generation  are more than everturned towards the future.Let me point out here that the establishment of theindependent State of Kosovo five years ago has becomean important factor of peace and stability in the South-east European region. It has become stronger andovercome all kinds of obstacles created by those whostill cannot accept reality and face the truth. As timepasses  independent Kosovo is being recognized andaccepted by an increasing number of States — close tohalf of the States Members of the United Nations.The advisory opinion of the International Courtof Justice on Kosovo (see A/64/881)  rendered in 2010upon specific request from Serbia  clearly ruled thatthe independence of Kosovo was in conformity with the international law. Just a few days ago  the Republicof Kosovo reached another level of State consolidationwith the end of the phase of independence supervisedby the international community.I take this opportunity to congratulate theauthorities of Kosovo on their continued progress inbuilding and strengthening a democratic State and amulti-ethnic society  and I call on all those countriesthat have not yet recognized Kosovo to consider areview and assessment of that irreversible reality inthe South-eastern European region. The recognition ofKosovo is an act of justice for a people that has sufferedfor too long  and represents a net contribution to peaceand stability in the Balkans.We have already heard  and we are prepared tolisten once again to the same old redundant argumentsfrom Serbia regarding Kosovo. What war failed to do propaganda will not achieve either. While Serbia’sleaders speak of partition and the redrawing of borders and while they make troubling statements denyinggenocide in Srebrenica  one is right to ask whether thepast continues to loom over the present there  obscuringreality and distorting their vision of the future.Albania has maintained strong positive economicgrowth despite the impact of the global financialand economic crisis. The pursuit of macroprudentialpolicies and well-anchored structural reforms focusingon privatization  fiscal probity  trade liberalization  thebusiness climate and the energy and financial sectorshave enabled Albania’s economy to become the mostresilient of the economies of South-east Europe. Duringthe period from 2007 to 2012  average economic growthhas been 5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) peaking in 2008 at 8 per cent of GDP.Since 2008  Albania has had a f lat tax of 10 percent; corporate tax has decreased from 25 per cent to10 per cent; personal income tax has dropped from23 per cent to 10 per cent; and dozens of fees havesimply been eliminated.The Global Competitiveness Report 2011-2012 published by the World Economic Forum  ranksAlbania seventy-eighth out of 142 countries/economies.The World Bank report Doing Business 2012: DoingBusiness in a More Transparent World ranks Albaniaeighty-second out of 183 economies in terms of easeof doing business. In the areas of getting credit andof protecting investors  Albania ranks twenty-fourth and sixteenth  respectively  putting it among the topreformer countries.On our road towards sustained development progress and prosperity  we remain fully engaged andcommitted to carrying out all reforms and taking allof the measures required to continue successfully onthe path to European Union integration. This is not analternative but a long-term choice carefully pursuedover the years  and we are determined to make it happen.In the weeks ahead  we expect a favourabledecision by the Council of Ministers of the EuropeanUnion on our bid for the status of candidate countryto the European Union. That merit-based decision willconstitute another milestone in Albania’s journey toEuropean integration and will place our commitmentsand our responsibilities at a higher stage of the process.In conclusion  let me assure the Assembly thatAlbania remains committed to international cooperationand is determined to continue to offer its contribution toadvancing peace  freedom and security  and respect forhuman rights  fighting poverty  promoting sustainabledevelopment and prosperity  and  last but not least protecting the environment."
"4",151,"AND",67,2012,"﻿I would firstlike to extend hearty congratulations to the Presidentof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session Mr. Jeremić  to whom I wish the greatest success in hiswork.Just one year ago  I ended my statement(see A/66/PV.27) by reasserting the notion of commitment as a fundamental value and linchpinof our political action  understood as a deep beliefin the values of democracy  respect for human rightsand the rule of law; as the assumption of individualresponsibilities for a common project; and ultimatelyas a desire for dialogue and understanding. It is in thepursuit of that commitment and that balance — whatwe might call the right balance — that the difficulty ofGovernment resides. That is the case at home  in everyone of our States  and also in our shared home of theUnited Nations.A year ago in this Assembly  we echoed a phrase ofthe then French President  who stated: “Let us choosethe path of compromise  which is neither renunciationnor repudiation  but which allows us to move forward step by step” (A/66/PV.11  p. 23). Indeed  on the path ofcompromise and the right balance  we cannot and mustnot abandon the defence of human rights  the rule oflaw and the most essential democratic values such asfreedom of expression. We cannot and should not denyrespect to others.However  establishing a fair balance does not meanconducting a balancing act. Indeed  that balance mustbe based on strong principles. There can be no excusefor violence  intolerance or impunity. President Obamawas right when he mentioned in this Hall that therecent attacks on diplomatic missions were not solelyan attack on the United States  but also an assault on thefoundations of the United Nations itself. There can beno excuse or impunity for such acts.We are all Chris Stevens. But what defines us is nothow we fall but how we rise again. We will stand by allChris Stevens as they rise to defend the ideals of theUnited Nations.Allow me today to echo the words of the newPresident of the French Republic  François Hollande Co-Prince of Andorra  who stated before this Assemblythat “The mission of the United Nations is to tacklethese challenges and to find strong and just responses tothem together.” (A/67/PV.6  p. 43) For over 65 years  theUnited Nations has been a reference for peace  justiceand respect for human rights. Remarkable progress hasindeed been observed in recent years. It is no less true however  that the countries represented here cannot afford the luxury of falling into complacency. Thedemand for just and strong responses is very real.The change of regime in Libya and the ongoinggrievous conflict in Syria have presented theinternational community with the awkward dilemma ofhaving to find a fair balance between resolving conflictspeacefully and the rule of law — in short  betweenpeace and justice. It would appear that  in order to attaina peaceful solution to a conflict or to end hostilities justice must be sacrificed while those who have violatedhuman rights go unpunished; or that  due to inf lexibleapplication of international law  conflicts will continueforever. A fair balance must not allow either those whoviolate human rights to go unpunished  or conflicts tocontinue endlessly. With regard to Syria  it is time tosupport open societies and political transitions that canguarantee a framework for democratic development. Iwish to praise the commitment of the Secretary-Generaland Joint Special Representative Mr. Lakhdar Brahimito finding a solution to the conflict in Syria.The Secretary-General has said that peoplewant progress and solutions today. They want ideas leadership and concrete hope for the future. TheSecretary-General’s words accurately reflect what theworld expects from all Member States. We also needto maintain perspective  because if complacency isdangerous  so too are harsh criticism and pessimism.While the working methods of the United Nationssystem are far from optimal  we should not forget thatthe reality of today seemed an unattainable dream acentury ago. We should move on from talk of dreamsto talk of ambition. We should move on from dreamingabout change to exerting the ambition to change. Weshould move on from “I have a dream”  as stated byMartin Luther King  Jr.  to speaking about the ambitionthat we all share.In his statement at the opening of the general debate(see A/67/PV.6)  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon rightlymentioned raising our levels of ambition. The stepfrom dream to ambition needs perspective; dreamingrequires knowing only how we would like things to be but having and realizing ambition requires us to knowhow far we are prepared to go  while bearing verymuch in mind the path travelled and everything to beexperienced along the way.In that respect the United Nations and its systemallow us to face the future with cautious optimism  asthe world has been better and more just with the presence of the United Nations than without it. However  whenwe look at its evolution  we realize that something is notquite right  as the evolution process has been fraughtwith limitations  shortcomings and obstacles that theinternational community must address in its efforts toresolve conflicts peacefully and in accordance withthe law. The Secretary-General rightly emphasizedhis new Education First initiative  which encouragesdemocratic values  human rights and the rule of law.And those values can guarantee equal opportunity andsocial cohesion.During its forthcoming presidency of the Council ofEurope  Andorra will prioritize education as a tool forencouraging democratic values  respect for human rightsand the rule of law. Andorra is particularly sensitiveto education  not only in the sphere of internationalcooperation  but also domestically  as it is aware thatits unique  multicultural and multilingual educationalapproach  featuring three public systems — Andorran French and Spanish — in a small society with its ownidentity  has not been a problem  but rather an asset andan essential element of social cohesion.We see that commitment to multiculturalism andmultilingualism within the francophone community.The commitment to openness and exchange amongindividuals is good and is far from self-absorption inone’s own language or culture. Now is not the timefor self-absorption but rather for openness; it is timefor ambition and not protectionism. The work of thefrancophone community is deeply aligned with ourvalues  and we will convene in Africa at the forthcomingSummit of the Francophonie to defend the spirit ofopenness to democratic values and human rights.That commitment to multiculturalism also beliesthe strong bonds we feel with our Latin Americanfriends. Our involvement within the General Assemblyin the preparatory work for the forthcoming Cadizsummit  to be hosted by our dear neighbour Spain should also be viewed through the prism of opennessand the defence of democratic values  human rights andthe rule of law.The Principality of Andorra today reasserts itscommitment to the founding principles of the UnitedNations: the promotion of peace  liberty  justice  democracy and human rights. Those are not utopianvalues and principles; quite the contrary  it would beunrealistic and unthinkable to seek to establish stabilityin the world with any other values. What is importantis to come here today to proclaim not that Andorrahas one of the oldest and most stable parliaments andpolitical systems on the planet  but that at the end of thethirteenth century its political system was consolidatedin a very short period of time and in circumstances thatwere far from ideal. In a very brief time span  the samesystem was again able to adapt to modern reality at theend of the twentieth century. In our country  indeed  itwas not until 1971 that women were entitled to vote.Yet only 40 years later  in 2011 the people of Andorraelected a Parliament with the second-highest number offemale representatives in the world. This is why I spokeearlier of viewing things from a perspective of processand evolution.History shows us that what appeared utopiannot long ago has become reality today. We shouldnot assume that things cannot change and cannot getbetter. The limits that the United Nations seems to haveencountered after almost seven decades of existencewill be overcome one day  and today’s challenges willbe viewed as things of the past. The numerous countriesthat form the international community have shown howrapidly things can change when there is a will to act.One only has to take a look at the determination withwhich many of the members of this Assembly havejoined forces and coordinated their policies to findsolutions to the grave financial and economic crisis thathas rocked the world over the last few years.The need for rapid and profound change has alsoarrived in Andorra. A year ago  we stated in our speechthat our country had one of the most closed economieson the planet and that it posed significant barriers toforeign investment  as foreigners had to meet costlyrequirements to attain full economic rights. Today only 12 months later  the Andorran economy is 100 percent open to foreign capital  and every foreign residentis granted full economic rights from the first day of hisor her residency.Earlier  I referred to openness in a broad sense but today economic openness should enable us torediscover the path of inclusive growth that has definedus  albeit now within an open and diversified economygeared to the pursuit of competitiveness  innovationand general progress. This entire process has beenaccompanied by an updating of the Andorran model with an appropriate tax framework and a commitmentto transparency towards the international community.The whole process is based on the belief that recoverymeans not faint-hearted withdrawal  but rather theambition to open up to the world and a willingness tocompete. That conviction is the driving force behindthe implementation by the Principality of Andorra ofsome of the most significant socioeconomic changes inits entire history.Twenty years ago  the United Nations pioneeredthe promotion of sustainable development. When theinternational community met in Rio de Janeiro in1992  at what was called the Earth Summit  the needto consider sustainable growth became manifest andthe subject was tackled from a threefold economic environmental and social perspective. The conclusionsof that Rio Summit  to which scant or no attention hasbeen paid  are today so topical that the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development  held in Rioin June  stressed the very same policies. However although 20 years ago sustainability might have seemedsolely an environmental issue  experience has shownus that public finance  economic growth and ourmodel of social protections must also be sustainable.The challenge of sustainability is now  more than ever shared and interdisciplinary.Many years ago  the United Nations was createdin the belief that maintaining peace and security inthe world was unrealistic without advances in humanrights  in international law and in democracy. Therecan be no lasting peace or security without liberty orjustice. More recently  we have all learned not onlythat separating democracy from economic progressmakes no sense  but also that it is foolish to believein unrestrained  unlimited growth at any cost  theconsequences of which we are still feeling.A few days ago  at the reception for the diplomaticcorps  our Episcopal Co-Prince  Joan Enric VivesSicilia  noted the dangerous tendency to prioritizehaving rather than being. We must learn the lessons ofrecent years  in which the desire to have everything wewanted too often led us to forget to pursue everythingwe needed. We must build a more sustainable  moreinterrelated and more co-responsible world in order tolay the foundations for more secure economic growth.A pledge to progress and prosperity also means supportfor democracy  for security and for peace."
"5",196,"ARE",67,2012,"﻿At the outset  I wouldlike to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his electionas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I am confident that his experience ininternational affairs will enable him to guide the workof this session wisely and ably  and I wish him everysuccess in his task.I would also like to commend his predecessor Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  for hissuccessful and prudent leadership of the sixty-sixthsession of the General Assembly  and to commend thegreat efforts made by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moonand pay tribute to his tireless efforts and the role of thisinternational Organization in promoting internationalpeace  security and development.Security and stability in the Arab Gulf region are ahigh priority for all of us. Our balanced policies are basedon the principles of the Charter of the United Nationsand the provisions of international law  especially thosecalling for peaceful coexistence  confidence-building good neighbourliness  mutual respect  non-interferencein the internal affairs of other States  and pursuingpeaceful means in resolving conflicts and disputes.On the basis of those principles  my Governmentexpresses  once again  its regret regarding thecontinued Iranian occupation of our three islands:Abu Musa  Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb. We demandthe restoration of the United Arab Emirates’ fullsovereignty over those islands. We emphasize that allactions and measures taken by Iran are null and void and are in contravention of international law and allnorms and universal human values.The events unfolding in Syria are for us a causefor great sadness. They have gone beyond all limitsand norms. The United Arab Emirates is closely  andwith great concern  following the policies of violence killing  displacement and expulsion being pursued bythe Syrian regime against its people  which regimehas lost all its legitimacy. We therefore call upon theinternational community to consider with seriousnessand firmness what is happening to our Syrian brothersand to shoulder its humanitarian responsibilities.We see it as our duty to stop those atrocities againstthe peaceful Syrian people. We are convinced that a solution to the crisis can be achieved only through anorderly transition of power.That severe humanitarian crisis requires usto support the people of Syria  in particular therefugees. The United Arab Emirates has shoulderedits responsibilities and obligations towards the Syrianrefugees in Turkey and Jordan and will continue to doso by providing relief. We urge all States to contributeto such humanitarian efforts.The Middle East holds great importance for us and we believe that peace and stability will never beachieved in that region until the Arab-Israeli conflictis resolved. That is the central and vital issue to thepeople of the entire region  and reaching a just solutionis the key for bringing peace and stability to the wholearea. It cannot be realized without putting an end tothe Israeli occupation of the Palestinian and Arabterritories through Israel’s withdrawal to the linesof 4 June 1967  including from East Jerusalem  theoccupied Syrian Golan Heights and the remainingoccupied Lebanese territories. The achievement of ajust and comprehensive peace must be carried out inaccordance with resolutions of international legitimacy the principle of land for peace  the Arab Peace Initiativeand the establishment of an independent PalestinianState  with East Jerusalem as its capital.The United Arab Emirates welcomes theconsiderable progress achieved in the political processin Somalia through the completion of the transitionalphase  the convening of the Constituent Assembly the adoption of the Constitution of Somalia and theelection of Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the newPresident of Somalia. We also reaffirm our supportfor the sovereignty  territorial integrity and politicalindependence of Somalia  and look forward to workingwith its Government towards achieving security andstability and countering piracy in a region of suchvital importance  not only with respect to oil and gastransport but also to the world economy in general.In the United Arab Emirates  we remain committedto supporting the security and stability of Afghanistanand confirm the continuation of our humanitarian anddevelopmental support to that distressed country. Inthat context  we welcome the outcome of the donorsconference that was held in Tokyo  with the hope thatthe pledges announced at the conference will contributeto the process of the reconstruction of Afghanistan. Aswe approach the year 2014 and the commitment formilitary withdrawal from Afghanistan and for turningthe country over to its people and Government  weaspire to see an Afghanistan that is free from terrorism extremism and violence.At the same time  the United Arab Emiratesexpresses its deep concern over the violence againstthe Rohingya Muslim community in Myanmar andcalls upon the international community to urge theGovernment of Myanmar to cease all acts incompatiblewith the principles of fundamental human rights.We reaffirm our commitment to all requirements ofnuclear non-proliferation and renew our support for theefforts aimed at designating the region of the MiddleEast  including the Arab Gulf region  a zone free ofweapons of mass destruction — especially the ArabGulf region. In that context  we must also call uponIsrael to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons and subject all of its nuclear facilitiesto the comprehensive safeguards regime.In that regard  we urge the Islamic Republic of Iranto fully cooperate with the International Atomic EnergyAgency in implementing its international commitmentsin order to dispel all fears and suspicions surroundingits nuclear programme. We look forward to a peacefulsolution to that crisis  ensuring that our region remainsfree of tension and conflict  while guaranteeing thetransparency and peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclearprogramme.The United Arab Emirates began in 2009 to developa nuclear energy programme for peaceful uses in orderto meet the country’s growing demand for energy and tosupport economic development projects. It ensured thatthe programme’s rules and regulations were based onthe highest standards of sustained safety and securitymeasures and principles of nuclear non-proliferation.I take the opportunity to call upon the States of theregion to draw on the experience of the United ArabEmirates in that field and to study the standards oftransparency  technology  safety and security uponwhich the programme is based.We would like to emphasize the importance ofaddressing the implications of climate change  whichinvolves developing renewable energy technologies toachieve sustainable development and providing cleanenergy for developing countries  which are amongthe goals advocated by the United Arab Emirates inoffering various types of humanitarian and developmentassistance.The United Arab Emirates reiterates its firmcondemnation of all acts of terrorism  illicit traffickingin drugs and arms and human trafficking  as well asorganized crime  which are interlinked phenomena thatfeed into each other. It reaffirms its resolve to continuecooperating with international and multilateral effortsaiming at the total elimination of those negativephenomena  which pose a direct threat to internationalpeace and security.The United Arab Emirates has announced theestablishment of the International Centre of Excellencefor Countering Violent Extremism  in collaboration withseveral inf luential friends and actors  which will beginits work in Abu Dhabi at the end of the year. Moderationand tolerance are the basic principles guiding ourpolitical orientation and represent lofty values to thecitizens of the United Arab Emirates and to society asa whole. In that sense  the United Arab Emirates hasbeen and will remain committed to moderation in itsapproach  and accepts other communities as part of adiverse world built on mutual respect. Those are thehuman values that have formed our convictions withregard to many issues  such as counterterrorism  humanrights  the empowerment of women and coexistenceamong peoples and religious sects.The United Arab Emirates emphasizes theimportance of consolidating the values of tolerance moderation and respect for religions  as well as theimportance of protecting religions against defamationand contempt and stresses the need to develop thenecessary legislation in that regard. I must condemn in the strongest possible terms  abuses against Islam as freedom of expression should not be allowed toundermine any religion or belief  whatsoever. We alsocondemn all violent reactions to any such abuse.Terrorism poses a challenge to international peaceand security and leads to violating the human rightsof ordinary people by depriving them of the rightto live in peace and prosperity. In that context andbased on our commitment to the principles of humanrights  the United Arab Emirates renews its support ofinternational efforts aimed at ensuring peace  securityand prosperity for all the peoples of the world  andlooks forward to expanding its engagement in that area.The United Arab Emirates has also been focusingits efforts on reducing gender discrimination.Therefore  we look forward to playing an active rolein the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality andthe Empowerment of Women  based on our successful  national experience in empowering the women ofthe United Arab Emirates  who actively participatein managing the affairs of the State as well as thecommunity.In conclusion  I would like to appeal to allMember States to support the quest of the United ArabEmirates to host World Expo 2020 in Dubai under theslogan “Connecting Minds  Creating the Future”. Welook forward to receiving the support necessary tostrengthen my country’s candidacy  particularly since itis the first time that the event will be held in the MiddleEast  North Africa and South Asia region."
"6",243,"ARG",67,2012,"﻿I wouldlike to begin my statement by confirming my personalposition and that of the Argentine Republic and theArgentine people with regard to our emphatic rejectionand repudiation of the savage assassination of UnitedStates Ambassador Christopher Stevens in the city ofBenghazi  Libya. That ugly act of terrorism warrantsthat we reflect upon certain interpretations of eventsthat took place in various Arab countries and were formany Western leaders interpreted as or called the ArabSpring. But  in reality  from our point of view — andI say this humbly and with all respect — it reflectedother situations that were not correctly perceived orunderstood by the main leaders in the West.It is no accident that the death of Chris Stevensoccurred in Benghazi  where the principal focus ofresistance against Muammar Al-Qadhafi’s regimeoriginated  and where those of us with an understandingof international politics clearly know that the mainIslamic fundamentalists were located — not justopponents of Muammar Al-Qadhafi’s regime  but those opposed to the very idea of peaceful coexistencebetween men and women of different races  religions beliefs or faiths.I say that because it is necessary to have a clearunderstanding of our problems and of the situationsin the world  particularly in the Middle East. It isimportant to understand the need for different policiesgeared to building true and lasting peace — a peace thatmust always imply choosing the language of diplomacybefore choosing the language of weapons. If one reviewsrecent history  one can see that important figures orpolitical factions that appear to be allied with the Westfrequently end up becoming sworn enemies of Westernvalues  perhaps as a result of poor interpretations orpolicies ill suited to what was happening in the MiddleEast and around the world.The need to recognize the Palestinian State andthe need to recognize that Israel must live withinlegally recognized borders in accordance with the 1967borders is the crux of the problem in the Middle East.The Argentine Republic — and I believe we reflect theinterests of our region — maintains that it is necessaryto have a response to an issue that has been callingfor a solution for decades. Yet  owing to differentcircumstances  to Governments and to interests inthe West  which has an enormous responsibility ofleadership in the issue  nothing constructive has beenachieved.For Chris Stevens  and for his family  there willbe no Arab Spring  but rather a terrible and eternalwinter. That is why it is absolutely necessary that wein the West rethink our strategies and policies withrespect to the Middle East. Otherwise  we run the riskof ending up embarking upon erroneous strategies thatundermine our values and deepen the crisis. What willhappen is what happened in Benghazi  and we shallhave to mourn the death of a diplomat  regardless of hisnationality. In this case  it was an American  somethingthat had not happened for a very long time.A similar situation could be described with respectto the other great crisis  which was apparently economicin nature and which is shaking the world. In 2008  whenwe came to the General Assembly  Lehman Brotherscollapsed  causing a crisis that seemed triggered bypoor people who could not pay off the mortgages ontheir homes — the famous sub-prime loans crisis — butit has ended up today as something greater than a crisisof the poor who cannot pay off their mortgages.It has spread well beyond that issue. It has beendiscovered that it was precisely those financialadministrators of capital who were behind all this.Actually  it was the wealthiest sectors of society whocreated this global crisis.In Europe the eurozone crisis is basically a crisisof sovereign debt for countries that owe more thantheir gross domestic product (GDP). Also  familieshave taken on more debt than they can pay off in thenext 20 or 30 years. At this very moment in Spainthere is repression against indignant citizens who aredemonstrating against the belt-tightening programmebeing imposed on their country. They are protestingthe same austerity programme that has been applied fordecades now and that has not borne any fruit.When we in Argentina discuss the problem wetalk about it with deep-seated knowledge of thetype of neoliberal policies that were the result of theWashington consensus  which was launched followingthe problems in the 1990s and ended up exploding as adefault on the most significant sovereign debt knownin history. Argentina owed 160 per cent of its GDP  theresult of debt policies that in turn had resulted from theindustrialization and ongoing imposed adjustment andconsumption policies. Those policies were ferociouslyand methodically imposed on countries  just as we areseeing now with Spain  Greece and Portugal  with theresulting danger to the eurozone.Endangering the eurozone involves more than justthe undermining of an economic region. It is actuallyendangering the very stability of the world financialsystem. We should recall that some 65 per cent ofinternational reserves deposited in central banksaround the world are in United States dollars  and some24 per cent are in euros.It is necessary to rethink all of this. We need torethink the trade war that has exploded betweenvarious countries. Some countries have denounced itas protectionism. Basically  participants in such tradewars assert that such policies are needed to defend theirsocieties  their workers  their labour markets and theirbusinesses against developed countries’ economies which actually were the root cause of the crisis we areall experiencing today. The developed countries aretrying to push their problems off on to others. I keepasking  if one of our countries had had a deficit in itscurrent account  such as the United States is runningright now  that country would no doubt have beencensored  punished and criticized. Of course  becausedollars are the reserve currency — some 85 per centof world transactions are in dollars — and the UnitedStates has been considered the country that issues themoney used as reserve currency par excellence  it endsup being outside of the whole system. It is not criticizedand is not targeted by the International Monetary Fund(IMF). Yet the IMF continues to impose adjustmentpolicies. Even yesterday  there were threats issued tocountries like the Argentine Republic.The IMF has tried to allude to sovereign debtsas though the whole thing were just a soccer game. IfArgentina were unable to accomplish certain things the country was going to be given a red card  just as insoccer. I just want to say to the head of that organizationthat this is not a soccer game. First  this is the mostserious political and economic crisis in memory sincethe 1930s. Secondly  my country is not a player in asoccer game; it is a sovereign nation  which makes itsdecisions on a sovereign basis. It will not be subjectto pressures brought to bear from the outside nor anythreats of red cards. Finally  continuing with thisanalogy between soccer and the economy  the Presidentof the International Federation of Association Football(FIFA) does a much more satisfactory job than the headof the IMF.With regard to organization and responsibility FIFA organizes world matches every four years. Nexttime  they will be in Brazil  and no doubt they will be asuccess. The International Monetary Fund is in chargeof organizing economies and has been doing so sincethe 1980s  and yet it has been unable to carry out itstask effectively. However  it seems that it is countriesthat should be criticizing themselves  whereas I do nothear any self-criticism from the IMF.With regard to the statistics for Spain  what werethe statistics for Greece or Portugal  Ireland or Italy?What were the figures that allowed them to go moreinto debt without any kind of control or oversight? Whyare some countries being controlled and not others?That is a question that we have to ask  and that we areasking from this rostrum. Since 2003  we have beensaying this.When President Néstor Kirchner came here for thefirst time he was representing an Argentina that hadbeen devastated by the crisis  with poverty at levelsthat we had never seen before: 25 per cent of Argentinepeople had no work. People were losing their savings in dollars  roubles  pesos  pounds  whatever; they simplyhad nothing left. They came to the United Nationsand said that we needed an opportunity to grow. For acountry to pay off its debt  it needs to be able to grow.The dead do not pay off their debts. That is what theArgentine President said  and he was not mistaken.In 2003  based on the policies he was able to put intoplace  and without access to capital markets  Argentinawas able to restructure a significant part of its foreigndebt. We have been rigorously making every singlepayment since 2005. We will continue making thosepayments because we believe in policies that promotenational production.We are working with the most vulnerable sectorsof society and promoting social programmes. Wehave dedicated more than 1 per cent of our GDP tothose programmes. We have put social policies andprogrammes in place  and they are the most notablein Latin America. They have allowed us to promotegrowth  which undoubtedly is the most significant seenin the last 200 years of the history of the ArgentineRepublic.We are not coming here to preach to anyone or toteach lessons. We do not think that we are teachers. Wejust want to tell the Assembly about the experience ofone country that went through a situation quite similarto that now being experienced by other countries inthe developed world. What we want to contribute isour empirical experience  not theoretical experiences.There are still decisions that need to be taken  but thathave not been taken because many continue to followthe practices of those who control the capital markets.They hit one country and then another. One day the stock market goes up 20 per cent  skyrockets  andthen it plummets the following day. We may not beeconomists  but we are not stupid either. We are talkingabout incredible transfers of money  and those who endup being harmed are the same millions of people wholose their jobs and lose their hope. What I hope to seeis that they do not lose patience. Usually  when peoplelose patience  that is when they hit the wall. Whenpeople cannot find a job and do not have a State that isprotecting them  it becomes a political and institutionalcrisis. That is what happened to us in 2001 in Argentina.I also believe that it is important to understand thatwe have a new world before us now. This new worldrequires more creative leadership.It requires taking the risk of applying new ideasand new concepts. Trying to solve the current problemsof the world with the same medicines that caused themis absolutely absurd. That has to be stated clearly.Then there is the matter of the current accountsdeficit  which is transferred from the United States toemerging countries  so that our currencies are devaluedand we have to make immense efforts to build up ourreserves. We also have to take measures to prevent thecentral countries from transferring cheap merchandiseto us that undermines our economies — the economiesof the emerging countries that  it bears saying  proppedup the growth of the global economy during the pastdecade.Today  as emerging countries  we are beingcondemned as protectionist by the very countries thatsurvived by protecting themselves through agriculturalsubsidies and all sorts of special breaks at the expenseof our economies and  above all  of millions of ourpeople who only now are being incorporated into thelabour force.It is crucial for developed countries to understandthe contribution that emerging countries can make tothe international economic recovery with the millionsof dollars we still owe  on top of our costs for socialbenefits and production. Besides  we have paid downour debt to levels never seen before. Argentina  whoseforeign debt represented 160 per cent of its grossnational product  today owes only 14 per cent of its grossnational product abroad; the remainder of its borrowingis intrasectoral public debt. We are at the lowest levelever of foreign debt and debt held by foreign sources.Obviously  for some we are a bad example. Why?Because when we restructured our debt — and I amnot proposing restructurization as a solution — weheld that under capitalism anyone who risked investingdollars in a country like Argentina  with interest ratesin the 1990’s between 15 and 16 per cent to ensureconvertibility  when the rate in rest of the world wasa mere two per cent  had to know that there was asubstantial risk that that person  that bank or thatinstitution would not repay the debt.Our thesis was that if they had taken the risk  theyshould share it. We therefore proposed a restructuringwhereby both parties would share. The fact is thatArgentina paid its stockholders more than Enron did.Enron paid  I believe  $1 per $100 share; Argentina paid$25 to $30 on $100. In reality  we were more generous and responsible than Enron was  not just towards therest of the world but to the citizens of the United States.That may of course annoy certain multilateral creditinstitutions  especially because  during the 1990’s Argentina was held up as an example of the way thingsshould be done  while in 2001 we were left to our owndevices and told to resolve things by ourselves. I believethat is why some would censure us or fine us  so thatour bad example does not spread  but if we think of theworld as a totality  we will understand that that is not aneconomic problem  but a political one. Without leaderswho can point to a clear  specific path for overcominga world economic crisis of this magnitude  we are nolonger facing a problem of economics or economists;we are facing a problem of politics for which there areneither solutions nor responses nor new models.We know that some multilateral agencies areangry with Argentina  but we tell them there is nopoint being angry with us. The important thing is toanalyse the mistakes that were made in both economicsand politics and what was done wrong so that we cancorrect them  move forward and overcome this crisis because if allowed to continue it will trigger not justsevere economic problems but severe political andinstitutional ones. Having been a political activist ata young age and having experienced periods in mycountry when Western values were not respected  whenpeople were raped  tortured and disappeared — becausedemocracy had disappeared — what I am most afraid ofis that if there continues to be no solution to the presentcrisis  many millions of people in the West will cease tobelieve that a democratic system can provide solutions.If we examine human history  we can clearly seethat the most terrible totalitarian periods were precededby severe economic crises that gave people no way out deprived them of hope and filled their ears with sirensongs that promised things we all know could never bedelivered.I wanted to speak emphatically about how to tacklethe problem  about how to conceive of it  so that thesituation can be brought back into line instead oflanguishing as it has since 2008. Unfortunately  wehave begun to see that the crisis in the developed worldis starting to spread into emerging countries  whichhave been the engine of global growth.I believe those things are connected. The lack of acorrect interpretation  of an adequate classification  sothat political and economic events get jumbled together  gives rise to fallacies — for example  that the people incertain political movements want to live like Westernersor that certain orthodox economic adjustments mightlead to some way out or some solution — all false  ofcourse.I would now like to address two topics that mightbe called bilateral in nature. One  in the form of thislittle booklet in English and Spanish  was delivered toeach of the Missions represented here and deals with thequestion of the colonial status of the Malvinas. Last June I appeared before the Committee on Decolonizationhere in New York to present our request for compliancewith resolution 2065 (XX)  which urged bothcountries — the United Kingdom and Argentina — toundertake a dialogue on the issue of the Malvinas. NextJanuary  it will have been 180 years since the UnitedKingdom illegally usurped our Malvinas islands. Notonly has that country not ceased  it has not listened toor heeded any of the many allegations and resolutionsof the United Nations  the resolutions of the Committeeon Decolonization  and the many resolutions of variousorganizations such as the Organization of AmericanStates and other multilateral organizations such as theRio Group  which have asked Great Britain to sit downto a dialogue with Argentina. We are not asking themto say that we are right. That would not be dialogue; itwould be to impose a point of view. We are simply askingthem to sit down with us to comply with the UnitedNations resolution and to undertake a dialogue on thesovereignty of the Malvinas  as well as to demilitarizethe South Atlantic so that it becomes a region of peacein South America  without regard to ethnic  religious orany other differences that could lead to clashes betweenus.That is why we once again reiterate our appeal.There is a clear double standard here: the permanentmembers of the Security Council have the right toviolate any and every requirement of the United Nations while everyone else has to accept without demur anyand every Council resolution. That is not buildingmultilateralism. It contributes nothing whatever to thepeacebuilding that we all demand and need  and it leadsto a growing feeling of injustice and inequality betweennations  which significantly affects the possibility of amore just world  of living in a world without violence.That is why we say once again: this is not abilateral issue between us and the United Kingdom. Ithas become a global issue — doing away with the lastvestiges of colonialism  which became one of the great contributions of the United Nations when it createdthe Decolonization Committee  in 1961. Entering thetwenty-first century without colonies is a matter ofhuman rights  rights that in my country we certainlydefend very strongly; our support for them is anexample to the world.Finally — and this relates to the early part of myspeech  when I repudiated and condemned the killingof Ambassador Christopher Stevens in Libya — I wouldlike to mention something that for us  the Argentinepeople  continues to be an open wound  since inits case justice has still not been served. That is thebombings of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina(AMIA) in 1994 and of the Israeli Embassy in 1992 acts that should be utterly deplored and condemned.Former President Kirchner and I both asked the IslamicRepublic of Iran  which stands accused by Argentina’sjudiciary of participation in that crime  for itscollaboration and cooperation. In 2010 and 2011  giventhe lack of response to that request  I suggested  as analternative  that if the Islamic Republic of Iran did nottrust the fairness and independence of the Argentinejudiciary  the solution could be based on a case that theAssembly will recall  the Libyan terrorist attack on aBritish airplane  in which a trial was eventually held ina third-party country to arrive at reparations — if onecan talk of reparations in the case of death — for someof the damages. Thus both countries would agree on athird country where a trial would guarantee justice forboth sides. In the aftermath of that terrible event  whatwas most important was the quest for truth.I began my statement by talking about internationalterrorism  and I am ending it on the same subject. I amnot talking about an act committed in a single Africancountry against a single member of the diplomat corps;I am talking about what was done in my country  on myterritory  to my brother Argentines  in clear violation ofterritorial sovereignty. Last Wednesday  19 September we received a request from the Islamic Republic of Iranfor a bilateral meeting at which  as we understood it there would be a dialogue on this matter. My country which has continued to ask for a dialogue and whichpromotes dialogue as a universal — and  in the caseof the Malvinas  a specific — instrument  decidedto instruct our Minister for Foreign Affairs to hold abilateral meeting between the two ministries  here at theUnited Nations  as requested by the Islamic Republic ofIran.I should say here that I am expecting resultsfrom that meeting  based on the fact that the IslamicRepublic of Iran showed that it wanted to cooperateand collaborate on the matter of the attack. If they donot want to conduct the case in Argentina or in a thirdcountry  we hope that they will come forward withother proposals as to how we can address this deep-seated conflict  dating back to 1994. I would like toremind the Assembly that when President Kirchner hadjust become President  in 2003  nine years had elapsedsince the attack  without results. But I would also liketo say that we hope this meeting will yield specific concrete results if the Islamic Republic of Iran has aproposal for making headway. It might not necessarilybe in the direction proposed by Argentina  but I wouldin any case  as a member of a representative and federalrepublican country  submit it for consideration by therepresentative parliamentary bodies of my country. Aproposal made by the Islamic Republic of Iran is tooimportant to be resolved through executive poweralone  quite apart from the fact that our Constitutionrequires that the legislature and judiciary be involvedin such an issue.This is not a matter of casual or standard foreignrelations with another country. It concerns an eventthat has marked the Argentine people and is enshrinedin the history of international terrorism. The essentialfact is that the families of the victims  to whom I feelvery committed  need answers. For six years I sat onthe bicameral commission of inquiry into both theEmbassy and the AMIA attacks  and I was alwayscritical of how the investigation was conducted. That iswhy I believe I have the authority to address the familiesof the victims — because they are the ones who trulyneed answers; they need to understand what happenedand who is responsible — and to assure them that thisPresident will not take any decisions on any proposalsput forward without first and foremost consulting themand the parliamentary representatives of my country.They all have an obligation to voice an opinion publiclyon a matter of this importance.Lastly  I would like to say to every member of theAssembly that in 2013 and 2014 Argentina will havethe great honour and responsibility of occupying aseat — a non-permanent seat  obviously — on theSecurity Council. I would like to make it clear thatbeyond the fact of our taking a seat at that table  eachand every country with serious aspirations to peaceas a universal value will be represented by us in that seat. That is not a disingenuous or informal wish. Itis a firm declaration that peace must go hand in handwith truth  justice and equality. Peace is impossible in aworld where countries are not all treated equally. Peaceis impossible in a world where people are growingpoorer and becoming increasingly excluded. Peace isimpossible in a world where people do not tell the truthor state how things really are.We believe that in peacebuilding the largestand leading nations of the world bear the greaterresponsibility. Just as in a country’s political systemthe President bears the greatest responsibility and thechain continues down from there  the same is true inthe wider world.We cannot  beyond the call for equality  turn ablind eye to hegemonies or to the importance of certaincountries in not only resolving conflicts but sometimesalso in triggering them.The Argentine Republic will  from its seat  doeverything in its power to promote the values that ithas always defended: peace and the unconditionalpromotion of human rights in all countries  whether weare on good terms with them or not. Human rights areuniversal values that should be respected by all types ofGovernments throughout the world. It is the obligationof the Assembly and the Security Council to act on thebasis of a single standard so as to build the values ofpeace  human rights  equality and truth. That is theonly way to bring about a world that is more fair andequitable than the one of today."
"7",268,"ARM",67,2012,"﻿Iwould like to join previous speakers in congratulatingMr. Vuk Jeremić on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I wouldalso like to extend our thanks to the outgoing President Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser.This session of the General Assembly is aninvaluable opportunity to bring together Member Statesin order to examine the challenges facing humanity andto join efforts in effectively addressing those challengesand in achieving internationally agreed goals. Weall know that when decisions are based on commonunderstanding and agreement  their implementationand success are more likely.Armenia continues to be committed to strengtheningthe institutional capacities of the Organization. Wesupport the United Nations reform processes and areready to contribute to them. We believe that the reformsare an opportunity to strengthen the role of the UnitedNations in solving the major issues facing our worldand to achieve both the Millennium Development Goalsand the sustainable development goals.We welcome the fact that the agenda of the sixty-seventh session  which encompasses the most pressingissues of our joint responsibility for the maintenanceof international peace and security  proposes thatthe session focus on the settlement of disputes bypeaceful means. In that context  we view the goals ofdisarmament and arms control as major elements ofglobal and regional security systems. We must alsoshoulder the responsibility to work together to countermilitaristic threats.A few days ago  on 14 September  within theframework of the United Nations  the first ever High-Level Forum on the Culture of Peace took place  callingfor tolerance and seeking to build mutual understandingand respect. Unfortunately  today  hate and intolerancecontinue to spread in some parts of the world  and wehave yet to dig into the root causes of such situations to have the courage to openly ask difficult questions asto the reasons for them  and to face sometimes painfulresponses.Regrettably  we have witnessed intolerance andhatred in our part of the world  too. Year after year Armenia has  from this rostrum  raised concernsabout the militaristic rhetoric  blatant violation ofinternational commitments and anti-Armenian hysteriabeing instilled into Azerbaijani society from thehighest levels of its leadership. Many internationalorganizations on human rights have been alerted tof lagrant cases of xenophobia  racism  intolerance andviolations of human rights in Azerbaijan  as well asabout the policy of hatred against Armenians.What has been the Azerbaijani response? It notonly ignores the expectations of the internationalcommunity  but it constantly takes new steps that goagainst the values of the civilized world. The latestsuch case is the Azeri Government’s release andglorification of the murderer Mr. Ramil Safarov  whohad slaughtered an Armenian officer in his sleep withan axe  during a NATO programme in Budapest  simplybecause he was Armenian. The Azerbaijani leadershipmade him a symbol of national pride and an examplefor young people to follow.The world’s reaction was unanimous and veryclear in condemning what was done by Baku  thecapital of Azerbaijan  in granting him clemency.Azerbaijan continues to express bewilderment at thestance of the international community. What did theyexpect — that the international community wouldapplaud the glorification of a heinous murderer? TheAzerbaijani leadership continues to pretend that theact was in accordance not only with the AzerbaijaniConstitution and legislation  but also with the normsand principles of international law and the relevantEuropean conventions. The leadership of the countryclaims that what was done was very good. It is very sadindeed that the constitution and legislation of a countrywould permit making a hero of a murderer and payingsuch a brutal criminal a salary for the years he spent inprison.The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Councilof Europe warned that “to glorify and reward such aperson f lies in the face of all accepted standards forhuman rights protection and rule of law”. The Presidentof the European Parliament and the President of theParliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europeexpressed concern about the abuse of the Europeanlegal instrument in question. The United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights said on 7 September:“ethnically motivated hate crimes of this gravity shouldbe deplored and properly punished — not publiclyglorified by leaders and politicians”.It is very clear that there are different perceptionsabout international legal principles and laws  differentperceptions in Azerbaijan and the rest of the worldabout what is good and what is bad. That is deeplyirresponsible and shameful behaviour  not only for anon-permanent member of the Security Council  butalso a Member State of the United Nations.It is clear that the international community cannottolerate the attempts of the Azerbaijani leadership to adjust international law to their own racist ideology.With a rich domestic experience in corruption  Baku isattempting to transfer that vice to inter-State relations exploiting it as a tool in order to impose its own falseperceptions on others. The international communitycannot tolerate the attempts of Azerbaijan to replacethe rule of law with the rule of oil.The scandalous situation regarding Safarovhas seriously undermined the Nagorno Karabakhnegotiation process and endangered the already fragileregional security and stability. Azerbaijan poses a threatto the security and stability in the region by constantlythreatening to use force against Nagorno Karabakhand Armenia  along with the daily unprovokedwarmongering by its leadership. It has not onlyrejected the proposals of the three co-Chair countriesof the Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe (OSCE) group on the consolidation of theceasefire agreement and on the creation of a mechanismof investigation of incidents along the line of contactbut also systematically commits ceasefire violations not only on the contact line between Nagorno Karabakhand Azerbaijan but also through provocations along theborder with Armenia and ceaseless acts of vandalismagainst the Armenian historical and cultural heritage.While Armenia and the international mediatorshave been working hard around the negotiation table Azerbaijan has increased its military budget more thantwenty-fold during the past few years  and boasts aboutit. While Armenia and the international communityhave been calling for the withdrawal of snipers from theline of contact  Azerbaijani leaders have been rejectingthose calls and have opened sniper schools for youngpeople. While Armenia has been calling for regionaleconomic cooperation  which could become a tool forincreasing confidence between the parties  Azerbaijaniauthorities have declared that  together with Turkey they will continue the blockade until there are no moreArmenians in Armenia.Armenia and the international community arespeaking in one language regarding the NagornoKarabakh issue. The documents on the settlement ofthe Nagorno Karabakh conflict adopted within theframework of the OSCE Astana Summit in 2010; theOSCE Ministerial Conferences of Helsinki in 2008 Athens in 2009  Ahnaty in 2010 and Vilnius in 2011;the statements of Presidents of the Co-Chair countrieswithin the framework of the Group of Eight Summits inl’Aquila in 2009  in Muskoka in 2010  and in Deauvillein 2011; and during the Group of 20 Summit in 2012in Los Cabos serve as proof of that. The position ofArmenia is in line with those documents  and it is inline with the position of the international community namely  to accept the settlement on that basis.Despite the intensive efforts of the three Co-Chaircountries of the OSCE  it has been impossible to reach abreakthrough  because the Azerbaijani side has rejected one after another  all of the proposals presented by themediators. Despite Azerbaijan’s destructive stance Armenia will continue to work towards the settlementof the Karabakh issue exclusively through peacefulmeans and on the basis of the purposes  principles andnorms reflected in the Charter and international law.Like many other speakers  I wish to express ourconcerns about the developments and worsening of thehumanitarian situation in Syria  which also directlyaffects the large Armenian community in that country.That community was formed mainly by the survivorsof the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire atthe beginning of the twentieth century. Today  theyare struggling for life  as are many Syrian citizens.Armenia continues to receive refugees from Syria;those refugees are full of worries about the escalationof violence in that country. It is impossible to reach adurable settlement without the cessation of hostilitiesby all parties and without an inclusive political dialoguethat takes into account the interests of all Syrians.Next year  the United Nations will mark the sixty-fifth anniversary of the Convention on the Preventionand Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Thatanniversary will become an important landmarkand occasion on which to create a more effectiveinstrument for combatting the crimes of genocide.The denial of genocide and impunity pave the wayfor the repetition of new crimes against humanity. Asdescendants of the nation that survived the horrorsof the first genocide of the twentieth century  weare convinced that the international communitymust stand together — independent of any kindof considerations — in the recognition and strongcondemnation of genocide  so as to be able to preventit from occurring. In the absence of such unanimity humankind will witness new attempts at crimes againsthumanity. Our strong conviction is that we shouldkeep the issue high on our common agenda. We shouldrecommit to a world where the crime of genocide cannever occur again.Armenia gladly assumes its share of our commonresponsibility to support the United Nations as aplatform for dialogue  multilateralism and collectiveaction in addressing the multiple challenges of today’sworld."
"8",301,"ATG",67,2012,"﻿I wish atthe outset to extend my heartiest congratulations andthe assurances of my cooperation and highest esteemto President Jeremić on his election to the presidencyof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.Antigua and Barbuda looks forward to his leadershipand guidance throughout this session.I extend congratulations also to your predecessor Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  on a job well doneand for his continued service to the internationalcommunity.The theme of the sixty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly  “Bringing about adjustment orsettlement of international disputes or situationsby peaceful means”  is judicious  for it accuratelysummarizes how we as nations need to act in theseprecarious times of insecurity and uncertainty. Thesetimes and circumstances call for a heightened sense ofurgency and a stronger will among all nations to workwith and through the United Nations in embracingmultilateralism in its truest form.The sixty-seventh session of the Assembly istaking place in an environment of continued challengesto international peace and security; internationaldemocracy is being tested; there is unbearable povertythroughout the world; the sluggish recovery of the world’s economy provides little hope; and disastersinduced by climate change are becoming more rampant.As we look around our global community  we askourselves what we can do to solve the many problemswe face  and how we can find and maintain the peacethat we so desire. Maybe if we ask ourselves not asindividuals but as nations what peace is  then  perhaps we can collectively resolve to find the answer so as toachieve peace.For Antigua and Barbuda  peace means respectfor human rights and the differences of others and theprotection of women  children and the elderly. Peace isdevoid of greed that ends in unparalleled wealth for a fewand nauseating poverty for many. Peace means globalhealth awareness  protection and accessibility for all.Peace means democracies with active global citizens by non-violent change. Peace means eliminating nuclearweapons and controlling small arms.Peace is free of violence and requires theacceptance of differences in race  gender and religion.Peace is a position from which to value the limits ofnature’s resources  and it is characterized by theabsence of the ignorance and shortsightedness thatleads some to selfishly plunder Earth’s plenty. Peace isthe understanding that climate change is real and thatsustainability should be our priority. Peace means fairtrade and equality of equity in globalization.Peace is the elimination of corruption in Government.Peace is the understanding and the recognition that theworld’s problems can be solved only by the inclusionof all countries. Peace therefore involves a wider andequal representation in the Security Council rather thanmembership by a selected few.In 2011  we celebrated the International Year forPeoples of African Descent. That year has passed and gone from the international agenda is the issueof reparations for slavery  which is central to fightingracism and racial discrimination and nurturing aculture of peace among nations. The legacy of racialviolence  segregation and slavery against peoples ofAfrican descent has severely impaired our advancementas nations  communities and individuals across thepolitical  social and  most importantly  the economicalspectrums. In the words of Kwame Nkrumah  we canno longer afford the luxury of delay. The time has comefor us to revisit the issue of reparations for slavery andplace it at the top of the international agenda.Over 200 million persons in the Americas dependon us. That is why I am reiterating a call I made inthe Hall in 2011 for former slave States to begin thereconciliation process by issuing formal apologies forthe crimes committed by the nations or their citizensover the 400 years of the African slave trade. Whilenations in the developing world continue to grapple withthe effects of a world economic crisis that is not of theirown making  I call on former slave States to back uptheir apologies with new commitments to the economicdevelopment of those nations that have suffered fromthat human tragedy.Transnational crime is threatening the veryexistence of peace in Antigua and Barbuda. Our smallsize and lack of human and financial resources makeit difficult for us  as a small island nation  to addressthat problem in an effective manner. The crime andviolence fuelled by the illicit trade in small arms andlight weapons are jeopardizing our major industries including tourism. Our health-care systems are weighteddown  and families are being torn apart. Nevertheless crime prevention and small arms control is a priorityfor my Government. It is important to note that neitherAntigua and Barbuda nor our Caribbean Communitybrothers and sisters manufacture small arms or lightweapons  yet one recent estimate indicates that thereare 1.6 million illegal firearms in the region.Additionally  Antigua and Barbuda is deeplysaddened by the fact that  despite significant efforts strong will on the part of the majority of States andthe fact that a compromise was potentially withinreach  there was no agreement on a text for the recentlydiscussed legally binding arms trade treaty. TheAssembly can rest assured that Antigua and Barbudawill not give up  and we will continue to advocate for alegally binding treaty that will eliminate the threat thatis crippling our region.Antigua and Barbuda is committed to the rule of lawand the process it enables for direct political dialogueand cooperation among all States and internationalactors. The rule of law facilitates international peaceand security  human rights and development for all. Ourjoint responses to the threats to peace and security  alongwith the opportunities arising from various political economic and social instabilities  must be guided by therule of law  as it is the basis for friendly coexistence andinterdependence between and among States.My Government upholds the ideals of the recentlyconcluded High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at theNational and International Levels and stands committedto upholding that very important principle.The Caribbean has been known as a zone of peace.We value our ability to live and work together despiteour different religious and political beliefs and ethnicbackgrounds. Antigua and Barbuda therefore condemnsthe brutal killing of the United States Ambassador toLibya and the destruction of the United States Consulatein Libya. We condemn any acts of violence or killingsdisguised as actions to defend religious belief. If we areto build an environment of peace around the world  wemust show tolerance for all peoples and beliefs.The dangers posed by non-State actors acquiringweapons of mass destruction are real and should beseen by all countries  large and small  as the single mostdestructive element threatening international peace andsecurity. Antigua and Barbuda is particularly concernedby the lack of progress in the area of disarmament andnon-proliferation. There should be no compromise onthat issue. Antigua and Barbuda remains resolute in ourcontinued call for a nuclear-weapon-free world.The recently concluded Rio+20 Conference onSustainable Development provided an internationalplatform from which to address the social  economic andenvironmental challenges affecting the internationalcommunity. Those challenges are direct threats tohumankind and oftentimes jeopardize peace andsecurity for all.In resolution 66/288  entitled “The future we want” Antigua and Barbuda saw the Rio+20 Conference assecuring comprehensive and inclusive sustainabilityfor small island nations  whose survival is contingenton an outcome of commitments and actions from theConference.At the recently concluded summit of the Allianceof Small Island States  my country joined with othersmall island States in sending a strong message tothe international community on the need for bold andambitious actions. We cannot wait for our lands todisappear before we act. We must act now to respond tothe climate crisis and ensure that not a single country issacrificed  no matter how small.The threat is real. Our sea levels are rising  there iscoral bleaching beyond our shores  and hurricanes arebecoming more recurrent and severe. The Conference of the Parties to the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change needs to take concretesteps in order to protect small island developing Statesand other exposed countries from the threats of climatechange.The responsibility to mitigate climate changeshould be at the forefront of the collective consciousnessof both developing and developed countries. However developed countries should accept their responsibilitiesas the leading contributors to the extremely highlevels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  whichare now threatening the welfare of present and futuregenerations. It is my Government’s hope that the selfishact of inaction will dissipate in Doha and that a positiveoutcome in the climate change negotiations will usherin new hopes for humanity and compassion for ourplanet.Antigua and Barbuda is doing its part to protectMother Earth. My Government has embarked on arenewable energy mandate. We are now shifting ourfocus towards harvesting water and wind to meet ourenergy needs. We are protecting our ecosystem withstrong legislation  and we are replanting mangrovesand protecting areas that are sensitive to pollutants.Climate change and sustainability are high on myGovernment’s development and investment priorities and we are ensuring that new and refurbished privateand commercial investments are in line with our greenapproach to our society.My Government also joins with member States ofthe Alliance of Small Island States in calling on theGeneral Assembly to designate 2014 as the InternationalYear of Small Island Developing States in order to raiseawareness of the special situation of our membersand mobilize international support for our sustainabledevelopment.Over the past year  the United Nations StabilizationMission in Haiti has made important progress in itssupport to the Haitian people’s efforts to consolidatedemocracy  stability and the rule of law and to moveforward on the path to social and economic development.In spite of the progress made  the situation in Haitiremains fragile  as the country strives to overcome itsdaunting political  social and economic challenges.I therefore stress the need for adequate fundingand continued implementation of the Mission in Haiti. Iwould like to reiterate my Government’s strong supportfor the Mission in Haiti and to stress that peace will only be achieved if we simultaneously address issues ofsecurity  national reconciliation and development. I alsocall on those nations that pledged assistance to Haiti tohonour their commitments. Those pledges are urgentlyneeded  now that the rebuilding phase is progressingunder a new Administration.It has been nearly fi ve years since we started to see asharp downturn in the world’s economy. Unfortunately Antigua and Barbuda is among the small and developingStates that have yet to see significant improvements.While we have made several attempts to curtail thehaemorrhaging of our fragile economies  it must besaid that we need greater cooperation  flexibilityand inclusion on the part of our developed partners.Gross domestic product can no longer be the criterionused in accessing concessionary financing and otherinternational financial relief; instead  mechanismsshould be put in place that take into consideration a hostof other elements  including the fragility of economies.We are still in a crisis  a crisis of confidence inglobal governance and the institutional capacityfor managing the international financial system international trade and international developmentpolicies. We are also living in the era of globalizationwhere cooperative collectives — and not ambitiousand selfish empires — must be the order of the day ininternational financial governance. A privileged fewshould never be allowed to make financial decisionsthat impact the socioeconomic livelihood of millionswithout regard for that excluded majority. Economicprosperity should be shared equally among countriesand within countries. The exclusive clubs of theGroup of Eight and the Group of 20 cannot repair thefragmented international financial system withouttaking due consideration of the majority of nations lefton the outside with much to offer.My Government calls on developed countriesand the countries of the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development to guarantee that theirresponse with regard to international tax matters willinvolve improved international cooperation on tax issuesthrough comprehensive and supportive frameworks thatensure the involvement and equal treatment of smalljurisdictions like Antigua and Barbuda without thenuances of inappropriately branding us as tax havens.Antigua and Barbuda has been proactive in itsapproach to diversifying our economy. We enteredinto the international gaming sector abiding by all prescribed international standards. Unfortunately our friend and developed partner  the United Statesof America  was of the view that our gaming sectorcontravened its domestic laws. Antigua and Barbudafound it appropriate to seek international redress onthe matter through the dispute resolution mechanismat the World Trade Organization. We prevailed  andthe United States was ordered to compensate Antiguaand Barbuda for its losses. Yet  years later  Antigua andBarbuda is still engaging in negotiations with the UnitedStates. I therefore call on the Government of the UnitedStates to work with us to quickly resolve the matter sothat we can arrive at a settlement that is fair and just.I also call on the United States to work cooperativelywith Antigua and Barbuda and other remote gamingjurisdictions to forge an enlightened  reasonable andreasoned way of addressing the regulation and licensingof remote gaming services.While we are on the matter of trade disputes  ithas been decades since the United States instituted itsembargo on Cuba. Time and time again the internationalcommunity  acting through the General Assembly  hascalled on the United States to lift that trade embargo.However  it continues unabated. Since its inception  theembargo has inf licted untold economic damage on theCuban people  caused shortages and needless sufferingto the Cuban population  limited and restrained thedevelopment of the country and seriously damagedthe Cuban economy. Through all of that  the Cubanpeople have managed to preserve their sovereignty independence and right to self-determination. As acountry committed to the norms of the multilateraltrading system and to the freedom of trade andnavigation and a country that rejects the extraterritorialapplication of another country’s national laws  Antiguaand Barbuda calls on the United States to immediatelyand unconditionally lift its economic embargo againstthe people of Cuba. It is time to turn a new page ofpeace  cooperation and understanding  a time for globalhealing and international community-building. Thecontinuation of the embargo further destroys the veryfabric of hope that we have created as a community ofnations in order to resolve the world’s issues.The world is changing. Economies  policies andcountries are becoming more intertwined than everbefore. Antigua and Barbuda sees those relationships ofintegration as positive steps towards achieving a worldthat is not dominated by a few but represents rather a unification of leadership in the hope of combating mostof the world’s shortcomings.The smaller developing countries in the Caribbeanand the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States(OECS) are poised to make great strides in our integrationagenda. The ratification of the OECS Economic Unionis a major step in that direction. We have a stableshared currency  with a monetary council that has beeninstrumental in preventing further deterioration of oureconomies. There have been renewed commitmentsby all of the Caribbean Community countries to worktirelessly to realize the full potential of the CaribbeanSingle Market and Economy. Antigua and Barbuda hasjoined the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of OurAmerica  an institution that is built on the principlesof solidarity  complementarity and cooperation.The Community of Latin America and CaribbeanStates — a new integration arm within our region — thegeographical position of our countries  our sharedcultures and values and our desires as developingpartners for a more just global community that is builton fairness and peace give my Government hope thatall is not lost as regards multilateralism.Antigua and Barbuda faces many challenges in theprevention  care and treatment of non-communicablediseases (NCDs). Heart disease  diabetes  cancer cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory diseasescontinue to be the leading causes of death in Antiguaand Barbuda  with cancer and heart disease being thetop two causes. The burdens of the cost  the loss ofproductivity and the disabilities as a result of chronicdiseases continue to weigh heavy on our health-caresystem  since treatment for those diseases and theircomplications  including dialysis  chemotherapyand drug therapy  continue to be offered free of costto patients. The fight against NCDs remains high therefore  on Antigua and Barbuda’s health agenda.Following our participation in the United NationsHigh-level Meeting on the subject last year  theGovernment of Antigua and Barbuda approved theestablishment of a multisectoral NCD commissionto provide leadership in that critical area  draftedlegislation for tobacco control  engaged civil societyand non-governmental organizations in drafting anNCD policy and action plan and has supported plans forthe development of a comprehensive cancer treatmentcentre in Antigua and Barbuda to serve the OECS.The Ministries of Health and Agriculture continue to collaborate in the development of a food policy that willaddress some of the risk factors for NCDs.The fight against HIV/AIDS in my region is alsoreal. The figures are heartbreaking  and the outlook istroubling. Despite some progress  much still needs tobe done to achieve the 2015 goal of universal accessto HIV prevention  treatment  support and care. MyGovernment is in the process of updating the code ofconduct to prevent discrimination in the workplaceagainst persons living with HIV/AIDS. We will nottolerate injustice  intolerance and violence of any kindagainst persons living with HIV/AIDS.Many might believe that for countries like Antiguaand Barbuda  as a small island developing State  ouronly concern is for development  but I stand here todaywith grave concern that the disregard for world peaceand security threatens the very existence of humankindand will push the international community into furtherchaos and destruction. We cannot ignore from our tinypeaceful shores the images that glare from our TVscreens of unrest  protest and demonstrations fromvarious corners of the world. The images are daunting the voices of change are deafening and the use offorce or threat of use of force to suppress the voices ofdemocracy is intolerable. The United Nations has to beunified in its response so as to act in a peaceful mannerwhile protecting the rights of populations near and far.The situation in Syria is disheartening. Children women and the elderly must be protected. I call onboth sides to exercise restraint and allow humanitarianrelief supplies to enter Syria. I also call on all nationsto cease supplying arms to the two sides in the conflict.As leaders  our priority must be to urge all parties inSyria to implement a ceasefire and stop the violenceimmediately and completely. Every effort must bemade to implement Mr. Annan’s six-point proposal andthe relevant Security Council resolutions. The UnitedNations and the Arab League must lead in that process.Any threats of war must be suppressed  and negotiationand mediation should be the order of the day. If it is notaddressed  the Syrian crisis will soon pose a seriousthreat to international peace and security. Antiguaand Barbuda will continue to give its support to a just peaceful and appropriate settlement of the Syrian crisisat an early date.These are undeniably perilous times. An event canoccur in a distant part of the globe that can severelyimpact Antigua and Barbuda domestically  an event that completely ignores the importance of achievingtolerance by peaceful means. Our response may beone of indignation but also a sense that we live in aperilous atmosphere characterized by the intolerance ofpeace. The multiplicity and interconnectedness of themany global threats and challenges we face will test theabilities of this Assembly. Is the United Nations up tothe task?I am confident that by sharing our collective wisdomand using it as a resource  the General Assembly at itssixty-seventh session will take decisions of meaningfuland enduring benefit and peace for the peoples of theworld. I am equally confident that our deliberationscan lead to solutions that will ensure the protection ofall our peoples. I therefore call on all of us  as worldleaders  to rise to the challenges and move with haste to bring peace to the citizens of the world. We are leadersand caretakers of humankind and  as such  our responseto those challenges will be recorded in the books ofhistory  which will reveal whether we had the ability toact with constraint  effectiveness and fairness in orderto achieve stability through peaceful means. Let peacereign."
"9",348,"AUS",67,2012,"﻿You now preside  Sir  overa forum for every voice — an Assembly of all people andnations  one for no country or bloc to dominate solelyor lead as one alone  where small and medium-sizedcountries are truly heard. Australia warmly welcomesyour election.The story of the United Nations is truly global encompassing all the people of the world. It is a story ofthe progress of small and medium-sized countries  notjust of great Powers. It is a story of reconstruction afterworld war and of the resettlement of massing millions of navigating the winds of change and of the end ofcolonialism  bringing self-determination to the world’sgreat majority  the billions of the global South. It isthe story of harnessing new sources of wealth and new resources through a revolution of rising expectationsand during decades of dictatorship  famine and war. Itis the story of bringing to justice the perpetrators ofthe worst international crimes and of preventing theworst human atrocities. Now  extending freedom andharnessing new markets  it is the story of lifting billionsmore out of poverty and oppression. That has been thework of the United Nations for seven decades.This year we assemble in the knowledge born ofthose years  neither expecting perfection nor acceptingthe status quo. We understanding that there is much thatwe can do together  and more that we can do togetherthan we could ever do alone.The United Nations articulates humankind’shighest ideals. Even more  it makes practical progresstowards realizing those ideals in the world. Thereis no better example of that than the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) — specific  measurabletargets of the highest human importance that are nowfamiliar to us all. Twelve years after 2000 and threeyears from 2015  the progress we have made mustbe just as familiar. The global economy has grown.Hundreds of millions of people have lifted themselvesup. That first fundamental Goal  to halve the proportionof the world’s population living in extreme poverty  hasnow been achieved: 1 billion human lives transformed.A decade ago 100 million children did not get to goto school. That number has been reduced by fully onethird  and 33 million human futures have been entirelyremade.But we must all acknowledge that there are vitalareas where the international community is failing toachieve change. That is why I accepted the Secretary-General’s invitation to co-chair the MillenniumDevelopment Goals Advocacy Group alongsideRwanda: to advocate for practical progress in thecoming three years. Where the world has fallen shortof ambitious goals  our response must be action  notdisillusion. That is what Australia will do. We will act.We will help improve education. Australia’sdevelopment spending on education doubled in thepast five years. We will be among the world’s largesteducation donors in 2015. I am especially pleased to joinas an education champion in support of the Secretary-General’s Education First initiative to mobilize globalsupport to help achieve education for all children by2015. I am honoured to lend it Australia’s support.We will help increase gender equality. I am proudto announce that at the Pacific Islands Forum Australiasaid that it would work alongside our partners in thePacific on an unprecedented gender initiative: PacificWomen Shaping Pacific Development. Australia willprovide $320 million over 10 years to support women’spolitical participation  to expand women’s leadershipand to spread economic and social opportunities inthe Pacific. That is a principle underpinning everyAustralian aid intervention and initiative: empoweringwomen and girls.We will help fight drug-resistant malaria. TheSecretary-General has made malaria one of his keypriorities for his second term. It is a priority we share.Since 2000  the world has cut the number of deathsfrom malaria by 26 per cent. Without those advances 330 000 more people would have died of malaria lastyear  the great majority of them in Africa. But malariaitself is fighting back. New drug resistance in malariamust be overcome. Later this year  Australia will holdthe Malaria 2012 meeting  bringing together politicalleaders  civil society and the private sector to accelerateefforts to control and eliminate malaria and combatgrowing drug resistance.While we are working hard to realize the MDGs inthe next three years  Australia is looking further ahead.The year 2015 is a goal  but it is not a destination. Rather it must be a new point of departure for much new work.Australia pledges to contribute to the important workof the high-level panel on the post-2015 developmentagenda.Australia brings considerable national experiencein working with conflict-affected States and leastdeveloped countries  especially in our own region. Wewill seek to apply what we have learned in our work since2000 to the world’s plans for beyond 2015. First  peaceis an essential foundation to development  and buildingpeace is vital to the progress of societies recovering fromconflict. Peacekeepers today must be peacebuilders not just stopping conflict but enabling development.Secondly  there can be no poverty alleviation withoutthe creation of wealth and jobs. Growth alone is neversufficient; but to achieve development in the interestsof all people we must create jobs and wealth. Thirdly we cannot make poverty history unless we also consignto history the argument that environmental protectionand human development are conflicting global goals.Climate change threatens the security of the food supply that guarantees development. New  clean sources ofenergy deliver a new source of economic growth.Australia is one of the world’s most successfulmulticultural and multi-faith nations. The Australianexperience proves a deeply important fact. There isnothing natural or inevitable about violent conflict overreligious belief. We must reaffirm that again today.The denigration of religious beliefs is never acceptable.Australia seeks to be an example of freedom for allfaiths  and we support that in the wider world. However our tolerance must never extend to tolerating religioushatred and incitement to violence. Whether suchattitudes lead to attacks against members of religiousminorities or diplomats or to attacks against houses ofworship or diplomatic missions  the perpetrators of allsuch violence must be brought to justice and all suchincitement must be condemned. Australia condemnsviolence and we work for peace.We proudly do our full part in the work of theUnited Nations for peace and security. We stringentlyobserve Security Council resolutions aimed atcurtailing weapons proliferation activities  like thoseof North Korea. We take the leading role in the UnitedNations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste. We leadthe Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands which operates with the United Nation’s endorsement.And we have been the largest non-NATO contributorto the United Nations-mandated International SecurityAssistance Force in Afghanistan. Australia will bringthat record of service to the international communityto our service on the Security Council  should wehave the privilege to be elected by the United Nationsmembership in October. There and beyond  our workand the work of every nation for peace must continue.As we meet  the Syrian Government is turningthe instruments of State power against the very peoplewhom State power ought to protect  employing heavyweapons and ground-attack aircraft against civiliansand engaging in systematic human rights abuses.Syria’s neighbours — in particular Jordan  Turkey Lebanon and Iraq — are burdened by growing numbersof refugees and are delivering vital help to desperatepeople.The United Nations has done important workalready. Australia is doing its part to help throughhumanitarian aid. We must do everything we can to endthe suffering of the Syrian people and to rebuild Syriansociety. Those who are committing crimes against humanity must be held accountable. The internationalcommunity must unite behind Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi the Joint Special Representative of the United Nationsand the League of Arab States for Syria. We urge themembers of the Security Council to do so and to actdecisively.The international community must also unite inguarding against the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. It is now six years since the SecurityCouncil first expressed concern about Iran’s nuclearweapons programme. Iran still refuses to take the urgentsteps necessary to build confidence that its nuclearprogramme is exclusively peaceful. In contraventionof successive International Atomic Energy Agency andSecurity Council resolutions  Iran is moving closer tohaving the capacity to produce weapons-grade material.We therefore stand with the world  united insending a strong signal  through Security Councilsanctions  that Iran must change its behaviour now. Anuclear-armed Iran would be a major threat to regionaland global security  especially given the shocking andaggressive statements about Israel by Iran’s leadership.There remains the opportunity for diplomacy  backedup by robust sanctions  to persuade Iran to change itscourse. Iran must take this opportunity for change  andthe nations of the Assembly must press it to do so.There must also be change in the Middle East peaceprocess. Australia shares the frustration of the partiesat the current impasse.We understand the strong desire of the Palestinianpeople for national self-determination. Australiais resolutely committed to the establishment of aPalestinian State that is both independent and viable.That is why we provide significant support to thefoundations of a future Palestinian State and build itsinfrastructure and economy. More than $300 million inaid has been provided for the period from 2011 to 2016.We commend the genuine progress President Abbasand Prime Minister Fayyad have made in buildingthe institutions and infrastructure for statehood. Andno one can doubt Australia’s close and continuingfriendship with Israel. Our support for the right ofIsrael and its people to exist in security and peace is a historic commitment in Australian policy  and it willendure.We urge a return to direct negotiations and thatthose negotiations be between the two parties. That isthe only durable basis for achieving a two-State solution.The present impasse must be overcome. Both sidesneed to make compromises and avoid provocations. Itwill take sacrifice on both sides to settle complex anddifficult issues such as settlements  borders  securityand Jerusalem. The Israeli and Palestinian peopledeserve no less.Australia’s ideals in the world are those of theUnited Nations  and Australians know the practicalvalue of the United Nations work. That is why Australiaseeks to serve in all the work of the United Nations andon the Security Council. We are a strong democracy welcoming all the peoples  languages and religionsof the world. We are a country of the Asia-Pacific  aneighbour to developing countries  with a perspectiveof both the North and South. We are a State with adecades-long tradition of capable and committed workin the United Nations. We contributed to the firstUnited Nations peacekeeping force in 1947  and we leadcontemporary peacebuilding in our own region.We support the development of new norms toenable the United Nations and its States Members toact to prevent atrocities and to make the perpetrators ofthe worst crimes accountable for them. We act as a firstresponder to humanitarian need  as a donor who staysthe course and as a partner in rebuilding after conflict.Australia embraces the high ideals of the United Nationsand takes a practical approach to achieving change. Thework of the United Nations is a historic task in whichAustralia wholeheartedly joins."
"10",395,"AUT",67,2012,"The events of recentmonths have illustrated once again the importanceof the United Nations as a multilateral forum foraddressing today’s crises and challenges. The conflictsin Syria and Mali and the ongoing reform processes inmany parts of the Arab world demonstrate that we canface such challenges only through concerted action.In Syria  thousands have lost their lives in theirstruggle for freedom and reform owing to crimescommitted by a regime that denies them every basichuman right in order to stay in power. Austria condemnsthe systematic human rights violations and bloodshedin Syria in the strongest possible terms. The more than27 000 victims and some 2.5 million people in direneed of humanitarian assistance are a stark reminderfor each and every one of us that it is high time for theUnited Nations to finally act. The Security Council  inparticular  must assume its responsibilities in relationto the ever-worsening situation in the country. Violencehas to stop immediately  and both sides have to engagein a meaningful dialogue facilitated by Joint SpecialRepresentative Lakhdar Brahimi. There will be nosolution unless President Al-Assad steps aside andgives way to the forces of reason and reconciliation.Austria continues to fully support the ongoingtransition processes in the Arab world. We welcomethe efforts undertaken so far to lay the foundationsfor more open  inclusive and prosperous societies. Weencourage the newly empowered authorities to fulfiltheir mandate for democratic change responsibly. Theaspirations of the people for dignity and freedom mustbe satisfied  thereby contributing to peace and stabilityin the region.In that context  let me reiterate my strongestcondemnation of the recent attacks on diplomaticmissions and personnel  especially the murder ofAmbassador Chris Stevens and three of his colleaguesin Benghazi. Violence is never an acceptable responseto the exercise of the fundamental right of freedom ofspeech. To attack an Embassy and its personnel is notonly contrary to international law but an attack on thevery ideals that the United Nations stands for  namely the peaceful cooperation of Member States to build abetter future together.The still unresolved Israeli-Palestinian conflictcontinues to gravely destabilize the MiddleEast. The terms of a negotiated and sustainablesolution — two States with secure and mutuallyrecognized borders — have been discussed over andover again and are broadly supported by the people and the international community  and yet we experienced acomplete lack of progress in the last year. We thereforecall on the leadership on both sides to finally assumetheir responsibilities and enable a lasting peace andsecurity to be established for their children and futuregenerations.The situation in Mali also continues to be amatter of grave concern. Austria has been dismayedby the political turmoil  with its disastrous effects onthe Malian population. Growing insecurity and thecontinued deterioration of the humanitarian and humanrights situation call for concerted action. The high-levelmeeting held on Wednesday was an important signalthat we are moving in that direction. We fully supportthe efforts by the Economic Community of WestAfrican States and the African Union to try to find together with the United Nations  a lasting politicalsolution to the crisis in Mali and the Sahel region asa whole. Austria will advocate for increased supportfrom the European Union to contribute to that end.In the light of the crises and challenges theinternational community is facing  Austria welcomesPresident Jeremić’s timely choice of theme to highlightthe peaceful settlement of disputes in this year’sgeneral debate. Prevention is always better — andcheaper — than a cure. The progress made in SierraLeone  Kyrgyzstan  Nepal and Myanmar testifies howsuccessful sustainable mediation efforts can be.The peaceful settlement of disputes can be achievedonly through open dialogue  based on mutual respect.Austria has a long-standing tradition of promotingintercultural and interreligious dialogue. We are proudto host the fifth Global Forum of the United NationsAlliance of Civilizations in Vienna. It will take place on27 and 28 February 2013  under the title “ResponsibleLeadership in Diversity and Dialogue”. Austria highlyvalues the contribution of youth as a transformativeforce. Therefore  the day before the Global Forum willbe dedicated to the Alliance of Civilizations youthevent in order to benefit from their views.In that context  I am also pleased to inform thatthe King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz International Centrefor lnterreligious and Intercultural Dialogue will beinaugurated on 26 November in Vienna. The Centre a joint initiative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Austria will certainly offer a significant contribution to thepromotion of dialogue.We need to be clear that sustainable peace anddevelopment go hand in hand with respect for humanrights  democracy and the rule of law. These are universalvalues that no human being should be denied. We mustnot falter until this goal is achieved. In 2011  Austriawas elected to the Human Rights Council. We fullysupport the Council and its mechanisms  especially theuniversal periodic review. The Council is best placedto react swiftly in case of human rights emergencies.Its special sessions on Syria and Libya illustrated thatthe international community will not turn a blind eyeon gross human rights violations and indiscriminateattacks against the civilian population. Human rightsabuses must not go unpunished. Violations must bethoroughly investigated and perpetrators must beheld accountable before credible judicial institutions including the International Criminal Court.Our membership of the Human Rights Councilis an opportunity to continue working on the keypriorities that Austria pursued during its SecurityCouncil membership in 2009 and 2010: the protection ofcivilians  the safety of journalists  the implementationof resolution 1325 (2000) on women  peace and security the freedom of religion and belief  and the protection ofchildren from violence and abuse.The High-level Meeting of 24 September was animportant opportunity to renew our commitment tothe rule of law at the national and international levels.It now needs an adequate follow-up. As chair of theGroup of Friends of the Rule of Law  Austria willprovide concrete proposals for the upcoming report ofthe Secretary-General.The various United Nations headquarters in Viennaare a hub for promoting peace and security. The workof the International Atomic Energy Agency is morerelevant than ever. I am pleased that we can now alsodraw on additional services from the new office of theOffice for Disarmament Affairs established in Vienna.Austria is deeply concerned about programmesfor weapons of mass destruction and proliferationactivities in several regions of the world. The creationof a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons ofmass destruction in the Middle East is more urgent thanever. In that respect  let me underline that Iran mustfinally give credible evidence for the peaceful nature ofits nuclear programmeme and engage in earnest in thetalks with the European Union three plus one group.The continued inability to even initiate substantive  multilateral disarmament negotiations is unacceptable.Austria is committed to working with other interestedStates to move forward on that crucial issue. I wouldlike to thank the Secretary-General for his continuedsupport in that matter.We need to move beyond a strictly military securityapproach that originates from the Cold War period. Itis time to change the discourse on nuclear weapons.Any use of nuclear weapons would be devastating forthe whole world in its humanitarian and environmentaleffects. In the twenty-first century  such an existentialthreat to humankind can no longer be handledexclusively by a few States as a national security matter.Austria is committed to strengthening and furtherdeveloping international law and a humanitarianapproach to advance the global disarmament andnon-proliferation agenda. A lot has been achieved inthe past two decades  as evidenced by the successfulconclusions of the conventions to ban anti-personnelmines and cluster munitions. We hope that similarprogress can be achieved on the arms trade treaty in thecoming months. Other Member States should join theemerging consensus on regulating the trade in arms ina comprehensive manner.Vienna and its United Nations headquarters alsoserve as a platform for the discussion on sustainabledevelopment. We welcome the decision of the Secretary-General to establish an implementation office for hisSustainable Energy for All initiative. That will helpto advance this important agenda. Universal access toenergy and the improvement of energy efficiency  alongwith a higher share of renewable energy  are goals thatwill help bring electricity to the billion and a half peopleworldwide lacking access. Equally  it will help controlgreenhouse gas emissions and global warming  whichthreaten the very existence of many Member States.This year’s United Nations Conference onSustainable Development marked the beginning of anew era  renewing the prospects for future generationsvia the sustainable development goals  as tailored tothe needs of different countries or groups of Statesand regions. While implementing those new globalgoals  we should not cease our efforts to achieve theMillennium Development Goals by the target date of2015.Austria remains fully committed to an effectivemultilateral system. Therefore we will support theefforts of the President of the Assembly and of theSecretary-General to further increase the effectivenessof our Organization in order to better enable us to facethe challenges of our time."
"11",420,"AZE",67,2012,"﻿At the outset  Iwould like to congratulate my good friend  Mr. VukJeremić  on his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session  and to wish himevery success in fulfilling his highly responsible duties.We are also grateful to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasserfor presiding ably over the sixty-sixth session.This is the fi rst general debate that I have addressedsince Azerbaijan was elected to a non-permanent seaton the Security Council  and I would like to expressour sincere gratitude and profound appreciation to the Governments of States Members of the United Nationsfor their valuable support for our candidacy and fortheir solidarity with Azerbaijan during 17 rounds ofelections.The theme of the this year’s general debate “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of internationaldisputes or situations by peaceful means”  is timelyand topical. It also represents a logical continuation ofdiscussions we had during the previous session. Indeed the peaceful settlement of disputes is one of the keyand core principles of international law enshrined inthe United Nations Charter. Its true value is to be ableto commit States to respecting one another’s territorialintegrity and political independence  refraining intheir international relations from the threat or use offorce and resolving their disputes in conformity withinternational law.At its sixty-fi fth and sixty-sixth sessions  the GeneralAssembly adopted two resolutions on strengthening therole of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes conflict prevention and resolution (resolutions 65/283and 66/291)  and the Secretary-General submitteda report on the subject that contains a Guidance forEffective Mediation (A/66/811  annex I). As a sponsorof those resolutions  Azerbaijan considers the processbegun by their adoption to be an essential efforttowards reinforcing the promotion of mediation in thepeaceful settlement of disputes  conflict preventionand resolution  as well as providing useful guidance toexisting and future mediation mechanisms. A crucialfactor is that those resolutions  and the Guidance forEffective Mediation developed by the Secretary-General  reaffirmed the key importance of the UnitedNations Charter and of international law and justice in particular the commitment to respect and upholdthe sovereignty  territorial integrity and politicalindependence of States.During Azerbaijan’s presidency of the SecurityCouncil this past May  we organized an Arria-formulameeting of the Council to encourage a frank exchangeof views  within a flexible procedural framework  onthe role of mediation  judicial settlement and justice inpromoting durable peace and reconciliation based oninternational law. We look forward to further initiativeson the topic in the General Assembly and the SecurityCouncil with a view to contributing to the developmentand implementation of comprehensive peace strategieswithin specific frameworks that provide that dispute settlement and conflict resolution must be based onrespect for the rule of law and for justice.The world continues to face persistent  grave andsystematic violations of the fundamental norms andprinciples of international law. There are still instanceswhere archaic patterns of the use of force against theterritorial integrity and political independence ofStates are used to achieve territorial gains. Hundredsof thousands of people throughout the world continueto suffer from aggression  military occupation  ethniccleansing and a prevailing culture of impunity for themost serious crimes of concern to the internationalcommunity.The ongoing armed conflict between Armeniaand Azerbaijan continues to represent a serious threatand challenge to international and regional peace andsecurity. The conflict has led to the occupation ofalmost 20 per cent of the territory of Azerbaijan andhas turned more than one million people in the countryinto internally displaced persons or refugees. The warhas also led to the deaths and wounding of thousandsof Azerbaijanis  including women  the elderly andchildren. In addition  the aggression against Azerbaijanhas severely damaged the country in socioeconomicterms. Not a single Azerbaijani historic or culturalmonument has been left undamaged  and no sacredsite has escaped desecration in either the occupiedterritories or in Armenia.We sincerely believe that there is no alternativeto peace  stability and mutually beneficial regionalcooperation. As a country suffering from the occupationof its territories and the forcible displacement ofhundreds of thousands of its citizens  Azerbaijan is themost interested party in the earliest possible negotiatedsettlement of the conflict. Without prejudice to its rightsunder the United Nations Charter  in particular thoseset forth in Article 51  Azerbaijan embarked on andremains committed to the conflict settlement process confident that it will lead to the end of the illegalArmenian occupation  ensure the return of forciblydisplaced people to their homes and guarantee thepeaceful coexistence of the Armenian and Azerbaijanicommunities in the Nagorno Karabakh region withinthe Republic of Azerbaijan.Attempts by the Armenian side to misinterpretthe norms and principles of international law andits insistence on unrealistic annexationist claims which Azerbaijan will never accept  speak to the realintentions of Armenia’s leadership and represent anopen challenge to the conflict settlement process  aswell as a serious threat to international and regionalpeace and security. In f lagrant violation of the UnitedNations Charter  Armenia continues to use force tomaintain its occupation of the Nagorno Karabakhregion and seven other districts of Azerbaijan  as wellas to prevent internally displaced Azerbaijani personsfrom returning to their homes. It is attempting to alterthe demographic balance in the occupied territoriesand to remove any signs of their Azerbaijani culturaland historical roots. Additionally  regular ceasefireviolations and deliberate attacks by the armed forces ofArmenia against the inhabitants of towns and villages inAzerbaijan along the front line and the border betweenthe two States have become more frequent and violentin recent times  resulting in the killing and injuring ofmany Azerbaijani civilians.We have no doubt that the Azerbaijani andArmenian communities of Nagorno Karabakh willone day live side by side in peace and dignity in thatregion of Azerbaijan. It is therefore essential and vitalto continue efforts for peace and coexistence betweenthe two communities. Azerbaijan considers that animportant part of the whole reconciliation processand has therefore accepted invitations from a numberof European non-governmental organizations to holdintercommunal meetings. However  those proposalshave so far been blocked by the authorities in Yerevan.Moreover  the aggressive rhetoric of Armenia’sleadership and its blatant promotion of odious ideas ofracial superiority  ethnic and religious incompatibilityand hatred towards Azerbaijan and other neighbouringnations only deepen mistrust and make more elusivethe prospect of a speedy negotiated settlement.The situation is further complicated by Armenia’sirresponsible and unacceptable behaviour in the highlysensitive domain of justice and reconciliation. Theperpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity including acts of genocide against the Azerbaijanipeople  not only remain unpunished in Armenia butare even promoted  venerated and officially rewardedwith the title of hero. Schools  universities and streetsare named after them and monuments are erected intheir honour. War criminals who proudly avow theirrole in the mass killing of Azerbaijani civilians arereincarnated as highly placed politicians  militarycommanders and public figures.Armenia must finally realize that the irresponsibleand provocative policy of territorial claims  animosityand hatred towards neighbouring countries and nationsbased on historical  cultural  racial and religiousprejudices has no chance of success. The earlier itgrasps that fact  the sooner our countries will be able toreach mutual understanding and enjoy peace  stabilityand cooperation.It is clear that both the conflict-settlement processand its outcome must be consistent with internationallaw. The achievement of peace  security  stability andconfidence therefore depends first and foremost on theremoval of the consequences of Armenia’s illegal useof force. That will ensure that the occupation of theterritories of Azerbaijan is at an end and that the rightof internally displaced Azerbaijani persons to return totheir homes and recover their property and possessionswill be implemented. That is what internationallaw and the relevant Security Council and GeneralAssembly resolutions require  which means that thiscondition cannot be subject to compromise or used asa bargaining chip in the conflict settlement process.Armenia’s implementation of its obligation to withdrawits armed forces from the territory of Azerbaijan andto resolve outstanding issues of State responsibility foracts deemed wrongful under international law cannotbe made contingent on addressing the aggressor’sunlawful and unacceptable claims.The fact that the situation has remained unresolvedfor so long does not speak well for the strength andefficiency of the international organizations that aredeaing with the issue. It is obvious that the primaryrole in the resolution of the conflict lies with theStates concerned. At the same time  when it comes toprinciples  it is everyone’s duty to defend them. In thatregard  Azerbaijan highly appreciates the principledstance of Member States  as expressed in variousforums  including the most recent summits of NATO the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and theNon-Aligned Movement  on issues of vital importanceto our country and pertaining to its sovereignty andterritorial integrity. We count on the continued resolveof the international community to defend the purposesand principles of the United Nations Charter  and on itsstrong solidarity with the just position of Azerbaijan.We would like to express our concern over thesituation with regard to the Middle East peace process which has been at a standstill with no substantiveprogress towards the resumption of direct talks between the parties. We call upon the parties tocreate the conditions conducive to the resumption ofnegotiations. In that regard  we share the concerns ofthe international community over settlement activityin the occupied Palestinian territories  which placesa tremendous burden on civilians  seriously obstructsthe peace process and  what is even more dangerous threatens the two-State solution and the emergence ofa viable Palestinian State. We reiterate our support forPalestine’s application for admission to membership inthe United Nations and look forward to a solution tothat issuebased on international law.Azerbaijan also remains deeply concernedabout the escalation of violence and the worseningsocioeconomic and humanitarian situation in Syria. Webelieve that the solution to the crisis lies in the handsof the Syrian people and in their desire for mutualreconciliation and an all-inclusive political process. Wewelcome the appointment of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi asthe Joint Special Representative of the United Nationsand the League of Arab States for Syria  and expressour firm support for his efforts.We must once again express our deep concernover the recent escalation provoked by the blasphemyagainst Islam. We strongly condemn all assaults againstreligions. At the same time  attacks on civilians  inparticular on diplomatic personnel  are unjustifiableunder any circumstances. It is critical to foster globaldialogue and cooperation to promote tolerance  peaceand better understanding across countries  cultures andcivilizations.We are confident that during the sixty-seventhsession of the General Assembly  Member States willbe able to take successful steps towards a strongerand more effective United Nations. With its activeparticipation in the work of the organs of the UnitedNations  most notably the General Assembly andSecurity Council  Azerbaijan will continue to be in theforefront of international efforts to that end."
"12",466,"BDI",67,2012,"﻿Itis a great pleasure for me to address the representativeshere today and to express my congratulations to Mr. VukJeremić on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session  and to his cabinetas well. I also thank his predecessor  Ambassador NassirAbdulaziz Al-Nasser  for his excellent work duringhis presidency. In addition  I extend my appreciationto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his work forthe good and well-being of Member States and theirpeoples.It is an honour and a pleasure for me to speak fromthis rostrum about current issues of great importanceto my country and the world. It is a pleasure especiallybecause Burundi is right now at a decisive and historicturning point. What I have to say Pierre Nkurunziza President of the Republic of Burundi  also spoke of lastyear at the Assembly’s sixty-sixth session. A major turnof events has placed a special stamp on our country’shistory since independence. Democratically electedinstitutions now serve out the terms entrusted to themby the people in peace  and then  at the end of theirtenure  give way to others  also democratically elected.Over two years ago  in 2010  Burundi organizeddemocratic elections for the second time since2005  from which were born our current republicaninstitutions  which operate with legitimacy in a restoredclimate of peace and security. That development gives usgreat satisfaction  and the Burundian people have everyreason to be proud of it. Indeed  whereas my countryfaced crises on multiple fronts  under which the peoplesuffered economic depletion  social degradation andpolitical discord  seriously demoralizing them  thosesame people are now steadily getting back on their feetand rediscovering hope as they look to the future. Thatpositive trend demonstrates conclusively a completebreak with the spirals of violence and instability thathave for decades been our ongoing lot.Thanks to the collective efforts  strength and spiritof the Burundian people  as well as to the support of ourpartners  I can confirm here and now that the policiesbegun in 2005 and carried on after 2010 have producedmost encouraging results in many areas. As I said earlier in the political sphere our country has held democraticelections twice in the recent past  in 2005 and 2010. Wehave established democratic institutions — the executivebranch  the National Assembly and the Senate — allof which are representative of the various elementsof Burundi’s population  in conformity with theethnic and gender balances agreed to in the ArushaPeace and Reconciliation Agreement  which havebeen incorporated into the Constitution governingBurundians today. I take pleasure in pointing out thatour Senate’s composition shows a gender parity suchthat out of all senates worldwide Burundi’s placessecond in women’s representation. That is clearly asignificant and bold step forward  because  rather thansettle for the minimum set out in the Constitution  ourGovernment voluntarily made the deliberate choice togo further  to ensure that the female majority in thepopulation is represented meaningfully in the country’sinstitutions.In its determined drive towards change  theGovernment subsequently established an independent national commission on human rights and anombudsman’s office. It initiated a zero-tolerance policydesigned to eradicate corruption and misuse of publicfunds  a scourge that has ravaged Burundian societyfor several years  and also set up adequate enforcementmechanisms. We still have a way to go  as is the casein many other countries  but the structures to get thereare firmly in place. In October 2011 the Governmentadopted a national good governance and anti-corruptionstrategy for 2011-2015. Also  Government officials including those at high levels  have signed performancecontracts  laying the groundwork for a culture ofaccountability  which is essential to democraticsystems. The members of the Administration andhigh-level officials are periodically evaluated based onthose contracts. If they live up to agreed performancestandards they are retained  but otherwise they arereplaced.The Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreementcalls for transitional justice mechanisms. We areworking towards a transitional justice systemthat carefully and rigorously balances nationalreconciliation requirements and those of justice. Weneed a mechanism that banishes the demons of thepast and at the same time affords no opportunity forany type of vengeance or the settling of old scores; inother words  a mechanism to establish the truth andto ensure that there is no recurrence of the acts inquestion. National consultations were held in 2009  andthe related report has been made public. A technicalcommittee was established with a mandate to pave theway for a truth and reconciliation commission. Thatcommittee proposed a methodology in its final report which was submitted through the proper channels inOctober 2011. The Government had hoped to establishthe commission in January 2012  but that decision hadto be postponed for technical reasons owing to the factthat further consultations were required  along withspecific proposals on the commission’s mandate andcomposition  the selection criteria for its members andmatters related to its operating budget.Besides those achievements in the political sphere the Government undertook a vast social constructionproject that yielded positive results. Measuresproviding free education for children of primary schoolage enabled millions of little Burundians to attendschool  while free medical care for pregnant women nursing mothers and children under five years of agesignificantly improved maternal and child health careand will help us to reach the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs) in that regard in the near future. Also with the participation of the population in communallabour  2 024 schools  80 health centres and more than2 000 potable-water wells were built in just three years.With respect to socioeconomic development Burundi is continuing to improve its basic economicinfrastructure  including the management of publicfinances  an improved business climate and goodgovernance. In addition  significant progress has beenmade with respect to the gradual and orderly returnof displaced persons and the repatriation of refugees.All those efforts have taken place within the StrategicFramework for Growth and Poverty Reduction  Vision2025 and the MDGs. Of the total of 800 000 countedin the census of 2000-2001  all have returned to ourcountry with the exception of 37 000 from the Mtabilacamp  who are expected to return by 31 December. Manyinternally displaced persons have already returned totheir homes. We have just finished a profiling surveyof those who remain on site  which  in the light of theirexpressed wishes  will determine the most appropriateand humane resolution of their situation.The social and economic reintegration of formercombatants has yet to be completed and represents agenuine security risk. While it is true that there havebeen a few isolated instances of insecurity here andthere in the country  that is not unique to Burundi.Banditry  which has taken place on a small scale inBurundi  also occurs elsewhere  in many countries.The Government is determined to stamp out all formsof criminality  including armed robbery. It considerssecurity the sine qua non of all social and economicprogress  which is why it has embarked on reforms inthat regard. The professionalization of the defence andsecurity forces and of the justice system to guaranteethe rights of both citizens and foreigners on our soil areamong the measures that the Government has writteninto its programme and will continue to promote as thecountry moves forward.In the area of regional integration  anintragovernmental committee has been established todevelop a national strategy for regional integration  withthe goal of enabling Burundi to take best advantage ofits participation in subregional entities and reducing thedeficits and disadvantages that stem from belonging tonon-regional organizations.The Strategic Framework for Growth and PovertyReduction has reached an advanced stage. The Government and the Вurundi configuration of thePeacebuilding Commission have made visible progressin a number of areas  as indicated in the outcome of thefifth review of the Peacebuilding Commission  issuedon 26 April 2011. Positive results were noted in the areasof political and institutional peacebuilding issues  goodgovernance  human rights  economic issues  vulnerablegroups and regional integration  as described earlier.After this brief survey of the internal situation ofmy country  I now turn to Burundi’s role and positionregarding certain international matters. With respectto Burundi’s participation in peacekeeping operations I would like to say that Burundi was one of the twocountries to take part in the African Union Mission inSomalia  and that it is pleased with the work accomplishedby its soldiers in that context. As the Secretary-Generalhas already done  my country commends the adoption in August  of the provisional Constitution of Somaliaby the National Constituent Assembly in Mogadishu.It congratulates and encourages the Somali delegatesand leaders with respect to the new developments underway  aimed at normalizing that country’s situation  andto their commitment to ending the transition period andestablishing new political institutions that representall Somalis. Burundi stands ready to share with theSomalis our experience on the question of nationalreconciliation and in training a national republicanarmy.With respect to the security situation in theeastern part of the Democratic Republic of theCongo  Burundi  along with the other members of theInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region confirms its strong commitment to the terms of thepact of 15 December 2006 and to its related protocolsguaranteeing security  stability and development. Weare also a signatory to the declarations agreed by theheads of State and Government of the member Statesof that organization in Addis Ababa on 15 July  and inKampala on 7 and 8 August and 7 and 8 September.Along with the other countries of the region  Burundiremains determined to seek solutions to that conflictthrough existing regional arrangements and inaccordance with decisions already taken by thecountries of the subregion within the framework of theInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region.The Assembly will have noted in the course of mystatement that the Government of Burundi has madeundeniable progress. Still  major challenges remain  not least of them the maintenance of economic growth.Despite the unfavourable international financial andeconomic context  Burundi  with the support of itspartners  must keep its head above water. It must increaseits economic growth with the aim of implementingits economic and social development projects. Itgoes without saying that lack of growth  along withpoverty  means fewer schools  fewer hospitals andless progress in the areas of energy and transportationinfrastructure — in short  less development for thecountry and its people. No leader worthy of the titlewould bequeath such a disastrous economic situation tofuture generations.That is why  despite the troubling internationaleconomic outlook  guidance and support are morethan ever necessary for economies as weak as ours inBurundi. However sustainable it may be at the nationallevel  our economy is still very much dependent onthe global economy. I remain convinced that  with thewill  commitment and vigour of the people of Burundi supported by our friends  the scale of our political andsocioeconomic gains will continue to expand. For itspart  the Government will spare no effort to harness coordinate and collaborate with the efforts of all partiesto fight hand in hand for people’s well-being andprosperity  in Burundi and around the world.I would like to conclude by welcoming the actionstaken by the United Nations  which over the 67 years ofits existence has moved the world forward at an everacceleratingpace. I would also like to see the institutionalchanges envisaged for the Organization take theinterests of all Member States into consideration  withall stakeholders taking part in the reform and updatingof the system..Finally  I wish the President of the GeneralAssembly every success throughout his term of office.Long live international cooperation! Long live theUnited Nations! Long live Burundi!"
"13",513,"BEL",67,2012,"﻿First ofall  on behalf of my country  I would like to welcomethe broad vision and the pertinence of the ideas putforward by the Secretary-General.I come from Belgium  one of the six foundingcountries of the European Union (EU)  a multiculturalunion of 500 million people who  as President Obamahas reminded us  live in peace — something that I wishfor the entire world — after experiencing horrifyingwars.Belgium provides a unique setting for politicaldecisions and international meetings. Brussels isthe capital of Europe and also the seat of NATOheadquarters. We are naturally open to the world. Imyself come from the city of Mons  which will be theEuropean cultural capital in 2015. In 2014  Belgiumwill solemnly commemorate the centennial of thestart of the sad and painful First World War. We willdo so in memory of the young people from more than50 countries who  on our territory  defended the idealsof peace and freedom. In 2013  Antwerp will host theWorld Outgames  a gathering of tolerance and diversity  while the city of Liège is a candidate to host the World’sFair in 2017. All those international events have a singlegoal: to bring us closer together and to mobilize arounduniversal values.For my country  respect for life and human rightsis fundamental. Whether we speak of the rights of thechild  of women or of refugees  or of the struggle againstall forms of discrimination  a single principle guidesmy country: the effective equality of all human beings regardless of status or beliefs. In that light  Belgium willjoin Slovenia in sponsoring a draft resolution againstracial discrimination. I hope members will support it.All heads of State and ministers share an immensecollective responsibility to ensure that women becomeequal to men worldwide at the political  social andeconomic levels; to ensure that little girls are nolonger subjected to circumcision; and that acts ofviolence against women are systematically fought andeliminated.In my country  women head three ministries: theMinistry of Justice  the Ministry of the Interior andthe Ministry of the Police. Significant efforts havealso been made to more effectively combat domesticviolence. Our national laws prohibit and punish allforms of discrimination  whether on the basis of genderor that of claimed race  disability or sexual orientation.In my country  both marriage and adoption are opento same-sex couples. Those are grounds for pride inBelgium.With the support of several countries of the EuropeanUnion  Belgium invites members to take vigorous concerted action in various realms of social life. I amthinking first and foremost of the decriminalization ofsexual orientation and the promotion of the rights oflesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender people. In thatregard  I welcome the initiative of UNESCO to counterhomophobia in schools.For my country  freedom of religion  which is tosay the freedom to practise or not practise a religion is fundamental. Belgium unequivocally condemnsIslamophobia. We just as firmly condemn violence which is unacceptable in all cases. We believe thathuman beings should be free to think what they wishand be able to express their indignation without everresorting to violence. Diplomatic missions should beinviolable throughout the world. It is not by oppressinghuman beings or promoting violence that the fundamental challenges of prosperity  the well-being ofcitizens and peace will be resolved.Belgium attaches particular importance tostrengthening the rule of law throughout the world. Thereason for that is simple: in my country we are convincedthat the rule of law is necessary for development andprosperity. It contributes to a better world  because thepurpose of the rule of law is to enable every humanbeing to live  flourish and love in complete freedom.For that reason  and in the spirit of mutual humanrespect  we support the principle of the responsibilityto protect victims of violence wherever they are. Inthe same spirit  Belgium responded to the Secretary-General’s call by instituting 17 specific projects.The rule of law and the enforcement of respect forhuman rights require us to step up the fight againstimpunity. Belgium will continue its policy of activecooperation with international criminal tribunals. Theaction of the International Criminal Court will help tousher in an era of responsibility. It is incumbent upon allStates to cooperate with the Court. Belgium  togetherwith Slovenia and the Netherlands  calls on all Statesrepresented here to improve international cooperationin mutual legal assistance and extradition.As the President of Brazil pointed out(see A/67/PV.6)  the effects of the economic crisisand financial speculation are felt by every household.When the balance sheets of banks represent 300 percent  400 per cent or 600 per cent of gross domesticproduct — indeed  even more in some countries — weshould not be surprised that there is a direct link betweenbank management and the economic and budgetaryhealth of sovereign States. In many countries in-depthstudies have been carried out and decisions taken  butclearly that is not enough. That is because the financialworld operates in line with the rhythm of its own peculiarlogic. Here at the United States the phenomenon isbetter understood than elsewhere. Programme tradingdominates financial exchanges. The software reacts amillion times faster than human traders  buying andselling thousands of shares every millionth of a second.We must work together here at the international level toestablish oversight mechanisms for the financial world with a view to ensuring that it again assists more in jobcreation and that it steers clear of risky managementpractices that compromise the economic and budgetaryhealth of nations.In Belgium we are working on the issue nationallyand within the eurozone. But an agreed international approach is becoming indispensable. Beyond suchin-depth reforms in the banking and financial sectors let us also dare to tax financial transactions. It is hightime that income derived from that source be used topromote prosperity for our people.The Assembly is committed to the follow-upto the United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment. We can never underline enough that wemust break with an economic development model thatdevours natural resources and energy. Belgium supportsthe Secretary-General’s Sustainable Energy for Allinitiative. It also stresses the importance of mergingwithin one process the Millennium Development Goalsand the sustainable development goals.I would like to turn to some regional issues that mycountry finds especially disturbing and tragic. In theGreat Lakes region  the situation in the eastern part ofthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  the resurgentviolence and the Mouvement du 23 Mars rebelliongreatly concern the Belgian Government  especiallybecause of their serious impact on local populations.We see images of massacres  rape  forced recruitment including of children  pillaging  400 000 internallydisplaced persons — all of it completely unacceptable.Belgium calls upon the countries of the region toredouble their efforts to put an end to the currentrebellion. We also call for a response to the root causesof instability in the Great Lakes region. We commendthe Secretary-General’s attention to the region and hisinitiative in calling a high-level meeting tomorrowon the crisis. Our Foreign Minister will attend  andBelgium stands ready to do what it can to help.The territorial integrity of the Democratic Republicof the Congo must categorically be respected. Allexternal support for the rebels must stop. Let us notdelude ourselves. Denying the facts does not makethem disappear. The facts on the ground give the lie toall denials. Belgium calls on all countries in the GreatLakes region to pledge to respect the sovereignty of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Belgium also urgesthe Congolese authorities to institute the necessaryreforms in the army and the police to re-establish therule of law in the whole of its territory  including obviously  the eastern part.I dearly hope that reason will prevail. Belgium isready to work to help restore trust among the countriesof the region. We furthermore hope that direct relationsbetween the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the President of Rwanda can be establishedand that it will speed progress towards a solution.As to Syria  we are all deeply concerned by thedeteriorating situation of an impasse on the ground and a political impasse as well. We are appalled bythe posture of a regime that kills its own citizens.Beyond the 30 000 dead there are at least 250 000refugees in neighbouring countries  and even moreinternally displaced. How is it that the collective humanconscience is not in agreement to stop the massacre? Isay respectfully to the members of the Security Councilthat we cannot knowingly allow such human sufferingto go on. Unless we take action we are complicit incrimes against humanity.Belgium has faith in and supports Joint SpecialRepresentative Lakhdar Brahimi. Belgium also supportsthe efforts by Arab countries and hopes that they willbe successful. We must all hope for a political solution.One thing is certain. Bashar Al-Assad must leave. Theregime has lost all legitimacy. Given the urgency of thesituation and the approaching winter  Belgium urgesthe international community to take concrete steps onthe humanitarian front and to come to the aid of themillions of people affected. Humanitarian concerns areour highest priority. The Belgian Government providesfinancial support for humanitarian aid to the refugees.In that connection  I will allow myself to insistthat my country demands earnestly that a solution befound to enable humanitarian organizations to carryout their work  particularly in hospitals  in line withinternational humanitarian law. I believe that both theChinese and Russian authorities will be able to join usin those objectives.I have another comment concerning the region; Iwish to mention the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Belgiumfavours the rapid resumption of negotiations aimedat finding a solution based on the coexistence of twoStates — the State of Israel and a State of Palestine thatis independent  democratic  united and viable — livingtogether in peace  security and prosperity. We also wishto state very clearly our opposition to the continuationof colonization.My country believes that multilateralism is the onlyway to improve conditions of our planet. Belgium is thefifteenth largest contributor to the United Nations.Let us have the courage and strength to agree tofree humankind from wars and social injustices  and support its development. I invite all of us to spur ourawareness. Let us demonstrate together our capacity toact."
"14",558,"BEN",67,2012,"﻿On behalf of theAfrican continent and as Chair of the African Union  Iwould like to congratulate you  Mr. President  on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assemblyat its sixty-seventh session  and at the same timecongratulate the Secretary-General for his leadershiprole for the peace and prosperity of our people.In our world  shaken by so many multifaceted crises the Assembly’s general debate offers us the opportunityto transcend our national interests to contemplatetogether the ways and means to ensure internationalpeace and security and to improve global governancefor healthy economic growth  which is the guarantorof sustainable human development. In that regard  Iwelcome the relevance of the theme of this session on the settlement of international disputes by peacefulmeans. It is a logical follow-up to that of the previoussession  which focused on mediation in the settlement ofdisputes  and amply demonstrates the importance thatthe United Nations accords to international peace andsecurity  the foundation of a better world characterizedby stability  equity  solidarity among nations  justice respect for human rights and fundamental freedomsand international cooperation.With regard to the conflicts and other wars thatshake our world  the African continent faces manychallenges which it cannot straighten out by itself. Wehope that the General Assembly’s attention  focusedsince its previous session on the thorny question ofconflicts and how to settle them peacefully  will helpAfrica to find appropriate solutions so that it candedicate its resources and energies to the sustainabledevelopment of its States and to the well-being of itspopulations.The major constraints on Africa’s economicdevelopment and social progress are at once sundry andvariable. They include  inter alia  the illicit and massivecirculation of small arms and light weapons  whichfeeds chronic insecurity and transnational organizedcrime in States and regions of the continent heretoforehavens of peace and prosperity. There is an upsurge interrorist acts in the Sahelo-Saharan area and activitiesrelated to transnational crime  such as abductionsand illegal trafficking of all kinds  in particular ofhumans  and trafficking in narcotics and counterfeitmedications. Piracy and armed robbery at sea confrontthe States of the Gulf of Guinea and the Horn of Africa.We see ongoing unemployment and underemployment lack of food in some regions and chronic malnutrition in many countries. Soil degradation and erosionincrease  and natural disasters  the consequences ofclimate upheavals and change recur. Poor governancein international economic relations engenders aneconomic and financial crisis.In spite of the difficulties and shortfalls noted intheir operation  the different elections that have takenplace in many African States in 2011 and 2012 showthe determination of the African peoples and theiradherence to the process of implanting democracy andthe rule of law in our dear continent.I take this opportunity to focus particularly on theefforts underway in the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS)  supported by the AfricanUnion  to deal with the grave security and institutionalcrises that have taken place in particular in Mali andGuinea-Bissau.In Mali a very disturbing situation is developingwhich has to do with the occupation of the north of thecountry by terrorist cells that threaten to destabilizethe entire West African subregion and could threatensecurity on the continent and throughout the world.The terrorist cells share the same intolerance that isdestabilizing the democratic Government of the FederalRepublic of Nigeria. The international communityhas a duty to act decisively against that terrorist andfundamentalist threat and ensure that human rights arerespected. I would like to reiterate from this rostrummy pressing appeal for the international community tocommit itself  along with ECOWAS and the AfricanUnion  to eliminate that serious threat to peace andsecurity in the subregion and to prevent large-scalehumanitarian disasters.I am not forgetting the situation in Guinea-Bissau which continues to hold the attention of ECOWAS andof the African Union in spite of progress made throughmediation between the different the parties concerned including ECOWAS  the African Union  the Communityof Portuguese-speaking Countries  the United Nationsand the bilateral and multilateral partners. I hope thatthe initiatives will continue to help to bring about acoordinated approach to the crisis in order to reach aninternational and national consensus on the situation inthat country.I welcome the different efforts by the AfricanUnion and the international community in pursuitof peace with regard to the various other hotbeds oftension on the continent  namely  in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Somalia  the Sudan  SouthSudan  Madagascar  et cetera. We must strengthen thestrategic partnership established between the UnitedNations Security Council and the Peace and SecurityCouncil of the African Union with regard to conflictprevention  mediation  peacekeeping  peacebuildingand the promotion of human rights and humanitarianlaw for the certain benefit of our people. We must alsothink more deeply on ways to ensure predictable andsustainable financing for African Union peacekeepingoperations  including the African Standby Force.As shown by the crises that are shaking our planet the system of global governance that has prevailed up tonow is suffering from serious disfunctions. It is thereforehigh time to accelerate the process of reforming theinternational system in order to democratize the modeof operation of its institutions and mechanisms thatregulate and promote cooperation among States.Since the 2005 World Summit  various measureshaving to do with rationalizing the United Nationssystem have been taken and have resulted in particularin the establishment of new bodies that have provenvery useful. The Peacebuilding Commission  createdto break the cycle of violence in countries emergingfrom conflict  has contributed to their stabilization byproviding them targeted support to confront troublingsituations. Similarly  the Human Rights Council iscontributing to improving global governance withregard to the protection and promotion of human rights humanitarian law and fundamental freedoms.In the same spirit  negotiations to reform theSecurity Council must be intensified to achieve in thenear term the establishment of an inclusive Council one that would repair the historical injustice done toAfrica with respect to its presence in that organ  whichheads the collective security system established by theCharter of the United Nations.Completing Security Council reform would  I amsure  result in more serenity in the handling of the world’scurrent major problems in the area of international peaceand security. It would confer greater legitimacy uponthe actions of our common Organization and wouldallow it to renew its original vocation as an instrumentof conflict prevention and resolution. It would alsoallow it to shed the inconsistencies that limit it to theincongruous role of an observer of carnage takingplace before its very eyes. Those laudable reforms mustbe complemented by a system offering the youth and women an opportunity to get more involved in the lifeof the United Nations.Peace in the world is possible. We cannot ignore thesituation in the Middle East. Today the United Nationshas the means to find a fair and sustainable solution tothe Palestinian problem  and under no pretext shouldit shirk its duty and historical responsibility. We aretalking about security  stability and peace  not onlyin the Middle East  but for the entire world. Africa isfully in favour of the “one land  two States” solution torestore lasting peace in the Middle East  because in theend the two peoples — Palestinians and Israelis — mustbe able to live in love  friendship  peace and prosperity.As the Assembly knows  the world economy stillsuffers from the financial and economic crisis thatwas unleashed in 2008. In spite of the macroeconomicpolicies established by both developed and developingcountries  with the support of the national andinternational financial institutions  the economicslowdown that began in 2008 has persisted  with thecorollary of weak and fragile economic growth andmore than 75 million unemployed people throughoutthe world  with very high unemployment rates in thedeveloping countries.The prices of raw materials  which are the majorsource of export earnings for developing countries have become very volatile  as have the prices of foodcommodities. Flows of private capital meant for foreigndirect investment cannot escape the negative impact ofthe crisis. At the same time  we see a tangible reductionof aid for development and other forms of official f lowsfrom countries of the North to those of the South.With regard to food security  almost 16 millionpeople in Sahel countries face problems of famine andnutrition  in spite of the many efforts made individuallyby our States and the collective initiatives in theAfrican Union through the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment and through the Comprehensive AfricaAgriculture Development Programme. In fact  of 40countries facing a food shortage throughout the world 34 still are in Africa  even though about twenty of themhave allocated at least 20 per cent of their budget toagriculture. That is why the nineteenth ordinary sessionof the Assembly of Heads of State and Government ofthe African Union adopted a decision declaring 2014the Year of Agriculture and Food Security in Africa tomark the tenth anniversary of the Comprehensive AfricaAgriculture Development Programme. The forecasted increase in food commodity prices  according to recentestimates of the Food and Agriculture Organization ofthe United Nations  and the already high costs of energyare certainly additional burdens for already vulnerablepopulations.We also welcome the positive initiative of theNew Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition takenby President Barack Obama on the margins of theGroup of Eight Summit  held on 18 and 19 May atCamp David  which calls for bringing together donors partner countries and the private sector for a commoncause aimed at pulling 50 million people out of povertyin the next ten years. We hope that this will allow usto mobilize more assistance for African countries inorder to improve food security and nutrition in orderto accelerate their progress towards achieving theMillenium Development Goals.It is also important not to disappoint the hopes raisedby the conclusions of the United Nations Conferenceon Sustainable Development (Rio+20)  which adoptedmore than 700 official commitments and promises ofgifts totaling more than $500 billion. The impact ofthose conferences will be measured by the fulfilmentof the decisions and commitments.Africa hopes that the results of the work of thehigh-level group of eminent persons selected by theSecretary-General to advise him on the post-2015development programme and the working group todefine sustainable development goals will be ableto achieve convergence in their efforts to suggest avision of sustainable human development  capableof mobilizing the international community so as toachieve equity and attain a prosperity shared by all.Africa  the cradle of humankind  is also a continentof the future  of hope and hopefulness. Indeed  thanksto the incalculable potential of its subsoil and to theyouthfulness of its population — which in 2050 willnumber 2 billion  60 per cent of whom will be less than35 years old — Africa could become the driving forcefor growth of the global economy  if that youth becomesprofessionalized.That is why we raised to cardinal principlesthe values of unity  stability  peace  security  goodgovernance and the struggle against any impedimentsto our development  particularly corruption  impuntiy the loss of accountability  fratricidal wars  politicaland institutional instability and brutal challenges tothe constitutional order. We have affirmed all of those values through the African Charter on Democracy Elections and Governance  the African charter onpublic service and the African peace and securitymechanisms  et cetera.Africa has decided to establish a free tradezone throughout the continent and is in theprocess of accelerating its economic integrationthrough its ambitious programme of developinginfrastructure — namely  energy  railroad networks airports and ports. That feeds the hope that we willhave support for private-public partnerships to financethose wide-ranging infrastructure programmes.In our implacable fight against poverty  Africahas no choice but to persevere in its efforts to ensureprogress in the areas of food  nutrition  health  waterprovisioning  sanitation  primary  technical andprofessional education for all  and the independence ofwomen and children.The fight against HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis andmalaria is a top priority for the continent  and wewill not be idle as long as we have not achieved theobjectives that we set in Abuja. In that regard  wewelcome the decision adopted by the Assembly ofHeads of State and Government of the African Unionasking the Commission of the Union to develop a roadmap for the African Union for shared responsibility andglobal solidarity in combating HIV/AIDS  tuberculosisand malaria in Africa for the period of 2012 to 2015.A high-level coordinating meeting on the subject willtake place tomorrow  26 September 2012  at UnitedNations Headquarters.  I call on the spirit of solidarity of developedcountries and of countries of the South that areexperiencing considerable economic expansion to setup  according to their historic responsibility and theirabilities  opportunities to assist the efforts of Africancountries  as was agreed during the fourth MinisterialConference of the Least Developed Countries  heldin Istanbul  Turkey in May 2011  as well as at theGroup of 20 Summit in Los Cabos  Mexico  in June.The recommendations of those bodies reflect wellour common ambition to transition of half of the leastdeveloped countries to the category of middle-incomecountries by 2020 — an ambition that has been fullyintegrated into the Rio+20 vision.My fervent wish is that the current difficulties ofdevelopment partners of the North  due to the sovereigndebt and bank crises  and the austerity measures thatthey are rightly imposing on themselves do not def lectthem from their commitments to a significant increasein development aid. In that regard  I am pleased by thereaffirmation at the Rio+20 Conference on SustainableDevelopment of the resolve of heads of State andGovernment to spare no effort to more promptly achieveinternationally agreed development goals  includingattaining the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 while bearing in mind the concerns linked to the risksthat current production and consumption methods poseto the planet in terms of the accelerated depletion ofresources and the challenges for future generations.I am convinced that a new world is possible. Itpresupposes inclusive governance in internationalpolitical  financial and economic bodies. Moreover the continuing challenges facing humanity make usfully aware of our interdependence and the need for anagreed system of governance in managing internationalrelations rather than withdrawal and resort tounilateralism and coercive domination.I remain convinced that a new world characterizedby peace  stability  security and the shared prosperityof our planet and our peoples will emerge only by theinternational community sharing its technology andfinancial resources  together with the wealth of theAfrican continent. May God bless our planet."
"15",604,"BFA",67,2012,"﻿Itis always a very significant moment for the delegationof Burkina Faso when we find ourselves present at thistraditional meeting that opens the annual session ofthe General Assembly. For us  it is a special momentfor ref lection on how the world is progressing and forsketching ways to build a world of peace  security andsolidarity. The sixty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly is taking place in an atmosphere of uncertaintyrelated to the very difficult international economicsituation and the growing threats to international peaceand security. The challenges that the situation poses toworld require of us greater courage  effort  creativityand solidarity  if all of us wish one day to achieve theobjectives of peace and development so dear to theinternational community.This year  Burkina Faso has been tested by a foodcrisis resulting from poor rainfall. The grain and cerealshortage was exacerbated by a massive inf low of tensof thousands of refugees from neighbouring Mali sometimes with all of their cattle  as a result of the crisisthat has raged in that brother country since 17 January.The situation has led the Government of Burkina Fasoto undertake vigorous and urgent measures that have enabled us to contain its negative impact on the mostvulnerable strata of society and welcome our brothersand sisters from Mali in acceptable human conditions. Ishould like to reiterate the gratitude of the Governmentand the people of Burkina Faso to the relevant specializedagencies of the United Nations systems  the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)  theWest African Economic and Monetary Union  theKingdom of Morocco  the Republic of China (Taiwan) the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  Algeria  Japan  Tunisia Egypt and Azerbaijan  who have lent us their assistanceto ensure that refugees and worst-off populations ofBurkina Faso are able to live dignified lives.At the political level  Burkina Faso  within theframework of the implementation of the conclusionsof the Consultative Council on Political Reforms  iscontinuing the strengthening and consolidation of itsdemocratic process. Following the successful holdingof a biometric registration effort covering the entirenational territory  December of this year will witness theorganization of joint legislative and municipal electionson the basis of greater transparency and fairness.Turning to the economy  Burkina Faso is continuingits policy of building a strong and prosperous economyto serve the basic needs of its population. To do that we have adopted a strategy of accelerated growth andsustainable development to fulfil our drive for progresstowards becoming an emerging country and enablingit to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Wewelcome the backing of Burkina Faso’s partners for thatstrategy  whose ultimate goal is to achieve strong andsustained economic growth that serves to multipliesrevenue and improves the population’s quality of life while taking into account the guiding principles ofsustainable management of natural resources.The annual foreign financing needs of the strategyremain significant  despite the efforts undertaken bythe Government of Burkina Faso on the basis of ourown resources. We are hopeful that our bilateral andmultilateral partners  as they have done in the past  willbe at our side to ensure a successful implementation ofthe strategy. We wish to convey our gratitude to thosethat have already demonstrated their solidarity with us.Burkina Faso is aware that there can be no sustainabledevelopment without peace and stability. That is whyPresident Blaise Compaoré has turned dialogue andmediation into new levers for the maintenance ofharmony and understanding among peoples. We are very grateful to President Vuk Jeremić for havingplaced this session of the General Assembly under thebanner  “Bringing about adjustment or settlement ofinternational disputes or situations by peaceful means”.That theme underscores the importance of resorting topeaceful means as an appropriate mechanism for thesettlement of disputes. Burkina Faso fully associatesitself with the choice of that topic which  following onthe sixty-sixth session  will enable the internationalcommunity to deepen its thinking and commit itselfresolutely to the peaceful settlement of conflictsthrough dialogue to avoid stalemate and the escalationof violence  which reduces to nought our effortsaimed at promoting sustainable economic and socialdevelopment.It is along those lines that the President of BurkinaFaso has accepted the mediation mission that its peersfrom the Economic Community of West African Stateshave entrusted him within the framework of the crisisin Mali. The ECOWAS mediation  whose goal is toresolve  through dialogue  the dual institutional andsecurity crisis that is raging in Mali  has focused itsefforts on restoring the normal constitutional order andto setting up stable transition bodies that are accepted byMalians and recognized by the international communityin order to implement the road map contained in theframework agreement of 6 April  which deals withthe management of the crisis and the organization ofelections. Burkina Faso will continue to work underthe ECOWAS framework  with the support of theinternational community  towards Mali’s reunificationand reconciliation so as to create conditions conduciveto the holding of free and democratic electionsthroughout all of Mali.The establishment of stable and lasting peacein Mali will require a comprehensive approachcombining political dialogue and the use of forcemainly aimed at neutralizing extremist terrorist groupsof a transnational nature  whose presence in the northof Mali is likely to irretrievably compromise effortsaimed at better governance and social and economicdevelopment. The President of Burkina Faso  with theassistance of President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan  willcontinue in a clear-headed way to seek solutions tothe deep-rooted causes of the crisis undermining oursubregion  a crisis which the armed rebellion has butexacerbated. I therefore call upon the Malian armedmovements to renounce the systematic use of arms as ameans to achieve their demands. I urge them to respect the fundamental freedoms of their fellow citizens andto clearly distance themselves from extremist andterrorist movements in order to promote the values ofdialogue and democracy to which Mali is so wedded.The crisis situation in the north of Mali is a tangiblemanifestation of the type of threat facing all of thecountries of the Sahel region. I therefore welcome thetimely initiative of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon thatbrought us together on 26 September on the marginsof the General Assembly around the issue of peace security and development in the States of the Sahelregion. I renew my gratitude and reiterate to him theregard and appreciation of the Government of BurkinaFaso for his availability and commitment to peace anddevelopment in Africa and throughout the world.Always working for international peace andsecurity  Burkina Faso contributes to peacekeepingoperations in Darfur and Guinea-Bissau. OnGuinea-Bissau  Burkina Faso encourages the effortsundertaken by the transitional bodies to quickly restoreconstitutional order and urges all of the country’sstakeholders to ensure a consensual and inclusivetransition and to create the best possible conditions inwhich to implement priority reforms  organize free andtransparent presidential elections and entrench the ruleof law. On Darfur  we encourage the parties to betterimplement the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur  andwe continue to contribute through the implementationand follow-up mechanism provided for by the DohaDocument.On the issue of the Western Sahara  Burkina Fasowelcomes the determination of the parties to exploreappropriate ways and means to achieve a fair andagreed political settlement of the issue. The currentstatus quo is neither viable nor of benefit to any ofthe parties  given its impact on the subregion’s peaceand security. That is why my country has continuouslypromoted dialogue and compromise aimed at achievingan acceptable political solution between the parties. Inthat regard  we believe that the Moroccan initiative forthe negotiation of an autonomous status for the Saharanregion could be an appropriate way to settle differences.The world is experiencing great uncertainty andanxiety as a result of the international economic andfinancial instability  the increase in poverty  ongoingenvironmental degradation and the increase in naturaldisasters. In particular  the recent international financialcrises  which seriously compromised the balance of our economies  are sorely testing the cohesion of oursocieties. They have an impact on all of us and requireof us constant vigilance and sustained solidarity.The United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment (Rio+20)  held from 18 to 22 June in Brazil rightly reminded us of our shared but differentiatedresponsibilities to protect our planet and to ensuresustainable development for future generations. Itis essential that efforts continue on the basis of theconsensus reached at the Conference in order to findacceptable compromises that take into account theinterests of the various regions of the world.Burkina Faso attaches special importance to allissues related to the empowerment of women. To thatend  we have spared no effort to improve women’slegal and social status in our country. The First Ladyof Burkina Faso  Mrs. Chantal Compaoré  GoodwillAmbassador and Coordinator of the InternationalCampaign to Ban Female Genital Mutilation Worldwide co-chaired during this session the high-level side eventon banning female genital mutilation. That is yetanother demonstration of her well-known commitmentto the defence of women’s rights and the improvementof the status of women. In that connection  we reiterateour full support for the African initiative to introduceat this session a draft resolution aimed at a global banon female genital mutilation. We hope that it will enjoythe support of the entire international community.Furthermore  we welcome efforts undertaken sincethe launch of UN-Women and we hope that this newbody will strengthen United Nations activities aimedat the empowerment of women  the defence of theirrights and the promotion of gender equality  especiallyin developing countries.Burkina Faso believes in multilateralism  solidaritybetween peoples and the virtue of dialogue amongnations. In that regard  my delegation notes with greatsatisfaction the calm atmosphere that currently prevailsin the relations between the Republic of China (Taiwan)and the People’s Republic of China. That wouldargue in favour of granting the Republic of China itsrightful place among the family of nations  includingthrough its meaningful participation in the activitiesof international organizations such as the InternationalCivil Aviation Organization and the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change.The nature of the threats and challenges facing theworld demands of us a better sharing of responsibilities through a reform of the United Nations. Such reformremains a topic of great concern at the very heart ofglobal governance. We hope that the negotiationslaunched within the framework of this reform willresult in acceptable compromises that can strengthenthe effectiveness and standing of the United Nations asit faces the new challenges of our changing world. Onlyin that way will we genuinely move towards building amore fair and united world.My delegation listened with great interest to theinaugural address by the President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session  in which hecovered all the major issues of concern to today’sdemocratic societies. I would therefore like tocongratulate him on his election and welcome thevision with which he would like to endow our commonOrganization. He can rest assured of our delegation’sreadiness for full cooperation.Finally  I would like to take this opportunity toexpress our gratitude to his predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of Qatar  for his effortsduring the sixty-sixth session of the Assembly. Thatsession’s very welcome results bear witness to the skilland effectiveness with which he led our work."
"16",647,"BGD",67,2012,"﻿I warmlycongratulate Mr. Jeremić on his election as President ofthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session  and Ithank Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his excellentleadership of the Assembly during the previous session.I also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for hisefforts on behalf of the United Nations in the past year.Our new world is experiencing popular uprisings intra-State conflicts  climate change disasters  globalfinancial crises  food and energy insecurity  humanrights violations  terrorism and so forth. These andother experiences call for collective efforts towardspeaceful resolution at the United Nations. I thereforecommend the theme for this year’s deliberations namely  “Bringing about adjustment or settlement ofinternational disputes or situations by peaceful means”.In that context  I would like to recall the role ofmy father  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  theFather of the Nation  who from this rostrum 38 yearsago espoused the principles of friendship towardsall and malice towards none  the peaceful settlementof disputes  the renunciation of the use of force ininternational relations  and contributing to global peaceand security. In essence  his policy at home and abroadwas based on justice and peace. At home  during mylast tenure as Prime Minister  in 1997  those policyguidelines inspired me to settle a 20-year conflict thathad cost more than 20 000 lives  through the signing ofthe Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord. In February2009  during my current tenure  I was able to peacefullysettle the volatile mutiny of our border guards  thusaverting a dangerous crisis.We have also put increased emphasis on improvingexternal relations. I was able to resolve a 25-year-oldissue with India on sharing the water of the RiverGanges with the signing in 1996 of the 30-year GangesWater Sharing Treaty. Last year the 2011 Protocol toour 1974 Land Boundary Agreement settled a borderdemarcation issue that had gone unresolved for 64years. We also addressed mutual concerns about adam proposed by India across a common river. Withour other neighbour  Myanmar  we reached a peacefulsettlement of a 41-year maritime boundary disputethrough the International Tribunal for the Law of theSea.Our national and international commitment to peacehas also been demonstrated by our position among thetop contributors to United Nations peacekeeping and as afounding member of the Peacebuilding Commission. Asthe current Chair of the Commission  on 25 Septemberwe held an event entitled “Peacebuilding: the wayforward towards sustainable peace and security”  inwhich many here participated. As a member of theHuman Rights Council and of the Economic and SocialCouncil  we promote justice  peace  democracy  genderequality  secularism  the rule of law and the rights ofminorities and vulnerable groups. As a member of theexecutive bodies of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the United Nations Population Fund  theUnited Nations Office for Partnerships  UNESCO the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UnitedNations  the International Maritime Organization andthe Universal Postal Union  we advocate setting globalnorms and standards.In my four decades in politics for the welfare ofthe people  I have learned that peace prevails whenjustice prevails  both within States and in relationsbetween States. Only justice can ensure peace  whichis so vital for development  and justice is possibleonly through democracy  which empowers people.The alternative — the absence of democracy — meanssocial injustice  poverty  inequality  deprivation and marginalization  which encourage extremism andterrorism. We are therefore strengthening democracyand justice by empowering people by eradicatingpoverty  hunger  inequality and deprivation andby establishing social safety nets  creating jobs promoting inclusiveness  sustained growth and humandevelopment  and by countering terrorism.The principles to which I have just referredalso encouraged me to present a model for people’sempowerment and development at the sixty-sixth session(see A/66/PV.22). The model encompasses six mutuallyreinforcing peace multipliers: first  eradicating povertyand hunger; secondly  reducing inequality; thirdly mitigating deprivation; fourthly  including excludedpersons; fifthly  accelerating human development;and sixthly  eliminating terrorism. That model wasendorsed by the Assembly in resolution 66/224  adoptedby consensus last year. In Dhaka  on 5 and 6 August2012  we held an international conference to discussthe model  and the 62 participating countries supportedits consideration at the sixty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly. I highly appreciate their support. Ialso seek the Assembly’s support for disseminating themodel.In our efforts to achieve people’s empowerment parliamentary standing committees were establishedduring the first session of the Parliament that wasconstituted immediately after the general elections of2008. There are 50 such committees  and many arechaired by members of Parliament from the oppositionbench. We also introduced the Prime Minister’s questiontime and strengthened commissions on anti-corruption human rights and information. We ensured anindependent  proactive judiciary  strengthened the ruleof law and established human rights  accountability secularism and rights of minorities. We proceededwith regional multimodal connectivity to empowerall people. We modernized education in madrasas. Weentrenched the election commission and democraticinstitutions for holding 5 182 elections in a completelyfree and credible atmosphere. We freed and expandedthe media  with 24 private television channels  7 newsagencies  11 FM and 14 community radio stations  320daily newspapers and 151 periodicals.Since justice is the basis for empowering people forpeace and development  women should have an equalrole. To expedite the process of their empowerment girls are provided free education up to higher secondaryschool under our new education policy. Women are alsoencouraged to be active in our national life. Women’sleadership has been developed from the grass-rootslevel to the national level. Their participation in politicshas been increased since the general elections in 2008.So far  12 838 women have been elected to localGovernment bodies  and 69 women are members of theParliament  constituting 20 per cent of the total numberof members of Parliament. Besides my being the PrimeMinister and Leader of the House  other women includethe Opposition Leader  the Deputy Leader of theHouse  five Cabinet ministers and a Whip. Of generalGovernment posts  30 per cent are reserved for women some of whom serve in very senior positions in thejudicial  administrative and diplomatic fields  as wellas in the armed and law enforcement services and asUnited Nations peacekeepers.Our efforts to empower people in my presenttenure have so far helped in reducing poverty by 10 percent  attaining a gross domestic product growth rate of6.5 per cent and enhancing per capita income by 34.6 percent. They have helped to reduce overall inflationfrom double digits to 4.97 per cent  with food inflationdeclining from 13 per cent in 2008 to 2.25 per cent atpresent. Our efforts have assisted in the employment of7.5 million in the private sector and half a million in thepublic sector. Exports have increased annually by 19 percent over 2009 figures to $24.3 billion in 2011-2012. Wehave helped to arrange overseas jobs for 1.87 millionnationals  increasing annual inward remittances by10 per cent over 2009 to $12 billion in 2011-2012.We have maintained macroeconomic stability. Wehave expanded information and communicationstechnology facilities among the lowest tier of localGovernment to ensure the availability of e-services torural people. Nearly 100 per cent of school-age childrenare enrolled in in primary schools. We have achievedgender parity in primary and secondary education andhave established 12 000 community clinics to ensurenutrition and health care for rural people  especiallymothers and children. A climate change trust fund hasbeen set up to implement adaptation and mitigationprogrammes. All those undertakings have helped inachieving Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)3  4 and 5  on gender parity and infant and maternalmortality  ahead of 2015.Our achievements have earned us global recognitionthrough MDG  South-South and Food and AgricultureOrganization awards. Importantly  the Secretary-General has acknowledged those achievements by including me as a member of the Scaling Up NutritionLead Group and as a champion for the Education Firstinitiative. We welcome his high-level panel on thepost-2015 development agenda  which should considercoherence with the sustainable development goals andshould prioritize poverty  hunger  nutrition  globalfood and energy security  climate change and globalpartnership for sustainable development.I hope that the high-level panel will also considerformulating a position on the painful plight of autisticand disadvantaged children  who constitute about1 per cent of the world’s population. At home  we haveput in place 55 special-needs schools and a centre forneurodevelopment and autism in children. In July 2011 with the collaboration of the World Health Organizationand Autism Speaks  we launched a global autism publichealth initiative. At the current Assembly session wewill submit a draft resolution on the autism spectrumdisorder  which I hope will receive the Assembly’ssupport.Our efforts are hindered by unjust developmentsresulting from climate change  such as increasingpoverty  property loss  human displacement and theconsequent terrorism. The inevitable sea-level rise willcreate mass movements of displaced migrants. A newlegal regime ensuring social  cultural and economicrehabilitation of climate migrants — which I called forat the Assembly’s sixty-fourth session — must be putin place.It was also emphasized at the Dhaka meeting in2011 of the Climate Vulnerable Forum that an alliance ofcountries most vulnerable to climate change and risingsea levels has to be forged. As the current Chair of theForum  Bangladesh launched the second edition of theClimate Vulnerability Monitor yesterday in New York.I also reiterate my call for an international agreementlimiting greenhouse-gas emissions on the principle ofcommon and differentiated responsibilities  on earlyoperationalization of the Green Climate Fund for  interalia  adaptation  mitigation and technology transfer.Closely linked to climate change is global foodand energy security. The increase of food and energyprices due to climate change can be very disturbingindeed. It has dangerous implications for leastdeveloped countries  which is why they need greaterinternational support for socioeconomic security  forduty-free and quota-free access of their products toall markets  for the fulfilment of official developmentassistance commitments  for an equal voice in BrettonWoods institutions and other international financialinstitutions  and for free movement of labour to allcountries. In fact  we should immediately implementMode IV of the General Agreement on Trade in Servicesto benefit both sending and receiving countries.We should also ensure documentation  safemigration and the protection of the rights of migrantworkers  especially women and children  as a sharedresponsibility of sending and receiving States in theWorld Trade Organization.The blatant injustice perpetrated against  andmurder  torture and humiliation of the Palestinianpeople by Israel marks a shameful chapter in humanhistory. Deep frustrations at the injustice in Palestineand in other places also fuel terrorism. It is vital toresolve the Palestine and similar burning questionsthrough justice and the establishment of democraticrights.In Bangladesh  from 2001 to 2006  an environment ofterrorism prevailed. Under the patronage of the previousBNP-Jamaat Government  such internationally bannedterrorist outfits as Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh Harkatul Jihad  Hizb ut-Tahrir and Lashkar-e-Toiba among others  carried out bomb and grenade attackswith impunity  every other day  to eliminate the secularand progressive parties. Prominent instances were thebomb attacks on four cinemas killing 19 people on5 December 2002; the grenade attack on the BritishHigh Commissioner on 21 May 2004; bomb blasts at500 places in 63 out of 64 districts within a span of halfan hour on 17 August 2005; grenade and firearm attacksthat killed former Finance Minister and ExecutiveDirector of the Economic and Social Commissionfor Asia and the Pacific Mr. S.A.M.S. Kibria  MP Mr. Ahsanullah Master  MP  Mr. Mumtazuddin  MP and two popular judges inside the court premises.I was myself a target of a grenade attack at a publicmeeting on 21 August 2004  which left 24 people deadand nearly 500 injured. Somehow  I miraculouslysurvived. Another heinous kind of terrorism that weexperienced in Bangladesh was the brutal assassinationof my father and the Father of the Nation  BangabandhuSheikh Mujibur Rahman  and 18 members of our familyon 15 August 1975 by some misguided army personnelseeking to usurp State power. At that time  I was abroadwith my sister  Sheikh Rehana  and thus escapeddeath. In view of our nation’s tragic experiences with terrorism  my Government has adopted a firm policy ofzero tolerance of terrorism and all forms of extremism.I conclude by joining the vast majority of UnitedNations Members in stressing once again the urgentneed to reform the United Nations  the Bretton WoodsInstitutions and other international financial institutions.Their structures and decision making processes reflecta balance of power that is 60 years old  serving theinterests of a privileged few and ignoring the largemajority. The new millennium  with its large numberof independent sovereign States and globalization has ushered in a new world order. Today  we speakboldly of justice  equality  democracy  freedom  humanrights  environment and the adverse impact of climatechange  among other things. These are the priorities ofour time  which we must acknowledge in place of thebitter experiences of the past. The new world order ofnations has to be based on justice  mutual respect andsovereign equality if we are to evolve towards the worldof peace and hope that we wish to leave to our futuregenerations.May Bangladesh live forever! Long live the UnitedNations!"
"17",693,"BGR",67,2012,"﻿It is a great honour for meto speak from this rostrum for the first time since Itook office in January. I would like to congratulatePresident Jeremić on assuming the chair of this highlyrepresentative body and wish him success in hischallenging task. I also wish to commend the workof his predecessor  Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser President of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session.Let me express our gratitude and appreciation toSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his inspiringvision  reform efforts and result-oriented action. I alsowish to welcome the appointment of Mr. Jan Eliasson ofSweden as Deputy Secretary-General.Our time is marked by historic shifts andby achievements in science  technology andcommunications that shape the global economy and politics but that  we should also bear in mind  have animpact on every human being. More and more nationsaround the world have now opted for open  free anddemocratic societies based on the rule of law andgood governance. But such historic transformationsdo not always bring more peace and stability. Onmany occasions we still face extreme violence andbloodshed  causing senseless loss of innocent lives human suffering and destruction.The main theme of the Assembly’s general debatetoday could not be more relevant for us as politicalleaders. Dealing with violent conflicts and promotingpeace  security  development and human rights havealways been at the core of the United Nations. Atyesterday’s High-level Meeting  we affirmed ourcredo that the rule of law forms the basis of a peacefuland predictable system of international relations.Nowadays  as conflicts have become more complex  weshare the view that mediation and good offices shouldbe the tools of preference for dealing with escalatingtension.Delivering justice is vital to addressing terrorism one of the ugliest and most despicable crimes againsthumanity. No cause whatsoever can justify theindiscriminate killing of innocent civilians. Sadlyenough  no country or human being today can feel safeor insured against this evil. Just a few weeks ago  at theSofia synagogue  we paid tribute to the memory of fiveIsraeli citizens and one Bulgarian who lost their lives inthe shocking terrorist attack last July at the airport ofSarafovo  a lively tourist destination on our Black Seacoast. From this high stage today in New York  a fewmiles from the September 11 memorial  I now reaffirmour strongest condemnation of that awful crime. Mycountry will spare no effort to bring the perpetratorsand masterminds to justice. That attack on our ownsoil has made us stronger and more determined to alignwith others in implementing the United Nations GlobalCounter-Terrorism Strategy.We condemn the violent acts committed recentlyin the name of defending religious beliefs. This isunacceptable. We urge all involved to show toleranceand avoid provocative actions that can be destructive topeace and stability.For more than a year now the continuing brutalviolence in Syria has provoked our extreme concern.Each day brings testimony of unacceptable levelsof bloodshed and human suffering. The regime in Damascus has lost all legitimacy by waging a recklesswar on its own people and refusing to heed the calls fora negotiated way out of the crisis. Due to the growingnumber of refugees  the humanitarian situation isdeteriorating day by day and the stability of neighbouringcountries is also at risk. Bulgaria condemns thesegross violations of basic United Nations principlesand of international humanitarian law. We call for fullaccountability on the part of the perpetrators  includingby bringing them before the International CriminalCourt. My country subscribes to the acts of solidarityundertaken by the European Union and its membersin providing relief to the suffering civilian populationthrough emergency humanitarian assistance.It is regrettable that the active involvement ofthe United Nations and the international communityhas so far failed to ensure the Syrian authorities’compliance with the peace proposals elaboratedthrough international mediation. Bulgaria gave its fullsupport to the diplomatic efforts of Mr. Kofi Annan andwelcomed the appointment of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi asJoint Special Representative of the United Nations andthe League of Arab States for Syria. While the violenceand bloodshed should be stopped immediately  wealso call for the start of a transition towards inclusiveand representative democratic rule in Syria  onethat guarantees the rights of all citizens regardlessof ethnicity or religion. Bulgaria has supported theSyrian opposition groups in their efforts to unite on analternative to the current regime  on the basis of thevision of a new democratic State that can be a home thatwelcomes all Syrians.The promotion of just  inclusive and transparentsocieties supports the process of democratic transition known as the Arab Spring  that has swept across theMiddle East and North Africa. Bulgaria welcomesthe steps taken by several countries on the path toconstitutional and political reform  and we trust thatthose are now irreversible.At the same time  the need to reactivate the MiddleEast peace process seems now more pressing thanever. Bulgaria looks forward to the resumption in goodfaith of direct negotiations and expects both parties todemonstrate their continued commitment to a peacefulsolution that respects the legitimate interests andsensitivities of the Israeli and Palestinian people. Allefforts should made to create an environment conduciveto a comprehensive peace settlement between the twoStates  a two-State solution. In that respect  we urge both the Palestinians and the Israelis to refrain fromany unilateral actions that could be destructive to thepeace process.Disarmament and non-proliferation of weaponsof mass destruction are areas that continue to demandstrong political will and action by the internationalcommunity. It is essential that we continue tostrengthen the comprehensive regime of the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and of othermajor international instruments  such as the ChemicalWeapons Convention. With regard to conventionalarms  Bulgaria consistently supports the negotiationprocess leading to the adoption of a legally bindingarms trade treaty that is robust in substance.Along with others  we believe that Iran’s fullcooperation with the International Atomic EnergyAgency is of paramount importance. The Governmentin Tehran must show greater transparency of its nuclearactivities and fully comply with all relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions. We look to a resumption of thehigh-level negotiations on the future of Iran’s nuclearprogramme and a clear demonstration of politicalwill by the Iranian authorities to undertake concreteconfidence-building steps and address the concerns ofthe international community.Bulgaria highly values the role of the HumanRights Council as the primary United Nations bodyfor the protection and promotion of human rights. I amdelighted to announce that my country will be seeking for the first time  election to the Council for the period2019 to 2021.Over the past two decades  Bulgaria has gonethrough a successful transition from totalitarian rule toa functioning democracy with an open market economyand a vibrant civil society. It has been a difficult dramatic and sometimes turbulent journey. I thinkour greatest achievement in this process was to havepreserved the long-standing tradition of tolerance anddialogue between ethnic and religious communitieswithin Bulgarian society. That tradition can be clearlyillustrated by a glimpse of the centre of our capital  wherefour temples of different religions — Islam  Judaismand Catholic and Orthodox Christianity — coexistpeacefully  surrounded by archaeological monumentsof several ancient civilizations.It is in this spirit that we stand ready to share theexperience from our road to democracy with othercountries undergoing similar challenges. More than a year ago  Bulgaria initiated an international forumcalled the Sofia Platform   providing a useful venue fordialogue and an exchange of views and best practicesamong countries in the region. We got experts officials and representatives from Governments non-governmental organizations and civil societies allover the world focusing on the transition processes inCentral and Eastern Europe  the Balkans and the MiddleEast. The forum showed that although the historical cultural and political realities vary in different countriesand regions  conclusions and lessons learned can berelevant in the field of national reconciliation  rule oflaw  institution-building and security sector reform.Bulgaria maintains its unwavering commitmentto the process of European Union (EU) enlargement involving all our neighbouring countries of South-Eastern Europe and the Balkans. We confirm ourconviction that all States of the region should one daybecome part of the European Union  on the basis oftheir own merits and criteria fulfilled in the negotiationprocess. At the same time  pursuing the national reformagendas  solving outstanding issues and buildingregional cooperation and good neighbourly relations  inaccordance with the European standards  is of directbenefit to all countries of the region and their Europeanperspective. All of us in South-Eastern Europe areinterested in promoting business and human contactswith our neighbours  developing cross-border projectsand facilitating travel  building railways and highways and developing communications and regional energyand transport infrastructure facilities — all as part ofthe pan-European networks. That is why we need tomake the best use of existing regional bodies  such as theOrganization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperationand the South-Eastern European Cooperation Processwith its Regional Cooperation Council.A few months ago  at the Rio+20 Conference onSustainable Development  we made a good start onthe path to a greener and safer world. The outcomedocuments indicate that sustainable development isthe only possible way forward. The triple-win policiesenvisaged in the outcome document  “The future wewant” (resolution 66/288  annex) seek to advance socialdevelopment  economic growth and environmentalsustainability  all at the same time. Our task now isto focus on the Conference follow-up and to deliver.The General Assembly should discuss the formulationof sustainable development goals to be integratedinto the United Nations development agenda beyond2015. We see an important role for the Economic and Social Council in the process  and we stand ready tocontribute  taking the opportunity of our membershipin the Council.In the context of the United Nations developmentagenda  let me stress that Bulgaria  as an EU member is deeply committed to the implementation of theMillennium Development Goals and is working togradually increase its share as a donor of developmentand humanitarian aid  in compliance with thecommitments it has undertaken. During this Assemblysession  Bulgaria will sign the Food AssistanceConvention.Being myself a strong supporter of greater focuson education as a key area for sustainable development allow me to express my high appreciation for theinitiative of the Secretary-General “Education First”.I am convinced that in a knowledge-based network ofeconomies  education is the best investment in orderto prepare young generations for global citizenship.We welcome the designation of UNESCO’s Director-General  Mrs. Irina Bokova  as the ExecutiveSecretary for this initiative. In view of her outstandingperformance so far  Bulgaria advocates Mrs. Bokova’sre-election for a second term at the helm of UNESCOfor the period 2013 to 2017.We highly value UNICEF’s noble mission topromote children’s rights  safety and well-being. Overthe past few years  the role of UNICEF in Bulgariaevolved from the usual technical assistance to astrategic partnership with the Government in order topromote fundamental reforms. In November this year my country will host a UNICEF-sponsored high-levelregional conference on child care system reform.Finally  let me assure the Assembly that Bulgariawill continue to give its full support to the noble causeof building a stronger  rule-based multilateral systemwith an enhanced role for the United Nations at itscentre. Success on that path will be achieved only byworking together."
"18",738,"BHR",67,2012,"﻿It gives me pleasure to congratulateMr. Vuk Jeremić on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Iam confident that he will successfully manage thesession thanks to his competence and his rich and longexperience in diplomacy in the service of his friendlycountry  the Republic of Serbia. I also express our greatappreciation for the President of the Assembly at its lastsession  Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser ofthe fraternal State of Qatar  and thank him for the vitalrole he played  the constructive issues he advanced andhis excellent management of the work of the sixty-sixthsession. We are proud of him as a seasoned diplomatfrom a State member of the Gulf Cooperation Council and wish him every success in his future endeavours.Let me also express our great appreciation forSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and thank him forthe strenuous efforts he has made to enhance theeffective role of the Organization in various fields. Welook forward to a renewed role for the United Nationscompatible with the Secretary-General’s new vision sothat the Organization will be able to address the majorchallenges before it.Since joining the United Nations  the Kingdomof Bahrain has worked tirelessly to promote the noblepurposes and principles of the United Nations  inparticular  the maintenance of peace and security andthe development of cooperation and friendly relationsamong nations on the basis of mutual respect. Guidedby full respect for those principles  I am honoured torepresent a country that acts upon its internationalcommitments and has laid the foundations of a modernState through initiatives  planning and political andorganizational vision. We seek to build a modernsociety that is well organized and committed to itsvalues in various fields  notably education  health employment  vocational training  economic reform andthe advancement of women.Our country  Bahrain  has opted for dialogue asan approach to all its modernization efforts aimedat meeting the requirements of its long history. We conducted municipal elections in the 1920s andparliamentary elections in the past few decades.Important results have been achieved in providing agreater degree of equality  participation  transparency political rights and human dignity. That is truly ahistorical milestone on the path towards building asociety based on competitive sustainability  justice the rule of law  equality and the consecration of theprinciples of popular participation and representationin the decision-making process.Notwithstanding all those remarkable nationalachievements  since last year the Kingdom of Bahrainhas faced some serious challenges to its security andstability  which it has addressed in full transparency commitment and honesty. In that context  we establishedthe Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry toascertain the truth and provide redress. Consequently we launched a comprehensive dialogue among thevarious sectors of society that resulted in a series ofconstitutional and legislative reforms encompassing allaspects of life — political  economic  social and legal.Against that backdrop  His Majesty King Hamadbin Issa Al Khalifa of Bahrain proposed the creation ofan Arab court of human rights to lay the foundations ofan environment conducive to the protection of humanrights and the prevention of their abuse in the Arabworld  using the model of the Inter-American Court ofHuman Rights  the European Court of Human Rightsand the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights.The Council of the League of Arab States endorsed thathistorical initiative  and arrangements are currentlyunder way to establish the legal basis for the court’sestablishment. We hope that the court will become areality in the near future.Last week  consistent with our efforts to builda pluralistic Bahraini society and in full respect forthe protection and enhancement of human rights  theKingdom of Bahrain approved more than 90 per centof the recommendations made by the Human RightsCouncil in Geneva during its Universal Periodic Review including a possible accession to the Optional Protocolto the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.The challenges and threats facing our region haveled the States members of the Gulf Cooperation Councilto realize the need for greater synergies among them.They have endorsed the proposal of the Custodian ofthe Two Holy Mosques  King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud  to move from cooperation to union as ameans of addressing those challenges and threats andbuilding capacities to achieve a Gulf CooperationCouncil society based on a shared vision of the futurethat responds to the accelerating pace of the world andanswers to the aspirations of the peoples of the Gulfregion. They are convinced that their interests andgains can be served only through solidarity and unitywith a view to preserving national independence andState sovereignty and to meeting the needs arisingfrom the strategic transformations on the regional andinternational scenes.My country believes that the United Nations has anindispensable role to play in addressing internationaland regional problems and finding appropriatesolutions to them. Our region dearly needs that roleto be fulfilled  given the catastrophic and fast-paceddevelopments taking place in Syria. The internationalcommunity  represented by the United Nations andits organs and bodies entrusted with the maintenanceof international peace and security  is called uponto unify its position with a view to putting an end tothe humanitarian suffering of the Syrian people andfinding a political solution to the crisis that will endthe violence and bloodshed  preserve the unity of Syriaand the cohesion of its people  and spare the region as awhole serious repercussions that could spill far beyondthe borders of Syria.The United Nations must therefore shoulderits responsibilities to protect unarmed civilianswithout allowing the Organization’s procedures andmechanisms to impede its ability to prevent crimesagainst humanity from being committed. It must setaside narrow geopolitical interests and proceed toattain the supreme goal of protecting civilians in armedconflicts and wars. My Government welcomes theappointment of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi as Joint SpecialRepresentative of the United Nations and the Leagueof Arab States  and wishes him every success in hisendeavours to achieve the legitimate demands of thebrotherly Syrian people.On the basis of the same humanitarian principle we should also stand by the Rohingya Muslims inMyanmar in their ordeal and provide them withassistance and support while providing good counsel tothe Government of Myanmar in that regard.Although the Syrian crisis is preoccupyingthe international community today  the Palestinianquestion remains the core issue for the Arab States and the international community. The Kingdom of Bahrainbelieves that it is imperative to redouble efforts towardsa just  durable and comprehensive solution  notablythrough the creation of an independent Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital  in conformity withthe relevant United Nations resolutions  the Arab PeaceInitiative and the decisions of the international Quartet.We are extremely concerned at attempts to violate thesanctity of the holy sites in Al-Quds Al-Sharif and theattempts to alter their identity.We call on the international community tosupport Mahmoud Abbas  President of the State ofPalestine  who is striving relentlessly to defend thecause of his occupied country and to achieve a just andcomprehensive peace in the region. We therefore urgethe international community to demand that Israel ceaseits settlement activities in the occupied Palestinianterritories and dismantle settlements that jeopardizethe chances for peace. We also stress the need toimplement the relevant General Assembly and SecurityCouncil resolutions by putting an end to ongoing Israeliviolations and aggression  and to ensure the principlesof international legitimacy  notably the Fourth GenevaConvention of 1949  which prohibits any geographicalor demographic alteration in occupied territories. Welook forward to peace in our region  which would servethe interests of all its peoples.One tenet of our foreign policy is to enhance peaceand security in the region. In that regard  Bahrainreaffirms its unf linching position in favour of anuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. That willbe possible only by compelling Israel to implementrelevant international resolutions  to adhere to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to subject its nuclear facilities to the supervision ofthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).Moreover  we stress that the Islamic Republic ofIran must fulfil its commitments in full and transparentcooperation with the IAEA. Indeed  nuclear weaponsconstitute a serious threat to peace and security in theentire region  and various parties must therefore assumetheir responsibility for peace and security and refrainfrom the language of intimidation  threats and counter-threats that have recently dominated our region.In that regard  we stress the importance of anexcellent preparation process for the 2012 conferenceto be held pursuant to the agreement reached in theFinal Document of the 2010 Review Conference ofthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol. I)).We also reaffirm that the principle of establishinga nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East in noway precludes the right of all nations to access nucleartechnology for peaceful purposes  provided that theydo so in full transparency and abide by the IAEAguarantee system.While the States members of the Gulf CooperationCouncil (GCC) have extended their hand to theirneighbour  the Islamic Republic of Iran  they haveunfortunately found no positive Iranian response thatcould facilitate confidence-building  peace and security.On the contrary  we have had to endure constantinterference in our internal affairs from our neighbour.Recently  Iran has reiterated menacing threats to GCCMember States  in contradiction of the spirit of good-neighbourliness  thus generating tension and distrust inthe region. More importantly  the Kingdom of Bahrainreaffirms the need  either through direct negotiationsor through arbitration by the International Court ofJustice  to resolve the problem of the three UnitedArab Emirates’ islands of Abu Musa  Greater Tunb andLesser Tunb that are occupied by the Islamic Republicof Iran.With regard to the situation in brotherly Yemen we are aware of the need for a successful transitionalperiod in order to achieve security and stabilityin the country  in line with the agreement reachedwithin the framework of the GCC initiative and itsimplementation mechanisms. We welcome the stepstaken by Mr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour President of the Republic of Yemen  to launch a nationalYemeni dialogue  and we are fully confident of his wiseleadership of Yemen during this critical transitionalperiod  so that the aspirations of the Yemeni people canbe realized.In that regard  the Kingdom of Bahrain welcomesthe convening of the donors conference for Yemen held in Riyadh and sponsored by the Kingdom ofSaudi Arabia  and fully supports the recommendationsand conclusions agreed upon with a view to buildinga brighter future for brotherly Yemen  as well as theoutcome of the meeting of the Friends of Yemen  heldtoday in New York.We also reaffirm the unwavering  principled andconsistent position of the Kingdom of Bahrain  insolidarity with the Kingdom of Morocco  regarding thepreservation of the territorial integrity of Morocco and the peaceful settlement of the Moroccan Sahara issuepursuant to relevant Security Council resolutions.In regard to the current political developmentsin Somalia  the Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes theelection of Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the newPresident of the Somali Republic in the context ofthe transitional process. We call on the internationalcommunity to offer its support and assistance in therestoration of peace and security in the country and inthe preservation of Somalia’s territorial integrity andpolitical independence. We commend the efforts of theSomali Government  together with the internationalcommunity  to restore peace  stability and cooperation particularly in combating piracy in the Horn of Africa.We have recently witnessed ugly insults anddenigration addressed to our beloved ProphetMuhammad — peace be upon him  his family andhis companions. A typical example of that is theshameful video that the Kingdom of Bahrain condemnsin the strongest terms  and which led to violenceand destruction around the world. Our concern iscompounded by the unjustified aggression perpetratedagainst the diplomatic mission of the United Statesof America in Benghazi that killed AmbassadorChristopher Stevens and a number of innocentAmerican diplomats  in f lagrant violation of the ViennaConvention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961.In spite of these serious developments andrepercussions  we should not let that gloomy sceneovershadow the spectacle of the crowds that took tothe streets in Libya the following day to condemn thatabominable attack on the American mission. We areall responsible  as peoples and nations  to teach eachother about respect. We need to redouble our efforts toprevent the recurrence of insults to religions  prophetsand other religious symbols as Allah commands us inthe Holy Koran:“We have created you from male and femaleand made you peoples and tribes that you mayknow one another. Indeed  the most noble of youin the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you.Indeed  Allah is all-knowing and acquainted”(The Holy Koran  XLIX:13).The Kingdom of Bahrain is among the first tohave achieved most of the Millenium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs) before the prescribed time frame in thefields of education  the empowerment of women  theexpansion of social security to vulnerable groups  equal opportunities for men and women  and the enhancementof health services  notably for children. Therefore  theKingdom of Bahrain occupies an advanced positionat the global level  as reflected in the United NationsHuman Development Reports issued during the pastfew years.If the international community is to overcome thechallenges facing Member States  we must be able tofully shoulder their responsibilities  especially as thedeadline for achieving the MDGs is approaching. We areonly three and a half years from that deadline. We haveto redouble our efforts and review our policies in orderto enhance national and regional capacities to avoidimbalances and to overcome challenges. Accordingto the Millennium Development Goals Report 2012 and notwithstanding some negative indicators  childmortality has been decreasing across the world  thepercentage of those living in extreme poverty has beenhalved  and over 89 per cent of the world’s populationnow has access to safe drinking water.However  it seems that other objectives are stillunattainable in many countries  and inequalitiescontinue to rise in some areas such as public health thatremains dismal and a cause for great concern. That alsoapplies to the scarcity of water resources. We thereforecannot use the global financial crisis as an excusefor reneging on our financial commitments to thosecountries in greatest need.In that regard  Bahrain welcomes the outcomeof the United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment  as well as the Secretary-General’s visionwith regard to sustainable development. Much remainsto be done  however  to ensure that people across theworld not only have access to the most basic needs  butthat they have the tools to maintain them over time.We must acknowledge that sustainability is not merelya response to needs but rather a principal element ofhuman dignity.To conclude  I believe that the formidable changesand challenges our world faces today present valuableopportunities that we can exploit through wisdom courage  patience and joint action. We must work withall our capacity to address the elements that divide us particularly backwardness  extremism and isolationism.At the same time  we must continue to lend a handto those most in need. We must use objectivity andhonesty to challenge immobility and prejudice in order to achieve the progress  dignity and prosperity to whichour peoples aspire."

It is a particular privilege and honour to representmy country in this forum  having returned here throughthe magic of democracy after five years. For the firsttime since the general election in May  our countrynow reaffirms its re-engagement in and with the worldcommunity. We are part of the larger Caribbean region and in that context we took part in a meeting with theSecretary-General of this body. We thank him for hiscourtesy.However  it is important that the representation ofthe Bahamas on regional engagement with the UnitedNations not be misinterpreted as a complaint aboutlack of attention by the Secretariat. It was not based onpetulance but on the simple fact that the United Nationsin all its organs and manifestations must live up to itscreed that all nations in this body are equal  and not create the impression that some are more equal thanothers. Our delegation will continue to ensure that theguiding principle of that equality and equity is adheredto strictly.I would like to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić onhis assumption of his duties as President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session and to assure himof my delegation’s support and cooperation throughout.I also commend his predecessor for his stewardshipover the previous session.I also wish on this occasion to express thanks forthe stellar work and contribution to our country ofour Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Paulette A. Bethel.The Bahamas commends the United Nations for theconvening and the outcome of the High-level Meetingon the Rule of Law at the National and InternationalLevels last Monday. The Bahamas has committed itselfto the principle of the rule of law and to ensuring thecontinuation of good governance for the benefit ofthe entire populace of the Bahamas. The Bahamas iscommitted also to adhering to the rule at law at theinternational level and to upholding the principles ofthe Charter of the United Nations.The Bahamas commends the convening in June2012 of the third biennial review of the United NationsGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy. The Bahamasunequivocally condemns terrorism in all its formsand manifestations and reiterates its commitmentto the fight against terrorism and to the Strategy’sfull implementation. The Bahamas renews its callfor the timely conclusion of negotiations on a draftcomprehensive international convention for theelimination of terrorism.The Bahamas condemns in the strongest possibleterms the violence that resulted in the deaths ofAmbassador Christopher Stevens and three otherUnited States diplomats a few weeks ago. We in theinternational community must commit wholeheartedlyand sincerely to creating a culture of peace throughoutthe world  underpinned by tolerance and understanding that precludes such outrageous occurrences and theircauses.The level of armed violence and crime plaguingour society — due in large part to the illicit tradein small arms and light weapons and trafficking innarcotics  neither of which our country manufactures or supplies — is increasing and cannot be allowedto continue if we are to save successive generationsfrom a life steeped in violence and lawlessness. It hasbeen more than a decade since the adoption in 2001 ofthe United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Armsand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Yet there hasbeen no abatement in the level and intensity of armedviolence impacting our country.The Bahamas welcomes the recent convening andsuccessful outcome of the United Nations Conferenceto Review Progress Made in the Implementation of theProgramme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicatethe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weaponsin All Its Aspects. The Government reiterates itsunwavering commitment to the full implementation ofthe Programme of Action. The lives of too many of ouryoung people are being destroyed by the use of illicitweapons in our country. Now is the time to act.Creating a safe Bahamas is a top priority for theGovernment. We are committed to the creation of anational intelligence agency and a national firearmscontrol strategy  including the establishment of a firearmsdepartment and database  as well as to the enhancementof the operations of the country’s Defence Force so thatit can more effectively control the porous borders of theBahamas. I would like to take the opportunity to thankthe United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairsand the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace Disarmament and Development in Latin Americaand the Caribbean for their support and provision ofequipment and capacity-building assistance in the areaof firearms destruction and stockpile management. TheBahamas was pleased to conclude an agreement withthe United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs lastApril and to have participated in a number of regionaltraining programmes and workshops sponsored by theRegional Centre on the illicit trade in small arms andlight weapons and the strengthening of border controls.The Bahamas joins other delegations in expressingour profound disappointment at the outcome ofthe United Nations Conference on the Arms TradeTreaty held in July and the failure of Member Statesto agree on a text despite six long years of protractednegotiations. The Bahamas supports the viewsarticulated by the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago onbehalf of the Caribbean Community during the month-long Conference. What we say to thousands of innocentvictims is that their voices must be heard. But what do we say to them and their families  who are suffering as aresult of the irresponsible and unregulated internationaltransfer of conventional arms? Commitment and areassessment of human life and dignity versus profitare critical if we are to prevail in our fight against thescourge of armed violence and terror plaguing oursocieties. We look forward to a successful outcome inthe next round of negotiations.The Bahamas solemnly reaffirms its commitmentto the three pillars of sustainable development:economic  social and environmental. Advancementscontinue nationally in important areas pertaining tothe protection of our biodiversity and developmentof policies to promote renewable energy. Some arguethat finding out how to provide reliable and affordableenergy may be the single largest factor affecting thefuture development of the Bahamas. The issue of energyis so important that the Prime Minister has made it asa personal mission to seek to solve the issue. We knowthat we must do it sustainably.The Bahamas has enacted legislation to foster thesustainable use and management of ecosystems throughbetter land-use planning. Under the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea  we have initiatedactions to preserve our fish stocks by introducingpenalties for overfishing. We have also taken actionto ban long-line fishing  to establish the Bahamas as asanctuary for sharks and to establish and expand marineprotected areas. For the Bahamas  it is imperativethat those sustainable development strategies becomplemented with appropriate actions taken by theinternational community. In that connection  we viewthe historic outcome of the United Nations Conferenceon Sustainable Development (Rio+20) as offeringsignificant opportunities  particularly for small islanddeveloping States (SIDS). We are encouraged by theinternational community’s call for continued andenhanced efforts to assist SIDS in implementing theBarbados Programme of Action for the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States and theMauritius Strategy for Implementation. The Bahamasalso welcomes plans to convene the Third InternationalConference on Small Island Developing States and willparticipate actively in the upcoming General Assemblyconsultations to determine the modalities of the meetingwith a view to ensuring a successful outcome.The Bahamas is also encouraged greatly bythe decision taken at Rio+20 to undertake work onuniversal  action-oriented  sustainable development goals. In that work we must take into account differentnational realities  capacities and levels of developmentand must respect national policies and priorities. TheBahamas hopes to work in the context of the open-endedworking group for the development of the sustainabledevelopment goals as well as in the intergovernmentalcommittee on financing  agreed at Rio+20  to ensurethat our special concerns are fully addressed.In that connection  the Bahamas looks forward tothe recommendations of the Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on global post-2015 development planningand commends the level of female participation therein.The convening of the Panel offers a major opportunityto learn from the mistakes of the past and build avision for global development beyond mere crisismanagement. The Panel must be seen to operate withopen transparency. It should also incorporate the viewsof geographical and economic anomalies such as thoseof the Caribbean subregion  and be innovative andforward-looking.The Bahamas welcomes the acknowledgementat Rio of the need to address the adverse impacts ofclimate change.The Bahamas believes that the United Nations hasa central role to play in global economic governance.The Bahamas welcomes the efforts of the Group of 20(G-20)  particularly Mexico in the role as current Chair in helping to translate G-20 deliberations into effectiveactions on a global scale through broad consultationamong Member States and with the United Nations itselfto find solutions to many of the major challenges of ourtimes  most particularly with respect to strengtheningthe international financial system.The Bahamas also envisions a greater role for theUnited Nations in the area of international cooperationin tax matters. The Bahamas  along with the widerGroup of 77 and China  continues to call for theconversion of the United Nations Committee of Expertson International Cooperation in Tax Matters into anintergovernmental subsidiary body of the Economicand Social Council  in keeping with the Doha mandate.We also continue to deplore the use by some States oftheir domestic laws for extraterritorial effect in suchareas as human trafficking  financial services and drugsmuggling. We continue to believe that those lawswith extraterritorial effect are misplaced and put anunfair burden upon small States and that they may beinterpreted as a departure from the international norms of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrityof States.In order to reverse current economic trends  one ofthe core imperatives of the Government of the Bahamasis the strengthening of the domestic economy and theattendant creation of jobs  the broadening of Bahamianownership in the economy and the attainment of ahigher standard of living. Creating job opportunitiesand reversing the unacceptable unemployment situationin the country  which currently is at a high rate  havebeen identified at the highest political level as themost critical near-term priorities for the Government especially in relation to young Bahamians. I wish tospeak especially on their behalf today. The youngBahamian sector of our country has been most severelyaffected by the unemployment problem  and the rate ofunemployment is unacceptable and cannot continue.We are committed to solving youth unemployment.The Bahamas underscores the need for enhancedpolicy dialogue and international cooperation on thequestion of building green economies  which will indeedrequire new investments  skills formation  technologydevelopment and transfer and capacity-building.The gross national income of the Bahamas issignificantly affected by a small population of wealthyexpatriates whose high incomes skew the measureaway from the true economic realities. The constructof per capita gross national income  therefore  takeson a unique interpretation in the context of developingcountries like the Bahamas and  I would daresay  theCaribbean subregion. The Bahamas continues to bedeserving of considerations that will not deny us theright to develop sustainably  supported by financial human and technological resources. Gross nationalincome per capita should not be used as a pretext torestrict our access to financial assistance.The General Assembly is set to consider  duringthis sixty-seventh session  the scale of assessments forthe apportionment of the expenses of the United Nationsregular budget and peacekeeping operations for theperiod 2013-2015. The Bahamas takes this opportunityto reiterate its long-standing position that per capitagross national income  for the reasons given  should notbe accorded overriding weight in determining capacityto pay.A representative  transparent  responsive accountable  democratic and inclusive Security Council predicated on an increased membership in both the permanent and non-permanent categories  as well ason modification of its working methods  is overdue.My delegation sincerely hopes that the next round ofnegotiations on Security Council reform during thissession will result in tangible progress aimed at makingthe Council all that it can and should be.Our desire for the realization of unfulfilledpotential also extends to our regional partner  theRepublic of Haiti. The Bahamas has been unremittingand consistent in its support for the people of Haiti andtheir aspirations for peace  security and development.The Bahamas commends the important role of theUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti inproviding security in Haiti and in laying the foundationfor its long-term recovery and stability. Pledges madetoward Haiti’s recovery and reconstruction must behonoured and fulfilled so that the required work can beundertaken and completed.The Bahamas welcomes increased dialogue onimproving international cooperation with respectto international migration and development. Illegalmigration from Haiti is a vexing issue for our country.We agree that proper cooperation can certainly help toensure that migration occurs through safe and regulatedchannels and to leverage the contributions that migrantscan make to the development of our country. TheBahamas will continue to participate constructively inthe process leading to the second High-level Dialogueon International Migration and Development  to beheld by the General Assembly in 2013  with a view toaddressing those and other related issues so crucial toour development.Given the events over the past year in the Bahamaswith regard to illegal migration  some of which havebeen tragic  as well as poaching in our seas by illegalpersons from south of the country  the Bahamas willbe taking stronger measures over the next year to put astop to those illegal activities. We appeal to all nationsin the region to prevail upon their citizens to ceaseand desist from those unlawful activities. We intend towork both bilaterally and with the broader internationalcommunity to stop these assaults on our national andeconomic security.The Bahamas has made significant strides in theareas of maternal and child health and HIV/AIDS inthis  the fiftieth year since women obtained the rightto vote in the Bahamas. We are committed to theachievement of gender equality and the empowerment of women  as was affirmed by the Minister for SocialServices during the consideration of the report onBahamas by the Committee on the Elimination ofDiscrimination against Women at its fifty-secondsession  held in July. The Bahamas  nevertheless remains concerned about the increasing incidences ofnon-communicable diseases among the population  inparticular women  who are disproportionately affectedby such preventable diseases.We can draw much strength  wisdom andinspiration from the remarkable successes of ournations’ athletes nationally and subregionally at thisyear’s Olympics. On behalf of my delegation  I wouldlike to pay tribute to the youth of the world for theirstellar displays of camaraderie and talent at the recentOlympics. In this forum  I wish to salute in particularthe gold medal athletes of the Bahamas  namely Demetrius Pinder  Michael Mathieu  Chris Brown andRamon Miller. Indeed  the performances of the athletesfrom the entire Caribbean Community region arenoteworthy  particularly those of our sister countriesGrenada  Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. Thoseexamples can be seen as contributing as much to peaceand development in our world as our deliberationsand initiatives at this session  hence  our warmestcongratulations to them all.My delegation also wishes to record in this forumthe passing of my late friend and brother  the late PaulL. Adderley  who was the longest-serving Ministerfor Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas. His tenureincluded the most critical foreign policy challengesof an independent Bahamas to date. Sadly  he died on19 September. He believed in this world body and itstenets and exemplified how it can assist small States.It is therefore only fitting that we mark and record hispassing.The Bahamas continues to believe that mankind canaspire to and achieve a higher inner strength that notcan only cause us to excel even beyond our dreams  butalso can lift all around us  even nations and the entireworld. May each one of us therefore reach for that innerstrength  change our world and transform an agenda ofproblems into covenants of partnerships. It remains astrue as always that we need the United Nations."
"20",801,"BIH",67,2012,"﻿I would like to congratulatePresident Jeremić on his election and to thank Mr. NassirAbdulaziz Al-Nasser for having successfully presidedover the General Assembly at its previous session.I also wish to express my deepest gratitude toSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for having visited mycountry this past July. As we are marking the twentiethanniversary of our admission to the United Nations  hisvisit came as a recognition of the fact that Bosnia andHerzegovina has travelled a long way since joining theOrganization  having transformed itself from a recipientof security assistance into a contributor to global peaceand security.  I also want to commend the Secretary-General forhis tireless efforts to advance dialogue and cooperation and for his firm commitment to the core values andprinciples of the United Nations. We in Bosnia andHerzegovina recognize the importance of  and fullysupport  his action agenda  which identified fivegenerational imperatives: prevention  a more secureworld  helping countries in transition  empoweringwomen and youth  and sustainable development.Today’s world is the scene of unfolding crises andmounting global challenges. The first and foremost ofthese is the disaster in Syria. As we stand here  ourfellow Syrians are fighting against a brutal regime.They are fighting to take their destiny into their ownhands. The regime of Bashar Al-Assad is answeringtheir yearning for freedom and democracy with gunsand bombs  just as his father’s regime did 30 years ago.That is revolting and morally reprehensible — but so isour collective failure to stop it.Once again  we are idly standing by while a humantragedy of dramatic proportions is unfolding before oureyes. We should do our part to help the Syrian people’shistoric stand for freedom. We should do our part tosave the people of Syria from tyranny. We should  butwe are not.The images coming from Syria remind us of thetragedy of Bosnia. We in Bosnia and Herzegovina feelthe pain of the Syrian people as our own because wewent through the same horrors not that long ago. WhenSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Srebrenica with me this July to pay his respects to the genocidevictims  he said:“The international community must be unitednot to see any further bloodshed in Syria becauseI do not want to see any of my successors  after 20years  visiting Syria  apologizing for what we couldhave done to protect the civilians in Syria — whichwe are not doing now”.His predecessor  Kofi Annan  stated in the reporton the fall of Srebrenica:“Through error  misjudgment and an inabilityto recognize the scope of the evil confronting us we failed to do our part to help save the people ofSrebrenica ... The tragedy of Srebrenica will hauntour history forever” (A/54/549  para. 503)Today  those words about the Organization’s failure torespond to the tragedy in Syria ring true.The best way to honour the victims of the Srebrenicagenocide would have been to learn the lessons of thatfailure and never commit the same errors again. Sadly the United Nations  especially the Security Council has failed to do that. The international community haschosen yet again to repeat the trial-and-error patternof the policies that failed in Bosnia and Herzegovina.The resolutions  statements of concern  ineffectivesanctions  observers  and missions with no mandateto protect civilians are actions that have deadlyconsequences  as demonstrated in my country.Make no mistake. Unless we act now  and actdecisively  to help the people of Syria and put an end tothe bloodshed there  that tragedy will haunt our historyforever  just like Srebrenica.Developments at the beginning of the twenty-firstcentury defy rational prediction. Indeed  who couldhave predicted such an explosion of freedom in theMiddle East? In the last few years  we have witnessed ahistoric awakening in the Arab world. Profound socialand political changes aimed at creating democraticsocieties are under way now — changes that have beenfermenting for decades. They are the best confirmationthat Muslims strive vigorously for freedom  dignityand human rights. A well-educated  free-thinkinggeneration of young Arabs has finally broken thechains of dictatorship. No force can prevent that newgeneration from taking charge of its destiny.As a non-permanent member of the SecurityCouncil  Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly supportedthe Arab peoples’ aspirations for greater freedom anddemocracy. We acted to ensure that the internationalcommunity supported those who wanted free societiesinstead of closed ones  the rule of law instead ofthe rule of one individual  democracy instead ofdictatorship  justice and fairness instead of oppressionand corruption.The stalemate in resolving the Israeli-Palestinianconflict is also deeply troubling. The peace process isnot moving forward  and the chain of violence has notbeen broken. A new impetus to negotiations is urgentlyneeded  because there is no alternative to a negotiatedsolution. The Palestinians have every right — historical moral and legal — to a State of their own  but Israel hasevery right to its security. The occupation of Palestinianterritories must end  but so must the terror and violence.All attempts to create new realities on the ground in thehope that they will be accepted as a starting point forfuture negotiations must be rejected. The continuationof settlement activities in the occupied Palestinianterritories continues to pose the most serious obstacleto peace. Israel should immediately end all settlementactivities in the occupied Palestinian territories because those activities are illegal under internationallaw. Doing so is in Israel’s own best interest if it trulydesires peace with the Palestinians.The state of affairs of 60 or 6 000 years ago is notthe right point of reference. The right point of referencefor a solution is the principle of the peaceful coexistenceof two sovereign States — an independent Palestine anda secure Israel. That is the only realistic way to bringabout a just resolution to the conflict and to ensurestability and progress in the Middle East. To achievesuch a solution  a more sincere attempt at good-faithnegotiations is needed  especially on the part of Israel.The road to peace does not include ignoring UnitedNations resolutions  squeezing the Palestinians ontobits and pieces of the land that once belonged to theirfathers  and building settlements on those remainingbits of land.The Organization needs to send a strong messagedemanding that its resolutions be respected and thatthere be no double standards or chosen peoples whenit comes to the application of international legal normsand human rights principles. Over the past few weeks  we have witnesseddisturbing violence linked to intolerance. The videothat sparked those developments is deeply insulting. Itdeserves the strongest condemnation  and we absolutelyreject its content and message. There is no justification however  for responding to that movie with violence.Violence in response to speech is unacceptable. Therecan be no debate about that. Violence is no way tohonour religion. Responding to bigotry with violenceonly further fans the flames of intolerance. We mustdraw the line at violence  but we must also find a way toprevent hate speech and bigotry. Yes  there is the rightto free speech  but there is also the right to dignity.We cannot impose our ideology or our religion onanyone else. We must promote tolerance  but we mustalso promote mutual respect. That is why  as responsibleleaders  we should have a frank debate about the outerlimits of free expression when that freedom is abusedto incite hate and deliberately slander the dignity ofothers.There is no inherent contradiction between Islamicand Western values. On the contrary  those values arecompatible. After all  they are derived from the samesources. Throughout history  interactions betweenthose values have led to tremendous achievements.There need be no clash. There are only those who needto create a false perception of a clash in order to cometo power or maintain their hold on it.So many societies in today’s world are in transition yearning to find a balance between traditional andmodern values. The relationship between the West andthe Islamic world and between their respective valuesystems is going to be one of the most critical issuesof our time. That relationship will go through crisesand periods of misunderstanding and intolerance. Inthe modern age  we need to continue to seek a formula which is to say a model  for how to reconcile Islamicand Western values  East and West. No matter how hardit may be  finding that formula is going to be essentialin the time ahead of us.The human condition is one of diversity. Our humanrace is a mosaic composed of a rich variety of peoples cultures and religions that shine together in a dynamic sparkling pattern. Our responsibility is to nurture andprotect that mosaic.I come from a country whose historical experiencecan offer valuable lessons in finding a model for peacefulcoexistence within such diversity. The whole world can benefit from the lessons that my country has learnedfrom constantly seeking to improve its understandingand management of diversity. For hundreds of years its citizens lived in harmony  helping each other buildhouses of worship that are physically almost leaningon each other. The westernmost range of OrthodoxChristianity and Islam  the easternmost range ofCatholicism  Bosnia is a meeting point of civilizations a bridge between East and West. Its unique multi-ethnicculture has been woven through a thousand years oftolerance and respect among its citizens  regardless oftheir ethnic and religious affiliation. That is why itspreservation and success  as a specific microcosm  iscrucial for the whole world.However  owing to our recent past  a great struggleis now under way in my country between the idea ofcoexistence and the idea of division. I believe that theoutcome of that struggle will have a significant bearingon resolving one of the greatest challenges of ourtime  that of conflict versus cooperation. If the idea ofcoexistence and cooperation does not prevail in Bosnia it can hardly prevail anywhere else in the world. If theunique social fabric of my country  which was torn bycrimes and force  is not restored  that will be a defeatfor the very idea of coexistence  which will produce awidening gap at one of the most delicate fault lines ofthe world.The growing power of humankind brings progressand prosperity. Yet the selfish side of that power cutsinto the very substance on which our future depends namely  our physical habitat and our spiritual essence.The world we live in is changing at a speed andin a direction that is rightfully worrisome. Inequality injustice and intolerance are on the rise. There is moreconflict and less cooperation. There is ever moreviolence and ever less compassion  solidarity  mutualcare  healthy interpersonal relations and family life.People around the world are taking to the streets  whichis a dramatic warning that there is less and less fairnessin the societies in which they live.Those unsettling trends can be reversed only bydecisive and coordinated global action. The future wedesire will not be just a utopia if we join our forcesto find the right solutions. Cooperative approaches aredifficult to accomplish but are needed more than ever. We are not perfect  and we can be better. We canbe wiser  more responsible  more willing to learn fromour past mistakes. Too often we have been prisonersof our own mentalities. We perceive willingness tocompromise as a weakness  but just the opposite istrue — compromise requires courage. To build a futurewe must make compromises. To succeed we muststop indulging in manipulative kinds of populism. Wemust break out of the worn and frayed patterns of thepast. We must turn to the future. Instead of havingendless debates about what has been  we must devoteourselves to reaching agreements about what can be.We must more correctly interpret the interests of thosewe represent. We must listen to the views of others  nomatter how different those views might be. We mustunderstand each other better and respect each othermore.Our most important mission in the time to comewill be to build bridges between cultures  religions andcivilizations — bridges of trust  understanding andrespect  bridges to reach out to problems the true natureof which we have only begun to understand. That is hardwork that requires daring leadership. The Organizationhas undergone difficult trials  but it has always been thebest framework for building those bridges. Let us keepit that way as we go forward."
"21",848,"BLR",67,2012,"﻿We ofteninvoke the phrase “the spirit of San Francisco”. We dothat when we speak and think about positive aspects ofinternational relations. Indeed  the message sent fromthe 1945 Conference in San Francisco offered immensehope to the generation that had just survived the mosthorrible war ever experienced — hope for buildinga fundamentally new world. Justice was intendedto replace violence  cooperation was to replacelawlessness. The United Nations  founded in that city was called upon to become the key element of a neworder.Have the hopes  born in San Francisco  cometrue? To some extent  they have. After all  today thereis no sign of the sharp ideological confrontation thatcharacterized the twentieth century. Nor is there thedirect  open conflict between the major Powers that hadmarked all previous centuries with its violence. Whatis more  such scourges as colonialism  slavery andapartheid have been irrevocably consigned to oblivion.But the spirit of San Francisco was about somethingmore than just preventing the recurring mistakes ofthe past. First and foremost  it was a message about apromising future. Unfortunately  that is precisely whathas failed to become a reality. Why? Reinhold Niebuhr an outstanding American philosopher who was writingin those fateful times  noted that general communityis established only when the knowledge that we needone another is supplemented by the recognition that theother form of life  or that unique other community  isthe limit beyond which our ambitions must not run.Today that point is as insightful as it was then.Some countries see neither the limits of their foreignpolicy nor forms of statehood other than their own.And that is exactly what gives rise to many of today’sgeopolitical problems. States that refuse to followpatterns imposed from the outside and choose to defendtheir real sovereignty must pay dearly for that right.Take the case of Cuba. The historic choice to pursuean independent path of development that was made by its people more than five decades ago encounteredrejection and economic blockade on the part of thosewho still believe  in the twenty-first century  that theycan continue to write the history of humankind in thesame manner as they did in the past. And that is not theonly example.Belarus is fully convinced that any attempt to makesomeone do something against their will is doomed tofail. Are we not learning the lessons of the past? Afterall  neither weapons nor wealth constitute the greatestsource of power on Earth. That power stems ratherfrom the spirit of self-determination. If a nation hasembarked on its own path of peaceful and progressivedevelopment  then no external force is able to stop it inits tracks. Battles can be won against such a nation  butnever wars.The time of imperialism  in whatever lofty slogansit is now being dressed — democracy  human rights good governance — is irreversibly past. Furthermore today we are weighed down by global economicchallenges  nearly all of which have resulted from apolicy of so-called market fundamentalism relentlesslypursued by its proponents over the past four decades.Its major outcome is a steady rise in inequality atall levels. Essentially we are witnessing the greatdivergence. Clearly  the situation resembles a slowlyticking time-bomb of future mass upheavals fraughtwith unpredictable consequences.Unfortunately  the current economic woes arestructural and therefore unlikely to be quickly anddecisively resolved. That is attested to by the fact thatthe crisis persists all over the world four years afterit began. The measures adopted over that period havefailed to do much to remedy the situation. Yet  whatis far more disturbing is that the countries whosepolicies had nothing to do with market fundamentalismhave also experienced severe hardships. Because ofthe growing global interdependence of all aspects ofinternational life  they simply have no other option.We call attention to another chronic ailment ofmodernity  of a moral nature. Double standards in theforeign policy of the world Powers have become a norm.As a result  those major world players are willing to go togreat lengths to cater to the interests of their “friends”.Yet they advocate the forced imposition of democracyand human rights on their adversaries. Guided solely bytheir own interests  the players who were shaking handswith you yesterday openly contribute to your downfalltoday. In considering human rights situations in other countries under a microscope  those players haverefused to acknowledge the obvious faults in their owncountries. In other words  we have come to witness therise of unscrupulous and barbaric behaviour in foreignpolicy that is worthy of the teachings of Machiavellihimself.It is unfortunate that the United Nations  by andlarge  has been sidelined in that context. Nevertheless it has not been the fault of the Organization. Thebrainchild of San Francisco has simply not been allowedto function in the manner conceived by its founders.Is there a way out of the seemingly hopelesssituation? We are certain that there is. The currentchallenges have not become insurmountable yet. Wewill be able to overcome them. However  that willrequire us to revive the spirit of San Francisco. Weshould return to the principles and foundations  whichcould serve as the building blocks for a better worldtoday. Multilateralism  justice and cooperation are asrelevant today as they were in 1945.So  what in practical terms must be done? Belarusdoes not pretend to have exhaustive answers. We wouldlike just to draw attention to four areas that  in our view are most crucial: the rule of law  politics  economicsand the environment. First  to establish the rule of lawglobally  the system of international law must becomefully functional. Forged through centuries of suffering it is the foundation without which all other elementsof modern civilization cannot operate. Having signedthe Charter of the United Nations  the world’s countriescommitted themselves to abide by the principles ofinternational law. In other words  they refused to liveany longer under conditions of destructive anarchy andlawlessness.International law has been shaped as a historiccompromise between the interests of all States. Itmay be supplemented and revised only if all Statesagree to do so. There should be no place for arbitraryinterpretations that seek to subordinate internationallaw to private interests. Let us bear in mind that suchbehaviour leads to infringement of the interests of otherinternational actors. That is why no trendy conceptssuch as humanitarian intervention or responsibility toprotect can justify interference in the internal affairs ofsovereign States.Secondly  in political terms  we need a stable andpredictable global order. It is up to us whether we willhave one. Global systems cannot establish and manage themselves — they result from human action. At thispoint we are living in a system that may be viewed asa dysfunctional multipolarity. Indeed  we are forcedto witness a rising number of global players that areproving unable to cope effectively with increasingglobal demands.If we fail to restructure the situation  then wewill most likely end up with a scenario that is evenworse — something that resembles the dark era of theMiddle Ages but aggravated by ever more dangeroustransnational threats and challenges. Thus  again wereturn to the perennial question: how is it possible tobuild an effective global order in a world that lacks aglobal government?We can offer an idea. A responsewould involve addressing the structural issue by meansof a functional approach. Let us try to devise an effectiveglobal system by tackling specific functional problems.After all  is it not the case that all positive-mindedglobal stakeholders have an interest in addressing fewerproblems or eliminating them altogether?We are deeply convinced that global partnershipswill provide the means whereby we realize that vision.They can bring together multiple players on the worldstage in a common effort against specific transnationalthreats and challenges. So let us begin working on andimplementing functional partnerships on each of theissues. Indeed  my country has already been doing justthat  for instance  in the fight against human traffickingwithin the framework of the global partnership againstslavery and human trafficking proposed by Belarussome time ago.Thirdly  there is the economic dimension. Massprotests across the world  like the Occupy Wall Streetmovement  testify to public rejection of the prevailingdevelopment model. This is hardly surprising; afterall  the model was built with the interests of corporatecapital in mind. Clearly  the classic recipe of Adam Smithdoes not work in a modern world. Contrary to generalexpectations  the invisible hand of the market has notled to universal public well-being. The experience ofthe past few decades indicates that the invisible handcontributes to the enrichment of the corporate sectoralone  while impoverishing others.The global economy of the twenty-first century istoo sophisticated to be left to the whims of market forces.That economy requires a reasonable balance amongits various elements. As far as the balance per se isconcerned  it cannot be established by default  someonemust do it. Only a State is able to accomplish that task  and more crucially  a strong  socially oriented State thatdoes not live by borrowing from future generations  asis currently the case in some advanced countries.We areconvinced that a State-based paradigm  as we suggest will permit the severe imbalance to be redressed.Likewise  it is key to significantly reducing poverty inthe world.Finally  what is required of us in terms of theenvironment? Climate change is the central anddefining challenge of today’s world. This is the wallthat separates current and future generations from aprosperous future. Our efforts in all other areas willprove futile if we fail to tackle this core challenge. Wemust preserve the life-giving ecosystem of the Earth.This  therefore  is where there is the greatest need forcomprehensive international cooperation.The United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment (Rio+20) was held in June. TheConference’s decisions essentially marked the start of anew green deal that is expected to rally all stakeholdersfor common action. We need to move forwarddecisively to implement its individual elements. It is above all  about elaborating sustainable developmentgoals and ensuring the transfer and integration ofgreen technologies. In the context of the follow-up toRio+20  the formulation of a comprehensive UnitedNations energy agenda must be seriously considered.We believe it would contribute to an urgently neededcomprehensive approach to addressing the interrelatedissues of climate change  energy and food security.The United Nations is the natural place for theimplementation of all the ideas articulated above. Noother international body possesses such universallegitimacy. Let us therefore  at last  empower theUnited Nations. We are certain that the United Nationswill then be able to realize with dignity the vision setforth in San Francisco so many years ago."
"22",883,"BLZ",67,2012,"﻿It is my distinct honourto address the Assembly on behalf of the Governmentand people of Belize. I wish to congratulate Mr. VukJeremić on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session. I am confidentthat he will guide the deliberations of the Assembly ina forthright and skilful manner.I take this opportunity to reaffirm Belize’sunequivocal commitment to the principles  goalsand ideals of the United Nations  and to pledge ourunconditional support for the success of its endeavours.Based on its performance over the past 67 years  wefeel confident to opine that  whereas the United Nationsis unquestionably imperfect  just as our democracy isimperfect  our United Nations is also  however — likedemocracy — the best institution devised by mankinddedicated exclusively to achieving a safer  more justand prosperous world.As the twenty-first century inexorably evolves laying bare the fragility and vulnerability of our planetto dangerous global forces  both natural and man-made which threaten the existence of all living things onour planet  the genius and prescience of the foundingfathers in creating the United Nations is illuminatedbeyond doubt. It is probably debatable whether in1945 the imperative for mankind to work togetherin harmony to ensure the survival of our very planetwas appreciated by all nations. It may be questionablewhether it was universally appreciated in 1945 that itwas absolutely necessary to have a global institutiondedicated to the protection of mankind against man’spenchant for causing destruction as well as againstNature’s destructive elements and forces. Today however  the need for the United Nations is not onlymanifest to everyone  but there are clarion calls for itto do more and to be more inclusive  representative anddemocratic  calls to which Belize adds its voice.My country gained its independence largely inconsequence of a resolution of the United Nationscalling upon the United Kingdom to grant us ourindependence by the end of 1981  thereby bringing toan end more than 100 years of colonial administration.But whereas we attained our political independence inSeptember 1981  our sovereignty over our homeland isstill being threatened by a territorial claim dating backto the post-1940s by our neighbour Guatemala. We therefore find the theme for this session’sdebate a timely and fitting one  namely  bringing aboutadjustment or settlement of international disputes orsituations by peaceful means. Happily  I can todayinform the Assembly that the Governments of Guatemalaand Belize both have agreed to a recommendation ofthe Secretary-General of the Organization of AmericanStates to allow the Guatemalan claim to be adjudicatedupon by the International Court of Justice if that isthe will of the citizens of our respective countries  asexpressed in simultaneous referendums to be held on6 October 2013.The resolution of the territorial differendumbetween Belize and Guatemala will not only consolidateBelize’s sovereignty and territorial integrity  but alsoenhance the peace and security of our subregion and beconducive to the strengthening and deepening of ourregional integration process.Belizeans are a peace-loving people. We abhorconflict. We believe in the rule of law. And we havefaith in the United Nations.With almost half of our population under the ageof 25 and approximately 37 per cent under the age of18  our nation’s future and destiny are inextricably tiedto the welfare of our children. And in order for themto attain their full potential  they must be properlynurtured and fed with balanced  nutritious meals. Theymust be safely and comfortably housed and they mustbe properly educated and trained  beginning from thetime they are in the cradle. Our children must be trainedand educated especially in science and technology.They must be trained to think creatively  to be fiercelycompetitive  to be industrious and to be prudent inthe management of our resources. Our Government isconvinced that it is only with this type of training anddevelopment that our citizens will be able to competesuccessfully in the world market and generate thewealth that is required to transform our society into atruly developed nation. If we fail our children today  weare setting ourselves up to fail in our common future.With a view to attaining development objectives our Government has initiated some ambitious comprehensive pro-poor policies. For example  ourGovernment is committed to a programme to ensure thatlow-income Belizean families do not have to face thedifficult choice between sending their children to schoolor buying food. Qualifying families in underservedrural or urban areas can already rely on our conditionalcash-transfer programme and on our food pantryprogramme. We provide education subsidies to familiesof children attending secondary school. We continueto emphasize and expand early childhood educationand to improve access to alternative education. We areinvesting in improving the quality of the health care towhich our citizens have access.As a small State that took its place among thenations of the world only 31 years ago  Belize isexperiencing all the growing pains that naturally afflictthe young. Furthermore  our situation is aggravated bythe fact our population is less than 350 000 persons who trace their origins to all over the globe and areconsequently multi-ethnic  multi-faith  multilingualand multicultural. With such a diverse population  theurgency of social cohesion cannot be overstated. Whenwe add to this mix the challenges which today confrontus all  occasioned by natural disasters such as climatechange and by man-made ones such as the globalfinancial collapse and transnational criminal activity it becomes readily apparent that it is wholly beyondthe capacity of any one Government to discharge itsobligation towards its citizens solely through nationalinitiatives and devices and solely with domesticresources.For this reason  the Belize Government hasembraced the multilateral system and our cooperationpartners around the world. We are partnering withthem in many fields  including economic  social environmental and humanitarian  in our perennialquest to better secure all our citizens and develop themto their fullest potential. In this regard  United Nationsfunds  programmes and agencies such as the UnitedNations Development Programme  the United NationsPopulation Fund  UNICEF  UNESCO  the Food andAgriculture Organization of the United Nations  theUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime  and theWorld Health Organization are working tirelessly withcountries like Belize to carry out the decisions of theinternational community and support efforts to meetthe aspirations of our people. Belize avails itself of thisopportunity to thank all our development partners forthe tremendous contributions they make daily to thesecurity and development of our country and people.We know that more can and  indeed  must be doneto raise our ambitions in delivering for the poor  for theneedy and for the vulnerable. It is therefore urgent thatwe move to shape a post-2015 development agenda thatreflects our equal stake in a common future  addresses the concerns of the wealthy and strong  and meets theneeds of the poor and the vulnerable.Belize remains fully supportive of all regionalinitiatives. We have sought and obtained membershipin the Organization of American States  the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM)  the Central AmericanIntegration System and the Community of LatinAmerican and Caribbean States. We work closely in allthese subregional groupings on the issues of concernto us such as climate change  security and economicdevelopment. And here we feel constrained to pointout that the impact of climate change on our region hasbeen direct  dire and devastating  compelling us to joinforces with our CARICOM partners and with the widerAlliance of Small Island States to advance our interestsin the climate change negotiation process. In thatconnection  Belize is proud of its contribution as hostnation of the CARICOM Climate Change Centre  whichis tasked to provide technical and scientific adviceto inform subregional policy positions in executingadaptation and mitigation projects in our subregion andto raise awareness of the deleterious impact of climatechange in our respective countries. We thank the staffof that institution for the sterling work they are doing.With respect to the nefarious enterprises oftransnational trafficking in humans  drugs and arms Belize subscribes to the view that a regional responseis imperative to combat these pernicious scourges.Our countries are not the markets for these illicitcommodities. Our countries do not benefit fromthe immense profits generated by these criminalenterprises  yet we bear the burden of having to divertscarce resources  badly needed for development  tocombat the activities of these merchants of death anddestruction. Indeed  our countries are overwhelmed bythe grim tasks which now befall us of having to mendthe shattered lives of our children and of mourningtheir untimely deaths. That is why Belize is committedto the implementation of the Central America RegionalSecurity Strategy and to working with our partnersto ensure that the Strategy has the level of supportnecessary to guarantee that it is effective.Our region  Central America and the Caribbean has been labelled as among the most violent regionsof the world  with homicide rates that have reachedcrisis levels  occasioned largely by the use of smallarms and light weapons. But almost all small arms andlight weapons found in our region start out as legallymanufactured and legally traded arms. Every Memberof the United Nations is involved in some measure in thistrade  which we believe is of dubious value to mankind.It is therefore deeply regrettable that  despite whatappeared to be an emerging consensus and despite theunderlying global urgency of a multilateral response the conclusion of an arms trade treaty has so far beenbeyond the reach of the international community. Itis urgent  in our view  that we redouble our efforts tobreak the gridlock and reach the compromise necessaryto arrive at a consensus on an arms trade treaty as soonas possible.The States of Latin America and the Caribbean arealmost all classified — wrongly and unjustly  in ourview — as middle-income countries. That is a genericclassification that masks the varied challenges ourcountries continue to face arising from poverty  highlevels of income inequality  economic vulnerabilitiesand debt. As a consequence  all our countries havebeen calling for a change in paradigm so that theclassification of countries as middle-income countriesno longer guides development cooperation. We urge allour development partners to heed this call and addressthis situation.Finally  we would like to echo the call of otherMembers of this institution who have advocated thelifting of the economic embargo against Cuba  whichcontinues to fetter the development of that sisterCaribbean nation and its people.Belize also notes and joins those positive voicesthat support Taiwan. We therefore urge Taiwan’s fullparticipation in the United Nations.We ask also that urgent attention be given to theconcerns of the people of Israel and Palestine  whoselegitimate expectation to live peaceful  fruitful livescontinues to be frustrated. And we stand in solidaritywith the citizens of the Middle East  particularly thosein Syria  in their quest for those democratic freedomsto which we all aspire.As we move ahead to take on the new challengesthat will emerge during the sixty-seventh session  aswe redouble our efforts to address the long-standingproblems our world faces  and as we renew our faithin the multilateral system  the role of the Assemblyand of our United Nations Organization will becomeincreasingly critical and relevant. This is the only bodythat is truly universal in character and which commandslegitimacy and authority. The entire world looks to theUnited Nations to solve the multitudinous problems which beset mankind. In the circumstances  the UnitedNations is simply just too big to fail in the discharge ofits singular obligation: to safeguard the well-being andsafety of humankind and planet Earth."
"23",930,"BOL",67,2012,"﻿The meetings we hold at the United Nations arealways very important events at which we debatesocial  environmental  political and economic issuesthroughout the world. I commend the President of theGeneral Assembly on having chosen as our centraltheme the peaceful settlement of disputes throughoutthe world.I wish to take the great opportunity of my presencehere today at the United Nations to inform theAssembly about a dispute between Chile and Bolivia.In 1879  as the result of an unjust war — an unjustinvasion — masterminded by Chilean oligarchicalinterests  with the participation of transnationalcorporations with an eye on Bolivia’s natural resources we lost our corridor to the Pacific Ocean.Bolivia was founded in 1825 and lost access to thesea in 1879. In the early 1900s  a treaty was signed thathas not been complied with. It is for that reason that Ihave come here to take advantage of the theme of ourdebate  the peaceful settlement of disputes  to say thatmajor disputes among States have been resolved andinjustices rectified through the resolve and goodwill ofthe relevant authorities.Chile cannot disregard Bolivia’s rights or thepronouncements of an entire continent  much lessprolong indefinitely our forcibly imposed landlockedstatus. An unjust  imposed and non-implemented treatycannot be allowed to continue to harm a people that isonly calling for justice and for an end to its country’sstatus as a landlocked country.The intangibility of treaties means that they arenot dogma. Treaties  like all other creations of human beings  can be changed. I say that because when we statethat Chile must return our sea corridor  we are asked what treaty? I therefore wish to take this opportunityto speak of a treaty signed in 1903 between the UnitedStates and Panama on the Panama Canal.In 1903  a treaty on the Panama Canal was signedunder which the United States was authorized to build thePanama Canal and received sovereignty  in perpetuity over the territories on both sides of the Canal and thearea of the Canal. In other words  according to theTreaty of 1903  that country would be the owner for alleternity of the Panama Canal. However  a renegotiatedtreaty was signed in 1977 that gradually transferredsovereignty over the Canal zone from the United Statesto Panama  and in 1999 Panama recovered control andadministration of the Canal through the Panama CanalAuthority.How did the United States return the Panama Canalto Panama when  through the first treaty  it had to bethe owner of the Canal in perpetuity? And how is itpossible for Chile not to return Bolivia’s sea corridor?I wish also to take this opportunity to say thattoday  in this millennium  is a time of integration andof focus on the protection of humankind  not a time ofdomestic or external colonialism. That is why I wish toreaffirm once again that the Malvinas are for Argentinaand the sea is for Bolivia. These demands  conflicts anddisputes have to be resolved peacefully  and Bolivia isa peace-loving country  in keeping with the State’s newpolitical Constitution.Bolivia appeals once again to the Government ofChile  here before the Assembly  to resolve definitivelythe issue of our landlocked status through peacefulsettlement mechanisms. We call on the internationalcommunity to support us in that endeavour  so that thisconflict  which does great harm to the integration of theAmerican continent  may finally come to an end.Among the Bolivian people  among children andgrandparents alike  there is a strong sense of the needto recover our sea corridor. Bolivia was born with a sea and it is not possible that oligarchies and transnationalcompanies  in order to plunder our natural resources can be allowed also to wrest from us our territory. Weneed the support of all those at the helm of the UnitedNations to put an end to a historical injustice on the partof international Powers. Yesterday I listened to the various statements onissues related to democracy  human rights and peace and I feel that the statements we make here as Presidentsshow that we agree in theory. All of us here are greatdefenders of human rights who want peace and defenddemocracy. But we are divided. The United Nations isnot united  and that makes a great difference. I listenedvery carefully to the statement made by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon telling us that we have to changethe world. We very much agree that we have to changethe world. But how can we change the world if we donot change the United Nations? How can the UnitedNations be responsible for interventionism on manycontinents?I have listened to two or three addresses by severalcountries  and I was very pleased. There seems to be arebellion on the part of States against powers  authorityand capitalism. I am very pleased  because when I camehere for the first time in 2006  only the countries of theBolivarian Alliance for the Countries of Our America with great ideological  political and programmaticclarity  stated that everything was for the people. Iknow some countries on other continents — very timidand fearful countries — feel that today are losing theirfear of the Powers. I would like to say to them  to theirrepresentatives and to their Presidents that we shouldnot be afraid. We should not be afraid of empires orcapitalism. Capitalism and imperialism are not thesolution to life or to humanity.We are living in times of the crisis of capitalism of a crisis in food. I remember when I was still atrade union leader  we conducted campaigns to havethe external debt of underdeveloped countries — atthat time  they were called underdeveloped countries instead of developing countries — cancelled. Now Irealize that our debt as poor countries can be paid  butthe debts of capitalism are impossible to pay. That iswhat the world we are living in today shows.We speak here of democracy. We have to defenddemocracy and  in order to do that  we have tointervene in some countries. But if we really wanted tobe democratic  we would respect all of the resolutionsof the United Nations. Just to cite an example  does theGovernment of the United States of America respectUnited Nations resolutions on the economic embargoagainst Cuba? It has never respected them. That is dueto pride on the part of the rulers  not of the Americanpeople. The rulers are never going to respect those resolutions  but they speak of democracy and ofdefending democracy.In that connection  I must express our full backing forthe Cuban people. Their commander  former PresidentFidel Castro  the most caring person in the world thatI have ever known — and I admire that revolutionarypeople — is  despite the embargo  engaged in continuousbattle at the side of his people. It is not possible that in thetwenty-first century an economic embargo continuesagainst the Cuban people  a genocidal embargo thathas failed and which violates the rights of an entirepeople. The embargo has been condemned by almostall of humankind and the international community including the allies of the United States of America for its extraterritorial character and its imposition inviolation of humanitarian and international law. Boliviaalso denounces the unjust inclusion of Cuba on the listunilaterally assembled by the United States in its reportentitled “State Sponsors of Terrorism”  the purpose ofwhich is to justify the embargo and continue imposingnew sanctions on the regime and the people of Cuba.What authority does the Government of the UnitedStates have to include a country in the list of terroristcountries? Do not all the peoples of the world realizethat the number one terrorist country practicing Stateterrorism is the Government of the United States?There have been so many interventions  so many deadand wounded  so much killing — under the pretext ofdefending democracy.Moments ago  a fellow president spoke about anintervention in Libya to restore democracy  which isa lie. They intervened in Libya not for its people butto recover oil for the Powers. We have to be sincereand straightforward with humankind  but where thereare presidents who stay in power without practicingdemocracy but are in favour of capitalism andimperialism  there is no intervention because they areallies of the United States Government; they are alliesof the empire; they are allies of capitalism. Where thereare natural resources  like oil  in the hands of the people they have to intervene under any pretext — terrorism dictatorship or drug trafficking — all of it to recover orto plunder the natural resources.Furthermore  I would also like to launch an appealfor the immediate release of five Cuban anti-terroristpolitical prisoners in the United States. Their releasewould show a political will to defend human rights.The President of the United States could release them;the power to do so is in his hands. I hope that justice will be done to our five Cuban brothers  who have beenimprisoned unjustly.In truth  I do not understand it when the presidentswho speak in defence of human rights are never theones who respect human  either within or outsidetheir own countries. I do not understand how one canspeak of peace while there are economic inequalitiesin the world. While there is an economic policy thatconcentrates capital in the hands of a few and whichimpoverishes many  there will never be justice  therewill never be peace or respect for human rights. Indeed the economic models that concentrate capital in a fewhands provoke injustice and create uprisings.I feel that now is the best time — I am referringto various meetings at the United Nations — to gainbetter understanding of the situation of all the peoplesof the world. We had requested the revision of someimportant international treaties concerning a veryimportant product for the indigenous peoples of theAndean region  the coca leaf. Although the coca leaf hasmedicinal and ritual properties  it has been penalizedunder the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.Therefore  Bolivia  which wishes to remain faithful toits commitment to fight drug trafficking  has requestedadherence to the Single Convention with a reservationthat preserves the right to use coca leaf for culturalpurposes  especially medicinal purposes  within ourterritory.In some states of the United States  it is legal tosell cocaine  but the United States does not allow us toconsume coca leaf — which is not cocaine. I welcomethe support for the proposal on the part of manycountries of the continent and the world — non-alignedcountries — recognizing  after thousands of years  theconsumption of coca leaf as legal. I respectfully requestthat the Assembly  acting on behalf of the UnitedNations  correct a historical prejudicial act.Unfortunately  since there is an illegal market forcoca leaf  that is  a market for cocaine or drugs  a portionof the harvest is diverted to the illegal market — but weare fighting that. We in Bolivia say that there will be nofree cultivation of coca  but there cannot be zero cocaleaf.I commend the United Nations for issuing a report afew weeks ago affirming that  for the first time  Boliviahad reduced the cultivation of coca by more than 12 percent. That is a Government achievement without anydead or wounded; previously  that kind of reduction resulted in many dead and wounded. Now  whilemaintaining respect for human rights and appealingto the conscience of my coca-producing brothers andsisters  we have had a net reduction.Coca cultivation has increased in some countries which are subsequently decertified by the United Statesof America. But the United States has also decertifieda country like Bolivia  even though it has reduced thecultivation of coca by 12 per cent. Do we then have toplant more coca for the Government of the United Statesto certify us? One cannot understand it. Of course since we are an anti-capitalist and anti-imperialistpeople and Government  we have been decertified. Thatdecertification is a political statement; it does not takeinto account the efforts made by the Bolivian peoplethrough its Government.We are not interested in whether we are certifiedor not. That is the least of it. What we are interestedin is the United Nations data. Honestly  the UnitedNations works in a transparent manner to recognizethe work that our Government has done to reduce cocacultivation.I would also like to take this opportunity to talkabout the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).Bolivia was previously a little-known country that hadbeen abandoned  living on foreign aid. We welcomedforeign aid. I would just like to present what we haveachieved since we took charge in Bolivia  in the contextof the MDGs.Bolivia was supposed to reduce extreme povertyto 24.1 per cent by 2015. I would like to report that by 2011  we had reduced extreme poverty to 20 percent. We have a plan. By the time Bolivia celebrates itsbicentennial  we will have eradicated extreme poverty.The numbers from international organizations confirmthat  last year  10 per cent of the population went fromextreme poverty to the middle class. That is 1 millionBolivians.The second figure to note is that  according to theMDG targets  78.5 per cent of the population shouldhave access to safe drinking water by 2015. I wouldlike to say that  as a result of our programme  this yearwe reached 78.5 per cent of the country  especially theindigenous rural communities. We have a programmecalled “My Water” to promote greater investmentsin water. What I did personally was to bring togetherall of the projects on safe drinking water or water forirrigation from every municipality in the country. Forthe second year in a row  we have invested $300 000 per municipality  and that has been rather helpful  inaddition to other programmes by the Ministry of theEnvironment and Water  in particular in cities and inrural areas. Those programmes for drinking water meanthat we have achieved our goal in 2012  not in 2015.Hopefully  by 2015 we will have achieved 90 or 100 percent drinking water coverage. That is our programme.Another of the Goals pertains to coverage in termsof hospital births. The MDG target for 2015 is 70 percent. I am here to report that by 2009 we had achieved70 per cent coverage  not to mention other programmessuch as the one that provides subsidies for pregnantwomen and children under the age of two. We aremaking good progress  although with slow steps.Why has there been such rapid change? Socialprogrammes and structural changes have allowed us tochange Bolivia. One example is telecommunications.Bolivia has 339 municipalities. In 2006  telephonecoverage or mobile phone coverage in rural areas existedin only 90 municipalities. The day after tomorrow  Iam going to inaugurate mobile communication in thelast municipality  the furthest from the cities  in theBolivian Amazon. Now my brothers and sisters livingin rural areas have telephones or mobile phones in all339 municipalities. Entel  our telephone service  hadbeen privatized. We took it back  nationalized it  andbegan to invest in it in order to provide better service.We have made progress for the following reason.As President  I received a mandate from the Bolivianpeople to recover or nationalize our natural resources.The biggest company in Bolivia is YacimientosPetrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB). For 20 years neoliberal Governments worked to privatize our naturalresources. They sold our natural resources  especiallyoil  to transnational corporations. Bolivia received only18 per cent of all the profits  while 82 per cent wentto transnational corporations. In addition  what didthe contracts signed by neoliberal Governments say?Who was the owner? The oil transnational corporationsacquired the right of ownership at the mouth of thewell. The Governments would tell us that the oil andgas continued to be ours as long as it was under theground. But once it came to the mouth of the well  itbelonged to the transnational corporations. We fought we mobilized  we raised awareness among the Bolivianpeople as to the importance of retaking or nationalizingthat natural resource. On 1 May 2006  we nationalizedthat industry without any misgivings. That act changed the national economy. In 2006 our international reserves stood at $1.7 billion. Ourinternational reserves now stand at more than $13 billion.In 2005  YPFB had $300 million in revenue. This year it has $3.5 billion. In 2005  total public investmentsamounted to $600 million. Out of that $600 million 70 per cent came from aid and loans and only 30 percent came from the national treasury. This year Stateinvestments will amount to approximately $6 billion with an additional $6 billion in private investments.How did that change come about in such a short periodof time?Of course  Bolivia is a small country. But wehave managed to change our national economy. Thatis why I say to countries whose natural resources including oil and gas  are still in private hands that myrecommendation is for them to nationalize and recovertheir natural resources. Natural resources cannotbelong to transnational corporations; they belong to thepeoples of the world  under State administration.I would also like to say that there have beensocial changes. Through a constituent assembly  wehave guaranteed basic services as a human right.Consequently  they cannot be in private hands.It is a task for the State. Water  electricity andcommunications — we have nationalized them andturned them into human rights. It is very important thatthose basic services be human rights. While we stillhave some problems in Bolivia with electricity  we willcontinue to work to ensure that that basic service is ahuman right as well.I am here to share our brief experience withGovernments  presidents  ambassadors and primeministers. Where there is the will to change  there willbe change. It depends to a large extent on willingness constant efforts to educate our people and transparentwork. Of course  we still have so many demands tomeet — sometimes  too  exaggerated demands from aparticular social sector or region — but regardless ofour interests or claims  our homeland and humankindas a whole come first.Dealing as we are with the problems we have inBolivia and the world with climate issues  I would liketo take this opportunity to convey an invitation to aninternational meeting on 21 December to greet a newera  an invitation to the celebration of the end of thecycle of non-time and the beginning of a new cycle ofequilibrium and harmony for Mother Earth. It would take too long here to go into the knowledge of ourindigenous brothers in Mexico  Guatemala  Bolivia andEcuador  but basically we are issuing this invitation to avirtual — and actual — debate on the following topics.First  the global crisis of sapitalism; second  thecrisis of civilization — world Government  capitalism socialism  community and the culture of life; third the crisis of climate — human beings’ relationship tonature; fourth  the energy of community and change;fifth  awareness of Mother Earth; sixth  recoveringancestral practices and customs and the natural cosmiccalendar; seventh  living the right way as a solution tothe global crisis — because once again we affirm thatwe cannot live better by plundering natural resources and that is a profound debate that we should have withthe whole world; eighth  food sovereignty and securitythrough food sovereignty; ninth  integration — throughbrotherhood  community  economy  complementarity the right to communication  and community learningfor life; the new human being with an integratedidentity; complementarity; self-knowledge  awakeningand  of course  health  which is so important.I would like to say that according to the Mayancalendar  21 December marks the end of the non-timeand the beginning of time. It is the end of themacha — the darkness — and the beginning of thepacha — communitarianism; it is the end of selfishnessand the beginning of brotherhood; it is the end ofindividualism and the beginning of collectivism. Asscientists know very well  21 December this yearmarks the end of the era of anthropocentrism and thebeginning of biocentrism. It is the end of hatred andthe beginning of love  the end of lies and the beginningof truth  the end of sadness and the beginning of joy  itis the end of division and the beginning of unity. Thisis a theme to be developed  and that is why we inviteall those here  those who are betting on humankind  toshare their experiences for the good of humankind.As always  I would like to thank the President forthese debates at the United Nations. We are alwaysthinking about new generations and about the goodof humankind  although sometimes sectoral interestsintrude — but as representatives who come here fromtime to time  we have an obligation to think about howto shoulder our responsibilities  and that means  assomeone said just now  bringing an end to the powersthat be. This is not a time when we can continue to praisethose powers; we are living in a time when peoples mustbe freed and where we must constantly seek economic and social equality for all human beings  a time to bringdignity to every citizen.I would like to commend those statements thatquestioned interventionism  military bases and troops.There will be social peace only when we change suchpolitical and economic policies and put an end tomilitary bases and interventionism. My respect goes tothose who resist military intervention by the Powers which is not a solution. That is something we havelearned  and that is why we hope that these debates willserve to help us think about life and humanity."
"24",977,"BRA",67,2012,"﻿Once again  a woman’svoice is opening the general debate of the GeneralAssembly. For many  we women are “half the sky”.However  we wish to be half the Earth as well  withequal rights and opportunities  free from all forms ofdiscrimination and violence  capable of building ourown emancipation and  with it  of contributing to thefull empowerment of all.A year after my statement at this same rostrum(see A/66/PV.11)  I note that many of the problems thatalready troubled us in September 2011 remain. Today I want to again consider a few of those issues  whosesolutions are becoming increasingly urgent.The grave economic crisis that began in 2008has taken on new and worrisome aspects. Opting fororthodox fiscal policies has been exacerbating therecession in developed economies  with repercussionsfor us as emerging countries  including Brazil. Themain leaders of the developed world have not yet foundthe path that combines appropriate fiscal adjustmentwith measures to stimulate investment and demand which are indispensable to halt the recession and ensureeconomic growth.Monetary policies cannot be the only response tothe growing unemployment  the increase in poverty andthe dismay that affects the most vulnerable sectors ofthe population throughout the world. The central banksof developed countries continue to pursue expansionistmonetary policies  which causes an imbalance inexchange rates. The resulting artificial appreciationof emerging countries’ currencies causes them to losemarket space  which further exacerbates the globalrecession.We cannot accept the legitimate trade protectioninitiatives of developing countries being unfairlyclassified as protectionism. We must remember thatlegitimate trade protection measures are in accordancewith the rules of the World Trade Organization. Weshould fight protectionism and all forms of trademanipulation  since they create greater competitivenessin a spurious and fraudulent way.There can be no effective response to the crisiswithout strengthening cooperation efforts amongcountries and multilateral bodies  such as the Groupof Twenty  the International Monetary Fund and theWorld Bank. Such cooperation must seek to reshapethe relationship between fiscal and monetary policiesin order to prevent the recession from worsening  tocontrol the currency war and to again stimulate globaldemand.We know from our own experience that the nationaldebt of States and bank and financial debts will not beaddressed in the context of a recession. On the contrary recession only exacerbates such problems. It is urgentthat we establish a comprehensive agreement for thecoordinated resumption of global economic growth inorder to prevent the despair caused by unemploymentand a lack of opportunities.My country has been doing its part. In recentyears  we have pursued prudent economic policies accumulated significant foreign exchange reserves strongly reduced public debt and  with innovative socialpolicies  lifted 40 million Brazilians out of poverty thereby strengthening a large domestic market.Like all countries  we were affected by the crisis.However  despite the temporary slowing in our growthrate  we have managed to maintain extremely highemployment levels and to continue to reduce socialinequality while significantly increasing workers’income levels. We have overcome the incorrect viewaccording to which measures to stimulate growthare incompatible with austerity plans. That is a falsedilemma. Fiscal responsibility is as necessary asgrowth measures are indispensable  because fiscalconsolidation can be sustainable only in a context ofeconomic recovery.History reveals that austerity  when exaggeratedand isolated from growth  is self-defeating. Brazil has chosen to face both of those challenges simultaneously.While exerting strict control over public spending  wehave increased our investments in infrastructure andeducation. While controlling inflation  we have actedvigorously through policies aimed at social inclusionand poverty eradication. Furthermore  while carryingout structural reforms in the financial and welfare areas we have reduced the tax burden and the cost of energy and we have invested in infrastructure and knowledgeto generate science  technology and innovation.There are moments in which we cannot choosebetween one alternative or the other. Both must bedeveloped separately at the same time.Just as in 2011  the Middle East and North Africacontinue to be at the center of the attention of theinternational community. Important social movements with different political orientations  have sweptaway despotic regimes and brought about transitionprocesses whose meaning and direction still cannot beclearly discerned. However  it is not difficult to identifyin almost all those movements a cry of protest againstpoverty  unemployment and the lack of opportunitiesand civil rights imposed by authoritarian governmentson large sectors of those societies  especially youngpeople. Nor is it difficult to find in those events thetraces of historical grievances caused by decades ofcolonial or neocolonial policies carried out in the nameof a supposedly civilizing agenda. Little by little  theeconomic interests behind those policies became clear.Today  we are witnessing with consternationthe unfolding of the dire situation in Syria. Brazilcondemns in the strongest terms the violence thatcontinues to claim lives in that country. Syria iswitnessing a large-scale humanitarian tragedy on itsterritory and in that of its neighbors. The Governmentin Damascus bears the largest share of responsibilityfor the cycle of violence that has victimized a largenumber of civilians  especially women  children andyoung people. However  we are also aware of theresponsibilities of armed opposition groups  especiallythose that increasingly rely on foreign military andlogistical support.As President of a country that is home to millionsof people of Syrian descent  I call on the parties tothe conflict to lay down their weapons and join themediation efforts being undertaken by the joint UnitedNations-Arab League special envoy. There is nomilitary solution to the Syrian crisis. Diplomacy and dialogue are not simply our best option; they are theonly option.As President of a country where thousands andthousands of Brazilian Muslims live  I declare heretoday our vehement repudiation of the escalationof Islamophobic prejudice in Western countries.Brazil is one of the players in the generous Allianceof Civilizations initiative originally launched by theTurkish Government.With the same vehemence  we repudiate theterrorist acts that took the lives of American diplomatsin Libya.With our eyes still set upon the Middle East  wheresome of the most important challenges to internationalpeace and security lie  I wish to once more touch uponthe Israeli-Palestinian question. I reiterate my wordsof 2011  when I expressed the Brazilian Government’ssupport for the recognition of the Palestinian State as afull Member of the United Nations. I added then  andI repeat today  that only a free and sovereign Palestinewill be able to fulfil Israel’s legitimate desires for peacewith its neighbours  security in its borders and regionalpolitical stability.The international community has encounteredgrowing difficulty in dealing with the exacerbation ofregional conflicts. That is clear from the stalemateswithin the Security Council. It is one of the gravestproblems that we face. The crisis that began in 2008demonstrated the need for reform of the mechanismsof global economic governance. In point of fact  to thisday we have still not fully implemented such reforms.Increasingly intense regional wars and conflicts  thetragic loss of human lives and the immense materiallosses for the peoples involved all demonstrate theutmost urgency of undertaking the institutional reformof the United Nations  in particular of its SecurityCouncil.We cannot allow the Council to be replaced  as hasbeen the case  by coalitions that are formed without itsconsent  beyond its control and without due regard forinternational law. The use of force without authorizationby the Council is clearly illegal  yet it is beginning tobe regarded in some quarters as an acceptable option. Itis by no means acceptable. The ease with which someresort to that kind of action results from the stalematesthat paralyse the Council. Because of that  the Councilmust urgently be reformed.Brazil will always fight to ensure that decisionsemanating from the United Nations prevail. But we wantlegitimate actions  founded on international legality. Inthis spirit  I have defended the need for “responsibilitywhile protecting” as a necessary complement to theresponsibility to protect.Multilateralism is stronger today after theUnited Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment — Rio+20. Together  during those daysin June  we held the largest and most participativeconference in the history of the United Nations.We were able to take firm steps towards the historicconsolidation of a new paradigm: to grow  to include to protect and to preserve — that is  sustainabledevelopment. I thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moonand Ambassador Sha Zukang for their efforts and theirclose collaboration with Brazil  before and throughoutthe Conference.The outcome document that we approved byconsensus in Rio (resolution 66/288  annex) not onlypreserves the legacy of 1992 but also sets the startingpoint for a sustainable development agenda for thetwenty-first century  with a focus on the eradicationof poverty  on the conscientious use of naturalresources and on sustainable patterns of production andconsumption.The United Nations has before it a number of tasksmandated by the Rio Conference. In particular  I wouldlike to make reference to the definition of the sustainabledevelopment goals. Rio+20 shone a powerful light onthe future we want. We have an obligation to heedthe many warnings being sounded by science andsociety. We must consider climate change one of themain challenges to present and future generations.The Brazilian Government is firmly committed to thetargets for controlling greenhouse gas emissions andto the unrelenting fight against deforestation in theAmazon rainforest.In 2009  we voluntarily took on commitments andadopted them as laws. Those targets are particularlyambitious for a developing country  which must dealwith pressing demands of all types in order to promotethe well-being of its population. We hope that thosecountries that bear a greater historical responsibilityfor climate change and that have greater means withwhich to deal with it will fulfil their obligations to theinternational community.Another United Nations initiative we commend isthe Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020. Brazilis engaged in efforts to protect lives and reduce roadaccidents  one of the main causes of death among youngpeople of the world. To that end  our Governmentis developing a wide-ranging awareness-raisingcampaign together with the Fédération Internationalede l’Automobile.In a context of environmental challenges  economiccrises and threats to peace in different parts of theworld  Brazil continues committed to working withits neighbours to build an environment of democracy peace  prosperity and social justice. We have madegreat progress in integrating the Latin Americanand Caribbean region as a priority for internationalcooperation.Our region is a good example for the world. Therule of law that we have achieved by overcomingauthoritarian regimes is being preserved andstrengthened. Democracy is not a heritage immuneto attacks. In order to avoid setbacks  the SouthernCommon Market and the Union of South AmericanNations have been firm when they had to be  because weconsider integration and democracy to be inseparableprinciples. I also reaffirm our commitment to keepingour region free from weapons of mass destruction. Inthat regard  I wish to recall the existence of immensearsenals that  in addition to threatening all humankind aggravate tensions and hamper efforts towards peace.The world clamours for food instead of weapons  for thebillions of men  women and children who suffer fromthe cruelest punishment inf licted on humanity: hunger.Finally  I wish to refer to a brother country  belovedby all Latin Americans and Caribbeans — Cuba. Cubahas made great progress in bringing its economicmodel up to date. To continue on its path  it needs thesupport of partners both near and far. Cooperation onCuba’s progress is  however  hampered by the economicembargo that has plagued its population for decades.The time has long since passed for us to put an end tothat anachronism  which is condemned by the immensemajority of Members of the United Nations.This year  we watched the Olympic and ParalympicGames brilliantly organized by the United Kingdom.With the closing of the London Olympic Games  Brazilhas begun the countdown towards the Rio de JaneiroOlympic Games in 2016  which will be preceded by the2014 World Cup. Every two years  during the Summer and Winter Games  humanity seems to reawaken tovalues that should inspire us permanently: tolerance respect for differences  equality  inclusion  friendshipand understanding. Those principles are also thefoundation of human rights and of this Organization. Atthe opening of the sixty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly  I propose to all the nations represented herethat they let the ideals of the Olympic flame shine uponthem.Strengthening the United Nations is necessaryat this stage when multipolarity opens a historic newperspective. We must work towards that end. We mustwork to ensure that in the multipolarity that is comingto prevail  cooperation predominates over conflict dialogue overcomes threats and negotiated solutions arereached before and forestall interventions involving theuse of force. I reiterate that in this necessarily collectiveeffort  which presupposes the quest for consensus  theUnited Nations has a key role to play  particularly asthe Organization and its various bodies become morerepresentative and more legitimate and therefore moreeffective."
"25",1021,"BRB",67,2012,"﻿On behalf of mydelegation  I have the honour to congratulate HisExcellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić  President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session  on his election.I assure him of the full support and cooperation ofthe delegation of Barbados during his presidency. Letme also convey my appreciation to his predecessor Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  President of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  for his ableleadership during that session.The theme of this year’s session  “Bringing aboutadjustment or settlement of international disputesor situations by peaceful means”  underscores a coreprinciple of the Charter of the United Nations. Inthe current global environment  where challenges tointernational peace and security are widespread  it isimportant to reaffirm the validity of that principle asone of the cornerstones on which the Organization isfounded.As a small island developing State  Barbadosis severely challenged by the global financial andeconomic crisis and the recession that has resulted fromit. Moreover  climate change and other environmentalchallenges continue to pose significant threats to theachievements of Barbados since its independence in November 1966. As a relatively young nation  ourindependence was achieved by negotiation ratherthan by war. We have enjoyed the benefits of stabilityfor more than 370 years of unbroken parliamentaryGovernment. We are a peace-loving  democratic nation extremely proud of our political and economic stability.Our relatively peaceful situation does not mean thatwe are insulated or isolated from the prevailing globalinstability that is very evident today. Our politicaland social stability have facilitated the achievement of a standard of living that has led Barbados to beconsistently ranked among the top 50 nations in theUnited Nations Development Programme’s annualHuman Development Index.Such a status has been achieved as a result of thecommitment of successive Governments to investheavily in our people  particularly in education  healthand other social safety nets. As a nation poor in naturalresources  we have placed priority on our greatestresource  our people. A significant factor in our abilityto overcome our constraints at the national level hasbeen the tripartite social partnership comprisingGovernment  workers’ unions and employers. Thepartnership grew out of an economic crisis duringthe early 1990s and continues to function effectivelytoday. Those strategies have been reinforced by ourcommitment to observing the rule of law. We are aprincipled country that firmly adheres to the corevalues enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations including respect for the rule of the law  respect forhuman rights and the principle of sovereign equality.We have been classified as a middle-incomedeveloping country. In reality  we are a small islanddeveloping State  characterized by high debt  highvulnerability to external shocks  and susceptibility tothe impacts of climate change and natural disasters.The global economic and environmental situation hashad a disproportionate effect on our successful  butnevertheless vulnerable  economy. We bear the burdenof rising food and fuel prices and a decline in foreigninvestment. Our efforts to address those threats havebeen severely undermined by international financialand cooperation mechanisms that fail to take account ofthe vulnerability and capacity constraints that we faceBarbados and similar vulnerable countries have beengraduated from grant and concessionary financing bymultilateral institutions  such as the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank and the World Bank  without regardfor our unique situation. There is a clear need for greaterequity  fairness and transparency in the process used todetermine classifications and resource allocation. Thepersistent use of international classification and ratingssystems that are solely based on gross domestic productper capita and other narrow criteria must be expandedin scope to take into account meaningful variables suchas vulnerability.In this context  we welcome the assertion by theSecretary-General that the use of per capita income to classify countries as a means of guiding developmentcooperation disregards the nature and multidimensionalnature of development. Barbados endorses the needfor the adoption of new indices and measures ofdevelopment and applauds the ongoing work of bodiessuch as the Commonwealth and the United NationsStatistical Commission to develop new indices.There is no greater threat to the survival  viabilityand indeed the security of my country and other smallisland developing States (SIDS) than the threat posedby climate change. Science continues to warn that weare on the threshold of irreversible and potentiallycatastrophic changes to the global climate system.Global emissions  the main cause of human-inducedclimate change  are rising at their fastest rate in history even as we bear witness to massive and accelerating iceloss from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarcticaand a doubling of the rate of sea-level rise.We are at a major turning point in the historyof mankind. Are we willing to sacrifice the mostvulnerable members of the international community?That is the stark choice we face. But after the islandsdisappear  who will be next? Inaction or inadequateaction is inexcusable and morally indefensible  giventhe level of certainty of the scientific evidence before usand the technological and financial tools at our disposalto effect the necessary change.While some useful progress was made at theDurban Climate Change Conference in Decemberlast year  we are not close to finding a solution tothe problem. Barbados welcomes the decision takenin Durban to launch negotiations on a new legallybinding agreement that would take effect after 2020.However  for us a post-2020 agreement is meaninglessif ambitious actions are not taken now to reduceglobal emissions and provide finance and technologyto vulnerable developing countries. That is essentialif we are to adapt to the ever-worsening impacts ofclimate change. The upcoming United Nations ClimateChange Conference in Doha must therefore prioritizethe pre-2020 actions necessary to ensure that theworld is on track in 2020 to meet the below 2 degreeor 1.5 degree globally agreed goals. Such actions willrequire clarity from developed countries on the scale ofclimate finance after the end of the fast-start financeperiod this year and a greater sense of urgency andambition in reducing global emissions before 2020 tominimize and avoid potentially catastrophic impacts ofclimate change. Barbados and other small island developing Stateshave thrown their full support behind the Secretary-General’s Sustainable Energy for All initiative. In Maythis year  the Government of Barbados  in collaborationwith the United Nations Development Programme hosted a High-level Conference of the small islanddeveloping States on achieving sustainable energy forall in SIDS  focused on challenges  opportunities andcommitments. At that meeting the Barbados Declarationwas adopted  outlining an ambitious and action-orientedagenda for achieving the goal of sustainable energyfor all in SIDS. As a concrete expression of our soliddetermination  some 22 SIDS agreed to inscribe  inan annex to the Declaration  a spectrum of ambitiousvoluntary commitments to promote transformationalactivities in the areas of renewable energy  energyefficiency  energy access and low-carbon development.I commend the Governments of Australia  Denmark New Zealand  Norway and the United Kingdom forpledging  in the Barbados Declaration  to support SIDSin the implementation of our ambitious commitments.We urge other development partners to join us onthis journey to ensure our energy independence. Forus  sustainable development is not possible withoutsustainable energy.Barbados shares the view of the Secretary-Generalthat the United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment (Rio +20) in Brazil this year reached anumber of important milestones. In the words of thePrime Minister of Barbados “Rio +20 will be remembered as that unique momentin time when we decided not to yield to our fears but rather to transform this present period of globaluncertainty and volatility into a major opportunityto set new agendas  which can then be developedmore fully over the next few years”.Barbados welcomes the agreement at Rio toconvene the third Global Conference on SIDS in 2014 some two decades after the convening of the first SIDSConference in Barbados. The international communitycan be assured that Barbados will do its part to ensurethe success of the Conference.During this session  the Assembly will considera draft resolution on the sustainable development ofthe Caribbean Sea. Within the Caribbean we haverecognized that an integrated management approachthat involves all stakeholders provides us with thebest option for protecting the Caribbean Sea  our most effort in the Association of Caribbean States to createthe Caribbean Sea Commission. The Commissionrepresents an oceans governance framework to promotecooperation towards effective management of theCaribbean Sea area. Barbados calls on the internationalcommunity to support this initiative  includingthrough the designation by the General Assembly ofthe Caribbean Sea as a special area in the context ofsustainable development.Citizen security remains a major concern forBarbados. The Caribbean Community subregionhas become a major transit and destination pointfor the trafficking of illicit drugs and firearms. As aconsequence  the incidence of crime and violencecontinues to escalate in the region and threatensto reverse many of our economic and social gains.Developing countries like ours have been compelledto divert financial and other resources earmarked forsocial and economic development for use in combatingthis transnational scourge.The heavy toll that that takes on the populations ofour region brings into sharp focus the importance ofthe United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Armsand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. It also emphasizesthe need for a strong  legally binding arms trade treaty which sets the highest possible international standardsfor the transfer of conventional arms. We share theprofound disappointment of many Member States atthe failure of the Arms Trade Treaty Conference toreach agreement on a treaty text before its conclusion.Barbados cannot envisage an arms trade treaty thatdoes not include small arms and light weapons  theircomponents and ammunition. Barbados expects that despite the setback  negotiations on the arms tradetreaty will resume during this session.At the national level  we are appreciative ofcontinuing cooperation with bilateral partners andregional and international bodies like the United NationsOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). These includeprogrammes aimed at preventing and reducing levelsof violence and crime in our society. We look forwardto the imminent reopening of the UNODC Office forthe Caribbean subregion  which my Government hasoffered once again to host.It is well recognized that peace  security anddevelopment are inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing. Barbados is therefore heartened that indealing with conflict prevention  the United Nationshas moved beyond traditional preventive diplomacy.We support the pursuit of comprehensive strategiesthat address deep-rooted structural causes of conflict poverty eradication and development  human rights andthe rule of law  elections and the building of democraticinstitutions.As a family of nations  we continue to strive forthe achievement of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs). Success has been mixed  and mademore difficult by the current global financial crisis. Thetarget implementation date of 2015 looms large  andwe share international concerns that the MDGs maybecome casualties of the current environment. As wearticulate the post-2015 development agenda  we mustnot lose sight of the urgency of fulfilling these goals.Let me reiterate my country’s commitment tothe rule of law and our unwavering commitment tothe principles enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations. I take this opportunity to speak out againstthe continued unilateral imposition of the economic commercial and financial embargo against Cuba bythe United States. Barbados joins the overwhelmingmajority of Member States in opposing this action which has persisted for too long. This situation meritsimmediate resolution if the unnecessary hardship andsuffering it has wrought on the Cuban people is toend. We therefore encourage constructive engagementbetween the two sides.Strong  functioning democracies are the foundationon which international peace  security and prosperityare built. As a democratic State with a longstanding andfirm commitment to effective multilateralism  Barbadosreiterates the crucial nexus between development peace  security and human rights. The United Nationsis the only global body with the unquestionablelegitimacy to lead a global response to the challengesfacing humanity. Recognizing this  Barbados remainssteadfast in its commitment to the United Nations andall it stands for."
"26",1053,"BRN",67,2012,"﻿On behalf of His Majesty the Sultan and the peopleof Brunei Darussalam  I would like to congratulateour new President  His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić  on his election and to wish him much success in thecoming year. We also wish to express our appreciationto the outgoing President  His Excellency Mr. NassirAbdulaziz Al-Nasser  for his dedication to the workof the Organization. We especially thank him for hisefforts to encourage us all to meet successfully theconsiderable challenges now being posed by life in thetwenty-first century.At the same time  we would also like to thankSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his constantwillingness to apply the core values of the UnitedNations directly whenever he has been asked to acton our behalf. We particularly welcome the five-yearAction Agenda he has set out and the common visionit offers us. At its heart  the vision is one of tolerance respect and understanding among nations.Sadly  over the past two weeks  we have witnessedevents that present a very different vision. In consideringthem  Brunei Darussalam has stated its unreservedcondemnation of their cause. We have equally stronglyadvised all our people of our Government’s absoluterejection of the violence and extremism that have beentheir result. Here at the United Nations  we congratulatethe Secretary-General on his statement about thematter. In doing so  we reaffirm our commitment to theuniversal values of tolerance and respect. Similarly  weuphold the institutions  structures and due processesof international affairs that this great Organizationembodies.Turning now to the theme for this year’s generaldebate — “Bringing about adjustment or settlementof international disputes or situations by peacefulmeans” — for me the key word is “adjustment”. I thinkit is well chosen. It suggests change that is carefully andgradually done. It does not invite confrontation. For usin Brunei Darussalam  it matches the main purposeof this annual meeting. We see it as an opportunity toexpress our satisfaction and our concern about howsuccessfully the United Nations is managing the processof globalization that we have nationally embraced.In other words  are we satisfied with things asthey are; or do we see a need for some adjustment?In answering that question  we would like to start byexpressing considerable satisfaction with many aspectsof the Organization’s work. The media constantlyheadline the supposed defects  failures and setbacks ofthe United Nations. But beneath all of that we observethe enormous contribution of the United Nations to the welfare of future generations. I would thereforelike to express our deep satisfaction with the work ofUnited Nations agencies and international bodies. Webelieve they are providing us with the opportunityto move out of nineteenth-century colonialism andtwentieth-century national interests. In the spirit ofour theme here  they are helping us to adjust to twenty-first century regionalism and eventually  we hope  tosuccessful globalism.I would therefore like to suggest three particularareas we find especially important. In each  we believethat the United Nations is helping to create a worldin which the people it represents can look to a betterfuture — one of hope rather than anguish  confidenceinstead of fear  and trust in the place of despair.The first area is the difficult long-term work beingdone on sustainable development. We were impressedby the results of the Rio de Janeiro United NationsConference on Sustainable Development  which washeld in June and built on 20 years of effort. Sustainabledevelopment is now far more than an academic topic;it is firmly part of the United Nations long-termdevelopment agenda. Work has moved from theory intomany practical ideas  projects and activities.The second area is covered in the United NationsDevelopment Programme’s Millennium DevelopmentGoals Report 2012. We especially noted the followingstatements by the Secretary-General in his foreword.The target of reducing extreme poverty by half hasbeen reached five years ahead of the 2015 deadline.The target has been achieved on halving the proportionof people who lack dependable access to improvedsources of drinking water. The conditions for morethan 200 million people living in slums have beengreatly improved. The primary school enrolment ofgirls has equalled that of boys. There is acceleratingprogress in reducing child and maternal mortality. Weare especially encouraged by his conclusion that theachievement of the Millennium Development Goals by2015 is challenging but possible.The third area is the sum of the ongoing efforts ofUnited Nations agencies such as the United NationsDevelopment Programme  UNICEF and the Foodand Agriculture Organization  which are operating inalmost 150 countries. Their work is both wide-rangingand specific in its emphasis upon the basic componentsof everyday life for the people we represent. Success in those three areas means that ourchildren and grandchildren will live in a world whereordinary people and their families have a real chance tolive together in hope and confidence. That is the reasonfor our satisfaction with the work of the United Nationsas a global Organization. In other words  in terms ofthe fundamental work of the United Nations  we seeno need to undertake what our theme here describes asadjustment.Rather  it is in the structure of the Organization thatwe see a need for some things to be adjusted. The reasonappears clear to many of those of us who are smallboth physically and politically. The current structureappears far too often to be the deep-seated cause of theheadline news I referred to. We see it as a twentieth-century structure designed to meet twentieth-centuryrealities. It is personified in the 64 years of sufferingby the ordinary people of Palestine  and in all otherdesperate situations in which the root causes of conflictand confrontation are still buried in the past century.Simply put  that must change. In our globalizedworld  we are all equally interdependent and equallyresponsible. But  like many other members in theAssembly  we believe that the current structure does nottruly reflect those realities. As such  it needs adjustingso that ancient political fault lines are repaired.The form we hope it will increasingly take shouldresemble that of some regions today that operate onthe basis of consensus  rather than compromise andconfrontation. That is what we have accepted in ourown region of South-East Asia. It is the spirit behindthe present focus of the Association of South-EastAsian Nations (ASEAN) on building a peaceful andmutually respectful community of nations  regardlessof background  economic resources or nationalpreoccupations.That is why we greatly appreciate the strongsupport and goodwill that is constantly shown us by ourmany partners from outside the region. It is also whywe in Brunei Darussalam  the smallest of all Membernations  feel honoured and privileged to assume thechairmanship of ASEAN next year. That organizationis an association of neighbours that have deliberatelychosen to adjust their region’s previous identity. Until45 years ago  ours was one of the most unstable regionson Earth  a confrontation point for the national interestsof great Powers and a focal point of the Cold War. Now  our region has adjusted  and is determined tooperate in the interests of its community of 600 millioncitizens. It will continue to do so not by conflict orconfrontation and not by compromising nationalvalues  but by peaceful consensus. In the same way  wehope that the structure of the United Nations can begradually and carefully adjusted."
"27",1094,"BTN",67,2012,"﻿As with most sessions ofthe General Assembly  we are sharing  yet again  ourcommon fears and frustrations in a world that is goingwrong. We have no stories  only f leeting moments with which to fill our sinking hearts with hope in anear or distant future. Ours is a narrative of mountingchallenges and doubts. Deep in our hearts  we know thatour very survival on this fragile planet is under threat.Yet  we share no common vision and fail to think andact in concert and with faith. And so we find ourselvesbeing overwhelmed by the forces that our irresponsibleand discordant actions have unleashed. All that we haveachieved individually  as nations  as regions and as aspecies  faces the threat of loss and reversal. As weargue and falter  the world we have built is falling apart.Climate is changing and ecosystems are dying. Thegrowing extractive industry spurred by consumerism isexhausting our natural resources  and conflicts are risingin number and more are looming on the horizon. Foodand energy are becoming costlier  thereby deepeningpoverty  inequality and discontent. Economies areunravelling; jobs and security are being lost. For toomany  basic human rights and dignity remain beyondreach  and the relevance of Governments and States isin question. Families and communities are losing theirresilience  and society is crumbling.I have reminded the Assembly each year that thesolutions we speak of and the measures we take tomeet all these challenges and many others plaguingmankind are of the kind that address the symptoms butaggravate the deeper malaise. We are discovering thatour problems — be they economic  social  ecologicalor even political — are interconnected and rooted in the folly of mankind’s pursuit of the wrong ends inwrongful ways.Although the United Nations has been a house ofgloom in recent years  it does have its shining moments projecting rays of hope. The Secretary-General referredto some of these in his address that focused on soundingthe alarm about our direction as a human family. Onesuch moment came when this great body resolved thatit was time to accept human well-being and happinessas a developmental goal binding all of humankindwith a common vision and pursuit  and that it shouldtherefore bring about a holistic  sustainable andinclusive approach to development. That determinationcaused my country to host a high-level meeting here atthe United Nations  which brought together more than800 participants from all walks of life and all over theworld. I was awed  humbled and indeed inspired by thephenomenal response to our call. It was a gathering ofextraordinary minds and concerned citizens  moved bythe urgent need for change — to blaze a new global pathto human happiness and the well-being of life on earth.Yet another moment came just months ago when theGeneral Assembly declared 20 March the InternationalDay of Happiness  thereby bringing together all humanbeings  at least once a year  to reflect on the meaningand purpose of life and realign our thoughts and actions.Three months ago  40 000 representativesgathered for the United Nations Conference onSustainable Development. The outcome document(resolution 66/288  annex) fell far short of what weought to have achieved. Many saw it as a missedopportunity. Not so for my country and people  who with minimal expectations  came away with cause forhope. The agreement to develop universal sustainabledevelopment goals that would integrate the economic environmental and social dimensions of developmentwas a substantive outcome  consistent with relevantGeneral Assembly resolutions and the efforts that myown country is making. My country hopes to participateactively in this work and sees it as evidence of thegrowing convergence in the belief that we need to makea break with the past and agree on a collective vision.It is our expectation that such sustainable developmentgoals will steer the post-2015 international developmentagenda and set humankind on the right course.What inspired me most at Rio was the indomitablespirit of the hundreds of side events  several of which Iwas honoured to participate in. These were organized bycivil society  grass-roots organizations and the private sector. They came to share best practices and learnfrom each other  and  more important  to demonstratethat sustainable development is not just an idle dreambut that there are individuals and organizations who arebreathing and living lives to realize what is profoundand necessary. While many of them went homedisappointed by the outcome document  I know it is notin their creed to despair. They are the pioneers  takingthe lead where Governments fear to tread  and givingcourageous expression to humankind’s basic goodnessand inherent wisdom. They are the torchbearers of abrave new dawn  and we too must have the wisdom andhumility to follow their lead.I am also inspired by the appointment of a high-levelpanel by the Secretary-General to advise on the globaldevelopment agenda beyond 2015  which  we note convened its first meeting earlier this week. Moreover the launch of the Sustainable Development SolutionsNetwork  led by Jeffrey Sachs  is to be welcomed as is the Secretary-General’s personal commitmentto enriching the discourse on the future of our race.For our part  I would like to submit that Bhutan hasinitiated a number of steps in the same direction pursuant to the recommendation issued at the 2 AprilHigh-level Meeting on Well-being and Happiness hereat the United Nations.In July  His Majesty the King of Bhutan establisheda working group of international experts  comprisingover 50 thought leaders  to elaborate the details ofthe new proposed development paradigm over thecoming two years. Their work will be made availablefor consideration at the sixty-eighth and sixty-ninthsessions of the General Assembly  in 2013 and 2014.Simultaneously  His Majesty the King appointed anational steering committee to guide and support thisprocess.The working group will elaborate and refine thefour themes of well-being and happiness  ecologicalsustainability  fair distribution  and the efficient useof resources. It will prepare detailed documentation including thorough literature reviews and examinationsof existing best practices on how the new paradigmcan work. They will look at its potential accountingand measurement systems  regulatory and financialmechanisms  and trade  governance  and otherinstitutional arrangements. We believe the findingswill complement and contribute to the efforts beingundertaken by the Secretary-General’s high-level panel.Towards this end  my Government also looks forward to the early establishment of the intergovernmentalopen working group tasked with designing sustainabledevelopment goals  as agreed at the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development in Rio.This month  Bhutan enters its forty-second year ofmembership in the United Nations. During this period Bhutan has been a beneficiary of the internationalcommunity  whose support and generosity have helpedto bring about tangible improvements in the lives of theBhutanese people. In return  Bhutan’s contributionsto the work of the United Nations have been modestbut focused. We have endeavoured to demonstrateour dedication to the causes of peace  developmentand the rule of law. As a responsible member of theinternational community  committed to the principlesenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  Bhutanis now prepared to engage directly in the process ofbuilding a more secure world through non-permanentmembership in the Security Council. This we regardnot only as a privilege  but also as a responsibility ofUnited Nations membership.It was in this context that in 1999 Bhutan informedthe Asian Group of its aspiration to seek membershipin the Security Council for the term 2013-2014. Havingnever held nor sought membership in the Council before we are convinced that all States  regardless of size population or level of development  must be permittedthe opportunity to contribute by bringing diversity ofthought  approach and  indeed  their will to the work ofthe Council. As a small State  we have always attachedthe highest importance to multilateralism and theprimacy of an effective United Nations that serves theinterests of all its Member States.The election of non-permanent members to theSecurity Council next month will  I believe  providethe opportunity for the international community  asrepresented by all Member States  to demonstrate itscommitment to the fundamental precept of sovereignequality as enshrined in the United Nations Charter andto the principles of democracy and rotation that give itmeaning."
"28",1135,"BWA",67,2012,"﻿Allow me  on behalf ofmy delegation  to join preceding speakers in expressingour felicitations to Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his assumptionof the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.

Itherefore pledge the full support and cooperation ofmy delegation to him  in the discharge of his onerousresponsibilities.Botswana is among the developing countriesthat have been adversely affected by the 2008 globaleconomic and financial crisis. Consequently  wewere compelled to reorder our priorities and alsodefer implementation of various approved projects inour National Development Plan  some of which wereof strategic national importance. In that regard  wecontinue to be concerned that many of our traditionaldonors who helped us to progress to where we are today have virtually abandoned us following Botswana’sgraduation to higher middle-income developing countrystatus. Contrary to the perception that Botswana is aneconomically well-off country  we now  more than everbefore  need development assistance  on account of thevaried nature and gravity of the challenges we continueto face.With respect to the African continent  Botswanahas followed with concern some recent peculiardevelopments. The military coups in Mali and Guinea-Bissau early this year are a sad reminder of what wethought was a closed chapter of the dark days of Africanpolitics driven by self-interest. Those developmentsseriously undermine the significant progress whichAfrica has made to date in embracing and consolidatingdemocracy  good governance  respect for human rightsand the rule of law. We therefore call on the AfricanUnion to remain firm and resolute in its rejection ofunconstitutional changes of Government on the Africancontinent  and we implore the international communityto give full importance and full support to the AfricanUnion in that regard.Elsewhere on the continent  we particularlywelcome the recent agreement between the Sudan andSouth Sudan on the implementation of the AfricanUnion road map  aimed at resolving outstanding issuesin the relations between the two countries. However  weremain concerned about the fragile security situation and we therefore appeal to both parties to exercisemaximum restraint and to commit to honouring theterms of the road map. Although the appeal is made toboth sides  we are very much aware that the Sudan is themain cause of the instability between the two countries. The catalogue of incidents of provocation and blatantacts of aggression against the Republic of South Sudanby the North that has led to instability in that region hasbeen typical of the Sudanese regime for many years.We live in times when our common well-beingis seriously compromised by such threats as nuclearproliferation  terrorism  climate change  environmentaldegradation  underdevelopment and pandemic diseases coupled with the effects of the global economic andfinancial crisis and internal conflicts. The resolutionof the myriad of challenges and threats confrontingmankind requires urgent and concerted action by theinternational community. Because of its universality the United Nations commands the requisite legitimacyand moral authority to provide guidance and leadershipin addressing those threats and challenges. It is thereforeimperative that the United Nations of the twenty-firstcentury respond effectively to present realities andeffectively handle future challenges.We believe that the international communityshould act and speak out strongly and forthrightlyagainst human rights abuses and atrocities whereverand whenever they occur. In that regard  my delegationobserves with deep regret that  over the past few months the world community has watched helplessly andfailed hopelessly to intervene as Syria descended intoprotracted anarchy. In the process  the Syrian peoplehave been subjected to a cycle of violent repression andsome of the worst human rights abuses and atrocitiesknown to mankind.Even as we speak  the violent crackdown andbloodshed in that country continue unabated. Al-Assadhas displaced more than a million Syrians to satisfyhis lust for power. He has caused around 300 000Syrians to f lee into neighbouring countries becauseof his criminal acts. He has slaughtered 20 000 of hiscitizens in order to remain President. He has killedmen  women  children and babies to achieve that. Theinternational community has  regrettably  failed torespond collectively. And Syria remains a Member ofthe United Nations  a body with the expressed objectiveof defending humankind. That surely cannot be right.Syria’s allies in the Security Council and in the regionneed to be equally condemned.The uprisings in the Middle East  commonlyreferred to as the Arab Spring  have demonstrated thatno amount of force can suppress the will of the peopleforever. The situation in Libya  Tunisia and Egypt where the popular will of the people has ushered indemocratic dispensations  attests to that.Concerning Libya  which had to engage in aninternal conflict to rid itself of a brutal dictator  wecommend the Libyan people and their allies in themilitary coalition that imposed a no-f ly zone in orderto remove Colonel Al-Qadhafi and his regime.My delegation is of the view that given itsmandate to maintain international peace and security the Security Council should assume the high moralground in defending the victims of war crimes andcrimes against humanity  such as those currently beingcommitted in Syria. The principle of the responsibilityto protect  as expressed in Security Council resolution1674 (2006)  should be forcefully applied wherevercrimes against humanity occur. In that connection  mydelegation condemns in the strongest possible termsthe persistent vetoes by China and Russia of successiveSecurity Council resolutions aimed at putting pressureon the Syrian leadership to cease its heinous crimesagainst its citizens. We therefore call on those membersof the Council to live up to their responsibilities  inaccordance with the provisions of the United NationsCharter. We urge the international community toact swiftly to save the people of Syria from furtherunwarranted bloodshed.Botswana will continue to sponsor and supportthe various General Assembly and Human RightsCouncil resolutions aimed at addressing the situation inSyria  as a practical demonstration of our unwaveringcommitment towards a resolution of the Syriancrisis. It is for that reason that we join forces withlike-minded countries in calling for the situation inSyria to be referred to the International Criminal Courtfor investigation  so that those responsible for crimesagainst humanity can be held accountable. Al-Assadand his regime should be removed as soon as possible.We must encourage the opposition to unite and to forma transition administration that we can all recognize.We wish to commend Turkey and the other countriesthat have taken on the burden of accommodating Syrianrefugees  have spoken out against the deterioratingsecurity and humanitarian situation in Syria andhave responded  with others  to the plea of theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees (UNHCR) for contributions. For its part Botswana has made a modest contribution to UNHCR tohelp the humanitarian relief efforts for Syrian refugees. We also wish to commend responsible human-rightsorganizations  such as Amnesty International andHuman Rights Watch  for the work they do in seekingto safeguard the principles that protect humankind.Their mission — to act as watchdogs in matters ofsafeguarding human rights — is a very necessaryone. Similarly  we commend those humanitariannon-governmental organizations that work tirelessly with meagre resources and under very difficultcircumstances  to bring relief to refugees affected bynatural and man-made disasters.Human rights abuses and atrocities are not limitedto Syria. It is in that context that we affirm our supportfor the International Criminal Court and urge it tocontinue to fulfil its mandate  including prosecutingthose indicted for human rights abuses and crimesagainst humanity. We therefore appeal to States partiesto fully cooperate with the Court in its efforts to bringthe suspected perpetrators of such crimes to justice.We wish to add our voice in condemning the violencethat occurred following the release of a publication thatoffended people of the Islamic faith. There can be nojustification for such a violent response. The violenceitself caused offence to its victims. Retaliation againstoffensive expressions therefore cannot take the formof other offensive actions aimed at innocent parties.However  where democracy is defined as Governmentof the people  by the people  for the people — inother words  doing what is in the best interests of thepeople — how can it be in the people’s best interests iffreedom of speech results in insults?Other freedoms  in a democratic dispensation include freedom of association — but we cannotassociate with terrorist or criminal groups withoutconsequences  since it is not in the people’s best intereststo live among terrorists and criminals. Freedom ofexpression allows for protests — but only peacefulprotests — in democracies  because it is also not inpeople’s best interests to have violent protests; and indemocracies consequences do follow if protests becomeviolent. The same goes for freedom of the press  if it isabused  as it often is. There must be consequences  inorder to protect people’s interests from misinformationand attempts to discredit or defame them. With all suchfreedoms there must be limits. Democracy is supposedto be responsible. Causing offence and insult cannot byany stretch of the imagination be passed off as whatwe want in a democracy. Trying to justify irresponsible actions as permitted under any of these freedoms including freedom of speech  is itself irresponsible.Turning to environmental issues  we note the limitedand disappointing progress made at the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development in addressingsustainable development issues  as has been the case atsimilar summits in the past. As we all know  the worldis facing the twin challenges of scarcity of resourcesand climate change. Those problems are particularlyacute in Africa  owing to the high incidence of povertythere.To respond to those big problems  which clearlyneed visionary solutions and strong partnerships forsustainability on a scale and with an impact that areunprecedented  my country took the important initiativeof hosting in May the Summit for Sustainability inAfrica. Participation was at the Head of State level and included representatives of some of the mostinf luential and significant private-sector stakeholdersin the world. The Summit adopted the GaboroneDeclaration  which  among other things  provides forpolicy improvements at both the Government and theprivate-sector levels  aimed at integrating the value ofnatural capital development. The Declaration also callsfor increased private-sector investment in Africa tohelp reduce food insecurity  improve livelihoods andincrease sustainability. We therefore call on the UnitedNations system and the international community ingeneral to commit to implementing the Declaration.There are many important and urgent issuesaffecting developing countries that must be addressed.They include technology transfer  funding and capacity-building in other areas  aimed at enabling such countriesto adapt to the requirements of a green economy in thecontext of sustainable development. In that regard  weurge the developed world to help developing countriesto address these critical issues and take acceleratedaction in order to deal with climate change and itscauses in their economies.However  we welcome the agreement to launch anintergovernmental negotiation process that will leadto the adoption of sustainable development goals aspart of the post-2015 development agenda  when theimplementation process of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals will have run its course. My delegation believesthat the process for developing sustainable developmentgoals should be synchronized with the 2013 review of theimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals. We would like to take this opportunity to commend thework done by environmental organizations worldwidein their efforts to save the planet from climate changeand its negative effects.Botswana participated in the ill-fated United NationsConference on the Arms Trade Treaty in July  whosepurpose was for Member States to agree on commoninternational standards for regulating the internationaltrade in conventional weapons. We believe that  whenadopted  an arms trade treaty will complement theUnited Nations programme of action for combating theproliferation of arms and ammunition  which continueto cause untold suffering.Before concluding  I wish to state that Botswanafully supports the call for implementing the Assembly’ssuccessive resolutions on lifting sanctions against Cuba something we believe is logical and long overdue."
"29",1178,"CAF",67,2012,"﻿It is a genuine honour and pleasure for me totake the f loor in the General Assembly Hall to reporton the great interest that the Central African Republictakes in the major international issues of concern toeveryone here.However  before doing so  I would like  onbehalf of my whole delegation  to extend my warmcongratulations to Mr. Jeremić on his election to thepresidency of the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session and to assure him of our full cooperation in his nobleand demanding work. I would also like to commend theexcellent work done under the presidency of Mr. NassirAbdulaziz Al-Nasser during the sixty-sixth session. Iwholeheartedly express my deepest thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the particular attention hefocuses on our post-conflict country  where the questto achieve and build peace remains a major challengeon the road to reconstruction and development. I alsocommend his tireless efforts to strengthen the role ofthe United Nations and to consolidate ever more firmlythe moral authority of the Organization.Before conveying our assessments and perspectiveson the main recurring themes of the general debate which constitute a litany of global concerns  let mefirst say that my country welcomes the initiative inconvening at the outset of the current session theHigh-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the Nationaland International Levels. That is an issue of criticalimportance  considering that the rule of law itself isbeing harshly put to the test all over the world. AllStates and all international institutions should strive topromote the rule of law at both the national and theinternational levels. Strengthening the rule of law anddemocratic institutions is of the utmost importance because they represent the guardians of sovereigntyand peaceful coexistence.The real battle at the national and internationallevels is to enforce respect for the rule of law whereverchaos prevails. Many challenges remain in maintainingthe rule of law. Hotspots persist and old conflicts eruptanew in many parts of the world  causing tragedy andthreatening to unravel the rule of law.In Africa the rule of law is particularly at risk ofbreaking down  threatened by tensions  disputes andconflicts in a number of high-tension areas  especiallyMali  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  theSudan  South Sudan and Somalia. The same appliesto other crises all over the world  carrying untold riskto governance and stability within countries  not tomention to international relations.The Government of the Central African Republicgoes to great lengths to support efforts to promotethe rule of law  justice and transparency through itsmanagement of the national institutions charged withenforcing the rule of law. Without peace and stabilityat the global and regional levels  national security and stability are out of the question  and therefore so is therule of law.All around the globe we hear cries for freedom anddemocracy. Since 1989 the world has been in a periodof change that has sparked much political fire in Africa.With the international transformations of the 1990s many African States  including the Central AfricanRepublic  have begun to move towards democratizingtheir political systems. Democracy  good governanceand human rights are interdependent. We can say thatthere can be no rule of law unless those values arerespected  both by Governments and the governed.The support and programmes designed to respond tocitizen’s expectations must take those shared valuesinto account  and the Government of the CentralAfrican Republic strives to achieve that every day. TheCentral African Republic has returned to democraticpractices  and there is no question that through theevolving democratic process efforts have been made toimprove the management of public affairs politically economically and socially. But we must admit thatmuch remains to be done  and it is something that theinternational community must commit to collectively.My country’s commitment to human rights hasbeen demonstrated  not only through its full accessionto many if not almost all  of the relevant internationaland regional instruments  but also in practice  throughits encouragement of those rights. Under the leadershipof General François Bozizé  President of the Republicand Head of State  we adopted a new Constitution on27 December 2004. The Constitution enshrines theprinciples of good governance  maintains the ruleof law and respect for human rights  and broadensthe scope of individual and collective liberties. TheConstitution also provides for recognition of theprinciple that international conventions ratified by theCentral African Republic take precedence over nationallegislation  thus encouraging the harmonization of ourlaws with our international commitments.In expressing its political will within the frameworkof the defence of civic and political rights protected bythe African Charter of Human and Peoples’ Rights  theCentral African Republic implements the provisionsof that Charter  which have been incorporated into itslaws. The Government is also making efforts to protectand encourage vulnerable groups  such as women andchildren and minorities  through social policies thatbenefit them.We are aware that the press is the fourth estate inevery democracy. In order to guarantee the exerciseof the freedom of the press in the Central AfricanRepublic  the Government enacted  on 22 February2005  Ordinance No. 05002  concerning freedom ofcommunication  which relaxes the laws concerningpress offences  notably by replacing prison terms withordinary fines for any contravention of the laws inquestion.In an effort to avoid post-electoral political crises the Government  the political parties — both themajority and the opposition parties — trade unions andcivil society are currently reviewing the electoral codein order to correct dysfunctional areas that were notedduring the election campaigns of January 2011. Thework being done will enable Central African politicalactors to undertake reforms and essential improvementsfor the next electoral cycle in a spirit of dialogue andconsensus.The state of the world should make us aware ofthe urgent need to strengthen multilateralism in orderto avoid the collective disaster we face  if we do notspeedily come up with appropriate and agreed-onsolutions to our global problems. The fundamentalgoals of disarmament and the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction continue to be heldhostage to the policy of the double standard  along withthe discriminatory practices and lack of respect forcommitments undertaken on the part of certain nuclearPowers.The fight against terrorism and violations ofhuman rights around the world  which is approachedselectively  and the biased implementation ofinternational humanitarian law has given rise tolegitimate doubts as to whether those noble causes arebeing exploited for political ends. That calls for actionby the Organization. Issues of climate change and theprotection of the natural world also demand a changedapproach that takes into account the aspirations of allpeoples. Floods and energy and drought-induced foodcrises continue in some parts of the world  and suchcrucial issues require greater mobilization on the partof the international community.This year we will renew the debate on the centralrole of the United Nations system  while puttingparticular emphasis on the global governance that itembodies. The Organization remains the keystone ofthe new world order and the conscience of humankind. That is why the need is greater than ever for a UnitedNations that can take on a more leading role in thatglobal governance  a groundbreaking organizationthat will be at the forefront of actions promoting aninclusive framework and global and lasting solutionsto all the crises that trouble our world and have directrepercussions for human rights.Increasing multipolarization and economicglobalization  the recent evolution of world economicgovernance and growing cooperation betweenemerging countries have all presented valuabledevelopment opportunities to many countries aroundthe world. The United Nations is the most universal andrepresentative intergovernmental organization with thegreatest authority  and it is the most important platformfor achieving multilateralism. Since its establishment ithas played a huge and irreplaceable role in maintainingworld peace  promoting shared development andstrengthening international cooperation. In today’sworld its role must be reinforced  not weakened.The Central African Republic will continue tosupport the essential and rational reform of the UnitedNations in line with the evolution of the internationalsituation  in order to increase its authority andeffectiveness  strengthen its capacity to deal withnew threats and challenges and better implementthe mandates entrusted to it by the Charter. Boththe revitalization of the General Assembly and thenecessary reform of the Security Council in order tomeet the legitimate aspirations of developing countries in particular in Africa  are certainly valid.The issue of civilian resources needed in postconflict situations takes us back to the Organization’sinitial purpose: to be a centre for the coordinated effortsof nations to maintain international peace and securitythrough peaceful means. The Charter has given rise totwo texts on the peaceful settlement of disputes: theGeneral Assembly Manila Declaration on the PeacefulSettlement of International Disputes of 1982 (resolution37/10  annex) and the 1988 Declaration on the Preventionand Removal of Disputes and Situations Which MayThreaten International Peace and Security and on theRole of the United Nations in this Field (resolution43/51  annex). We could also mention resolution 47/120 entitled “An Agenda for Peace”  drawn up followingthe summit meeting of the Security Council in January1992 convened to establish a doctrine of preventivediplomacy in order to anticipate crises or to facilitatetheir settlement through the mechanisms of good offices  mediators and special envoys of the Secretary-General supported by the Mediation Support Unit.In that context  the Government of the CentralAfrican Republic welcomes the African Union’slaunching of the African Solidarity Initiative in July. Itsaim is to mobilize contributions of all kinds in support ofthe various reconstruction phases in African countriesemerging from conflict. Post-conflict reconstruction iscomplex and requires short-  medium- and long-termprogrammes to prevent violence from escalating andthe reoccurrence of violent conflict and to strengthenand consolidate a lasting peace.Under the presidency of President Bozizé  theCentral African Republic  a post-conflict country thatowes much to the virtues of dialogue  quickly notedthe significance of such a tool in the prevention andsettlement of national crises. In that regard  I wouldlike to draw the international community’s attention tothe fact that the Central African Government has madethe issue of mediation a priority concern in its workplan. To that end  it established the National MediationCouncil.We should perhaps go further in establishingcivilian mediation bodies for the restoration of peace whose members would be charged with visiting thewarring parties in order to establish dialogue betweenthem and to help them to settle their disputes throughpeaceful means.The Central African Republic affirms that therecan be no rule of law without respect for and thepromotion of rights and freedoms  including that ofreligion  which should be practiced without extremism the consequences of which often lead to a clash ofcivilizations. Regional and international meetings havetaken place in the context of the dialogue of civilizations.However  violence and intolerance continue to affectsocial relations.This is the place to express to the Americanpeople the sincere condolences of the Central AfricanGovernment over the attacks on the United Statesconsulate in Benghazi  which led to the death ofinnocent victims."
"30",1225,"CAN",67,2012,"﻿It is anhonour to address the opening of the sixty-seventhregular session of the General Assembly.First of all  allow me to begin with a moment ofsilence in tribute to all the diplomats  from so manycountries  who have lost their lives in the service ofour common humanity and in the pursuit of deeperunderstanding among countries.With the opening of this session  the GeneralAssembly has passed an important milestone. Since thefirst session was convened in Central Hall Westminsterin London in January 1946 until the calling to order ofthis new session  precisely 66 years and eight monthshave elapsed. The General Assembly is now two thirdsof a century old — two thirds of a century during whichthe Assembly and the planet have been witness to bothgreat achievements and grave injustices and have seenboth human triumphs and human tragedies.It has been two thirds of a century during whichthe peoples of the world made powerful progress. Wehave launched humans into orbit. We have mapped thehuman genome and unlocked various mysteries of lifeand science. We have pulled hundreds of millions ofpeople out of abject poverty. And yet it has also beentwo thirds of a century during which we suffered deepdisappointment — the worst incidents of terrorismin the world’s history  including the largest terrorattack ever  here in New York on 11 September 2001;the failure to anticipate and prevent genocide inCambodia and Rwanda; and the stubborn persistenceof totalitarianism and despotism. Some developmentswere predictable. Others no one foresaw  and nobodycould have scripted.As we stand on the threshold of the next third of acentury  we are reminded of that old adage  “the only analogy. At one time  sailors would navigate by theNorth Star. Winds and currents would shift  stormswould blow  ships might even veer off course  but theNorth Star remained fixed — as a guide and as a goal.In the same way  the only way for us to navigate theseas of change is to follow fixed principles and chart acourse for immutable goals. In our opinion  those goalsare the well-being  prosperity  security and dignity ofhumankind  objectives that are reflected in the purposesinscribed in Article 1 of the United Nations Charter.We owe it to those we serve — to the people of thisplanet — to maintain consistent effort in that direction.They will judge our success by how well we furtherthe ends of prosperity  security  and human dignity. Onemeasures results by measuring the results themselves not by weighing best efforts  not by counting goodintentions  and not by calculating inputs. I do notpropose  therefore  to dwell extensively on reform ofthe United Nations. This Organization is not a goal; itis merely the means to accomplish goals. However  theUnited Nations must spend less time looking at itself and more time focused on the problems that demand itsattention. I make that observation in a constructive andpositive spirit.Canada was an original signatory to the Charter and is today the seventh-largest contributor to thebudget of this important Organization. Our commitmentto the United Nations has been tested and is proven.Our commitment to the United Nations is important.Nevertheless  because of our commitment to this body we cannot and will not participate in endless  fruitlessinward-looking exercises.Canada’s Permanent Mission to the United Nationswill henceforth devote primary attention to what theUnited Nations is achieving  not to how the UnitedNations arranges its affairs. The United Nations spendstoo much time on itself. It must now look outward. Thepreoccupation with procedure and process must yieldto substance and results. If the United Nations focuseson the achievement of goals — such as prosperity security and human dignity — then reform will takecare of itself. As the international community sets itssights on a post-2015 development framework  it shouldnot forget the work that remains to be done and thecommitments it has made.The United Nations Commission on Informationand Accountability for Women’s and Children’s Health co-chaired by Canada’s Prime Minister  StephenHarper  and President Jakaya Kikwete of the UnitedRepublic of Tanzania  is the type of initiative thatCanada would like to see more of in the future  and itsrecommendations need to be integrated into a post-2015framework.The Preamble to the Charter of the United Nationsreflects our collective determination to achieve “betterstandards of life” for all humankind. It sets as a goal“the economic and social advancement of all peoples”.That is no mean ambition. Those of us who recognizea Creator accept the responsibility to use the Creator’sgifts to improve the well-being of all. Openness andengagement are vital to progress and prosperity. Sincebefore recorded history  societies have reached out totheir neighbours and beyond. As soon as human beingsinvented transport  we invented trade  exchanging notjust the fruits of the Earth  but also goods  practices andideas. Informed by our successes and failures — thatis  having benefited from engagement and having paidthe price of isolation — humankind has learned severallessons. We cannot develop understanding by buildingwalls between cultures. We cannot achieve prosperityby erecting walls between economies. And we cannotadvance a people by putting walls between them andthe State.It is no longer necessary for humankind to endlesslydebate how to make people better off. There is nospecial alchemy required. Blessed with the benefit ofhuman experience  we know what produces prosperity:free trade among open societies operating undertransparent  consistent and fair rules. As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recently wrote  “engaging in theworld is the best path to a better future”.The fight for the economic and social advancementof all peoples is manifested in the struggle for openmarkets  open society and open-mindedness. It is astruggle in which Canada is decidedly not neutral. Werecognize that the well-being of Canadians dependsboth on openness at home and on openness to the world.Canadians know  from experience  the connectionbetween trade and prosperity. After all  in order tosupport the world’s tenth-largest economy with onlythe world’s thirty-sixth-largest population  we must bea trading nation. We are expanding trade at a rate ofunparalleled ambition  and consequently we are lookingfor partners. But we fully recognize that sustained traderequires stability and security.The United Nations will also be judged by howwell it advances the security of humankind. The goal ofsecurity is not separate from the objective of well-being. Security is  after all  a vital part of people’s well-being.Once again  openness and engagement are importantmeans of achieving that goal. While there may at timesbe tension in the means of execution  there exists nofundamental conflict between national security and theopen society; both seek to protect the same values  thesame rights and the same freedoms.It is not enough for a society to protect its ownsecurity. Global security affects all of us as membersof the global community. Or  as Nelson Mandelaeloquently put it  “freedom would be meaninglesswithout security in the home and in the streets”. Thus our freedom is strengthened when others are free  andour liberty is diminished so long as any of our brothersor sisters are imprisoned by fear. Because a threat toone is a threat to all  our security is enhanced when wecooperate to protect fragile democracies or to block theforces of instability.The crisis in Syria is a test of this Organization’sability to achieve results. While the brutal and repressiveregime of Bashar Al-Assad continues the slaughter ofits own people  the United Nations continues to fail toimpose binding sanctions that would stem the crimsontide of that bloody assault. Until the last moment ofrecorded time  the world will remember and history willjudge Member States that are allowing the atrocities tocontinue.Many people of the planet  including many of thecitizens whom we represent  cannot understand whythis Organization — despite the sound and fury ofdebate in this great Assembly — has been unable totake concrete steps. Some ask  “What business is itof ours?” Our citizens would argue that the businessis our common humanity  and our mandate is thestrengthening of humanity’s bonds. It is difficultto fault their logic. The late Martin Luther King Jr.once said: “He who passively accepts evil is as muchinvolved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He whoaccepts evil without protesting against it is reallycooperating with it”. And if the collective interest inour shared humanity does not motivate us to act  thenthe self-interest of our own security should. After all a stockpile of chemical and biological weapons doesnot respect national sovereignty or recognize territorialintegrity. Who among us would be secure if thechemical and biological weapons of another MemberState fell into the wrong hands? That is why Canadacalls on the Syrian regime to ensure that its stockpile of chemical weapons remains secure against possible useor proliferation by those who would do evil.When the post-Al-Qadhafi Libya declared itswillingness to destroy previously unknown stockpiles Canada stepped in and provided $6 million to theOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weaponsin order to achieve that vital objective. Until such anopportunity arises in Syria  Canada stands readyto assist neighbouring States in taking measures toreduce the threat of the proliferation of those terribleweapons. Until that time  Canada continues to call foran immediate end to the violence. Al-Assad must bereplaced by a new order that protects Syria’s territorialintegrity and all the rights of each and every citizen.I have seen the despair of the Syrian people firsthand on the Jordanian border  where a little girl heart-wrenchingly told me that all she wanted to do was to gohome. That experience will no doubt leave a lasting scaron the children caught in the middle of the tragedy. Wemust ensure that they have the opportunity for a betterlife — for a life free of fear and full of opportunity.I pledge that Canada will work to address the urgenthumanitarian crises wrought by the violence of the past18 months. It behoves all Member States in a positionto do so to improve conditions for the Syrian civiliansaffected by their great struggle against tyranny inpursuit of dignity.Today  the most significant threat to global peaceand security remains the regime in Iran. It refuses tocomply with Security Council resolutions. It routinelythreatens the very existence of the State of Israel. Itfoments hatred against the Jewish people and incitesgenocide. It provides aid  comfort and support toterrorist groups. It is guilty of the widespread andmassive repression of the human rights of its own people including gays  lesbians and religious minorities.A nuclear Iran would embolden an already recklessregime and would perpetuate a very destabilizingfactor not just for an already fragile region  but alsofor the entire planet. The Government of Canada hasnot only formally listed the Iranian regime as a Statesponsor of terrorism under Canadian law  but we havealso suspended diplomatic relations. Some may askwhy a country committed to openness and engagementwould suspend relations. We do not take such decisionslightly.On a practical level  the regime’s blatant disregardfor the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations created real and legitimate concern for the safety andsecurity of our civilian diplomats. But there is also a greatprinciple at stake. While Canada prizes engagementand open relations  there can be no open engagementwith a regime that dishonours its word  repudiatesits commitments and threatens to perpetuate crimesagainst humanity. Canada’s philosophy is captured inthe wisdom of Dag Hammarskjöld  the second UnitedNations Secretary-General  killed 51 years ago whilefighting for peace and justice. He advised: “Never  forthe sake of peace and quiet  deny your own experienceor convictions”. That is why Canada has imposed someof the toughest economic sanctions against the Iranianregime.However  let me be absolutely clear. Our quarrelis not with the people of Iran  but with the regime which aims to silence their voices. Canada urges Iranto comply with its international nuclear obligations andto cease sensitive enrichment activities. We supportthe process of the five plus one group of countries.Iran needs to seize the opportunity provided by theinternational community and negotiate in good faithby showing demonstrable progress and by meeting itsnuclear obligations.The Iranian regime still has the chance to redeemitself. In fact  I encourage Iran to follow the exampleof some of its neighbours  some of whom Canada hassupported in building nuclear energy programmes forpeaceful purposes. We will continue to work closelywith the United States  the European Union andother allies to put pressure on Iran to comply with itsimportant international nuclear obligations. Rather thanaccept as inevitable the conflict that Iran seems intenton provoking  Canada seeks a peaceful alternative. Iranmust act immediately to stop all enrichment and mustabandon technology that could be used for weapons.Iran is testing the will of the international communityto its utmost. That  too  must end.The world’s security is closely linked to the thirdgoal that should animate this Organization  namely protecting the dignity and worth of every person byupholding and protecting fundamental freedoms. Thegreat poet Kahlil Gibran inspired us to remember thatsafeguarding the rights of others is the most noble andbeautiful goal of a human being.That principle is not simply a question of beliefs andvalues. It includes a requirement for action. Protectinghuman rights and human dignity is an obligation thateach State owes its citizens. It is a mutual obligation that all members of the international community mustshare. History teaches us that an open society that istolerant  pluralistic and free is the best guarantor ofhuman rights and dignity.A threat to the security of humankind is oftencoupled with the crushing of human rights. Yet humanrights abuses that do not threaten security still concernus. The enslavement of others is a vicious human rightsabuse. It takes many forms  such as the notoriouspolitical prisoner camps of North Korea  the forciblerecruitment by the Mouvement du 23 mars groupin the Democratic Republic of Congo  and the earlyand forced marriage of young girls  which is a trulybarbaric form of slavery. Another despicable type ofenslavement is the criminalization of sexuality: jailing torturing and killing people for who they are and whomthey love. Other abuses enslave the soul by suppressing sometimes with brutal force  the right to worshipfreely  to practise a faith and to hold religious beliefs.Assaults on human dignity  wherever they occur  areunacceptable.At the start of my address  I observed that resultsmatter. This Organization was created to achievecertain goals  and it will be measured by its successin doing so. No one ever said that it would be easy tomake real progress in advancing the prosperity  well-being  security and dignity of humankind. It is not easybut it is essential. Despite the challenges  the frequentsetbacks and the cost  which is often heavy  we knowthat the nations and peoples of the world are up to thechallenge. As we celebrate Mohandas Gandhi’s birthdaytomorrow  let us be inspired by his words: “You mustnot lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if afew drops of the ocean are dirty  the ocean does notbecome dirty.”Emboldened and bolstered by our faith in humanity let us move forward together to secure the results thatthis Organization was established to achieve.constant is change”.The only constant is change. Indeed  our worldcontinues to change and at a rapid pace in all domains.At the geopolitical level  change means a rebalancingof power and new opportunities. Not since the ColdWar has so much change occurred so quickly. Inthese turbulent times  when change can be swift andunexpected  it is all the more important that we focuswith precision on the constants that remain true.Canada is a maritime nation bordered by threeoceans.

"31",1240,"CHE",67,2012,"﻿Ten years ago  Switzerland joined the United Nations thus becoming both the 190th Member State and thefirst country in which United Nations membershipwas approved by its citizens in a popular vote. TheUnited Nations and Switzerland share the same valuesand pursue common goals: the promotion of peaceand security  sustainable development  the protectionand promotion of human rights  and the provision ofemergency relief to victims of conflict and naturaldisasters.We face significant and pressing challengesin all these areas. Climate change  food and waterscarcity  migration  organized crime  terrorism and theproliferation of weapons do not respect borders. Theseare global challenges that threaten entire regions. In anincreasingly interconnected world  we have to searchfor global solutions that respond to regional and nationalneeds. It is not enough to simply maintain the statusquo. We have to find today the solutions of tomorrow.The United Nations spans the entire world. Itsuniversality gives it unparalleled legitimacy andenables it to find and implement solutions to globalchallenges that enjoy broad support. In view of thegrowing interdependence of those challenges  theUnited Nations is now more important than ever. It mustbe at the heart of international governance. The supportof every Member State and every one of us is thereforecrucial. In order to accomplish the Herculean tasksawaiting it  the United Nations can no longer settle forthe lowest common denominator  as it does all too oftenwhen consensus is reached among its Members. If theUnited Nations is to overcome the challenges facing it it must be efficient  innovative and active. What doesthat mean?The United Nations is efficient when it updates andimproves its processes so that it can act more rapidlyand in a more coordinated manner  despite growingbudgetary pressures. In this respect  Switzerlandsupports the reform agenda of the Secretary-General. Itshould be implemented swiftly.The United Nations is innovative when it developsnew ideas and solutions that are tailored to the bigpicture. United Nations structures have evolvedorganically over past decades. They do not encouragepeople to stray from the beaten path. More intensiveexchanges within the United Nations and between theOrganization and scientific circles  civil society andthe private sector promote creativity and ensure broadsupport for United Nations activities. At the seat ofthe United Nations in Geneva that type of exchangeis encouraged in a targeted manner. Switzerlandalso supports the strengthening and development ofref lection and research activities within the UnitedNations. Bringing those activities together in Genevawould further strengthen the creative potential of theOrganization.Finally  the United Nations will show its strengthsif it can achieve consensus in conflict situations andpush through to find solutions. Resorting to the rightof the veto in the Security Council is difficult to justifyin the event of genocide  war crimes or crimes againsthumanity. That is why Switzerland  together withother countries  continues to clamour for reform of theworking methods of the Security Council. Transparencyand the Council’s collaboration with other bodies withinthe Organization should be improved  and the right ofveto should be limited.As Switzerland traditionally defends dialogue  wecall upon all States and peoples to commit to greaterunderstanding and peaceful coexistence amongcultures  religions and beliefs. Freedom of belief andreligion  like freedom of opinion and expression are universally guaranteed core values that must beprotected and respected. Moreover  responding to anunpleasant opinion with violence can never be justified.It must be countered by ideas and logical arguments and if necessary through legal recourse  especially ifnational  religious or cultural hatred has been incited.The attacks in recent weeks against diplomatic missionsare therefore unacceptable regardless of the motivationbehind them. We all bear a common responsibility topromote tolerance and the respect for beliefs.For the current session of the General Assembly the President has chosen as the theme for the high-leveldebate “Bringing about adjustment or settlement ofinternational disputes or situations by peaceful means”.I applaud his choice. In recent years  the United Nationshas strengthened its capacity in the area of mediationand preventive diplomacy  which has brought about are-evaluation of mediation processes. We need to gofurther  however  as most of the United Nations budgetcontinues to be spent on peacekeeping operations.Switzerland is therefore convinced that greaterinvestment in peaceful means that could bring abouta settlement of disputes  especially through mediationand preventive diplomacy  would pay off in the longrun. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure;that is as true for States as it is for people.It is not just a matter of funding. Every singleconflict that is averted means the avoidance of humansuffering and the non-interruption of development in thecountries concerned. Over the past decade  Switzerlandhas actively participated in more than 30 mediationprocesses in some 20 countries. Moreover  Switzerlandregularly makes its experts and know-how available tothe United Nations and hopes to see its collaborationwith the Organization grow. Adapted to current needs special political missions respond to the complexity ofpolitical realities. Thanks to those missions  the UnitedNations is in a position to react f lexibly and quicklyin the event of a constitutional crisis or a coup d’état.As the main instruments of preventive diplomacy  suchmissions should be strengthened  specifically throughthe introduction of modalities  financing and optimalsupport.When prevention is not enough  the internationalcommunity must act firmly. The United Nations shouldtherefore demonstrate that it is capable of interveningand imposing itself. Switzerland is deeply concerned bythe dramatic worsening of the situation in Syria  wherehuman rights and international humanitarian law arebeing f louted. At this very moment  as I speak  innocentpeople are dying from bullets fired by the Syrian armyand the armed opposition. Thousands of people havebeen killed  more than 1 million are on the run in theirown country and some 250 000 have sought refugein neighbouring countries. It is difficult  maybe evenimpossible  to reach hundreds of thousands of victimswho  wounded and traumatized  are condemned to waitin zones under siege. United Nations agencies estimatethat approximately 2.5 million people need urgenthumanitarian assistance. Switzerland has therefore setaside more than $15 million for humanitarian assistancein Syria and neighbouring countries.As long as human rights continue to be trampled uponand those responsible are not sufficiently perturbed  itwill be impossible to guarantee security. Switzerlandtherefore calls for the perpetrators of serious violationsof human rights answer for their actions. The impunityof perpetrators is not just immoral; by compromisingthe process of reconciliation that gets under way in asociety after a war  it encourages history to repeat itself.Switzerland leads a group of some 30 countriesthat are asking that the International Criminal Courttake up the case of Syria. I would invite all heads ofState and Government present here today to rally to thatinitiative. The international community must be madeaware of the extent of human rights violations in Syria.Switzerland welcomes the work of the commissionof inquiry set up by the Human Rights Council andcalls for it to be strengthened. It also welcomes theappointment of Mr. Brahimi as the new Joint SpecialRepresentative of the United Nations and the League ofArab States for the Syrian crisis and will do its utmostto help him find a political solution to the conflict inthat country.We know that our use of the world’s availableresources is not sustainable at the global level. Weare exploiting those resources without concern forthe future. We also know that human beings are thecause of climate change. The fate of our planet rests inour hands. Much will depend on whether we succeedin making the transition to sustainable developmentand whether we succeed in moving towards a greeneconomy. The Rio+20 outcome document provides uswith an opportunity that we must embrace. We must acttoday so that future generations do not have to pay theprice for our inaction.However  a great deal of mutual distrust remains  asdoes the fear that not everyone will be able to competeon equal terms in a green economy. We must overcomethat hurdle. Switzerland will play its part in sharing theburden of efforts between the North and the South. TheGreen Climate Fund will be a key element in financingthat transition. It should therefore be set up withoutdelay and in an optimal environment. I am convincedthat Geneva can offer such an environment.The transition to a green economy also requiresnew approaches  in terms of both thinking and acting.In any process of change  there are winners and losers.However  with regard to sustainable developmentthe winners and losers are the same  namely  futuregenerations. Either they will be able to continue to livein an intact environment where they benefit from thenatural resources they need  or they will have to putup with a decline in the standard of living due to theexhaustion of resources and the broad consequences ofclimate change. Our common challenge lies in ensuringthe well-being of all without overexploiting our naturalresources.Switzerland attaches the greatest importance tothe post-2015 agenda  which will allow us to benefitfrom our experience with the Millennium DevelopmentGoals in order to prepare for the future. That approachgives us the opportunity to consider all dimensions ofsustainable development together and  for the first timeever  develop a universal system of targets for the well-being of future generations throughout the world.Switzerland is convinced that setting sustainabledevelopment goals is an important element instrengthening that development. It will play an activepart in defining a new system of goals. Switzerlandbelieves it imperative to combine discussions on thepost-2015 agenda and on sustainable development goalsinto a single process.According to the Roman philosopher Seneca  it isnot that we have a short space of time  but that we wastemuch of it. So let us today take on the great challengesbefore us. Let us join forces to bring about more peaceand security in the world and better protect human rights.Let us put an end to the impunity of the perpetrators ofserious human rights abuses and bring them to account.Let us take bold steps for more sustainable developmentin the interests of our children and grandchildren. Andlet us strengthen the United Nations so that  as the onlytruly universal Organization  it is better equipped toaddress those immense challenges."
"32",1286,"CHL",67,2012,"﻿Allow me to convey to Mr. Jeremić our warmestcongratulations on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session and toonce again extend to him our fullest cooperation. Wewould also like to convey our gratitude to Mr. NassirAbdulaziz Al-Nasser for his significant work duringthe previous session. We also congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his leadership at a timemarked by the immense scale of the challenges that weface.Chile’s foreign policy is based on principles suchas the defence of democracy  respect for human rights and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Among others those principles form part of the Charter of the UnitedNations. Their observance provides for coexistenceamong States at the international and national levels and thus preserves  for nations and their peoples the most precious asset of national societies and theinternational community  namely  peace.Peace is the basic value at the root of this body.However  despite the efforts made  serious problemspersist internationally  as well as nationally in someMember States. We have witnessed the Arab Spring which  by channelling the legitimate expressionof its peoples for greater freedom  democracy andrespect for human rights  resulted in some cases without prejudice to the difficulties that remain to beovercome  in processes that have led to democraticchanges. Regrettably  in other cases  it has given rise torepression and violence.The repression of their people by dictatorialregimes and the inability to peacefully forge democratictransition processes are the result of a mistaken way ofengaging in and understanding politics. Confrontationhas prevailed over tolerance  violence over dialogue andconflict over understanding  as we see now happeningin Syria.From this rostrum  we reiterate the call to allparties  in particular the Government of that country for an immediate end to the violence  respect forhuman rights and the establishment of the foundationsfor a dialogue that can lead to a political solution ofthe current crisis  in which justice and the rule oflaw prevail. The international community bears theresponsibility to support that process  while respectingthe principles of non-intervention  territorial integrityand  above all  human life.We must condemn the intolerance that shows a lackof respect for different cultures and beliefs and hasgiven rise to outbreaks of violence. Nothing justifiesthe criminal act committed in Libya against UnitedStates diplomats. We vigorously condemn that eventand any other act of violence  which  in that particularcase  negates the essence of the diplomatic function which this forum must specifically seek to defend withthe utmost resolve and determination.In addition  we have resolutely supported allinternational efforts towards a just  legitimate andlasting solution of the problem between Palestineand Israel. We recognize the Palestinian State — a country that we hope very shortly to welcome to theOrganization. We strongly believe that the Palestinianpeople have the right to a free  sovereign and democraticState. However  we also note that the State of Israel hasthe right to recognized  safe and respected borders.Only in that way will Palestinians and Israelis be ableto coexist and move forward in peace and harmony.The leaders of the States members of the Assemblyhave the moral obligation and enormous responsibilityof seeking to harmonize interests in order for reasonto prevail. The United Nations is the sole internationalforum with the necessary capacity to address themaintenance of peace  security  the protection of humanrights and international development cooperation. It istherefore our responsibility to strive to find the meansfor consensus to enable us to cooperate in resolvingcurrent conflicts  averting future ones  preservingpeace and launching a cycle of development for thebenefit of our peoples.Chile  through a sustained effort  has enjoyed morethan 100 years of peaceful international coexistenceon the basis of understanding and dialogue  as wellas legally and politically respected border agreementsand treaties  as borne out by our peaceful vocation.Nearly 40 years ago  however  my country experienceda crisis that shattered its institutional order and dividedour society  leading to a confrontation with tragicconsequences. Thanks to a united effort  an exemplarypeaceful transition was possible. Despite the deepdivisions that were a hallmark of that time  we wereable to move forward in building a solid foundationowing to the willingness to reach an understanding thatprevailed among political forces that previously heldirreconcilable positions.Moreover  despite its differences  Latin Americahas learned to live in diversity and has progressed morethan other regions in the past decade. In our region various kinds of Governments that propose differentpolitical and development models coexist. However through dialogue  understanding and reason  we havereached consensus on establishing regional integrationmechanisms that have enabled us to move forwardwith common goals. That policy  based on respectfor differences and the pursuit of mutually beneficialintegration  is at the heart of our foreign policy.Just as mutual respect and human understanding areground rules of our national policy to achieve freedom progress and social justice  the same should occur in the international political arena. This is the best forumfor the leaders of nations to debate ideas  free fromabsolute  exclusive or discriminatory positions  whichinevitably lead to confrontation. Many of the problemsfacing us are due to the fact that the virtue of dialogue which is the only means for our mutual understandingand civilized coexistence  is increasingly undermined.However  countries alone cannot always findthe basis for understanding in order to achieve thepolitical stability that makes solid institution-buildingand economic and social development possible. Theinternational community also has a responsibility.We believe that it is crucial not only to help countriesemerge from crisis situations  but also to support themin peacebuilding and development in a comprehensiveway. That means support for the rebuilding of politicalinstitutions and for internal reconciliation processes andsocial and economic development  which are tasks forwhich the Peacebuilding Commission was established.We strongly support its work.In that context  with regard to the United NationsStabilization Mission in Haiti  we believe that therequired modifications to its composition and sizemust be offset by strengthening the presence of thedevelopment component of the United Nations systemthrough its agencies  funds and programmes. Thatis fundamental to helping the reconstruction anddevelopment of Haiti.In that spirit of cooperation in peacebuilding we also welcome with satisfaction  a sense ofresponsibility and enthusiasm the invitation of theColombian Government to assist in the negotiationsprocess launched to put an end to the internal conflictthat has affected that brother country for more than 50years  causing so much suffering. We commend thewillingness and readiness of the parties and the courageof the Government of Colombia  which  building on thecircumstances brought about through its efforts andpatience in recent years  took the decision to initiatea peace process that  we trust  will end successfully tothe benefit of all Colombians.We have conveyed our vision of what we believeto be the most profound purpose of politics. On thisoccasion  we would also like to address the issueof Security Council reform. In order to strengthenits capacities and legitimacy  a more representativeand democratic organ that is in line with the newinternational reality should be formed. Chile reiteratesits support for a Security Council reform that envisagesthe expansion of its membership in the permanent andnon-permanent categories  thus ensuring due regionalrepresentation and enhanced transparency of itsworking methods.We also wish to reiterate our opposition to the vetopower. However  given its existence  Chile supports thecall for the veto not to be used in situations of crimesagainst humanity  war crimes  genocide or ethniccleansing. The countries with the veto power have agreat responsibility and the obligation to use it withmoderation and transparency in seeking to resolvecrises  putting aside national or ideological positionsthat hamper the system and render it ineffective.In that context  our commitment to the main themeson the international peace and security agenda has ledus to submit our candidature for Security Council forthe period of 2014-2015. As part of that effort  we wishto help strengthen the effectiveness of the multilateralsystem based on democratic values and principles namely  equality and individual freedoms and solidarity which are substantial aspects of our foreign policy. Wealso wish to contribute to that from the perspective ofLatin America and the Caribbean.Democracy demands respect for  and the promotionof  human rights  which requires full implementationof the rule of law. Chile is firmly committed to that.Our own experience regarding a shattered democracy with tragic consequences for the rights of individuals which I have already mentioned  underscores for usthe importance of developing public policies. It alsohighlights the need to implement the instrumentsmade available to us by the international system  withparticular emphasis on those that support the mostvulnerable  namely  children  women  young people indigenous peoples  people with disabilities and theelderly. In that regard  we support strengthening thefunctioning of the human rights treaty body systemand the work undertaken by the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights.In addition to the issue of peace  another acuteproblem for nations today is the international financialcrisis. It has wrought havoc on markets  trade  finance investment and  worse still  employment. As in the caseof politics  where confrontation and the lack of dialogueimpede solutions and compromises  in economics the improper practices of excessive spending  a lack offiscal tightening and the absence of adequate regulatoryframeworks triggered the crisis that currently affects usand whose end is not yet in sight.The experience of our country and our region hastaught us harshly in recent decades that progress andtrue development require measures that are not populistor short term. Governments must act responsibly andcontrol public spending without turning to that asan easy solution to artificially promote an economicboom. The current crisis blatantly shows the painfulconsequences of such policies. A rigorous fiscal policyand the establishment of stabilization funds  like somecountries have created  such as Norway on the basisof oil and Chile on the basis of copper  are examplesof efficient mechanisms for economic stability andbalancing global cycles.Similarly  in seeking solutions to the crisis  wemust avoid the temptation to resort to artificial andshort-term measures. There are voices clamouringfor the imposition of protectionist practices to boostthe economy. Such practices may benefit a specificeconomic sector in the short term. However  they have af leeting effect. Let us not fool ourselves. Protectionismprotects inefficient industries and provides citizens withpoor quality and more expensive products. Worse still it undermines productivity  eliminates competition andentrepreneurship and hampers real development.Our experience shows us that we must take theopposite path  namely  greater openness and more freetrade. Threats to democracy are thereby overcomethrough greater democracy. Economic growth is boostedby greater openness to markets and fewer obstacles toglobal trade. Years ago  our country launched tradeliberalization by  first  unilaterally reducing its tariffsand  subsequently  through free trade agreementsthat today extend to more than 60 countries and thatrepresent more than 85 per cent of world gross domesticproduct. Chile has the most free trade agreements andhas the world’s eighth-lowest tariffs  at less than 1 percent on average.Despite external difficulties  that policy has enabledus to increase our growth by 6 per cent in the past twoyears and to achieve the region’s highest per capitaincome. In turn  it has made it possible to reduce thelevel of unemployment  poverty and extreme povertyby creating new jobs and social protection programmes.  Real and effective integration goes beyond trade.We are also pursuing shared projects with other nations such as the recent Pacific Alliance initiative  launchedtogether with Peru  Mexico and Colombia. It focuses onthe integration not only of goods and services  but alsothe free movement of people and capital  thus sharingthe full potential of our economies. Such initiativeswith Pacific Rim countries are not new. In 1994 we were already part of the Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation  seeking to accelerate trade liberalizationin a broad region that unites the largest economies onboth sides of that ocean. Subsequently  in 2005  alongwith Singapore  New Zealand and Brunei Darussalam we launched a process to forge an ambitious freetrade agreement. Today  that project  known as theTrans-Pacific Partnership  aspires to create the largestglobal free trade area with the accession of newmembers  including the United States.Two years ago  only days after the Governmentthat I represent assumed its duties  a natural disaster ofglobal proportions  namely  the fifth-largest earthquakeregistered in the world since such disasters wererecorded  caused destruction and death in our country.Chile recovered thanks to the solidarity and unity ofits people and as a result of the generous assistance offriendly nations and organizations. Recently  PresidentSebastian Piñera Echeñique affirmed the announcementthat he made at that time  pointing out that  by the endof his term in office  all material damage would befully rebuilt.In recent years  we have seen an increase in thenumber of natural disasters — f loods  tornados typhoons  earthquakes and mudslides. There is no placeon the planet that is not either suffering or has sufferedfrom a natural disaster. No country has the capacityto deal with disasters of that scale alone. There istherefore a need for the assistance and solidarity amongnations that we saw not only during the earthquake in2010  but also at the time of the collapse of the SanJosé mine  which affected 33 miners. The lives ofthose miners were saved thanks to their courage  to thedetermination of the Government of Chile to rescuethem and to international cooperation.In Chile  we have strengthened disasterpreparedness and early-warning systems and haveenhanced the national civil protection agency inorder to ensure greater coordination at the national regional and local levels. However  the occurrenceof some of those natural phenomena is also linked to environmental protection. Preserving the environmentis another topic that merits the attention of theinternational community and means that we should actresponsibly to safeguard for future generations a cleanenvironment and sustainable development that respectsnature. The recommendations of the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development  namely sustainable development goals  financing mechanismsand a mechanism to transfer and distribute clean energy should now be implemented.Chile assumed the position of the first pro temporepresidency of the Community of Latin American andCaribbean States (CELAC) with great satisfaction. The33 member States of Latin America and the Caribbeanagreed the Community’s guiding principles andpurposes  including the promotion and protection ofdemocracy and human rights  political coordination integration  the fight against poverty and inequalityand stronger global engagement. Among the issuesof interest to CELAC that I would like to underscorein this forum is support for the legitimate claims ofthe Argentine Republic in the dispute for sovereigntyover the Malvinas Islands  South Georgia Islands andSouth Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritimeareas. We call for a resumption of negotiations with theUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Irelandin order to find a peaceful and lasting solution to thatdispute. CELAC also wishes to underscore the need toput an end to the economic blockade imposed by theUnited States of America against Cuba. The GeneralAssembly has adopted important resolutions on bothmatters.We live in a world of great opportunities  but alsosignificant challenges and global threats that require thecoordinated action of the international community inorder to ensure an appropriate response. Only througheffective  efficient and inclusive multilateralism willwe find the best way to respond to those great globalchallenges.The United Nations system has the capacity toexercise leadership in pursuing international peace andsecurity  in promoting sustainable development andcooperation and in protecting and promoting humanrights. Also  in seeking to resolve the global economiccrisis  in environmental protection and in the rapidinternational response to prevent and provide assistancein the case of natural disasters  we  as Member States must demonstrate the political will to make that capacity a reality and thus ensure that the politicallycorrect action is also morally correct.The President of Bolivia mentioned  in terms that donot comply with the norms of good coexistence amongnations  that country’s maritime claim (see A/67/PV.11).Along with the formal note of reply that was submittedto the President of the General Assembly  in addressingthis debate I feel obliged to categorically reject theposition  affirmation and charges made against mycountry. It is timely to reiterate to the Assembly thatthere are no outstanding border issues between ourStates. Those matters are clearly set out in the 1904Treaty of Peace and Friendship  and are fully respected.Chile has fully met its obligations under thatTreaty  allowing the most extensive free transit throughits territory by means of high-quality infrastructure as acknowledged by the Bolivians themselves. Boliviahas no right to claim access to the sea. The respect ofborder agreements between neighbouring countries isone of the cornerstones for coexistence among Statesand is the guarantor of international peace  as prevailsbetween our countries.Before this Organization  Chile reaffirms thatthe Constitution of the Plurinational State of Bolivia adopted in 2009  introduced provisions that contravenethe framework of international law  which governs thepeaceful coexistence among nations. Those provisionsare therefore not enforceable with regard to our country.As declared by a committee of lawyers appointed bythe League of Nations in 1921 and as acknowledgedat the last session of the General Assembly of theOrganization of American States  held in the Boliviancity of Cochabamba  this is strictly a bilateral matter.Chile has continued to convey to Bolivia its readinessfor brotherly dialogue  based on full respect for thetreaties in force  which provide significant benefits forboth peoples. It is in the hands of Bolivia to accept thatinvitation."
"33",1332,"CHN",67,2012,"﻿I wishto congratulate Mr. Jeremić on his election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.I am confident that with his ability and experience hewill successfully fulfil that lofty mission. I also wish to thank Mr. Al-Nasser for his positive contribution asPresident at the last session.The world is undergoing major and profoundchanges. The trends towards multipolarity  economicglobalization and the application of informationtechnology are gaining momentum. Countries havenever been as interconnected and interdependent as theyare today. Emerging markets and developing countrieshave never had such strong influence  and cross-civilizational dialogue and exchanges are flourishingas never before. To promote peace  developmentand cooperation has become the shared aspiration ofpeople across the world and the common pursuit of theinternational community.On the other hand  the world is still far from beingpeaceful. The underlying impact of the internationalfinancial crisis and the European debt crisis remainsstrong. Destabilizing factors and uncertainties affectingglobal growth have increased. Regional turbulencepersists  hotspot issues keep emerging and traditionaland non-traditional security issues have becomeintertwined. The international security environment ishighly complex.Facing both unprecedented opportunities andchallenges  we must not allow the outdated Cold Warmentality and zero-sum game theory to stand in ourway. We should act like passengers who stick togetherin a boat when crossing a torrential river and seekwin-win progress through cooperation. That is the onlyoption for countries around the world. To ensure one’sown security  a country should respect and accommodatethe security of other nations. To achieve one’s owndevelopment  a country should actively promotecommon development. In pursuing one’s own interests a country should take into account the interests ofother nations. Only by promoting common security anddevelopment for all its members can the internationalcommunity effectively address complex and multiplesecurity threats and global challenges  resolveincreasingly serious difficulties facing development andensure durable peace and sustainable development inthe world. With that in mind  China believes that it isimportant to do the following.We should promote equality and democracy ininternational relations. Mutual respect and equalityare basic norms governing international relations. Allcountries  large or small  strong or weak  rich or poor are equal members of the international community. Respect for each other’s sovereignty  core interestsand choice of social system and development path is afundamental principle guiding State-to-State relations.We should resolutely promote greater democracy ininternational relations. A country should deal with itsinternal affairs itself. Issues involving the interests ofvarious countries should be handled by those countriesthrough consultation. We should remain true tomultilateralism and uphold the purposes and principlesof the Charter of the United Nations and the central roleof the United Nations in international affairs.China strives to strengthen political mutual trustand to address problems and differences with othercountries through dialogue and exchanges. China doesnot interfere in the internal affairs of other countries orimpose its will on others. China does not allow outsideforces to interfere in its internal affairs.We should seek win-win progress throughcooperation on development. As economic globalizationdeepens  all countries have a high stake in each other’ssuccess. We should therefore enhance cooperationand develop common interests to achieve win-winprogress with benefits for all. We should tap thepotential for cooperation in all countries  increase anddevelop cooperation  improve cooperation mechanismsand work together to make economic globalizationbalanced  inclusive and beneficial to all.We should accelerate the development ofdeveloping countries and narrow the North-South gap.We should enhance global development cooperation toensure that the benefits of development reach everyone.Since the start of the international financial crisis while maintaining its own robust growth  China hassignificantly increased contributions to internationalfinancial institutions  extended a helping hand to otherdeveloping countries and bought more bonds fromcertain developed countries. That has helped to stabilizethe international economic and financial situation andto maintain the economic and social development of therelevant countries.We should ensure fairness and effectiveness inconducting global governance. Facing increasingglobal challenges  the international community shouldstrengthen coordination and cooperation  establish afair  equitable  flexible and effective system of globalgovernance  properly address the various global issuesand promote the common well-being of humanity.China supports the United Nations in enhancing its authority  efficiency and ability to address new threatsand challenges through the required proper reform.It is important to advance the building of a globalsystem of economic governance with a focus onreforming the international financial system  rapidlyimplement the quota and governance reform plans ofthe International Monetary Fund and other financialinstitutions  and increase the representation and voice ofemerging markets and developing countries. We shouldfully implement the outcome and consensus of theUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development(resolution 66/288  annex)  further develop internationalcooperation on sustainable development and discuss theestablishment of a post-2015 international developmentagenda based on actively implementing the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.We should launch a process of open  transparentand democratic intergovernmental consultation with development and poverty reduction as the coreobjectives. We should also fully leverage the role ofcivil society and the private sector in that task. Togetherwith all other parties  China is ready to activelyparticipate in reforming the international system and inglobal governance and to jointly face the various globalchallenges.We should pursue common progress by embracingthe diversity of civilizations. According to ancientChinese philosophy  the world will be a great placewhen all things thrive without harming each anotherand when various efforts are pursued in parallelwithout their clashing. We should encourage exchangesand mutual learning among different civilizations andsocial systems  draw on each other’s strength throughcompetition and comparison and make progress byseeking common ground  while maintaining ourdifferences. We should respect the diversity of the worldand the right of all countries to independently choosetheir development path. China encourages dialogueand exchanges among civilizations. We should replaceconfrontation with dialogue and bridge differenceswith inclusiveness in order to make the world moreharmonious and to ensure common progress forhumanity.We should seek common security amid growinginterdependence. No country is immune to the complexand multiple security threats and challenges in theworld. We should foster a new thinking on security thatis characterized by mutual trust and benefit  equality and coordination. We should adopt a holistic approachto address both the symptoms and the root causes ofthe various security challenges and should build apeaceful and stable international and regional securityenvironment.The United Nations should fully play its role inmaintaining international peace and security andin establishing a fair and effective mechanism forcommon security. We must resolve disputes throughdialogue and negotiation and oppose the wilful use orthreat of force. We must oppose all forms of terrorism separatism and extremism.West Asia and North Africa are undergoingprofound changes. China respects and supports effortsby countries in those regions to independently dealwith their internal affairs. We respect the aspirationsand calls of people in those areas for change anddevelopment. The unique features of those regions interms of religion  civilization  history and ethnicitymust be respected. We hope that the relevant parties willsettle differences through inclusive and constructivepolitical dialogue and that they will resolve problemspeacefully.Safeguarding peace and stability in those areas upholding the fundamental and long-term interests ofArab countries and ensuring the growth of friendlyChina-Arab relations will remain a central goal ofChina’s policy towards such regions. We will continueto tirelessly strive  together with countries in thoseareas  to promote peace and development in line withthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the UnitedNations.China is deeply concerned about the stalledPalestinian-Israeli peace talks and the economicand humanitarian difficulties facing the Palestinianpeople. The turbulence in the region should not divertinternational attention from the Palestinian issue. Chinasupports the Palestinian people in establishing  on thebasis of the 1967 border  an independent Palestinian Statethat enjoys full sovereignty  with East Jerusalem as itscapital. China supports Palestine’s membership of theUnited Nations and other international organizations.China urges both Palestine and Israel to take concretemeasures to remove obstacles and to work for the earlyresumption and substantive progress of the peace talks.China is deeply concerned about the ongoingtension and worsening humanitarian situation inSyria. We call on all relevant parties in Syria to put an immediate end to the fighting and violence  toimplement the relevant Security Council resolutions Mr. Kofi Annan’s six-point plan and the communiquéof the foreign ministers’ meeting of the Action Groupfor Syria (A/66/865  annex)  and to launch an inclusivepolitical dialogue and a Syrian-led political transition assoon as possible. China is open to any political plan thatis acceptable to all parties in Syria. The relevant partiesof the international community should play a positiveand constructive role in that regard  credibly supportMr. Lakhdar Brahimi  Joint Special Representativeof the United Nations and the League of Arab States in conducting impartial mediation  and strive to setin motion and move forward the process of politicaltransition in Syria.The Iranian nuclear issue has reached a new  criticalstage. The relevant parties should remain committed toa diplomatic solution and begin a new round of dialogueas soon as possible. In the spirit of respecting eachother’s concerns  we should act with flexibility andpragmatism to expand common ground and overcomedifferences  seek early progress in dialogue andnegotiation and  over time  achieve a comprehensive long-term and appropriate solution to the issue. Chinahas always supported efforts to uphold the internationalnuclear non-proliferation regime and will continue towork with the parties concerned and play a constructiverole in seeking a peaceful solution to the Iranian nuclearissue through dialogue and negotiation.The Asia-Pacific region has maintained generalstability and rapid growth for many years  therebymaking important contributions to global stabilityand prosperity. Given the growing threat of shrinkagein the global economy and increasing volatility in theinternational situation  maintaining peace  stabilityand sound growth in the Asia-Pacific region is crucialto ensuring the well-being of its people and meets thebroader interests of the international community.We should fully respect the reality of adiverse and interdependent Asia-Pacific region and continue to follow the approach of regionalcooperation — building consensus  makingincremental progress and accommodating each other’scomfort levels — that has proved effective over theyears. We should promote regional development withgreater determination  advance regional cooperationwith increased resources  and handle differences withlonger-term interests in mind so as to uphold the peace stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region. As an important participant in building theinternational system  China is committed to sharingdevelopment opportunities with other countries andto working with them to overcome various challengesand realize security and development for all. Chinawill stay the course of peaceful development. We seeka peaceful international environment in which Chinacan promote its own development. By so doing  Chinawill contribute to global peace and development. Chinais firm in upholding its core interests. At the sametime  it respects the legitimate right of other countriesto protect their interests. We seek to expand commoninterests with other parties for the sake of the commongood.China has contributed a total of some 21 000personnel to United Nations peacekeeping missionsand taken an active part in international cooperationon counter-terrorism  anti-piracy and non-proliferationefforts. In our efforts to resolve major internationaland regional hotspot issues  we have urged the partiesconcerned to seek peaceful solutions through negotiationand thereby played an important and constructive rolein easing tensions and achieving the political resolutionof those issues. China has made remarkable progressin pursuing peaceful development and will continue tofollow that path in the years to come.China will enhance friendly relations andcooperation with all other countries on the basis ofthe five principles of peaceful coexistence and striveto promote a new type of relationship among majorcountries based on mutual respect and win-wincooperation. Following a policy of building goodrelationships and partnerships with neighbouringcountries  China has actively expanded exchanges withits neighbours.China has contributed to over 50 per cent ofAsia’s growth for many consecutive years. We haveendeavoured to build mechanisms of mutual trust andpolitical cooperation with other Asian countries andappropriately to address differences and frictions amongrelevant countries. On the basis of firmly upholdingChina’s sovereignty  security and territorial integrity we have worked with our neighbours to maintain soundrelations and overall stability in the region. China treatsother developing countries as good friends and goodpartners; we therefore support each other and seekcommon development on the basis of equality.By the end of 2011  the Chinese Government hadbuilt over 2 200 projects that are important to the local economies and people’s lives in the countriesconcerned. We have cancelled the debts owed to Chinaby 50 heavily indebted poor and least-developedcountries. We have trained over 60 000 personnel invarious sectors for 173 developing countries and 13regional and international organizations. All of that hascontributed to the economic and social development ofother developing countries.China has taken an active part in reforming theinternational system and global governance  andassumed its due share of international responsibilitiesand obligations as its capabilities permit. We areworking to build a fair  equitable and non-discriminatoryglobal trading system and a more equal and balancednew global partnership for development. We supporta greater role for the Group of Twenty as the premierforum for international economic cooperation  as wellas the efforts of emerging markets represented by theBRICS group — Brazil  Russia  India  China and SouthAfrica — aimed at exploring a new model of globalcooperation.The global economy is at a critical stage  andachieving full recovery and sustained growth will be along and difficult task. Last year  despite a challengingeconomic environment both at home and abroad  Chinaregistered a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rateof 9.3 per cent  and made good progress in adjusting itseconomic structure and improving people’s lives. Sincethe beginning of the year  in order to address somenew problems in economic performance  the ChineseGovernment has stepped up anticipatory fine-tuning ofthe economy and introduced a series of targeted policymeasures. That has boosted market confidence andensured steady growth.China’s GDP grew by 7.8 per cent in the first half ofthe year  and the country has enjoyed sound economicand social development. China is still in an importantperiod of strategic opportunities for development.Industrialization  urbanization  the application ofinformation technology and agricultural modernizationwill continue to unlock our great potential fordevelopment. We have the confidence  means andability to maintain steady and robust growth andachieve long-term  sound and sustainable development.During its twelfth five-year plan for the period2011-2015  China’s domestic market will become one ofthe largest in the world. Its total imports are expectedto exceed $10 trillion  and direct outbound investment is expected to exceed $500 billion. That will createenormous business and job opportunities for the worldand provide good opportunities for other countries’development.The Diaoyu Islands have been an integral partof China’s territory since ancient times. China hasindisputable historical and legal evidence in thatregard. Japan seized the islands in 1895 at the end of theSino-Japanese War and forced the Chinese Governmentof the time to sign an unequal treaty to cede the islandsand other Chinese territories to Japan. After the SecondWorld War  the Diaoyu Islands and other Chineseterritories occupied by Japan were returned to Chinain accordance with the Cairo Declaration  the PotsdamAgreement and other international documents.By taking such unilateral actions as the so-calledisland purchase  the Japanese Government has grosslyviolated China’s sovereignty. This is an outright denialof the outcomes of the victorious anti-fascist WorldWar and poses a grave challenge to the post-warinternational order and the purposes and principles ofthe Charter of the United Nations. The moves made byJapan are totally illegal and invalid. They can in no waychange the historical fact that Japan stole the DiaoyuIslands from China and that China has territorialsovereignty over them. The Chinese Government isfirm in upholding China’s territorial sovereignty. Chinastrongly urges Japan to immediately stop all activitiesviolating China’s territorial sovereignty  take concreteaction to correct its mistakes and return to the path ofresolving the dispute through negotiation.The Communist Party of China will soon holdits eighteenth National Congress. We are confidentthat the important meeting will lead China’s reform opening-up and modernization drive to a new stage.The facts have shown and will continue to prove thatChina’s development is peaceful  open  cooperative andwin-win in nature. We will work with the internationalcommunity to follow the trend of history and the callof the times and build a harmonious world of enduringpeace and shared prosperity."
"34",1366,"CIV",67,2012,"﻿His Excellency Mr. Alassane Ouattara  President ofthe Republic of Côte d’Ivoire  who was not able tobe here today  wishes me to express  on behalf of thepeople and Government of Côte d’Ivoire  the warmestcongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremićon his well-deserved election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Iwould like to assure Mr.Jeremić of the full support of the Ivorian delegation for the success of his mandate.I would also like to convey to his predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  mydelegation’s satisfaction with the work undertaken andthe encouraging results achieved under his presidency.His commitment to our common cause has allowed theOrganization to fully play the role conferred upon itby the United Nations Charter. I wish to reiterate toHis Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon mysincere thanks for his determined commitment and forhis persistent quest for peace throughout the world.I reiterate to him once again the infinite gratitude ofmy President and the entire nation for his unfailingcommitment to Côte d’Ivoire. Through the Secretary-General  I would like to pay tribute to all the civiland military personnel of the United Nations for theirtireless efforts on behalf of peace and security.The theme chosen for this session  “Bringing aboutadjustment or settlement of international disputesor situations by peaceful means”  follows on fromthe theme of the previous session. In particular  itreflects the essence of the ideals of the San FranciscoConference  which led to the birth of the Organization.The purposes ascribed to the United Nations in itsCharter can be summarized by the triptych of peace liberty and development. To achieve those Charterpurposes  the founding fathers of the Organizationestablished a system of collective security on the basisof two major principles: the prohibition of recourseto the use of force in international relations and theobligation to settle disputes peacefully.Now more than ever  we must enhance our collectivesecurity system and ensure that it has all the necessaryresources to be effective. For his part  the President ofCôte d’Ivoire is committed to strictly following a policyof peace and dialogue. These are principles that wereenshrined as cardinal virtues  through trial by fire by the late President  Mr. Félix Houphouët-Boigny who won a place in the history of Côte d’Ivoire  andindeed of the African continent  through his pragmaticapproach to the settlement of conflict through dialogue.For that reason  President Allassane Ouattara sparesno efforts in seeking lasting solutions  both nationally inthe post-electoral crisis in Côte d’Ivoire  and regionally especially with regard to the situations in Mali andGuinea-Bissau. Indeed  the security of West Africa isseriously challenged by military and political crisesorchestrated by military  rebel or terrorist movements particularly in Mali and Guinea-Bissau. The Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS)  which has always promoted the path ofnegotiation highlighted by the theme of this session  isworking tirelessly to ensure a positive outcome to thosecrises and to ensure the restoration of constitutionalorder and democracy in Mali and Guinea-Bissau.While the situation has considerably improved inGuinea-Bissau  the one in Mali continues to be of majorconcern. Rebel movements linked to terrorist networkscontinue to occupy the main towns in the north of thatcountry  which they are now pillaging and destroyingwith total impunity.Determined to put an end to this abusive occupationof the north of Mali  ECOWAS plans to deploy amilitary force at the request of the Government of Malito help the Malian army efficiently fulfil its sovereignmission of defending the territorial integrity of thecountry. The establishment and deployment of such aforce requires major support from the African Union the United Nations and all development partners.Indeed  the presence of groups with links to terroristsin northern Mali is a genuine threat  which could lead if nothing is done  to the implosion of the entire WestAfrican region and the Sahel.When we look at the non-State players involvedin the current conflicts in Guinea-Bissau and Mali particularly the terrorist networks and armed groupslinked to transnational crime and piracy in the Gulfof Guinea  we note how incomplete the currentinstruments for resolving these crises are  based asthey are on negotiation and mediation. Today  there isno questioning the fact that the resurgence of terrorismin the Sahel region in general and in northern Maliin particular has created a sanctuary  a lawless zone.Western Africa faces other dangerous threats to thesecurity of not only the region itself but also otherregions  perhaps even Europe.Eradicating these problems requires concerted anddiligent action by ECOWAS  the African Union andthe United Nations. I am pleased to note the creation ofthe United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre  which isfinanced and hosted by Saudi Arabia. I also welcomethe proposal made by the Secretary-General to appointa United Nations counter-terrorism coordinator  and Iwould like to assure him of Côte d’Ivoire’s full support.Transnational crime  drug trafficking  humantrafficking  piracy in the Gulf of Guinea and thedestruction of the environment are threats to the world in general and to Africa in particular. The InternationalMaritime Organization  in its 2010 annual report  quiterightly said that the West African coast is one of the sixmain centres of piracy in the world. Responsibility forthe measures to be taken to deal with these scourgeslies first and foremost with the States of the subregionand the principal subregional organizations.In that regard  I welcome the fact that the fortyfirstECOWAS Summit  held in Yamoussoukro on28 and 29 June  decided to convene a joint summit ofWest African and Central African States to take jointmeasures on piracy and organized transnational crimein the Gulf of Guinea pursuant to Security Councilresolution 2039 (2012).However  despite the goodwill of the countries ofthe subregion  they cannot  on their own  deal with thethreats facing maritime security. My country welcomesthe proposal of the Secretary-General to facilitate theorganization of a summit of heads of State of the regionto enable them to draw up a regional strategy to combatmaritime piracy  together with the African Union.Côte d’Ivoire  like many other African andnon-African States  sincerely hopes that theOrganization will be able to adopt in the near futurea legally binding arms trade treaty  following theefforts made by all parties to reach a consensus. Theinternational community must not lose the historicopportunity it has to better regulate  if not outrightprohibit  a trade that causes 500 000 deaths each yearand that is the main cause of violations of humanrights and the destabilization of our States  as well asworsening conditions for our people  and  above all poses a constant threat to regional and internationalpeace and security. With respect to the links betweeneconomic development and the environment  the UnitedNations Conference on Sustainable Development held in June in Rio de Janeiro  shows what we canaccomplish when we work together to build a betterworld for current generations and those to come. Thecombined crises in food  energy and the environmentthreaten the peace and security of all humankind. Yetwe have the means to achieve a world free of famineand hunger. It is within our capabilities.Allow me to stress that  with respect to theinternational system  Côte d’Ivoire urges all delegations as we take up the eighth round of intergovernmentalnegotiations concerning the reform of the SecurityCouncil  to show flexibility and a spirit of compromise. It is important to act quickly  because the compositionof the Council is the keystone of our collective securitysystem  and in that light its composition should bedesigned to maximize efficiency.In order for the Security Council to be trulyeffective in its decisions  since it devotes two-thirdsof its time to the African continent  we consider itmore critical than ever for Africa to hold a permanentseat with the right of veto  in accordance with therecommendations defined in the Ezulwini Consensus.Taking duly into account the wishes of African headsof State and Government  the reform of the SecurityCouncil could represent a historical opportunity thatthe international community should seize in order torepair an anomaly in international relations. With thatin mind  I hope that the forthcoming negotiations onSecurity Council reform will be crowned with success yielding a Council that truly represents the realities ofour shared history and our contemporary world.I would like now to make some remarks about thesituation in my country. Thanks to the most valuablesupport of the international community  especially theUnited Nations  Côte d’Ivoire has emerged from themilitary and political crisis that rocked the foundationsof its economic and social development for nearlya decade. Resolutely committed to the path of postconflict reconstruction  and with the aim of nationalcohesion  Côte d’Ivoire has made considerableprogress in the political  economic  social  securityand humanitarian spheres since 21 May 2011  theofficial date on which President Ouattara assumedthe presidency of the Republic. Those results weremade possible by the determination of the IvorianGovernment to implement the three central prioritiesdefined by the President when he took office.First  on security and stability  significant jointefforts by the Government and the United NationsOperation in Côte d’Ivoire lead to improvements in thesituation  even in the west of the country  which hasbeen the most problematic area.Secondly  national reconciliation has been effectedthrough the National Commission for Dialogue  Truthand Reconciliation  which has been serving as thestanding body for maintaining political dialogue.Reconstruction and economic renewal are alreadyoff to a good start  with an estimated growth of morethan 8 per cent in the gross national product for 2012.The economic situation has greatly improved  thanksto the support of our development partners  especially after we met the goals of the Heavily Indebted PoorCountries Initiative in June.The resulting drop in our foreign debt and theadoption of our national development plan for the period2012-2015 allow Côte d’Ivoire to hope that we can reachthe double-digit economic growth rate necessary forour country to become an emerging country by 2020 as envisioned by President Ouattara.Before concluding  I would like to say that Côted’Ivoire notes that the President of the General Assemblyat the previous session opened an informal interactivedialogue  at the level of the United Nations  on the issueof the responsibility to protect. In the aftermath of thatuseful forum and in the light of the lessons learned Côte d’Ivoire  following the example of the Secretary-General  believes that the principle of the responsibilityto protect has achieved sufficient maturity and thatwhat remains to be done now is to implement it.On that basis  the Economic Community ofWest African States and the Global Centre for theResponsibility to Protect jointly held a regional forumin Abuja devoted to that concept. A similar meeting isscheduled to take place in Côte d’Ivoire at the end ofthis year.In conclusion  I would like to reiterate the gratitudeof President Ouattara  his Government and the Ivorianpeople to the United Nations and the entire internationalcommunity for their commitment to peace and stabilityin Côte d’Ivoire. That constitutes to be the preconditionfor development."
"35",1409,"CMR",67,2012,"﻿I speak on behalf of Mr. Paul Biya  Presidentof the Republic of Cameroon  who has had to remain inCameroon owing to painful circumstances. He askedme to read the following statement.“Allow me  first of all  to warmly congratulatethe President on his election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.The experience he brings as former head of thediplomatic corps of his country leads me to believethat he  like his predecessor  Mr. Nassir AbdulazizAl-Nasser  will lead the discussions with therequisite agility and talent. I would also like to express to Mr. Al-Nasser my country’s appreciationfor his action as President of the General Assemblyat its sixty-sixth session.“Finally  I would like thank Secretary-GeneralBan Ki-moon for his devotion to serving the idealsof the Organization.“This has been an active year for theOrganization. We have held major meetings todiscuss the important questions of the day andexamined the most appropriate course of action toaddress them. Allow me to return to two of them.“First of all  there is Rio+20  the UnitedNations Conference on Sustainable Development which was held in June 2012 to commemorate thetwentieth anniversary of the historic Earth Summit.The meeting enabled us to define the future we wantto leave our children.“I am pleased that the vision adopted at theend of the meeting recognizes the need to furtherincorporate at all levels of activities the economic social and environmental aspects of sustainabledevelopment. If we want to leave a liveable worldto future generations  the green economy seems themost effective way of ensuring that developmentmeets the needs of populations while at the sametime preserving the environment.“For our part  Cameroon has already begunactions in that respect. We intend to work further topreserve our natural capital and to seek low-carbonsolutions  as well as to promote production andconsumption patterns that are sustainable.“In our view  progress towards the greeneconomy must be gradual and enjoy the supportof the international community. In that respect the document adopted at the end of the RioConference committed the international communityto upholding the many obligations that had beenundertaken with respect to Africa in terms ofsustainable development  while ensuring  inter alia appropriate technology transfer. The internationalfinancial institutions and the United NationsConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)are called upon to strengthen their activities to thatend. That is a significant step forward.“The second important meeting that we shouldnote is the thirteenth quadrennial session held byUNCTAD in Doha  Qatar. Less commented upon by the media than the Rio meeting  that session aimedto curb the excesses of globalization and to refocusit on development. Globalization  because of what ithas brought to the development of trade  economicand technological progress and the rapprochement ofcultures  can be considered a positive phenomenon.The fact remains  however  that because of poormanagement and poor regulation  it was unable toprevent economic crises and relegated problems ofunderdevelopment to the backburner. UNCTAD after the Doha meeting  was reinforced in its role interms of trade and development  which is somethingto be welcomed.“Since 2008  we have seen a slowdown in globaleconomic activity. Industrialized countries  be theyEuropean Union or the United States or Japan have  to varying degrees  been experiencing seriousdifficulties — slower growth or even recession increased debt and public deficits  imbalancesin foreign trade  and so on. Emerging countriesthemselves  which had seen high growth rates have been experiencing a slowdown as well. As todeveloping countries  even if they continue to makemoderate progress  they fear the effects of a crash ofthe global economy and a possible contagion.“A few moments ago I said that globalization even if it does have some positive aspects  has notachieved its main objective  that is  ensuring theharmonious functioning of the global economyand global finance while taking into account theinterests of all concerned parties. That relativefailure has revealed an urgent need for regulation.Right now it is hard to see how and when that needcan be met.“Major forums  such as the Group of 20  ofwhich industrialized countries make up the majority and the World Trade Organization have  for theirpart  discussed several times the question of theglobal economy and outlined solutions that couldre-establish an overall balance. But it has to be saidthat  given the scale of the task  the lack of availableresources and the difficulties that major countriesthemselves are having to face  the discussions havenot always been followed by action. From thatstandpoint  the international community seems tobe going through a period of doubt and concern.Every one of us is aware that urgent and large-scaleaction is required  but  preoccupied with our own problems  we seem to be in a state of paralysis andunable to take the decisions that need to be taken.“The obvious risk is one of a return toprotectionism — a temptation that is alreadyevident. If we believe the signs  that could onlybring temporary respite and in time could exacerbatethe recession. African countries  and Cameroonin particular  which have undergone a long crisismarked by declines in gross domestic product the harsh discipline of structural adjustment plansand the worsening of social hardship  are in agood position to evaluate the consequences ofa deterioration of the economy. That is why theyplace their hopes in a broad consultation with aview to the comprehensive regulation of economicand financial flows that would take into account thesituation of the different categories of countries andprovide opportunities for international solidarity toplay a role.“For its part  Cameroon has drawn lessonsfrom the current situation. Back on its feet  thanksto the sacrifices of its population and relieved ofthe weight of their debt by external partners  theeconomy of Cameroon is now focused on takingadvantage of its natural resources. Well endowedby nature  my country intends to develop modernagriculture in order to consolidate its food self-sufficiency and encourage exports. Also  awarethat its industrialization requires the availability ofsufficient energy  we have set in motion a programmeto exploit our vast hydroelectric potential. Finally several mining projects  together with the buildingof adequate road transport and port infrastructure are under way. We hope to make progress on theroad to development and the improvement of theliving conditions of our population.“I would now like to express my appreciationfor the President’s choice of theme for the generaldebate  namely  ‘Bringing about adjustment orsettlement of international disputes or situations bypeaceful means’. That subject follows on from lastyear’s theme and enables us to revisit the Charter ofthe United Nations and to remind ourselves of thevalues that it promotes and that should guide ouractions.“The theme recalls recalls the fundamentalprinciples of the Organization  which are  interalia  the maintenance of international peace and security through the adoption of effective collectivemeasures and the settlement by peaceful meansof disputes which could lead to a breakdown ofpeace  in accordance with the principles of justiceand international law. That reminder is not withoutvalue at the present moment  when tensions persistin the Sahel  especially in Mali  when the Sudan andSouth Sudan struggle to normalize relations  andwhen Syria is ravaged by internal conflict. Thosetensions highlight the risk of force being used toresolve differences.“The use of force can be justified in somecases  such as to respond to international terrorism violations of human rights and democracy  threatsto the security of persons or violations of thesovereignty and territorial integrity of States.However  it is clear that  before resorting to thatextreme  peaceful means must first be used toresolve disputes  so as to avoid setting off a viciouscircle of violence and retaliation. Far be it from meto indulge in utopianism. There are situations whenmilitary intervention is perhaps inevitable. But itis our responsibility to reduce to the minimum thelikelihood of military action by taking a maximumof precautions. In any case  clearly the preferredway to settle disputes is still through prevention andnegotiation.“For the greater part of international publicopinion  the United Nations embodies the noblesthuman values and the hope for a future in keepingwith the ideals of peace  security and development as enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Letus strive to keep that hope from being yet againbetrayed.”"
"36",1453,"COD",67,2012,"﻿Atthe outset  I should like to join previous speakers incongratulating Mr. Vuk Jeremić and the other membersof the Bureau on his election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Ishould like also to congratulate Mr. Nassir AbdulazizAl-Nasser for the work that he accomplished duringhis mandate  and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moonfor his commitment to defending the ideals of ourOrganization.The holding of a session of the General Assemblyoffers each of us an opportunity to participate in acollective process of ref lection on ways and means ofensuring the success of efforts aimed at peace  securityand development in each of our States and throughoutthe world.President Jeremić has rightly recommendedthat interventions during this general debate focusin particular on the adjustment or settlement ofinternational disputes by peaceful means. Thatrecommendation is particularly wise because this is anissue whose relevance and timeliness are immutableand which is part and parcel of the process of tirelesslyseeking peace through means other than the use offorce.World history makes clear the operational validity ofthe principle of the peaceful settlement of internationaldisputes. It also teaches us that processes of dialogueand negotiation  in order to remain credible as ways ofresolving conflicts and disputes  must be based on truthand respect for the law and the values and universallyrecognized principles. They should guard against bothhasty action and stalemate  and they should demonstrateeffectiveness by producing the hoped-for results  evenif this is done in a gradual manner.It must be noted that more than 60 years after thefounding of the United Nations  the world continuesto witness many situations of war and instability.Terrorism is increasing instead of decreasing. Maritimepiracy  which we thought had been eradicated  is onceagain becoming one of the main threats to peaceand security. The Middle East is today a hotbed oftension. Syria is in the throes of bloodshed  and Mali iswitnessing attempts at separatism.More broadly  as peace is more than just the absenceof war  many scourges still affect humanity. Many aredevoting their creativity and energy to destabilizationand destruction  by means of drug trafficking  trafficking in persons and other violations of the rightsand freedoms of human beings  instead of working forthe prosperity and for individual and collective well-being.In addition  for the sake of more than two thirds ofhumanity  there is an increasingly urgent need to fightpoverty  ignorance  violence  injustice and diseases ofall kinds  particularly HIV and malaria.After years of difficulties  my country  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  is in the processof consolidating of peace and security. To that end  noeffort has been spared  and remarkable progress hasbeen made. Begun for the first time only 10 years agoin a country that has had independence for 50 years tireless efforts towards democratization  the buildingof a State based on the rule of law  the development ofthe socioeconomic infrastructure  and the improvementof the living conditions of our people continue  which isproof of the determination of the Congolese people andof its leaders to be a factor of peace and stability.That momentum  unfortunately  is now underthreat by the enemies of peace. Since March 2012  theprovince of North Kivu  in the Democratic Republicof the Congo  where the concepts of peace  stability reconciliation  work and human dignity had begunto regain a foothold  has  sadly  once again gainednotoriety  not because of the incomparable beautyof its landscape or the extraordinary richness of itsbiodiversity  but as an example of the profound evilthat selfishness  extremism  communal violence andthe philosophy of “might makes right” can wreak ona society.Even as I address the Assembly today  hundredsof thousands of children  women and men in NorthKivu are deprived of peace and are being subjected toinhuman and degrading treatment by negative forces led by unrepentant elements with a vast capacity to doharm and who benefit from external support. Childrenare unable to attend school and are forced to carryand use firearms to kill other children  even their ownbrothers and sisters. That situation is unacceptable. Itshould be condemned and should give rise to sanctions.We expect that the community of nations will shoulderits responsibilities in that respect and that the SecurityCouncil will ensure compliance with its resolutions.That is a condition for those resolutions to be effectiveand remain credible.We are aware that it is up to us  the Congolesepeople  to defend our country and ensure law and orderand security throughout our national territory. We aredetermined to assume that responsibility and we intendto dedicate all of our human  material and financialresources to that end  even sacrificing our legitimateambitions for the emergence of Congo. We also remaindetermined to guarantee national cohesion and ensureequal protection for all Congolese citizens.At the same time  it is my hope to see the Organizationencourage all Member States  in particular those that aretempted by violence  to respect the guiding principlesof the Charter of the United Nations.In conclusion  I would like to thank all those who from afar or from close by  bilateral or multilateralpartners  including the United Nations  have assisted usin our efforts to build at the centre of Africa a Congothat is united and prosperous and that lives in peacewith itself and with all of its neighbours. I would liketo assure the Assembly of one thing: the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo is a safe investment."
"37",1500,"COG",67,2012,"﻿It is ahappy coincidence — and one that gives me greatpleasure — that my fellow countryman  who is presidingat this meeting  has given me the f loor.Despite progress in the field of knowledge andforecasting  the evolution of humankind remainssubject to uncertainties. In that connection  the work of the United Nations  which is the appropriate forumfor seeking collective solutions to the many challengesthat make up our world  is markedly affected by thoseuncertainties.The persistence and resurgence of hotbeds oftension of all kinds pose a serious threat to peace andinternational security  jeopardize the implementationof all projects for sustainable development and posea dangerous threat to the promotion and protectionof human rights. In that context  it is appropriate thatthe sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly hasopened under the banner of the theme  “Bringing aboutadjustment or settlement of international disputes orsituations by peaceful means”. My delegation welcomesthat choice  which is also in line with the theme of theprevious session on mediation and reflects in a timelymanner the concerns of the day and aspirations of ourStates.A year ago  speaking from this rostrum  I assertedthe importance and necessity of mediation as anessential tool for the prevention and settlement ofconflicts  a tool that has proved itself  not only in Africabut around the world. Having endured the horrors ofarmed conflict for years in the 1990s  the Congo chosethe path of mediation and dialogue. Thanks to thatcommitment  my country has been able to overcomethe sociopolitical upheavals of its recent history  andtoday  the peace that reigns throughout the country hascleared the way for the impetus needed to strengthenour democratic process and economic development.Two rounds of legislative elections were conductedin an atmosphere of calm on 15 July and 5 August followed by the peaceful celebration on 15 August ofthe fifty-second anniversary of our independence inKinkala  city seat of the Department of Pool  which hadendured violence for a long time; those events serve asadditional examples of positive developments.Strengthened by that experience  the Congo wouldlike to voice its deep concern about the continuingcrises threatening peace and security  regionally andinternationally. For many years Africa has been thetheatre of choice for conflict. Today a number of Africancountries — indeed  in some cases an entire region like the Sahel — are still at the mercy of instabilityand increasingly complex crises. Several meetingsdedicated to conflicts in Africa are listed on the agendasof high-level meetings during the General Assembly’scurrent session  which is unquestionably an indicatorof instability in the world. However  we can agree that the conflicts and crises that have marked the Africancontinent for the whole of its post-independence historyhave also enriched it with the experience of mediationinitiatives and have mobilized efforts aimed at settlingthe conflicts by peaceful means.The Democratic Republic of the Congo is dealingwith a serious crisis in the eastern part of the country characterized by repeated violence that has resultedin an intolerable humanitarian tragedy produced bysmall armed groups of the Mouvement du 23 marsand other opposition forces. That situation is a seriousthreat to peace and security and to the integrity anddevelopment of our brother country. Furthermore  thepolitical  security  socioeconomic and humanitarianconsequences can be felt throughout the Great Lakesregion. The heads of State and Government of theregion  meeting at the International Conference on theGreat Lakes region  are fully committed to seekingpeaceful solutions.I would like to take this opportunity  as I did thismorning  to commend again the initiative of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to organize a high-level meetingon 27 September on the situation in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  which will certainly provide astimulus to the International Conference on the GreatLakes Region  supported by the African Union. TheCongo  which is committed to that effort as a neighbour a State member of the Conference and a member ofthe Peace and Security Council of the African Union concurs with the conclusions of that important meeting hoping to see them realized as soon as possible  so asto enable the Democratic Republic of the Congo toregain its stability and play the role expected of thatgreat country. Our region will continue with its effortsto achieve the objectives we have sought and will useevery mechanism we have to attain them.In December the Congo will host the thirty-fifthministerial meeting of the United Nations StandingAdvisory Committee on Security Questions inCentral Africa  which will allow us to celebrate thetwentieth anniversary of that General Assembly bodyand continue our cooperation on settling crises in thesubregion.The collapse of democracy in Mali  which was oncea fine example of democracy in Africa  represents arelapse that my country has condemned  while callingfor a return to constitutional order. The deterioratinghumanitarian situation  combined with the risk of spreading terrorism  calls for urgent implementationof the decisions of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States  together with the support of the AfricanUnion  the United Nations and the internationalcommunity  so as to ensure that that dangerousprecedent is not repeated anywhere else and that anyimpulses towards destabilizing and partitioning Statesby terrorist groups are quashed.My delegation can only welcome the positivedevelopments in the political process established bythe African Union in Somalia  which culminated inthe election on 10 September of the new Presidentof the Republic  Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud.Many challenges remain  of course  particularlythose of security  unification and reconciliation andestablishing the rule of law  to name only a few. Inthat regard  we must support Somalia by helping thatcountry to strengthen the gains of recent months focusing everything we do on working within a globalstrategy for the reconstruction and development of theentire Somali territory and maintaining a coordinated organized and coherent approach on the part of theinternational community  in support of the efforts ofthe African Union Mission in Somalia.Regarding the dispute between the young Republicof South Sudan and the Republic of the Sudan  mydelegation urges both countries to demonstrate thenecessary political will and to spare no effort tosuccessfully and implement sign the ComprehensivePeace Agreement  as called for by the African Unionin envisioning the existence of two viable Statesand a lasting peace. We support the African Union’snegotiations in Ethiopia on that issue.Outside the African continent  particularly withrespect to the Middle East  the ongoing violence incertain countries continues to erode the prospects forpeace in the region  not to mention the blocked peaceprocess between Israel and Palestine  now deadlockedfor several decades and  even worse  10 years after theadoption of the Arab Peace Initiative. The Arab springhas apparently not bloomed there  to the detriment ofthe interests of a people who have the same right as anyother to live in peace with its neighbours in a viableState. The Palestinian State has a rightful place in thisbody.The situation in Syria is particularly troubling  asspeakers before me have emphasized. Faced with therisks of the general destabilization that that situation presents for the subregion and the world  we call for acoordinated and negotiated settlement that takes intoconsideration the interests of the various parties  soas to put an end to the escalating violence and seriousviolations of human rights.Regarding the nuclear issue  which represents aserious threat to humankind in general  it is essentialthat the nuclear-weapon States take responsibility  asthey should  to implement specific measures that willenable progress towards genuine nuclear disarmament while monitoring the ban on nuclear proliferationwith regard to military purposes. We reaffirm theimportance of respecting the three pillars of the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  that is nuclear disarmament  non-proliferation and the rightof every State to develop nuclear energy for peacefulpurposes under the supervision of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency.The development agenda of the United Nations isstruggling to give sustainable support to our countriesin their unceasing efforts to improve their economicdevelopment and their peoples’ well-being. Thecommitments made by industrialized countries at themajor international conferences under the auspices ofthe United Nations have still not been met. The globaleconomic and financial crisis continues to weaken theeconomies of developed as well as developing countriesaround the world. We are also concerned about theongoing crisis in the euro zone and its effects  whichare having a considerable impact on the achievementof social development objectives at the internationallevel  including the Millennium Development Goals.Areas such as the fight against poverty  employment education and health are affected by the crisis. Inthat light  my delegation reaffirms the responsibilityand central role of the United Nations in forging thespirit of solidarity and cooperation that can enable thecommitments made in the areas of aid and financing ofdevelopment to be respected.Climate change remains a serious threat to theequilibrium of mankind. Sadly  we have to admit thatwe have not done enough to reverse its negative effectson the environment. It is therefore important to wasteno more time and work to find solutions that will ensurea better future for coming generations.Along those lines  my delegation took an active partin June at the United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment (Rio+20)  a high-level exchange on thechallenge of sustainable development. The President of the Congo  Denis Sassou Nguesso  brought Africa’svoice to the Conference  in his role as spokesperson forthe continent. While we welcome the analysis and thereaffirmation of shared positions that the Conferenceyielded  my delegation remains concerned about thelack of real progress on the important issues of aninstitutional framework for sustainable developmentand for global environmental governance  as well asplans for their implementation.Although not all of Africa’s concerns wereaddressed  Africa’s common positions are neverthelesswell represented in the Rio+20 final document (resolution66/288  annex)  thanks to the dogged perseverance andresolve of the African Group  which maintained unityand strove throughout the negotiation process to keepthe African point of view in the fore. I want to takethis opportunity here in New York to convey PresidentSassou Nguesso’s words of appreciation to the AfricanGroup and to extend his special thanks to the group ofexperts led by Kenya and its Permanent Representative.The sixty-seventh session of the Assembly is animportant forum for a follow-up to Rio+20. I onceagain urge African delegates to speak with one voicein defending African interests in the vital matter ofsustainable development. Especially important is theintergovernmental process for developing proposals foreffective sustainable development financing strategiesto mobilize resources and put them to effective use.I could well have raised many other issues  suchas Security Council reform and the need for genuineglobal governance that takes into account people’sdesire for multilateralism. But I will limit myself to afew words about certain concerns that should be takeninto account. First is the need for global governanceof political and security issues through the necessaryreform of the Security Council. We also need to addressglobal economic management by granting greaterauthority to the Economic and Social Council. Finally there is the need for global environmental managementthrough an international institution with real powerto protect the environment and promote sustainabledevelopment.Our times demand the pursuit of those legitimategoals  shared by the majority of Member States of ourworld Organization. Its credibility and credit in theworld will increase if we meet the challenge of globalgovernance with a unified drive to create a more peaceful  prosperous and just world for the benefit ofall."
"38",1547,"COL",67,2012,"﻿Two years ago  during my first address before theAssembly as President of Colombia (see A/65/PV.15)  Iexpressed my country’s aspiration to become a memberof the Security Council for the period 2011-2012.We assumed the responsibility of participating inmaking decisions about critical situations that threatenworld peace in a spirit of absolute independence andwell aware of the enormous commitment required towork for international peace and security. It has beena particularly turbulent time  but one during which theaspirations of many peoples who had suffered long conflicts and armed confrontation have been furthered.Countries like Liberia  Sierra Leone and Côte d’Ivoireare now making strides towards peacebuilding and therule of law.In Libya  a ruthless tyranny in place for more than 40years was dismantled in a process in which the SecurityCouncil played a decisive role. My Government didnot hesitate to condemn the violent repression of thecivilian population justly clamouring for the exerciseof their fundamental rights. That is why we joined theCouncil’s decisions furthering a transition towardsa democracy that  although still fragile  enjoys thesupport of the international community as it seeks toentrench itself. There are still violent groups that wantto sabotage that process by terrorist methods. I takethis opportunity to condemn in the strongest terms thedespicable attack perpetrated against the United Statesconsulate in Benghazi. Extremism  terrorism anddisregard for human life cannot be allowed to persist.Today  the Arab world is experiencing afundamental political transformation  opening theway towards democracy. If the process is to last  itwill require respect for people’s rights and the creationof conditions conducive to sustainable economicdevelopment. We hope that participation by citizens especially women  will continue to increase and fosterdemocratic systems and opportunities for developmentand welfare.With regard to the dire situation in Syria for morethan a year and half  I must express our deep frustrationwith the inability of the international community to put an end to the tragedy that every day takes more and moreSyrian lives. From this rostrum  we reiterate our callfor an end to the attacks and for a political negotiationthat will meet the legitimate aspirations of all sectorsof Syrian society. Implementing Kofi Annan’s six-pointplan would greatly contribute to facilitating a Syrian-led political transition. We strongly support the newJoint Special Representative of the United Nationsand the League of Arab States  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi and wish him much success in his very complex anddifficult task.As a representative of a country that is currentlya member of the Security Council  I would like tobrief ly turn to the matter of its reform  which hasbeen under discussion for 20 years. Colombia believesthat consensus should be our guide in developing acomprehensive approach that includes change in boththe Council’s composition and its working methods soas to promote more effectively the United Nations goalsof peace  well-being and humanity.In our hemisphere  one country that requirescomprehensive peacebuilding is Haiti. We continue towork for Haiti. Its recovery will require our continuoussupport in strengthening its capacities  institutionsand productivity so as to generate employment  reduceextreme poverty and promote the United Nations workfor development in the country. I urge everyone topersevere in that cause.A key event for the world this year was the UnitedNations Conference on Sustainable Development(Rio+20). Inspired by the Millennium DevelopmentGoals model  Colombia led the proposal to establishthe sustainable development goals  which was themost important outcome of the Rio+20 process. Today the sustainable development goals promise to be afundamental component of the planet’s developmentagenda  and the Secretary-General himself hasidentified them as one of the five priorities of hislegacy. We are therefore especially pleased that ourForeign Minister has been invited to be a member of thehigh-level panel on the post-2015 development agenda which held its first meeting yesterday.This year  the sixth Summit of the Americas gatheredin Colombia  with 30 Heads of State and Governmentfrom the western hemisphere in attendance. It was afruitful gathering  which for the first time we organizedsimultaneously with a business summit attended by theleaders of the premier companies of the Americas. Wealso held a social forum that brought together peoplefrom diverse social organizations on the continents.The Summit of the Americas in Cartagena wascharacterized by frank and open dialogue about themost crucial issues for the region and the world. TheGovernments of the Americas agreed to undertakean analysis and discussion of the track record effectiveness and future prospects of the so-called waron drugs  as well as possible alternatives to it. It is ourduty to question with scientific objectivity whether weare doing the best we can or if there are better optionsto more effectively combating the scourge. To that end we mandated the Organization of American Statesto begin an analysis and discussion  inviting otherentities — the first of which would be  of course  theUnited Nations — to participate.That is only a first step  but it is of great importancebecause it is the beginning of a discussion that theworld has avoided for many years. We hope that it willultimately yield concrete results. The debate aboutdrugs that have caused so much harm throughout theworld and to my country must be frank and  mostcertainly  global.Similarly  in my statement before the GeneralAssembly two years ago  I expressed my convictionthat the dawning decade should be the decade ofLatin America and the Caribbean — a decade thatwould consolidate that region of the world as a regionof peace  progress and solutions for the rest of theplanet. Today  we are pleased to note that our regionis indeed experiencing a favourable moment with solideconomies  functional democracies and no currentconflict among the nations of which it is formed.Regional coordination mechanisms of relativelyrecent establishment  such as the Union of SouthAmerican Nations and the Community of LatinAmerican and Caribbean States  are evidence of theresolve of our countries and peoples to cooperate. Iwould like to highlight the enormous potential of thePacific Alliance that was formalized this year amongMexico  Peru  Colombia and Chile. The Alliance isopen to the participation of other States with which weseek to strengthen not only trade but also political andhuman ties  as well as to the nations of the immensePacific basin.I cannot conclude without referring to the specialmoment that our country is currently experiencing.Against the backdrop of international turbulence  we have been successful in maintaining a healthy economythat has generated over 2 million new jobs over thecourse of two years  attesting to the major progresswe have made in reducing poverty. We have put inplace initiatives of great social impact  such as a lawfor victims  which is the only legislation in the worldthat seeks to return lands to displaced peasants andto compensate the victims of a conflict that remainsongoing; or major hydrocarbon and mining royaltiesreform to more fairly distribute the revenues generatedby such activities  and thereby promote more effectivesocial development.Nevertheless  our progress  which has beenremarkable  has been curtailed by an absurd conflictthat has now lasted half a century. Today  Colombiais suffering through the most prolonged internalarmed conflict in its hemisphere  indeed perhaps oneof the longest-lasting in the world — an ever-moreanachronistic and inexplicable conflict. Above all  itis inexplicable in the light of the development of ourdemocracy and of our social progress.Aware of that  and without neglecting theprotection and security of the Colombian people andwithout ceding an inch in the fight against terrorismand crime  my Government is resolved to move forwardprudently  seriously and firmly  and without repeatingthe mistakes of the past  by entering into conversationswith the guerrilla forces in order to achieve an end tothe armed conflict.After two years of exploratory contacts  we haveannounced to the country and to the world that aphase of talks will be initiated on a short and concreteagenda  which we hope will allow us to achieve thedesired outcome. The talks will begin in Oslo duringthe first half of October and will continue in Havana thanks to the goodwill of the Governments of Norwayand Cuba  which will serve as guarantors. We will alsohave the backing of the Government of Venezuela  towhich we are grateful for its valuable support  and ofthe Government of Chile  which will be working withus during the second phase.Today  before the General Assembly  I wish tothank the international community for the support it hasexpressed at outset of the talks and for its willingnessto cooperate and help in any way that is necessary. Weembark upon the talks with moderate optimism and inthe absolute conviction that it is an opportunity thatwe cannot squander to achieve a peace that is good notonly for Colombia but for the entire region. With regard to my statement today  a few days ago Iasked the Colombian people through social media whatmessage they wanted me to bring here to the GeneralAssembly. Among the many messages I received  Iwant to share one from my compatriot Henry RodríguezChacón: “An entire generation wants to wake up oneday to the news of a peace agreement.” That is the mostheartfelt wish of the Colombian people.Aware that the process must have brief deadlinesand precise terms if it is to be successful  I trust thatI will be able to deliver to the Assembly next year apositive outcome of the effort  which we undertakeenthusiastically with a view to ending our 50-yearconflict.We do not want to talk just about peace; we wantto build conditions for peace. That is what we are doingon a daily basis with the actions of our Government andnow with the talks that we are initiating. Today  withgreat hope  we present the world with this new specialmoment for my country  Colombia."
"39",1587,"COM",67,2012,"﻿Allow me at the outset  to extend my warmest congratulations toHis Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić  Minister for ForeignAffairs of Serbia  on his election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly. I should like to express to himthe pleasure of the Union of the Comoros at seeing himpreside over our work and to assure him of the fullsupport of the Comorian delegation in discharging hisnoble task.I should also like to pay tribute to his predecessor Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  former PermanentRepresentative of the State of Qatar  who presided overthe General Assembly with such wisdom  skill anddetermination and who was successful in working tostrengthen its role.Finally  I wish to congratulate the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for thevision with which he has led the Organization and forthe worthy initiatives he has ceaselessly undertaken topromote respect for the purposes and principles of theCharter of the United Nations  especially peacebuildingand stability for greater development.As was the case last year  the General Assemblyis meeting in a context of global uncertainty. It is aclimate marked by multifaceted crises  all of themmajor challenges for our institution. It is meeting ata moment when one of the Members of our UnitedNations family  Syria  is being rent asunder by a steadilydeterioraiting fratricidal war  which poses a seriousthreat to peace both for the region and for the world due to that country’s strategic geopolitical position.The resignation of the Joint Special Envoy of the UnitedNations and the League of Arab States  former UnitedNations Secretary-General Kofi Annan  demonstrated were there any need for such  the complexity ofmanaging the Syrian conflict. It therefore behoves us toact without delay to put an end to the terrible sufferingof the brotherly Syrian people and to save what can besaved of its various infrastructures.Just as important is the Palestinian cause. Fordecades now  it has awaited a fair and lasting solution one found through our shared desire to establishtogether the solid foundations for a world of peace andprosperity. The Union of the Comoros reiterates its fullsupport for the Palestinian people and associates itselfwith the formula of a Palestinian State as a full-fledgedmember of the community of nations  living side byside and in perfect security with the State of Israel.The situation in northern Mali is also alarming.The attacks carried out against the civilian populationof the region  the serious violations of human rights the obstacles erected to humanitarian access  andthe destruction and looting of holy places and otherreligious  historical and cultural sites are barbarous actsthat are contrary to the principles of Islam. That is whymy country supports the commitment of the EconomicCommunity of West African States  alongside the African Union and the United Nations  to put an end tothose violations  which have gone on for much too long.One should not  however  lose sight of the factthat while some advocate fanaticism and extremism Islamophobia is also taking on alarming proportions.Indeed  the dissemination of the video Innocence ofMuslims has led to waves of indignation and manydemonstrations throughout the world. Several millionbelievers have felt their faith insulted and harmed.However  the protests against the unspeakableinsults to Islam  Muslims and the ProphetMuhammad — peace be upon him — cannot justify theviolence against Western missions in many countries.My country therefore condemns the terrorist attacksthat in Benghazi  Libya  caused the death of theAmerican Ambassador  Chris Stevens  and a numberof his colleagues. I take this opportunity to reiterateto the American people and to the grieving families ofthe victims the most heartfelt condolences of the peopleand the Government of the Comoros.The ongoing existence of many hotbeds of tensionthroughout the world  the violation of fundamentalhuman rights  and the growth of piracy and terrorismall speak to the need for urgent and in-depth reform ofthe Security Council. My country therefore reiteratesits support for the African Union’s position regardingthe need to reform the Council for better representationof the international community and for greatereffectiveness in the settlement and management ofconflicts.A few decades ago  my country resolutelycommitted itself to the path of democracy. It wishesto make its contribution to the promotion of a worldof peace  security  justice and fairness. That is whyI have committed myself  since my accession to thepresidency  to spare no effort in promoting the rule oflaw and good governance in the Union of the Comoros.Above and beyond the setting up of all institutionsprovided for under our Constitution  including theSupreme Court  I have given major priority to thefight against corruption. An anti-corruption law hasalready been promulgated  and a national commissionto combat and prevent corruption has now been set upand made operational. I thank the European Union forits assistance and expertise in this area  which enabledus to develop the document for our national strategy tocombat corruption.This year once again  the global economic andfinancial crisis is at the heart of the Assembly’s generaldebate. That crisis has made evident the urgent needfor a global form of economic governance based on thevalues of responsibility  fairness and solidarity. It hasalso placed before the eyes of the world the urgencyof an in-depth reform of the international financialinstitutions.The repercussions of the crisis are becomingincreasingly palpable  particularly in developingcountries  where the rising price of staples threatenspeace and stability. The crisis has also intensifiedproblems linked to energy  which powers allsocioeconomic development  limiting our ability topromote development through investments.Climate change is another major challenge ourcountries face. We must respond effectively to thatphenomenon  which affects the entire planet  especiallysmall island developing States such as the Union of theComoros.I wish to stress that last April my countryexperienced two weeks of unusually violent torrentialrains that hammered our islands  causing damage thathad disastrous consequences for our population and thenational economy. Ten per cent of the population wasaffected  a high percentage for a country as sparselypopulated as the Comoros. In the name of the wholeComorian people and of my Government  I wouldtherefore like to thank all the partners and friends whooffered us urgent humanitarian aid to help us addressthat dramatic situation.The unprecedented storms led my Governmentto draw up a rapid recovery plan  with the aid andsupport of the international community. It will enableus to better help those affected and to restore destroyedinfrastructure throughout our territory. That plan  whichcontains procedures aimed at restoring the situationwithin a period of six to 12 months  was launched ata round table held on 5 September in Pretoria  withthe fraternal support of our friendly brother country the Republic of South Africa. I would therefore like toappeal to all here to help finance the rapid recoveryplan  whose cost has been estimated at $18 million.That will allow my country to better face the currentsituation and to better prepare for the future.The time has come to relaunch with greaterdetermination a number of pending international issues in particular those regarding measures to mitigate or adapt to climate change and to make operational theCopenhagen Climate Fund. We need to honour thecommitments made to the countries of the South byimplementing  inter alia  the agreements on emissionslinked to deforestation and forest degradation  as wellas a comprehensive agreement on climate change. Wemust also respect the Kyoto Protocol on the reductionof greenhouses gases within the framework of theUnited Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange. Finally  we must do our utmost to achieve theMillennium Development Goals.Faced with all those equally important challenges I urgently call on the most developed countries to applyto the most fragile countries the same mechanisms thathave been implemented to reduce the impact of thecrisis in Europe  in order to prevent more unfortunateconsequences  knowing that our countries depend onthe financial contributions of our people abroad. In thatcontext  my country  which is currently a beneficiaryof the Extended Credit Facility of the InternationalMonetary Fund  hopes by December to have reachedthe completion point of the Heavily Indebted PoorCountries Initiative. In other words  the new worldeconomic order  based on the shared principles offairness  transparency and prosperity that we havewillingly embraced  requires a real and dynamic easingof the crisis that has struck the world. Africa impatientlyawaits the advent of that new order to realize economicand social integration and to embark resolutely on thepath of sustainable development.In conclusion  with respect to my country’sstability  before the General Assembly  I once againappeal to France that a frank and sincere dialoguefinally be set up between our two closely linked nationson the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte. Ithas grown increasingly clear that the fact that Mayotteremains under French administration constitutes a threatto the peace and stability of the three other Comorianislands — the peace that remains the foundation offreedom and prosperity.It is true  and a secret to no one  that that island hasalways served as a rear guard for the detractors of theComoros  those who would prefer not to see our countrymove forward despite its great potential. Moreover  theyear 2012  now drawing to a close  proved particularlydramatic for my people. Men  women and childrenaboard f limsy boats known as kwassa kwassa perishedin the narrow waters that separate the Comorian islandsof Anjouan and Mayotte because of the visas that France imposed on the Comorians of the other islands. Surelythat painful  unacceptable situation  which has lasted fordecades  cannot fail to move this worldwide Assembly whose chosen theme for this year is “Bringing aboutadjustment or settlement of international disputes orsituations by peaceful means”  including the rule of lawat the national and international levels.I therefore hope that France will honour itscommitments as a country that respects internationallaw. Finally  I hope it will respond positively to oururgent call so that together we may find a positiveway for Mayotte to return to its natural home  whichremains the Union of the Comoros. That is how to putan end to the humanitarian tragedy and to guaranteelasting stability for my country. It is through a definitivesolution to this conflict  which has lasted far too long that France can contribute to the ongoing efforts toenhance regional integration  and thus to safeguard theinterests of this region of the Indian Ocean that we hopeto build together in stability and peace."
"40",1626,"CPV",67,2012,"﻿I convey my greetingsto the President of the General Assembly  Mr. VukJeremić  whom I congratulate on his election. I wish himsuccess during his tenure as President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session. I would also liketo convey my greetings to the former President of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  Mr. NassirAbdulaziz Al-Nasser of the State of Qatar  for theexcellent work he accomplished during his tenure.Also allow me to express my appreciation toSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his competentmanagement of the Organization. We reaffirm ourtrust in his leadership during a particularly difficulttime in our history — during one of the worst financialcrises that the world has ever known that has hadrepercussions in the economic  social  political  food energy and environmental sectors  to say nothing of theterrible threats to peace and security emanating fromevery corner of the world.As a small island State  with a shortage ofresources and with only 37 years of independence Cape Verde is proud to be a democratic country thatis based on the rule of law  built with the sufferingand the determination of Cape Verdeans inside andoutside our country. Notwithstanding the fact that my country faces enormous difficulties in ensuring itsown existence and that to overcome them will requireinternational solidarity  I believe that Cape Verde can although modestly  contribute towards finding solutionsto important problems that threaten the troubled worldof our time.Apart from the political stability that hascharacterized us as well as the build-up and consolidationof a democratic system  the Cape Verdean nation thatpreceded the creation of the State can be consideredan example of peaceful coexistence among peopleswho originated from different countries  with differentcreeds integrated into what had already been a mixedsculture. Our nation stands open to the world and to theexchange of values.Cape Verde has opted for a policy for peace  dialogueand understanding in the resolution of conflicts. Theexpression of those values is part of the Cape Verdeanpeople’s way of living and being. Ours is a culture oftolerance that has shaped  in the almost four decadesof its history  the values and principles of the country’spolicies. Besides our modest political contribution to theresolution of conflicts in Southern Africa  for example the end of apartheid in South Africa  the independenceof Namibia and peace in Angola  I would assert that ourbiggest contribution has been our way of life as a peopleand as a culture. Through our way of life  we have beenable to show that tolerance and the sharing of valuescan be part of daily living  even in adverse conditions.Our way of life has allowed successive Cape VerdeanGovernments and heads of State to manage the foreignpolicy of our country in a consistent manner  givingpriority to peace  justice and the peaceful coexistenceof people in the formulation of policy. Accordingly  ourforeign policy is the expression or translation of ourculture and our ideology. That is also what guides meas I strive to broaden Cape Verde’s contribution to ourcontinent and  hopefully  to the world.On 25 September  we celebrated the twenty-fifthanniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of theRepublic of Cape Verde  which is proof of the stabilitywe enjoy in our country. It has allowed numerouspresidential  legislative and municipal elections to takeplace  and changes in power have occurred with thehighest degree of normality. By happy coincidence  thatcritical date for Cape Verde — 25 September — coincideswith the launch of the sixty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly  that exponent of democracyon a global level which is undergoing a process of revitalization. As such  I am very grateful to be able toshare our milestone with General Assembly.The Magna Law stipulates that our domestic legalorder incorporates the precedents and standards ofinternational common law and the law of treaties aslawfully approved and ratified. It is thus clear thatwe attach great importance to institutions like theUnited Nations and the principles that guide them.Nevertheless  we are aware that if those principles which we have embedded in our Constitution  includingthose referring to human rights  do not trickle downinto our day-to-day culture  the Constitution will notbe fulfilled in its entirety. We therefore urge all CapeVerdeans  be they in the country or outside  to furtherinternalize the values of our Constitution  which weconsider a critical step in ensuring its vitality and fullrealization.Despite the serious issues arising in the worldand the vulnerabilities of the Cape Verdean economyand its direct impact on the living conditions of themajority of its people  I must say without false modestythat I am proud of the trajectory that my country hasfollowed since its independence. At independence  ourannual gross domestic product (GDP) was $190 percapita  whereas today it has grown to $3 295 per capitaper annum. Several social indices have mirrored thatgrowth  making it possible for us to achieve some ofthe Millennium Development Goals. In fact  the humandevelopment  economic and financial results registeredin the biennium 2011-2012 received positive reviewsfrom the major international financial institutions.Ours is a service economy — with servicesaccounting for 80 per cent of GDP in 2010 — with a verysmall market and an agricultural sector that is strugglingwith desertification and drought. We therefore cannotignore our great vulnerabilities or rest on our laurelsfor having graduated to a medium-income developedcountry. On the contrary  we cannot lose sight of thefact that our economy is still very dependent  that itcannot employ a significant portion of its potentialworkforce  with all the social consequences that stemfrom that. We are therefore obliged to continue to relyon international solidarity.We of course will continue to use our meagreresources in an efficient and rational manner anddevelop even more effective efforts to combat poverty social exclusion and unemployment  which in 2010reached an overall rate of 21 per cent  and 50 per cent among youth. Constraints with respect to energy  waterand sanitation continue to garner our full attention sothat  as we build key infrastructure  we can create theconditions needed to achieve sustainable growth in oureconomy.We also must take into account the fact that theimpact on small island developing States of climatechange and natural disasters is a sword of Damoclesthreatening our future. It is imperative that all countries acting consistently and with solidarity  implementenvironmental defence programmes  develop the greeneconomy and help build true global resilience.One of the most remarkable characteristics oftoday’s world is the increasing interdependence ofall sectors. We may speak frequently of the economy but that is because it conditions all the rest — theenvironmental  health  security  political and culturalsectors  indeed  nearly all areas of human activity. Itis therefore fundamental for us to constantly monitorall relevant aspects of those complex relationships sothat we can understand the leading trends that havean impact on our process of development  but also sothat we can contribute even modestly to solving theproblems of people and countries across the globe.Although social and political stability are essentialaspects of our society  we cannot ignore the fact thaton our continent  Africa  that has not been a basiccharacteristic for internal and  to some extent  externalreasons.I express my deep concern about the economic andfinancial global crisis that continues to severely punishthe Governments and defenceless populations of theAfrican continent. Those people are already sufferingfrom hunger  the scourge of AIDS  the consequencesof other endemic diseases  the f light of hundreds ofthousands of displaced people and the overwhelmingenvironmental degradation to which the continentis victim. Despite the fact that the continent leastcontributed to that imbalance  it is Africa that mostsuffers from its consequences.Such crises also affect security not only becauseof regional conflicts but also owing to the universaldimension that terrorism has assumed. In that regard  ithas affected a good part of our continent with its linksto trafficking in drugs and persons  maritime piracy religious intolerance and the problems that arise fromthe political  social or military instability prevailingin many of our countries. That is fertile territory for terrorism and its growth. The recent cases of Mali Guinea-Bissau and others  such as the Sudan  Somalia the Democratic Republic of the Congo and somecountries of the Maghreb  well illustrate the situation.The international community has every interest inresolutely focusing on the fight to eradicate such ills.Despite those constraints  it should be acknowledgedthat the new wave of African leaders has been doing agreat deal for the continent’s progress. The internationalcommunity must therefore help such countries to findappropriate solutions to the situations that they face without interfering or acting in the interests of othersrather than of our people.In any case  an organization such as the UnitedNations  which is a depository of values that respectlegality and international law  should never  throughits silence  promote  further or support solutions thatmerely legitimize unconstitutional actions. It is clearthat much remains to be done.In our view  as I have said before  in Africathere has been no lack of mechanisms  declarations recommendations  programmes and projects withassessments and perspectives that disregard thepolitical  institutional  social and cultural elements andsometimes resemble a vicious cycle. There is no realdevelopment because there is no peace. Democracy isnot deeply rooted because it conflicts with cultural andmoral traditions. There is no peace on account of theintolerance and social exclusion that prevent its citizensfrom building a free  fair  democratic and pluralisticsociety. That  at times  exacerbates armed conflicts andother social ills.Africa needs a new train of thought that does notreject the universal values of democracy but  on thecontrary  uses them to enrich its own developmentprocess with a dialectic between modernity andtradition  freedom and the tendency for its ownconditioning  the demands of its economic developmentand the fight against exclusion and social inequality and reality and preconceptions.Africa needs to regain its self-confidence. Africastill needs to see stronger links between the UnitedNations and the African Union for a true developmentpartnership.It is time to take decisions on issues such asglobal trade and climate change on the basis of globalnegotiations that are grounded in fair  equal and ethical rules and that are in step with the countries of theSouth  in general  and of my continent  in particular.That would give legitimacy to other forums  that is  inthe context of the World Trade Organization  the Foodand Agriculture Organization of the United Nationsand United Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange.In short  we call for decisions on specific measuresthat will result in effective decision-taking within thisOrganization on development areas  such as cancellingthe foreign debt of developing countries  in particularsmall island developing States. We are certain that thatwould be a stimulus for all such countries to achieve theMillennium Development Goals in 2015.In 2009  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon affirmedat Princeton University that the United Nations needed“a new vision  a new paradigm  a new multilateralism”.That would help to ensure global economic and financialstability  combat poverty  re-establish peace  respond tothe effects of climate change  improve global health fight against terrorism and ensure disarmament andnon-proliferation.At the closing ceremony of the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)in June  it was stated that Rio+20 had shown thatmultilateralism was an irreplaceable instrument for theglobal expression of democracy. We reaffirm that thatis the legitimate path for finding solutions to problemsthat affect all humankind. I support and welcome suchstatements.In conclusion  the world has developed immenselysince the end of the Cold War. The current multilateralsystem must align itself with the new challenges. Forthe United Nations to continue to be an efficient andvital instrument for the international community in thisnew era of multilateral relations  it will have to openup  innovate  listen to other voices and accept the newpolitical  economic and social realities that have beencreated and imposed by the globalization process.The reform of the Security Council — an organ thatis responding less and less every day to the challengesof the contemporary world — is a goal that has longbeen pursued  without success. Cape Verde supportsthe position of the African Union  which recommendsthat the Council be reformed so as to correct theunjust situation with respect to the African continent.At present Africa does not have the right to even onepermanent seat on the Council  even though it meets allthe requirements.I conclude  Mr. President  with the conviction thatAfrica can also provide a valuable contribution to thedevelopment of a better world  one without war  wherepeace is not just a theoretical concept; a world withmore freedom  justice and security — in other words a world with more fraternity and prosperity  in whichthe well-being of its citizens is effectively provided for."
"41",1672,"CRI",67,2012,"﻿I willbegin my remarks by congratulating Mr. Vuk Jeremić President of the General Assembly  on his election.My country offers its support to him as he fulfils hisimportant role. Success in his work will also representsuccess for the United Nations and therefore for all thepeoples of the world. We endorse his commitment tothe “adjustment or settlement of international disputesor situations by peaceful means”  and we supportthe road map that he has outlined for the exercise ofhis duties. We welcome the outstanding work of hispredecessor  Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  andemphasize in particular his commitment to mediation.We reiterate our support for the five imperatives of theagenda presented in January by Secretary-General BanKi-moon for his second term.Barely a year ago  we gathered in this Hall encouraged by an echo of hope. It came from NorthAfrica and the Middle East and was broadcast bya wide cross-section of voices gathered around oneuniversal value — freedom. That hopeful clamour canstill be heard in the complex transitions to democracy propelled by the will of the people. Tunisia  Egypt andLibya are the best examples. We convey our admirationand respect to those countries and their people.Today  however  the sounds most stronglyresonating in this Hall are the desperate cries ofwomen and children in Syria. To them  we convey oursolidarity. At the same time  we are distressed at the furyunleashed by those who would manipulate intoleranceand extremism. We are worried by the resurgence ofterritorial conflicts  the warmongering rhetoric of someStates and the indifference of autocratic regimes. Weface the ongoing challenges of relentless terrorism  drugtrafficking and organized crime. Meanwhile  alarmingsigns of environmental destruction are cropping upwith increasing urgency. These challenges have madeus aware of the many threats we face  and they reiteratethe seminal importance of this Organization and of themultilateral system as a whole.The peaceful settlement of disputes is imperativefor peaceful coexistence among individuals  peoplesand countries. For Costa Rica  it is also a part of dailylife and a central goal of our foreign policy. It is a valuethat is deeply rooted in our respect for diversity and ourcommitment to tolerance and the rule of law. To prevent conflicts or to strip them of their violent consequences we must promote preventive diplomacy and mediation.We enjoy the best results when these processes generatelegally binding agreements and decisions within theframework of the rule of law. A clear link thereforeexists between the theme proposed by PresidentJeremić for this session and the commitment by theUnited Nations and its Member States to the rule of law.Costa Rica believes in the power of mediation  and isthus part of a group of countries dedicated to promotingit within the United Nations. In July 2011  thanks toan initiative by the group that was enthusiasticallysupported by many other States  the Assembly adoptedby consensus its first resolution aimed at strengtheningthe role of mediation (resolution 66/291). A few daysago  the Assembly gave its support to a follow-up text.Moreover  Costa Rica is proud to have headed upone of the most successful mediation processes in thehistory of our hemisphere. In the mid-1980s  variousarmed conflicts bloodied our brotherly countries inCentral America. There seemed to be no way out of theconflict. However  thanks to the tenacious leadershipof former Costa Rican President Óscar Arias Sánchez on 7 August 1987  the region’s Heads of State signedthe Central American peace plan in Guatemala. Thatleadership earned our compatriot and President theNobel Peace Prize.The success of the peace plan stemmed fromthe double commitment of the signatories: to ceasehostilities  and to address their root causes. Thanksto this comprehensive approach  the vision of the fivePresidents of the Central American isthmus and effectiveinternational support  Central America silenced itsguns and achieved peace. It was a peace founded ondemocracy and the commitment to development andjustice.Unfortunately  the region today faces anotherchallenge of similar proportions. I refer to the onslaughtof drug trafficking and international organized crime.We are a transit route between the production centres ofthe south and the large consumption centre of the north.This situation has made us the victims of a problemover which we exercise minimal control. Our resourcesto deal with the problem are even more meagre.Central Americans countries have agreed on regionalstrategies to work jointly on prevention  interdictionand suppression  but our capacity for action is limitedand has prevented any rapid implementation. Despite all this  Costa Rica has rejected thedangerous notion of a “war” to confront these scourges.Rather  we are working to expand opportunities foryoung people  promote preventative measures  improvepolice capacity  strengthen the effectiveness of thejudiciary and assist addicts. Fortunately  we are seeingresults in terms of civil security. For example  ourmurder rate  which is the lowest in Central America has fallen from 11.7 per 100 000 people in May 2011 to 9 per 100 000 in May of this year. Reports of crimein general decreased by 12 per cent from 2010 to 2011.However  the cartels’ onslaught is so intense  thelogic of the drug market so disastrous  and the globalstrategies to control it so disorganized and insufficientthat the outlook is grim.Costa Rica therefore believes a more active linkmust be developed between the United Nations andthe design and implementation of balanced regionalstrategies to deal with the drug trade. Moreover  drugtraffickers must be viewed as a real threat to peace andinternational security.Costa Rica is a small  democratic  unarmedand civilian country. The multilateral system andinternational law are our only means of defence. For thisreason  we have recognized the compulsory jurisdictionof the International Court of Justice since 1973.At the end of 2010  we appealed to the Court after theGovernment of Nicaragua illegally deployed militaryforces and civilian personnel in part of our nationalterritory. In March of the following year  the Courtpronounced a series of provisional measures. Amongthem  the Court ordered Nicaragua to remove its forcesfrom the disputed area and granted environmentalcustody to Costa Rica. However  the Governmentof Nicaragua has consistently f louted the order andcontinued to send personnel to that area. It has done soin open defiance of the Court  to the detriment of ourbilateral relations  and in violation of paragraph 31 ofthe Declaration on the Rule of Law at the National andInternational Levels that was adopted a week ago by theAssembly (resolution 67/1). We do not want this case tomar relations or  even worse  the profound human tiesbetween our countries. But Nicaragua has still failed tofulfil the provisional measures of the Court. We regretthis  we condemn this and we denounce this once againin this Hall.Despite its clear adherence to the rule of law andcommitment to mediation  the international communityhas been unable to adopt a key instrument for avoiding conflicts or  at least  limiting their destructive effects.At the end of July 2012  we failed to reach a consensuson a universal  robust and binding arms trade treaty.It was a sombre moment for peace and human dignity.Costa Rica  one of the co-authors of that initiative  willnot cease in its efforts to promote the kind of instrumentthat the millions of victims of conventional weaponsare demanding from the silence of their tombs.The rule of law should also be the foundation ofglobal governance. If this governance is to be robust inany area  it should be in the area of the environment.The United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment brought about important progress in thisrespect. However  the biggest tasks and commitmentsremain pending. While the global temperaturecontinues to rise  droughts and f loods continue toexact a toll in lives  destroy infrastructure and displacepopulations. The environmental threat is about toassume exponential dimensions. We cannot wait anylonger to act.Costa Rica adopted sustainability as a developmentmodel several years ago and has embraced its nationalresponsibilities on the matter. We have increasedour forest coverage. We generate 90 per cent of ourenergy from renewable sources. Over 25 per cent ofour territory is made up of national parks  and we haveadopted the goal of becoming a carbon-neutral countryby 2021. But these and many other initiatives by smallcountries will be useless without the commitment ofthe biggest carbon emitters and without internationalcooperation for mitigation and adaption in the mostvulnerable countries.The formulation of the post-2015 sustainabledevelopment goals gives us an excellent opportunityto move forward. We expect their formulation to be amultisectoral and participatory process that includesrule of law and good governance components.Middle-income countries still need the supportof the international community to consolidate ourimprovements in economic and human development.Let us not forget that our achievements are due  inpart  to the proper use of cooperation mechanisms.To eliminate these because they have been well usedwould be a disastrous mistake. That is why CostaRica  together with other middle-income countries will continue to participate actively in improving themethodology guiding the graduation processes in thecontext of the United Nations Development Programme.As we mentioned  we must consider  in the models for these processes  not only income  but also other criteriathat better reflect the extent of our challenges andthat foster cooperation strategies that provide greatersupport to our development efforts.The main leadership role in global governanceshould be played by the United Nations  on the basisof international law. Only legitimate multilateralaction can promote and protect the most importantglobal public goods. We cannot discount the externalchallenges to the leadership of this Organization. But itis more important that we recognize the internal need tocommit ourselves to making it more vigorous  effective efficient  inclusive and representative. Member Statesshould understand that the best way to promote ournational interests through the United Nations is toreform it in order to improve its performance.Costa Rica aligns itself with the concept of a globalSecretariat that was formulated by the Secretary-General  and is ready to give its constructive support totranslating this idea into reality. We are also committedto the comprehensive reform of the Security Counciland believe that improving its working methods shouldbe an ongoing process.We emphasize the value of the responsibilityto protect as a critical operative principle of theinternational community.The fight against impunity is part of the fight forhuman dignity. This is why we ardently support theInternational Criminal Court  one of the most relevantachievements of the multilateral system since thecreation of the United Nations.The upheavals in the world today demand ourattention and fill us with dismay  but hope alsoflourishes alongside them. What better example isthere  in this regard  than the spirit recently embodiedby the Olympic and Paralympic athletes in London  whocompeted with clear rules  fair play  mutual respect anda feeling of achievement? If the conflicts of our worldmimicked that experience  the course of humanitywould be different. Maybe such a fundamental changeis not possible  but we should at least continue to workfor a world that is more just  peaceful  free  sustainable and respectful of human dignity and the rule of law.Costa Rica reiterates its profound commitment to thistask."
"42",1741,"CUB",67,2012,"﻿Never before have Latin America and the Caribbeanexpressed themselves with such strength and unity asthey did at the Summit of the Americas  held last Aprilin Cartagena de Indias  Colombia. Once again  Cubawas excluded at the insistence of the United States.Argentine sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands  whichour country fervently supports  and the lifting of theblockade against Cuba were the focus of a declarationthat demonstrated that the American homelandenvisaged by Bolivar — our America as envisaged by Marti — has entered a new era: the century of itsultimate independence.Some months prior  the Community of LatinAmerican and Caribbean States (CELAC) held itsinaugural summit meeting in Caracas. No otherinstitutional entity in our hemisphere in the course ofthe last century is of such major importance  wrotethe leader of the Cuban Revolution  Fidel Castro Ruz about CELAC. We know that CELAC still has not yetreached its full development  so that our peoples cango forward in ranks as compact as the veins of silverin the roots of the Andes. But Latin America and theCaribbean have definitively changed  and they areprepared to make a greater contribution to the worldorder. However  the threats  dangers and obstaclesshould not be underestimated.The policy of the United States with regard toour region  under both Democratic and RepublicanAdministrations  has been essentially the same. Thepromises made by the current President in 2009 havegone unfulfilled. Tireless efforts have been made tocontrol our wealth  to impose their models  culture andideas  and to interfere in our internal affairs. Despitetalk of “intelligent power” and the use of fabulous newtechnology  the focus remains on security and militarydeployment  rather than on democratic and mutuallybeneficial relations between equal  sovereign States.In the circumstances of a global economic crisis the depletion of resources and the shifting balances inthe world  NATO continues to perceive our region asa mere periphery of the Euro-Atlantic area  in whichit might intervene to protect its interests  howeverillegitimate.The upcoming elections in the sister nation of theBolivarian Republic of Venezuela will be decisivefor the shared destiny of our region. We would liketo express to the Venezuelan people and their leader President Chávez Frías  our full solidarity in the face ofthe looming attempts at destabilization. The governingpowers in the United States would be making a veryserious mistake of untold consequences if they wereto attempt to reverse by force the social achievementsattained by our peoples.Cuba has continuously contributed to peace inColombia  with discretion and modesty. We fullysupported the confidential exploratory talks heldthroughout this year in Havana  and we will continue todo so as a guarantor and host of the upcoming process of dialogue between the Colombian Government andthe Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.Our America will remain mutilated as long asPuerto Rico  a Latin American and Caribbean nation lacks its independence — a cause that we fully support.Today’s world is in no way similar to the onethat was envisioned by those who drafted the UnitedNations Charter  over the ashes left by the SecondWorld War  when they expressed their determination tosave our generations from the scourge of war; protectthe fundamental rights of human beings and equalityamong all nations  large and small; and promote justice dignity and social progress. Today  the overthrow ofGovernments through the use of force and violence isbeing blatantly encouraged. Regime change is beingimposed from Washington and other NATO capitals and wars of conquest are being waged for the controlof natural resources and areas of strategic importance.The Governments of the United States and someEuropean countries have decided to overthrow theSyrian Government. To that end  they have armed financed and trained opposition groups  and turned tothe use of mercenaries.Owing mainly to the firm opposition of Russiaand China  it has not been possible to manipulate theSecurity Council into imposing the interventionistformula that has been applied in the context of recentbellicose ventures.Cuba reaffirms the right of the Syrian people tothe full exercise of its right to self-determination andsovereignty without interference or foreign interventionof any sort. The violence  massacres and terrorist acts which have taken a high toll in innocent lives  mustcease. The trafficking in arms and money f lows thathelps fund insurgent groups  as well as the shamefulmanipulation of reality by the media  must also cometo an end.It is the duty of the General Assembly to make use ofthe means at its disposal to promote a peaceful solutionto the current situation  which is destroying that Arabcountry  and prevent foreign military aggression  whichwould have serious consequences for the entire MiddleEast region.The General Assembly should act with resolve andrecognize the Palestinian State as a full Member of theUnited Nations  within the borders established priorto 1967 and with East Jerusalem as its capital; and it should do so now  with or without the consent of theSecurity Council; with or without a United States veto;and with or without new peace negotiations.The global economic crisis  which is having aparticularly strong impact on Europe  reflects theinability of Governments and institutions to solve aproblem that requires a rethinking of the basic tenets ofthe current system of international economic relations which serves only to pillage underdeveloped countries.The harsh consequences of the crisis in thedeveloped world and the failed policies adopted so farin an attempt to stop it continue to be borne by workers the increasing number of unemployed  immigrants andthe poor  whose protest movements are being brutallyrepressed. The predicted increase in food prices as aresult of the drought that is affecting much of NorthAmerica threatens to exacerbate global food insecurity.Environmental destruction is also worsening.The loss of biodiversity and of the natural balanceof ecosystems is accelerating; and the growingirrationality of production and consumption patterns the marginalization of more than half of the world’spopulation and the lack of comprehensive measures tohalt climate change pose an ever-increasing risk to thephysical integrity of entire nations  particularly smallisland States.In the face of those colossal challenges  we wonderif anything could ever justify the fact that  20 yearsafter the end of the so-called Cold War  military budgetshave almost doubled  reaching the astronomical figureof $1.74 trillion. As President Raúl Castro Ruz asked against what enemies will those weapons be used? Willthey be used to eliminate the masses of poor peoplewho can no longer tolerate their poverty  or to halt theunstoppable migrations of survivors?Under these circumstances  it is urgent to save theUnited Nations and subject it to deep-seated reform  soas to put it at the service of all  equally sovereign Statesand free it from the arbitrariness and double standardsof a handful of industrialized and powerful countries.International law and the purposes and principles ofthe Charter of the United Nations should be resolutelyenforced; the key role of the General Assembly shouldbe restored; and a democratic  transparent and trulyrepresentative Security Council should be relaunched.The Summit of Non-Aligned Countries wassuccessfully held in Tehran and reaffirmed the Movement’s positions in defence of peace  independenceand the sovereign equality of States; justice; the rightto development; sovereignty over natural resources;general and complete disarmament  particularlynuclear disarmament; and the right to the peaceful useof nuclear energy. We have pledged our full support tothe chairmanship of the Movement.On July 31  the State Department of the UnitedStates included Cuba once again on its unilateral arbitrary list of States that sponsor internationalterrorism. The true motive behind the inclusion of Cubaon that spurious list is to fabricate pretexts to increasethe persecution of Cuba with respect to its financialtransactions and justify the policy of blockade  whichhas caused immense human and economic harmtotalling $1 trillion  based on the current value of gold.The United States does not have the slightest moralor political authority to judge Cuba.It is well knownthat the United States Government has resorted to Stateterrorism as a weapon in its policy against Cuba  whichhas caused the deaths of 3 478 of our compatriots andinjured another 2 099. It is also harbouring dozensof terrorists  some of whom live in freedom in thatcountry  and continues with the prolonged  inhumaneimprisonment and cruel and arbitrary retention on itsterritory of the five Cuban anti-terrorists.Cuba strongly rejects the use of so sensitive an issueas terrorism to pursue political goals and calls for theUnited States Government to stop lying and put an endto this shameful exercise  which is an outrage againstthe Cuban people  the North American victims and theinternational community and discredits the cause of thestruggle against terrorism.We reiterate to the United States  on the eve ofthe elections in that country  our irrevocable yearningfor peace and our interest in moving towards thenormalization of bilateral relations through dialogue on an equal footing and with absolute respect for ourindependence.With absolute certainty  our people  come whatmay  with all and for the well-being of all  will continueon the path they have already chosen until they haveachieved full justice."
"43",1787,"CYP",67,2012,"﻿Allow me to congratulateyou  Sir  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session and to express mydelegation’s support to you in discharging your dutiesI would also like to express my sincere appreciation toyour predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Nassir AbdulazizAl-Nasser  for the excellent way in which he conductedthe work of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixthsession. I would also like to take this opportunity tothank the Secretary-General for his report on the workof the Organization (A/67/1).Owing to its geographical location and historicalties with its neighbouring countries  Cyprus has beenclosely following and has taken particular interest inthe developments in the wider Middle East and NorthAfrica over the past 18 months. The sovereignty ofpeoples was and remains a fundamental principle ofthe Organization and the functioning of States. As theinternational community  we should  in our opinion address events there through that prism  respecting theright of each people to determine its own future.During that period  we witnessed transformationsin Tunisia  Egypt  Yemen and Libya. We stand by thosepeoples through that transition and encourage theirefforts on the difficult road to consolidating democracyand the rule of law. We look forward to new structures that are inclusive of women and minorities and thatcreate the conditions for the further participation ofcitizens in political life.It is with great sadness  however  that we arewitnessing the loss of human lives in the region.Increased violence in Syria continues  and the potentialspillover effects to neighbouring countries are a greatcause for concern. We strongly condemn the violenceand the massacres of innocent civilians in Syria andcall for their immediate cessation. There is undoubtedlya humanitarian crisis there that needs urgent attention.Recent consultations in the Security Council haveemphasized that. The Republic of Cyprus stands readyto contribute to international efforts to manage thecrisis  in particular as the fire is raging just outsideour door.We remain committed to respecting the sovereigntyand territorial integrity of Syria and emphasize thatthe continued violence and its recent intensificationunderscore the need for a political solution. In thatrespect  I join the rest of the international communityin expressing our unequivocal support for the newlyappointed Joint Special Representative for Syria Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  with the sincere hope that hewill help bring the conflict to an end.Against that background of significant changes inthe region  the Middle East peace process continues tobe at an impasse. It is imperative to resume negotiationsthat can eventually lead to the implementation ofthe relevant Security Council resolutions and theestablishment of a free and independent PalestinianState on the basis of the pre-1967 borders. At the sametime  the solution must address Israel’s legitimatesecurity concerns.No viable solutions can be achieved in the absenceof political dialogue. As you  Mr. President  wiselyproposed upon your election  the “Bringing aboutadjustment or settlement of international disputesor situations by peaceful means” is the overarchingpurpose of the United Nations. It nevertheless alsoremains a timeless challenge. I can personally attest tothat.Cyprus still faces the consequences of foreignintervention  namely  the Turkish invasion andoccupation. More than one third of my country’sterritory is still under the military occupation of Turkey a fellow Member State of the Organization.Our participation at the United Nations requiresengagement in the struggle for the protection ofhuman rights. We share a commitment to the rule oflaw and are proponents of peace and security in theworld. Yesterday  we supported the Declaration of theHigh-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the Nationaland International Levels (resolution 67/1)  affirmingthe sovereign equality of States and respect for theirterritorial integrity.Yet Turkey  after invading Cyprus in 1974  hascontinued to occupy the northern part of the island forthe past 38 years  maintaining a strong military forceand continuing the mass transfer of settlers from Turkey pursuant to its policy for the demographic alteration ofmy country’s population. Turkey continues to violatethe human rights and fundamental freedoms of tensof thousands of displaced persons  including usurpingtheir property and violating the rights of the besiegedand those who have lost their loved ones and continueto search for them.Since the assumption of my duties as President ofthe Republic of Cyprus in 2008  I took the initiative in collaboration with the Secretary-General  Mr. BanKi-moon  to end the stalemate and to start a new processof direct negotiations with the then leader of the TurkishCypriot community  Mr. Mehmet Ali Talat  on the basisof a bicommunal and bizonal federation with a singlysovereignty  citizenship and international personality.We came to an agreement on those conditions withMr. Talat. The process began under the auspices of theSecretary-General and is being facilitated by his goodoffices mission on the island.I believe that the Turkish Cypriot side  underMr. Talat  shared the vision of a solution  for thebenefit of all Cypriots  to terminate the occupation andestablish the conditions for lasting peace and securityon the island. Despite the difficulties posed by theoccupation  at the time we achieved convergence in anumber of important areas.Since 2010  however  despite committing itself inthe presence of the Secretary-General to continuing thetalks from where they had left off  the current TurkishCypriot leadership  under Mr. Eroğlu  has broken thatjoint commitment and has retracted from the agreementworked out with the previous Turkish Cypriot leader.In addition  since last March  the Turkish Cypriotleadership  with Turkey’s support  has abandonedthe negotiations in response to the assumption of the presidency of the Council of the European Union by theRepublic of Cyprus.For our part  we remain committed to SecurityCouncil resolution 2026 (2011)  which provides thatan accord on the internal aspects of the Cyprus issuemust be achieved before convening an internationalconference on the international aspects of the matterwith the consent of the two communities.We remain unchanged in our commitment toreturning to the negotiating table; to continuing thenegotiations in good faith; and to respecting in practice not just in words  the agreed basis for the solution ofa bicommunal and bizonal federation with a singlesovereignty  citizenship and international personalityand political equality  as defined in the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions.We are grateful to the Secretary-General  whohas willingly devoted his time and effort and investedin that process  despite the many challenges that thisinternational Organization faces.I call on the Turkish Cypriot leadership to returnto the table and to share our vision for a united andpeaceful Cyprus. A solution to the Cyprus problemrequires the support of all concerned parties. Turkey’spositive contribution and practical support for effortson the part of the two communities to take the processforward is crucial. Yet Turkey has instead beenpursuing “gunboat diplomacy”  with frequent displaysof military strength around Cyprus.Turkey’s alarming behaviour has been escalatingsince September 2011  when Cyprus undertookexploration activities in its exclusive economiczone  based on its rights under international law andparticularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on theLaw of the Sea.Turkey has neither signed the aforementionedConvention nor abided by relevant customaryinternational law. On the contrary  Turkey has carriedout unilateral actions with respect to sea areas that aresituated patently beyond any reasonable geographicalor legal limit of its continental shelf and potentialexclusive economic zone and that clearly fall within theexclusive economic zone and continental shelf of theRepublic of Cyprus.Turkey is behaving as if the Republic of Cyprusdid not exist on the map of the region. Such behavior by a country seeking to become a member State of the European Union and supposedly seeking to maintainzero problems with its neighbours  cannot and shouldnot be tolerated by the international community. I callon Turkey  before this Assembly  to cease its provocativebehaviour. I repeat at the same time that in a reunifiedCyprus the natural resources  including hydrocarbons will be the common wealth of all Cypriots — bothGreek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots alike.The deadline set by the international communityfor the achievement of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals in 2015 is nearing. We have seen much progressthus far but much more remains to be done  as povertyand hunger persist. In looking beyond 2015  we needto recommit ourselves to a solid new agenda aimedat poverty eradication  inclusive economic and socialdevelopment  environmental sustainability and peaceand security for all."
"44",1811,"CZE",67,2012,"﻿I would like to congratulatePresident Jeremić on his election to serve as the highestrepresentative of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. In recent decades  his country has gonethrough a difficult period. I am sure his experience asthe Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs who saw theconsequences of one kind of peacefully negotiatedsettlement and armed international intervention willbenefit this year’s General Assembly and contributeto making our deliberations less formal and morepractical.Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan)  Vice-President  took theChair.The Czech Republic firmly believes thatinternational disputes and conflicts can and shouldbe settled by peaceful  not military  means. We havebeen systematically demonstrating that for a long time.When the division of Czechoslovakia was taking place20 years ago and the situation was emotionally strainedand painful for us  it never crossed the mind of any of ourpoliticians that the problem should be addressed by anyother than peaceful means. The difficult negotiations undertaken solely by our own representatives  resultedin achieving a settlement that political representativesand  especially  citizens in both the newly establishedStates considered then and still consider to be a positivesolution.Our experience affirms that it is the domesticpoliticians  in particular  who should be the driving force of negotiations rather than international teamsor former political figures from abroad. The mandateof the negotiating parties must be rooted as firmly aspossible in domestic conditions and local traditions.External observers must not succumb to the temptationof imposing the settlement that they themselves regardas the right one  but which is not in line with long-term natural developments in the country or regionin question. For a number of reasons  those inevitablepreconditions are often not met in attempts at peacefulconflict resolution. It is therefore no wonder that weoften see the opposite results to those that the architectsof a particular settlement would have wished.We must ask ourselves what successful peacetalks and international missions are. Do externalinterventions improve the situation or do they make itworse by hindering spontaneous processes that couldreintroduce stability in the region  possibly with smallersacrifices compared to the price paid through externalintervention? For instance  are the developments inIraq  the unresolved Cyprus issue or the independenceof Kosovo a success of the United Nations or not?Let me say a few words about Syria. As a countrythat has recent historical experience of a transitionto democracy  the Czech Republic wishes Syria to beable to take the same path. However  we do not seea feasible solution now. Our immediate effort mustfocus on helping the people affected by the currenttragic situation in the country. The Czech Republic hasalready sent humanitarian aid to Syria and to Syriansf leeing into neighbouring countries. We have set up amedical evacuation programme for wounded Syrianrefugees. Czech experts took part in the United Nationsobserver mission in Syria. Our Embassy in Damascusis also providing assistance. Two months ago  the CzechRepublic accepted the request of the United States forrepresentation in diplomatic and consular matters inSyria.There is no doubt that we must look at the situationin Syria from a broader and longer-term perspective.We should know what needs to be done tomorrow andthe day after tomorrow. I am afraid that that is the mostimportant lesson learned from other similar issues such as the recent military intervention in Libya.Allow me to affirm that the Czech Republic willcontinue to be an active United Nations Member. TheCzech Republic observes and applies the principlesand standards of international law in its foreign policy and promotes their international application. Wewill support United Nations activities in the fieldsof disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclearweapons. Those issues are among our security policypriorities. The Czech Republic will continue to takepart in United Nations peacekeeping operations  aswell as in humanitarian and development programmes.It also supports efforts to reform the United Nations including the Security Council  which in 2005 began towork towards responding to our changed internationalenvironment and promoting a more balancedrepresentation of individual regions and States."
"45",1873,"DEU",67,2012,"﻿Freedom dignity  self-determination and the hope of a betterlife were the driving forces behind the movement forchange in the Arab world.As Germans  we know from our own bitterexperience that freedom is not a gift. It has to be wonand constantly defended. Freedom is more than justfreedom of thought. It is freedom to express one’s ownopinion and to voice public criticism. For that reasonalone  freedom is not always comfortable. The firstarticle of the Basic Law  Germany’s Constitution states that human dignity shall be inviolable. Thatapplies to every single individual  regardless of theirorigin  culture  creed or sex. As Germans  we haveexperienced what it is to lack freedom in the course ofour own history. We will always stand by those who wherever they are in the world  call for freedom ofopinion  religion  the press and artistic freedom.Freedom has a daughter; it is tolerance. Andfreedom has a son; it is respect  respect for other people respect for what is important to others  respect for whatis sacred to others. Freedom therefore does not meanfreedom from responsibility. Freedom always meansfreedom to shoulder responsibility.We understand the many devout people who feelwounded by the recent shameful anti-Islam video.However  legitimate criticism and sincere indignationcannot be used to justify acts of violence or destruction.Some would have us believe that the burning of embassybuildings are proof of a clash of civilizations. We mustnot allow ourselves to be deluded by such arguments.The vast majority of people oppose violence. Thepeople who have taken to the streets  as well as theirpolitical representatives gathered here in New Yorkthis week  have expressed that forcefully. It is not aclash of civilizations. It is a clash within societies andcivilizations. It is also a struggle for the soul of themovement for change in the Arab world.It is a struggle between open and closed minds between moderates and radicals  between understandingand hate. It is a clash between those seeking peace andthose prepared to resort to violence. The extremistswant to prevent the emergence of freedom by incitingviolence. They must not be allowed to succeed.Germany has taken a stand in that struggle. We willcontinue to expand our support for people in the Arabworld. We are not going to turn our backs on them  butwe will be open to them. Our values and our interestscompel us to take the side of those around the world whoare fighting peacefully for freedom  dignity and self-determination. Education and work  investment andgrowth — our offer of a transformational partnershipstill stands.I will never forget the Syrian father who held outhis emaciated son to me during my visit to the Zaatarirefugee camp in Jordan. Such suffering renders usspeechless  but it also impels us to act. To this veryday  the Security Council has failed to live up to itsresponsibility for the people in Syria. I express thatcriticism with great sadness. The deadlock in theSecurity Council must not continue. Every day  theviolence perpetrated by the Bashar Al-Assad regimeis escalating. The risk of a conf lagration engulfing theentire region is growing. Together with our partners andthe United Nations  we are helping the many refugeesin Syria itself and in neighbouring countries.All Syrians who want their country to have ademocratic and pluralistic future based on the ruleof law must work together. We support the efforts ofMr. Lakhdar Brahimi  Joint Special Representative ofthe United Nations and the League of Arab States  tofind a political approach. Despite the escalating violenceand despite the deadlock in the Security Council  wemust not stop working on a political solution.During the past 20 months  the Arab Leaguehas demonstrated ever more clearly its adherenceto the values enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations. We welcome that and we want to build onit. At Germany’s initiative  during the last week inSeptember  the Security Council welcomed intensifyingcooperation between the United Nations and theLeague of Arab States (see S/PRST/2012/20). That isan acknowledgement of the Arab League’s constructiveand positive role.We also pay tribute to the efforts to gain freedom inother parts of the world. As a result of the remarkableopening-up process under way in Myanmar  the countryis emerging from isolation and gradually leavingrepression behind.We criticize and strongly condemn the ongoingrepression in our own neighbourhood  in Belarus.In many other Asian and African countries  whichhave struck out in a new direction  we are supportingpolitical transformation by providing assistance foreconomic and social development. That is in thecommon interest of the international community. Forthere is one thing that becomes ever more apparent  andthat is that without development  there can be no securityand without security there can be no development. Thatapplies to our engagement in Afghanistan  which wewill continue after the withdrawal of combat troops in2014. It also applies to the efforts to bring stability toSomalia and Yemen  to the Great Lakes region and tothe countries of the Sahel.We are very concerned by the still-unresolveddispute about Iran’s nuclear programme. Iran has stillnot produced evidence of the exclusively peacefulnature of its nuclear programme. It has also failed todate to provide the transparency that the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency has long demanded. So far  thetalks during the last few months have not made enoughprogress towards reaching a solution. The EuropeanUnion’s three plus three group has put forwardproposals for a substantive negotiation process. We stillawait a serious response from Iran. We want a politicaland diplomatic solution. Time is short. Israel’s securityis at stake. Indeed  stability in the entire region is atstake. However  that is also about averting the risk ofa nuclear arms race with unforeseeable consequencesfor international security. I call on Iran to stop playingfor time. The situation is serious indeed  and time isrunning out. We want a political solution  and we areputting all our efforts into achieving that goal.Those challenges must not lead us to lose sight ofthe necessity of a negotiated peace settlement betweenIsrael and the Palestinians. There is a danger that thegoal of a two-State solution  the only solution that canreconcile the legitimate interests of the two sides  willslip away. The two sides must build new trust. At thesame time  they must refrain from doing anything thatmight jeopardize a two-State solution.Germany’s foreign policy is a policy for peace.Germany’s foreign policy is anchored in Europe. Manyhave been wondering whether Europe can successfullymanage its sovereign debt crisis and whether it willcontinue to play a leading role in the world. The answeris an emphatic yes. Europe has a great responsibility inthe world. And Germany is aware of its responsibilityfor Europe. The way out of the debt crisis is difficult. Itrequires spending discipline  solidarity and growth. Wewill continue down that road. Europe is growing closertogether. Europe is consolidating. Europe will emergefrom the crisis stronger than ever before. Europe willremain a force to be reckoned with as the world’s largestdonor of development assistance  as an inspiration forpeaceful regional cooperation  as a pioneer in climateaction and disarmament  as a champion of rules-basedglobalization and as a driving force for United Nationsreform.My country’s peaceful unification more than 20years ago also signified the reunification of Europe.Since then  the world has changed dramatically. Today we find ourselves on the threshold of a multipolarworld. The world with its interdependencies needs acooperative order. It needs strong and representativeinstitutions. We will weaken the Security Council ifwe fail to adapt it to today’s world. Together with ourpartners in the G-4 group  India  Brazil and Japan Germany is prepared to assume greater responsibility.It cannot be that Latin America and Africa haveno permanent seats on the Security Council or thatdynamic Asia has only one. That does not reflect the realities of today’s world  and it definitely does notreflect the realities of tomorrow.The challenges are too great for us to simplyaccept the status quo. The world is not only growingtogether; the pace of change is increasing. We areliving in an age of breathtaking change. That changebrings with it risks and new dangers  as well as newuncertainties. Above all  however  that change bringswith it great opportunities  especially for young people.In this changing world we need a clear compass  andour compass is freedom. The yearning for freedom isrooted in people’s hearts all over the world. They areour partners in building a better future."
"46",1905,"DJI",67,2012,"﻿I wouldlike to begin by extending my warmest congratulationsto the President on his election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.I have no doubt that his skills and long experiencein international matters are the best guarantee of thesuccess for our work during this session. I also wishto express my strong gratitude to his predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  for hisexcellent guidance of our work and for the efficiencyhe showed during difficult moments throughout thesixty-sixth session. I wish him every success in his newresponsibilities.The global economic and financial context remainsmore troubling than ever. The successive and increasingeconomic and financial crises that began in 2008 affectus all. Both developed and developing countries facean uncertain environment  with economies slowed ifnot in recession  sluggish growth  crushing debts anddeficits that threaten certain States with bankruptcy  aswell as growing unemployment rates. In such a context developing nations  in particular the least advanced  areseverely impacted economically as well as socially. Thenegative consequences for achieving the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) have been enormous. Inmany African countries  reaching those Goals by 2015is jeopardized despite the fact that they have spared noeffort to step up implementation before the deadline.It is in times of difficulty that we must showresponsibility and solidarity by honouring our respectivecommitments. It is therefore important that the fate ofthe least advanced African countries be examined withparticular attention with a view to helping them lightentheir burden  improve their productive capabilities andfacilitate access for their products to world marketsunder more favourable conditions. My Government callsfor the comprehensive implementation of the IstanbulProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countriesfor the Decade 2011-2020 (A/CONF.219/3/Rev.1).The current financial and economic crises havemultidimensional consequences in Africa; any effortto resolve them must take into account Africa’sspecific needs and must ensure that commitmentsmade at international meetings are implemented. Itake this opportunity to welcome the establishment of a United Nations monitoring mechanism to review thecommitments made related to Africa’s development.The United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment (Rio+20) in June was an opportunityfor all Governments to renew their commitment to asustainable development that embraces the economic social and environmental spheres. It is important that ourshared political will be swiftly transformed into actionand that the work we put into the Rio commitments for“The future we want” becomes a reality.The elimination of poverty remains an absolutepriority on the path to sustainable development. It isa major challenge for many countries of the world including those of the Horn of Africa. Our region issuffering enormously from the adverse effects of climatechange  and has been for a number of years. Trappedin the cycle of chronic droughts and f loods  our mostvulnerable people are seeing their means of subsistencedestroyed and their productive capacity and access tosufficient  nutritious food hampered. Our Governmenthas implemented social policies designed to relieve theburden of extreme poverty and its corollary  hunger  andhopes its partners will continue their support by actingin accord with the national priorities  within a long-termapproach that will enable us to move from emergencyoperations geared to the relief of affected populationsto a perspective of sustainable development.That means  from the emergency stage onward  acomprehensive global approach accompanied by effortsto guarantee women  children and men the right tofood. Guaranteeing food security to our fellow citizensremains our priority. I am convinced that the goalsof the Secretary-General’s Zero Hunger initiative areachievable  because they have been developed withinthe perspective of an integrated  effective strategy toeliminate hunger that involves all actors.I wish to acknowledge the support of our partners who have spared no effort to help us reach that goal especially in the efforts to reduce the disparitiesbetween rural and urban populations and to develop ouragricultural production. In that regard  my country hasimplemented a number of agricultural infrastructureprojects  including the development of arable land inneighbouring countries such as Ethiopia and the Sudanand a project to capture the water of the Awash River onthe Ethiopian border when it f loods.Access to potable water and water purificationcontinue to be a critical goal for my country  which is unfortunately on the list of those deficient in potablewater and which is considered a country at risk of watershortages in the next 25 years. For most countries inour situation  the effects of climate change accentuateexisting disparities.Sustainable development must take an approachfocused on meeting the needs of populations. Women children and young people should be the target ofany implementation policy derived from the Rio+20outcome document (resolution 66/288  annex) and ofall discussions geared to formulating the post-2015development agenda. Human capital is my country’smain asset  and that is why my Government devotesparticular attention to its development. Social policiesare being developed around the goal of promoting andenhancing the rights and well-being of young peopleand women. It is a national priority to guaranteegender equality and to empower women through accessto health care and protect them from all forms ofdiscrimination and violence. My Government thereforewelcomes the African Union initiative recommendingthat at its sixty-seventh session the Assembly adopta draft resolution aimed at intensifying efforts toeliminate female genital mutilation from the world.We welcome the measures undertaken by the AfricanGroup in New York to that effect.Youth  which is our future  constitutes a sure assetfor the African continent. Indeed  almost 65 per centof the African population is under the age of 35. Itgoes without saying that addressing their present andensuring their social well-being is the way to successfor our country. The challenges are enormous giventhe global economic stagnation. My Government hastherefore set up social policies and programmes inorder to respond to the specific needs of young peoplein the areas of education  health care and employment.On behalf of the Republic of Djibouti  I would liketo reiterate my warmest congratulations to the newPresident of the Somali Republic  Mr. Hassan SheikhMohamud  and to his people on having taken the firststep towards the reconciliation and stabilization ofSomalia and on having found the necessary resourcesto overcome all obstacles on the way. The civil andpeaceful climate among the candidates at the time of theelection and the maturity that they showed throughoutan historic and inclusive electoral process must becommended. Those realities are the best guarantee ofsuccess for the future. The hope of seeing a reconciledand peaceful Somalia is in sight. A new phase in the country’s political life isbeginning for the Somali people after more than20 years of suffering and violence. The momentumand enthusiasm prompted by those elections amongSomalis in the diaspora and within the country areunprecedented. However  at this point it is crucial toaddress two major challenges. The short-term priorities namely  security  good governance and economicrecovery  are challenges that the Somali Governmentcannot overcome alone.Somalia is at a crossroads and will need more thanever the support and cooperation of all its partnersand friends. Donors and the international financialinstitutions must stand beside the new Somali leadershipin order to help fulfil its new vision and to improvethe lives of Somalis as soon as possible. Their actionmust be strengthened  coordinated and consistent withthe priorities of the new Government as there are manychallenges to overcome. Those challenges range fromrestoring the security services to access to justice andfrom establishing the rule of law to respect for humanrights  not to mention the problems of terrorism andpiracy off the Somali coast  which will not disappearin the short term.In short  it is clear that the end of the transitionin Somalia does not mean the completion of the peaceprocess. Politically  it is important that all phases ofthe road map be implemented and that the politicaldialogue continue. From the humanitarian point ofview  the situation remains critical. Millions of Somalisneed humanitarian assistance and have no means ofsubsistence. The problem of refugees and internallydisplaced persons also remains a source of concern.Restoring security and maintaining it is not theeasiest thing in Somalia giving the new upsurge inthe terrorist acts and guerrilla tactics of extremistgroups  such as Al-Shabaab  despite the undeniablesuccess of the troops of the African Union Mission inSomalia (AMISOM) and of the Somali and Ethiopiansecurity forces.I would like to pay tribute here to the memory of thelate Meles Zenawi  former Prime Minister of Ethiopia who made peace his centrepiece. I would also like toexpress admiration for the tireless efforts and heavysacrifices of the AMISOM troops  the Somali SecurityForces and the allied forces. Their contribution was andremains invaluable to improving the security situation inMogadishu and the surrounding areas. The internationalcommunity must ensure the continued  predictable and reliable financing of the AMISOM troops so that thereconciliation  stabilization and peacebuilding strategycontinues and reaches all Somalia.In that regard  strengthening the security gainsis crucial. The countries in the region — Uganda Burundi  Ethiopia  Kenya and Djibouti — have doneuseful work and continue to serve the noble cause ofpeace. However  the transformation of the AMISOMforces into a United Nations peacekeeping force nowseems inevitable. We can no longer avoid that issue. It isup to the Security Council to take that timely decision.I would also like to launch an appeal for theconvening of a donor conference in order to mobilizeresources for the reconstruction of the Somali economy.I am convinced that we are all aware of the necessityof meeting the individual recovery  reintegration andreconstruction needs of countries emerging fromconflict. Somalia is no exception. Here at the UnitedNations  we must consider the steps to be taken  inparticular by the Peacebuilding Commission.The theme of the General Assembly thisyear — “Bringing about adjustment or settlementof international disputes or situations by peacefulmeans” — is relevant given the many conflicts in theworld that threaten international peace and security.Our region  the Horn of Africa  has unfortunately notbeen spared. As members know  my country  whichhad successfully preserved the peace  was attacked andbrought into a border conflict by Eritrea in June 2008.Since then  the Government has spared no effortto resolve the dispute peacefully within regional andinternational organizations. In the conviction thatdialogue is possible  my Government accepted thegood offices of His Royal Highness the Emir of Qatarand his mediation. On the ground  that took the formof deploying Qatari troops at the border betweenDjibouti and Eritrea and the withdrawal of Eritreantroops from Ras Doumeira and Doumeira Island. TheSecurity Council adopted resolutions 1862 (2009)  1907(2009) and 2023 (2011) to express the concern of theinternational community in the light of that new crisisin the Horn of Africa.To date  two and a half years after the signingof the mediation agreement  we are still waiting forthe demarcation of the border and the return of ourprisoners of war. The request for the release of theDjibouti prisoners and the implementation of resolution1862 (2009) remain sensitive issues for my country. My Government remains convinced that mediationis the path that will enable us to achieve peace. We willnever stop believing in the virtues of dialogue  whichis the only way for our region to strengthen the gainsof peace.The events that have taken place in the worldin recent weeks following the dissemination of ananti-Islam film and of caricatures denigrating theimage of the Prophet of Islam cannot and must not leavethe international community indifferent. The tragicconsequences that led in particular to the loss of humanlives demand our attention. Political and religiousleaders and all people of goodwill must form a commonfront against extremist and fanatical excesses of allkinds. Given the desire of some to spread religiousintolerance  States Members of the United Nations mustensure that the provisions of the Human Rights Councilconsensus resolution 16/18 and General Assemblyconsensus resolution 66/167 provide the answer.While all legal steps must be taken to ensure freedomof expression  it is just as important that malicious actsthat incite people to religious hatred  discrimination violence and intimidation through negative stereotypes as well as violence and discrimination on the basis ofreligion  in particular against Muslims or any othergroup  must be condemned and rejected  in accordancewith the relevant human rights instruments.Given their increasing role in our modern societies the media and social networks have responsibilitiesand must be on the side of those who contribute tounderstanding and respect among the various culturesand civilizations. It is more urgent than ever to beon the side of tolerance  moderation and reason. Allinitiatives and actions that promote peace in minds andhearts and mutual understanding among peoples mustbe encouraged.The establishment of the United Nations gave riseto immense hope in the world following the SecondWorld War and symbolized the will of all peoples ofthe world not to be plunged again into the throes ofwar. The Organization has been a forum for all nationsunder colonization and a platform for them to acquiresovereignty and to free themselves from domination.However  it seems that  since 1947  there hasbeen an exception  to the detriment of the Palestinianpeople. Palestine still lives under occupation which today is morally reprehensible and politicallyunacceptable. It is high time that justice be delivered to the Palestinian people and that the peace processbetween the Palestinian authorities and the occupyingforce succeed. Freedom  justice  dignity and respect forhuman rights are the only bastions against extremistexcesses. The international community has a moralduty and a political responsibility to put an end to thesuffering of the Palestinian people  which has lasted formore than 60 years.History is on the side of those that show thepolitical courage required to achieve peace and togive the peoples concerned hope for a better life. Therecognition of a Palestinian State as a fully-fledgedMember of the United Nations by the General Assemblyis the first step in the solidarity that the internationalcommunity owes to the Palestinian people  who haveshown patience and self lessness until now."
"47",1932,"DMA",67,2012,"﻿On behalf of theGovernment and people of the Commonwealth ofDominica  I would like to congratulate Mr. Jeremić onhis election to the presidency of the General Assemblyat its sixty-seventh session and to wish him everysuccess. We also express our appreciation and gratitudeto his predecessor  Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  forthe able manner in which he presided over the sixty-sixth session.The sixty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly has convened at a time when we face myriadchallenges — the impact of climate change  civilconflicts  hunger and starvation  poverty  HIV/AIDS andchronic non-communicable diseases. Those challenges however  are equally matched by the tremendousopportunities created by the rapid advancement inscience and technology and the unprecedented level ofinternational cooperation.We therefore need the political will to harnessthose opportunities for the benefit of our peoples.That would necessarily require the transformation ofmultilateral institutions  such as the United Nations including its organs and agencies  the World Bank andthe International Monetary Fund  to reflect equity andinclusion. Those changes must be supported by a shiftin our systems of production and consumption and by anew economic system  built on the principles of fairnessand differentiated treatment on the basis of the uniquechallenges of countries  especially the vulnerability ofsmall island developing States (SIDS). I am confidentthat  with such an approach  we will be able to overcomethose challenges in a functioning multilateral system.The unsustainable consumption and productionsystems that continue to deplete the world’s resourcesand that simultaneously contribute to global warmingremain a major threat to the survival of those of us wholive close to the world’s oceans. The United NationsConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) wasa commendable effort by the international communityto take stock of the human impact on the Earth’sresources and to commit to reversing the presenttrend. The outcome document  entitled “The futurewe want” (resolution 66/288  annex)  falls short of ourexpectations. However  it remains a work in progressand presents a useful platform for the ongoing discussionof multilateral resolutions to the growing concern ofsustainable development. More important  the outcome  document is indicative of what the internationalcommunity can achieve when collective energies areharnessed to present an international response.The Commonwealth of Dominica is pleased thatRio+20 reaffirmed an international commitment tosupport small island developing States. We especiallywelcome the agreement to convene the third GlobalConference on the Sustainable Development of SIDSin 2014 in the Pacific region. In fact  we are of theview that the third Global Conference will provide anopportunity for the implementation of the outcomes ofRio+20  the Barbados Programme of Action and theMauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation ofthe Barbados Programme of Action.As a small island developing State  Dominica iscommitted to the fundamental principle of environmentalsustainability. That is clearly demonstrated by ourapproach to sustainable development as the “NatureIsland”. The sustainable use of our natural resourceshas contributed to our tourism product  while at thesame time blessing our citizens with the most beautifulplace on Earth to call home. Notwithstanding that  ourgreat vulnerability continues to put us at the mercyof countries that promote and employ unsustainablepractices. The challenges include an internationaleconomic system dominated by the strong and thepowerful that pays little or no regard to the vulnerable.If multilateralism is to survive  we need to focus oncorrecting that lopsided system  which is destined toannihilate SIDS.Dominica’s very vulnerability to the effects ofglobal warming underscores our commitment to amultilateral approach aimed at combating climatechange. The impact of climate change continues tomanifest itself in a number of ways  resulting in greaterchallenges to the survival of SIDS. The failure to dateto reach a legally binding outcome on climate change isa cause of grave concern. While the debate continues the challenges to our islands increase.We are encouraged  however  by the fact that therecently concluded climate talks in Bangkok prepareda fertile ground for the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change in Doha later thisyear. Nevertheless  Dominica continues to stress theimportance of extending and amending the KyotoProtocol before it lapses. The timely creation of a roadmap for a new legally binding document must be treatedas a matter of urgency. We look forward to the Dohatalks  of which we have great expectations.One major contributor to climate change is theconsumption of fossil fuels for the production ofelectricity. The importation of fossil fuels also has thegreatest impact on the economic vulnerability of manysmall island developing States. Addressing energyissues is therefore central to responding to the challengesof climate change and sustainable development. Today there is still a significant portion of many remote andrural island communities that has little or no access tomodern and affordable energy services.The low-carbon economies in SIDS thereforeprovide an opportunity to reduce greenhouse-gasemissions  while decreasing dependence on importedfossil fuels. By generating their own energy fromnatural renewable sources  SIDS will be able to achieveenergy security. The savings realized from avoidingthe cost of importing fossil fuels could be used foradaptation and developmental needs. For that andother reasons  the SIDS Sustainable Energy Initiative known as SIDS DOCK  was instituted. The Initiativecurrently provides a global platform for SIDS to pursuetheir renewable energy ambitions by building capacityand by providing technical support to member States.The Governments of Denmark and Japan  the UnitedNations Development Programme and the World Bankcontinue to play a significant role in making energyindependence a reality for SIDS. The recent partnershipwith the Clinton Foundation has given new hope to anumber of islands that are vigorously pursuing theirrenewable energy aspirations.Dominica has the honour of serving as Chair ofSIDS DOCK. My delegation  on its own behalf as wellas that of SIDS DOCK  fully endorses the BarbadosDeclaration on Achieving Sustainable Energy for Allin Small Island Developing States  signed by ministersand other heads of delegation of the Alliance of SmallIsland States at the ministerial conference held inBridgetown in May. The commitments made and targetsset to increase the percentage of renewable energy andincrease energy efficiency in energy portfolios aretestimony to our region’s commitment to the Secretary-General’s Sustainable Energy for All initiative. Wecongratulate the Secretary-General on launching theinitiative  which SIDS DOCK joined and is committedto actively supporting.Dominica  the “Nature Island”  continues to pursuethe development of its geothermal resources. We arepleased to announce that the recently concluded test-drilling in the Roseau Valley has confirmed that ourgeothermal resources have the potential to supply ourdomestic needs and provide an exportable surplus. Thatwill allow us to move away from the importation of fossilfuel for the generation of electricity within the next fiveyears  while also reducing the cost of electricity for ourpeople. At the same time  the development of a powerplant for export to the French territories of Guadeloupeand Martinique will provide a source of revenue forthe island. Negotiations are ongoing and expectedto conclude by the end of 2012. Work is expected tocommence on the first power plant in the first quarterof 2013. Dominica’s energy initiative has the potentialto transform its economy and to improve the qualityof life of its people. The Government of Dominica  astrustee of the island’s resources on behalf of its people is therefore ensuring that it manages that processresponsibly.We have sought and are receiving assistance fromsome of the most reputable consultants in the world. Thesupport of the Clinton Climate Initiative has allowed us tonavigate through the complex challenges of the project.We therefore wish to express our gratitude to PresidentBill Clinton for his continued support in that initiative.We anticipate that  by 2017  all of our electricity needswill be met by a combination of sources  namely  hydroand geothermal. By 2020 we expect to be exportingelectricity to our neighbouring islands via submarinecables. That  coupled with our sustainable developmentpractices  means that Dominica will go beyond carbonneutrality to being carbon-negative by the year 2020.Like Dominica  many SIDS are pursuing nationalrenewable energy initiatives  and more than 20 SIDShave made pledges under the Sustainable Energy forAll initiative. However  unsustainable debt and thelack of technology make it impossible for them toachieve their goals. We therefore invite other developedcountries and the international community to join theGovernments of Denmark and Japan and the ClintonClimate Initiative in the SIDS DOCK partnership and the Government of Norway in its Energy for Allinitiative  in providing critical support to SIDS.The global community should heed the prolonged and in some cases recent  cries of peoples around theworld. The response should not be selective or be basedon narrow national interests. Injustice anywhere and inany form should not be tolerated. The so-called ArabSpring has been one expression of people’s discontent.The international community must support the wishesof people as they struggle to create their own democraticsystems  driven by their aspirations.The recent spate of attacks on United Statesmissions and personnel  or attacks on the diplomaticfacilities of any country  does nothing to advance thecauses of those who may be marginalized or who feeloffended by other democratic systems. Regardless ofwhat may have led to the protests  the Commonwealthof Dominica condemns those unjustified attacks  whichresulted in the unfortunate loss of life of United StatesAmbassador Christopher Stevens and his colleagues.While we are heartened by the attention that hasbeen given to the recent outcries from some cornersof the globe  we remain concerned that in our part ofthe world the cries of people who have been sufferingfor decades have aroused less sympathy. The sufferingof our brothers and sisters in the Republic of Haitipersists  much to the concern of Dominica and theCaribbean Community (CARICOM). We are grateful tothose countries that have responded and to others thathave supported and continue to support the rebuildingefforts in Haiti. However  we are still far from assistingthe people of Haiti to reach a state of normalcy wherethey can enjoy the basic necessities of life. We thereforecall upon the international community to heed the cryof Haiti and to provide support in the rebuilding efforts.The Caribbean region also continues to witness theunheeded call for the discontinuation of the economic financial and trade embargo on our brothers and sistersin the Republic of Cuba. We call upon the Governmentof the United States to allow the people of Cuba to befully integrated into the global trading system  therebyenabling them to improve their lives and allowing theworld to benefit from their tremendous contributions especially in the area of science and technology.The international trade  transfer and use ofconventional arms  weapons  munitions and ammunitioncontinue to threaten international peace and security.Dominica  like its sister nations in CARICOM  is notimmune to that debilitating phenomenon. Our regioncontinues to be affected by an increase in gangsand violent criminal activities born out of the tradeand transfer of illicit arms and drugs throughout theCaribbean region  from North to South America. Weare therefore perturbed that  despite four weeks of rigorous deliberations and intense negotiations  theUnited Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treatydid not result in the finalization of the treaty. However like the rest of our CARICOM colleagues  we believethat the 26 July text from the Chair of the Conferenceprovides a blueprint for a possible final document.As leaders  the task is now ours to finalize a legallybinding document in the interests of the protection ofour people.Dominica remains optimistic that that canbe achieved during the current session of the GeneralAssembly  and we reaffirm our commitment to therealization of a robust arms trade treaty.Dominica would like to take this opportunityto applaud the role and efforts of the United Nationsin combating the proliferation of small arms andlight weapons in the global community. The long-term socioeconomic development of many nations particularly SIDS such as Dominica  is severelycompromised because of the proliferation of smallarms and light weapons in our region. Associated withthat illicit trade is the trafficking of narcotics throughthe Caribbean region  from South to North America which has presented new challenges to the maintenanceof peace and security in our region. It underscoresthe urgent need for a legally binding internationalinstrument that addresses the control and monitoringof the illicit trade in small arms among States andnon-State actors.In conclusion  Dominica remains committedto collaborating with the United Nations and all itsagencies  as well as with all Member States  to strengthenthe mission of this noble body that  notwithstandingits imperfections  is critical to maintaining worldpeace and security. We reaffirm our confidence in theUnited Nations system as the ultimate negotiating anddeliberative body for addressing the major challengesconfronting the world.May we all rise to the occasion and resolve to bringpeace  security and prosperity to every corner of theglobe.Before I finish  Sir  I hope that  given that I am thelast speaker  you will allow me the latitude to addressa word of thanks to the interpreters and the rest of theUnited Nations staff for their hard work over the pastweek. We know that their task has not been easy  andwe appreciate their contribution.May God bless the United Nations. May God blessus all."
"48",1976,"DNK",67,2012,"﻿In a complex world  it issmart economics and also smart politics to focus onprevention rather than cure. This holds true whetherwe address the global economic crisis  sustainabledevelopment and poverty reduction  conflicts likethe one in Syria  or the arms trade and disarmament.In that context  the inclusion of women in politicaldecision-making processes is not only the right thingto do  it is one of the most powerful drivers for positivechange.Our natural resources are increasingly underpressure. By 2030  the world will need 50 per centmore food  45 per cent more energy and 30 per centmore water. Thus  we must chart a new course forour common future and develop a new paradigm foreconomic growth and development that will make itpossible to deal with those challenges and to createopportunities for future generations.In June  at the United Nations Conferenceon Sustainable Development (Rio+20)  we madesome progress  laying down the foundations for thetransformative process we need to pursue. But thehouse still has to be built  and the General Assemblymust provide some of the important building blocksto do this. Defining sustainable development goals aspart of the overall post-2015 international developmentframework  establishing the new high-level politicalforum  and upgrading the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme are all key parts of the agenda before us.Denmark strongly supports the Secretary-General’sSustainable Energy for All initiative  launchedin November 2011  and remains committed to itsobjectives. Access to sustainable energy  improvedenergy efficiency and increased use of renewable energyare all necessary conditions for achieving long-termsustainable development. At Rio+20  a green economywas finally recognized as one of the important toolsavailable for achieving sustainable development.We need to work in close partnership with both theprivate sector and civil society  if we are to succeedin transforming the global economy. The DanishGovernment  in partnership with the Governmentsof Mexico and Republic of Korea  last year createda public-private partnership among progressiveGovernments  global corporations  financialinstitutions and international organizations  includingthe United Nations  called the Global Green GrowthForum. At the second Forum meeting a week from now in Copenhagen  the focus will be on resource efficiencyand growth  reinforcing the need to decouple economicgrowth from unsustainable environmental pressuresand to refocus efforts on the creation of decent jobs.While making the last push for achieving theMillennium Development Goals in 2015  we will startpreparing the post-2015 international developmentframework and embark on the discussion on how to bestformulate new and more ambitious goals beyond 2015.As stated  the sustainable development goals should bean integrated part of this exercise. Denmark stronglysupports the promotion of human rights as a means todevelopment  rights being understood as indivisible andinterdependent. Such a rights-based approach is aboutplacing people — men and women — at the centreand in charge of their own development. And let meadd  in the case of a woman  this also means the rightto decide over her own body. That is why Denmarkwelcomes today’s launch of the high-level task forcefor the International Conference on Population andDevelopment. Important parts of the rights-basedapproach are access to information  involvement indecision-making and strengthening the voice of civilsociety.Four decades ago  the United Nations set a targetfor developed countries to increase their officialdevelopment assistance to 0.7 per cent of their grossnational income. Every year since 1978 Denmark hassurpassed the target  and our development assistancewill continue to increase over the years to come. Wecall on other donors and potential donors  includingemerging economies  to increase their assistance aswell.We see a great need for support to fragile Stateslike Somalia  South Sudan  Yemen  Afghanistan andMali  where fragility and conflict hamper developmentand poverty reduction and may provide a breedingground for all kinds of instability. We see positive signsin those countries  but there are still many challenges and we therefore require strong and continuous politicalcommitment  both within the countries themselves andon the part of the international community  in orderto succeed. We in the international community needto take a closer look inside our toolbox and find theright mix of development assistance and security policyresponse  including ways of addressing terrorismand in some cases piracy. In conflict-affected andfragile countries  there is a need to understand thatwithout security there can be no development andthat without development there can be no security.Denmark actively participates in promoting the NewDeal for Engagement in Fragile States  and we arecurrently co-chairing the International Dialogue onPeacebuilding and State-building. A peaceful andprosperous development in fragile States stands atthe heart of Danish development policy  most recentlyexemplified in the Sahel region. Denmark sharesthe ambition of the International Dialogue to havepeacebuilding and statebuilding goals firmly reflectedin the post-2015 international development framework.We must also use international cooperation toreduce the level of conflicts and to set clear rules forall to abide by. Unregulated and irresponsible tradeof conventional weapons is often the direct cause ofunbearable human suffering. It further destabilizesweak and fragile States and is a hindrance todevelopment. There is an urgent need for a universaland legally binding arms trade treaty  and  togetherwith Germany  Denmark has encouraged the Secretary-General to continue his strong personal engagementwith respect to the convening of a second arms tradetreaty conference early next year. Now is the time toact  and we call upon the members of the Assembly to successfully conclude negotiations on a treaty and to doso without delay.Let me use this occasion to once again call onthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  and moreparticularly on Iran  to comply with internationallaw and relevant Security Council resolutions. It isin Iran’s own interest to take concrete steps to buildinternational confidence in the exclusively peacefulnature of its nuclear programme. The Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is a cornerstoneof international cooperation on disarmament andnon-proliferation. In this context  Denmark activelysupports the work of the Finnish facilitator to organizea conference on the Middle East as a zone free ofweapons and materials of mass destruction.For Denmark and the European Union  the ruleof law is critical to international peace and security human rights and development. It is a fundamentalprinciple of good governance  whereby the State isaccountable to its citizens and ensures their humanrights and fundamental freedoms  as well as theirparticipatory rights. We therefore welcome the outcomeof last week’s High-level Meeting on the Rule of Lawat the National and International Levels (resolution67/1) and the commitments made by Member States.Denmark also looks forward to an effective follow-upto the High-level Meeting.International agreement on the responsibility toprotect at the 2005 World Summit was a clear statementby the international community that the atrocitiesand large-scale tragedies of the last century must notbe repeated in the twenty-first century. The globalnetwork of national focal points on the responsibility toprotect — an initiative launched by the Governments ofDenmark and Ghana  Costa Rica and Australia — is anapproach to encourage and assist States in developingtheir national capacities and mechanisms for theprevention of mass atrocity crimes. We call on allStates to appoint national focal points and to join thenetwork  thereby demonstrating their commitment todecisive and timely prevention and response.Even as I speak  we are witnessing in Syria aGovernment that is not living up to its moral and politicalobligations. Instead  it pursues a violent path of tryingto quell the cry for freedom  for democratic reformsand for human rights. Despite several promises madeto the international community during the last year  theAl-Assad regime has not stopped the violence. Instead we have only heard the sound of machine guns  heavyweapons and airplanes firing away at civilians. Since Istood here at this rostrum a year ago (see A/66/PV.29) the situation has only deteriorated. Last year about2 600 people in Syria had died in the conflict. Now more than 20 000 people have suffered that fate. TheSyrian people are f leeing from the shooting spree and a quarter of a million of them are now refugeesin neighbouring countries. More than a million peopleinside Syria are in need of humanitarian assistance.We condemn the brutal violence and massacres ofcivilians in the strongest terms. The time has come tostop the bloodshed and the suffering of the Syrian people.We cannot look away while the increasing sectarianviolence spirals out of control  the humanitarianemergency escalates and the crisis spills over borders.President Al-Assad has lost all legitimacy and muststep aside to allow for a peaceful and democratictransition. At the same time  those responsible for grosshuman rights violations must be brought to justice. Wecommend the very valuable work done by the HumanRights Council’s Commission of Inquiry on Syria.We note in particular that the Commission has statedthat it is likely that crimes against humanity have beencommitted by the Syrian regime. The internationalcommunity must act on that information. Denmark callson the Security Council to refer the case of Syria andthe serious violations of international humanitarian lawcommitted in the country to the International CriminalCourt.We urge the Security Council to unite and agree onstrong measures  including comprehensive sanctions to enforce the six-point plan endorsed by the Council.We cannot afford to continue waiting for a change ofpolicy on the part of the regime  which it shows no signof ever making. The Syrian people need action. At thesame time  we strongly encourage the Syrian oppositiongroups to agree on a set of shared principles for workingtowards an inclusive  orderly and peaceful transitionin Syria to a future free of Al-Assad and his brutalregime. While thanking former Secretary-General KofiAnnan for his valuable contribution to finding a lastingsolution to the conflict  we now put our trust in the newJoint Special Representative of the United Nations andthe League of Arab States  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  andin his efforts at reaching a political solution.The negative developments in Syria stand in sharpcontrast to the situation in other countries that havebeen affected by the Arab winds of change. Calls for reforms  economic justice  democracy and respect forhuman rights have been heard  and in countries likeTunisia  Morocco  Egypt and Libya things are moving and generally in the right direction. But there are alsosigns that progress is not universal  for example  therecent decision by the Bahraini Court of Cassation touphold the convictions of 20 human rights activists including a Danish national. Calling for reforms is not acrime  as was rightly pointed out by the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Human Rights.Last month’s election of the new Prime Ministerin Libya by a democratically elected parliament is aconcrete example of progress  which makes it all themore difficult to comprehend the terrible and tragicattack on the United States Consulate in Benghazi which we have strongly condemned. It was a soberingreminder of the serious challenges that still persist incountries in transition toward democracy. Democracydoes not happen overnight. It takes years to develop  andattacks by extremists should not be allowed to derail aprocess that the majority of the people have fought sohard for. We stand firm by our commitments to Libya and we stand firm in there being no justification forsuch attacks — none whatsoever.It has been clear since the beginning of the ArabSpring that developments in the region make the MiddleEast peace process and a negotiated solution evenmore urgent and important. A year ago  the Quartetin its 23 September 2011 statement (SG/2178) calledfor a peace agreement to be signed no later than theend of 2012. Regrettably  we face a reality which doesnot augur well for that to happen. As things developon the ground  the prospects for a two-State solution providing for two independent  democratic  contiguous sovereign and viable States living side by side inpeace and security  are diminishing  not increasing.As we approach the twentieth anniversary of the OsloAgreement  it is indeed time to reach a final agreement.The world is undergoing profound changes. Currentand new challenges call for international resolveand multilateral solutions. They call for strategicapproaches  focusing on prevention and early action todismantle problems  rather than on belated responsesand interventions to deal with them when it is too late too inefficient and much more costly. And they callfor the United Nations  the strength of which lies inits unique legitimacy  to stand up and take the lead inaddressing global challenges. The United Nations can make a real difference for the 7 billion people livingon this planet. It is up to all of us to ensure that it does"
"49",2021,"DOM",67,2012,"﻿Wewarmly congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his electionto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.We are also pleased that the general debate of thissession is devoted to considering  among other issues the promotion of sustained economic growth andsustainable development in accordance with relevantGeneral Assembly resolutions and recent UnitedNations conferences.Since we adopted the Declaration that led to theMillenium Development Goals (resolution 55/2)  theimage of development has been tied to the reductionof poverty and to the development of capacities andopportunities for the most vulnerable populations.The majority of our developing countries had madesignificant progress in this area until 2008  when thefinancial crisis  which affected the world economy andthreatened to cancel out our achievements  began.We are living at a time of multiple simultaneouscrises. The ecological crisis threatens the majority ofour f lora and fauna. Global warming threatens coastalpopulations and small island countries. Uncheckedpopulation growth threatens to exceed the capacity ofnature to restore itself. We have witnessed a crisis of thevalues that have traditionally governed the behaviour ofhumankind. War and armed conflict threaten the rightto cultural  ideological and political diversity and ourright to live in peace and unity.Those of us who live in the developing countriesdid not cause the world financial crisis. As you know the crisis was caused by the failure to use effectiveregulations in the international financial system andby the arrogance  greed and unbridled desire to amasswealth. In the context of the crisis  age-old debateshave resurfaced as to how best to tackle the crisis.Should we reduce investment in social protections forour populations? Or  on the contrary  should we bolsterinvestment  making anti-cyclical social investment policies into a springboard for reviving economies?And how do we measure poverty and development andrecognize the social impact of the measures adopted?Do we use average income indicators for reducingsocial inequality and improving quality of life?The countries in the developing world whoseeconomies have performed better and have shown lessvulnerability in the context of the world crisis have beenthose that have understood  in time  that investing intraining our peoples and improving the quality of life ofour peoples is the best way to reduce our vulnerabilityand to maintain economic growth. The economy mustserve the people  not the reverse.In the debate on development  we must reaffirmas peoples and as Government leaders that we havelearned quite often through painful experience thatequality and sustainability are key prerequisites forensuring sustained and sustainable economic growth.Today  we know that it is not enough to have economicgrowth in order to reduce social inequity and toimprove the quality of life of our peoples. Nor is it rightto sacrifice our people in the hope that the growth ofan economy will ultimately lead to benefits for all andreduce social inequality. That expectation quite oftenremains unmet. On the contrary  experience has shownthat by improving the quality of life and by reducingpoverty and social exclusion  we can help stimulatehealthy economic growth.In the context of international crisis anduncertainty  we must reduce national and internationalsocial inequalities. We must increase social cohesionand strengthen democratic governance. We also knowthat economic growth  which does not take account ofthe limits of natural resources and the needs of futuregenerations  will entail the risk of imminent collapse.We must revise the ideas about development that haveprevailed in the international financial system.Equity and sustainability are two sides of thesame coin  and that is how we must approach humandevelopment. That vision is consistent with internationaldeclarations on sustainable development  such as theDeclarations issued by the United Nations Conferenceon the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972  bythe Rio Earth Summit in Rio de Janiero in 1992  andby the World Summit on Sustainable Development inJohannesburg in 2002. They promoted the three pillarsof sustainable development: environmental equity economic equity and social equity. Development means protecting environmental systems  raising theproductive capacity of goods and services and reducingsocial inequality by raising the quality of life of all menand women  multiplying capacities and opportunities.Today  7 billion people inhabit the Earth. Of those 43 per cent  or 3 billion  are under the age of 25. Wemust invest so that our young people have the skills andopportunities to tackle creatively the development tasksthat face our societies. For many years  the developmentof countries has been assessed by international financialinstitutions  using measures of income or nationalproduction expressed per capita in order to determinethe state of material well-being. Based on that kindof measure  our country  the Dominican Republic has been classified in recent years as a medium highincome country.Nonetheless  more than a third of our citizens livein poverty. How then is it possible to exclude countrieslike ours from receiving development aid? By the sametoken  to give an international comparison  poverty hasbeen measured in terms of income  with those familiesthat subsist on less than $2 a day being defined as poorand those who live on less than $1.25 as extremely poor an adjustment being made in both cases for buyingpower.According to those criteria  over 2 billion peopleworldwide — 33 per cent of humanity — are poor  and in2005 the number living in extreme poverty had droppedto 1.4 billion. Those same measures project that by 2015only 883 million will be living in extreme poverty. Theoptimism of those international figures does not appearto coincide with the perception of many of our citizens who feel that the increase in gross domestic productdoes not reflect their needs or despair  nor does it jibewith the unhappiness of our young people who  despiteraising their educational level  are still unable to finddignified work or the opportunities to fulfil theirbusiness aspirations.That discrepancy between the optimism of certaininternational indicators and the discontent on our streetscan be explained by the fact that we are using inadequatetools to measure poverty  development and well-being.At least in the Dominican Republic  it is hard to believethat the quality of life and the opportunities to improveit would be very different for a person with an incomeof $2 a day than for someone earning a few cents less.Poverty in a given family or community is much morethan the lack of income with respect to a predetermined threshold  just as the development of a country is muchmore than the size of its median income.The International Labour Organization reported in2010 that 81 million of the 620 million young peoplebetween the ages of 15 and 24 worldwide who wereeconomically active  which represents 13 per centof that age group  had been unemployed during thepreceding year  primarily due to the world economicand financial crisis. Between 2007 and 2009  the globalunemployment rate for young people experienced thegreatest rise in its history: from 11.9 per cent to 13 percent. Young women had a harder time than young menin finding work.The results in terms of health  education andmaternal and child mortality show the limits ofthe unilateral and optimistic focus on poverty anddevelopment. Not without reason have some academicssaid that“we are gambling with the fate of our planet with‘games’ in which a few private players reap thebenefits and society pays the consequences. Asystem that permits results like those is destined tomismanage risk”.Social investment in the education  health andemployment of young people can build the foundation fora strong economic base that can halt the transmission ofpoverty from one generation to the next. Strengtheningyoung people’s skills creates the conditions for them toearn higher income during their productive economiclives. The way we understand and measure povertytranslates into national and international policydecisions.To assume that poverty and underdevelopment aresimply the expression of family income or nationalaverages has led to limited social policies of entitlementor transfers. Such policies temporarily raise the incomeof impoverished families above the so-called povertyline  at the expense of developing universal  moreeffective and better-quality public service systems thatwould benefit  as a right  those who have traditionallybeen excluded.Adam Smith  the father of economic liberalism included in his definition of poverty such social andcultural aspects as “the ability to go about withoutshame”. More recently  the Nobel Prize winner inEconomics Amartya Sen spoke of development itselfas freedom. In that sense  broadening our concept of poverty to include measures of social participation andinclusion  as well as unmet basic needs  will allow us todevelop more holistic and effective responses. Povertyis a multidimensional phenomenon  a complex systemof problems that requires a systemic solution leading tobroader skills  freedom and opportunities for those whohave traditionally been excluded.Investment in quality universal education and healthsystems  a universal safety net  access to dignifiedwork and living spaces  personal safety and the securityof goods  inter alia  are crucial elements for expandingthe skills and opportunities of impoverished portions ofthe population. Poverty reduction is the basic lever forincreasing the production of goods and services and forpropelling new dynamics of growth and development.Assessing the development of countries exclusively onthe basis of their national per capita income leads todecisions that have a negative impact on our efforts atdevelopment. When a country is ranked according tothose simple criteria  the contribution of internationalcooperation is reduced and access to loans frominternational financial institutions is reduced orbecomes more expensive.As developing countries  we also need to shoulderour share of responsibility. Domestically  we need toimprove our information systems in order to betterunderstand our social  land and gender inequalities as well the impact we have on the environment. At thesame time  we must redirect our investment patternsand our public policies to promote equality and socialinclusion for the most vulnerable groups  and for thatwe need the support of the international community..A country should not cease to receive development aidsimply because its average national income has crosseda certain arbitrarily defined threshold.Latin America has long experience with thesearch for multidimensional measures of poverty anddevelopment. Since the middle of the last century the Economic Commission for Latin America and theCaribbean has developed a methodology based on anindex of unmet basic needs. Many countries haveapplied such composite multidimensional indexes. Inthe Dominican Republic we use a quality of life indextailored to our reality. The United Nations DevelopmentProgramme has applied the human development index and a number of other indexes have been proposed at theinternational level. Despite that  the majority of bodiesin the international financial system continue to relyon one-dimensional measures that focus on monetary income to assess and categorize the development of ourcountries and to determine their policies on the basis ofcriteria for international financial support.We wish to avail ourselves of this opportunity tourge international financial organizations to be moreready and willing to embrace our efforts to breakthe vicious cycle of poverty and social exclusion asthe basis for development. We need to use enhancedindicators with a greater capacity to capture andmeasure the complex dynamics of human development.What is needed is for us to work together to overcomeexclusion  not to prolong poverty and extreme povertyindefinitely.The Dominican Republic reiterates its firmcommitment to peace  tolerance and internationalcoexistence as well as to democracy and freedom as basiccomponents for development. We hope that sustainabledevelopment will enrich the daily lives of individuals families  communities and countries and will preserveour natural resources. Peace  the abolishment ofsocial inequality  environmental sustainability and thesustained growth of our capacity to produce the goodsand services required by our peoples go hand-in-hand and they are the very core of development."
"50",2068,"DZA",67,2012,"﻿I wouldlike to take this opportunity to warmly congratulatePresident Vuk Jeremić on his election to the presidencyof the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I alsopay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Nassir AbdulazizAl-Nasser  for his efforts during his tenure. I wouldalso like to commend the continuing commitment andefforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.Today our world faces a complex turning point inits history  replete with challenges and opportunities.The deep geopolitical upheavals in our region and theserious problems resulting from the economic andfinancial crisis attest to that.We believe that our collective faith in multilateralismwill help us to unite our efforts to find solutions andovercome the persistent uncertainty that has resultedfrom those changes. The unprecedented extent of ourproblems may risk worsening the existing imbalancesin relations among nations. All of us  without exception bear a responsibility for the future of our planet  whichwe would like to be more just and more united.No country has been spared the consequencesof the global crisis  and their management cannot beconsidered by only a small number of States acting to the exclusion of the rest. Quite the contrary  we allhave the right to participate in finding solutions. Theslowdown in the world’s economy negatively affectsmany countries  including those of the developedworld  which are facing a sovereign debt crisis andincreasing unemployment. Therefore  further effortsare called for to prevent such situations from spillingover to other regions of the world  in particular toAfrica. The response to the challenges of the crisis restswith our capacity to find alternatives to the theoriesand practices of the past  because the new realities ofour times require urgent implementation of appropriateand more effective approaches and mechanisms foraddressing the crisis.As in previous years  we continue to suffer fromthe effects of the multidimensional crisis  whether ineconomic governance or in political coordination. Infact  the return of trust and growth should lead us tostep up our efforts to coordinate between the UnitedNations and multilateral institutions in the economicand financial fields. The United Nations and the BrettonWoods institutions should complement each other andact in complete political and economic coordinationand harmony.As far as we are concerned  Algeria has shoulderedits share of responsibility. It has made enormoussacrifices and continues to rigorously control andmanage its expenditures. The fiscal surplus that wehave achieved has allowed us to adopt a revived socialpolicy under our five-year plan 2010-2014 that involvesredistributing wealth while maintaining investmentsfor economic growth.Algeria has always called for combating thecauses and not just the consequences of instability. Wehave insisted on the important fact that developmentand peace and security are interrelated  and that thestrategies of the United Nations and  in particular  theSecurity Council  for lasting peace must be thought ofin harmony with socioeconomic development policies.In that regard  at the regional level  Algeria iscontributing to the process of democratization andthe promotion of the rule of law and socioeconomicdevelopment. The fight against hunger and poverty the protection of food security  agriculture  growth infrastructure  energy and renewable energy are areasin which we cooperate with countries of the Maghreband the Sahel. Along the same lines  Algeria is sharingwith African and Arab countries and with its otherpartners its experience in the area of fighting terrorism and the interrelated scourges of organized crime andillicit trafficking in drugs and weapons  which arewidespread our region.Algeria welcomes the recent changes in somecountries of North Africa and the Middle East thatreflected the will of their peoples  who are searchingfor a democratic ideal  justice and dignity. Those are  infact  the founding principles of the Algerian revolution.Committed to the principle of self-determination ofpeoples and mutual respect among nations  Algeriacondemns all forms of violence and repression wherever they arise. We will continue to believe thatdialogue and negotiation are the best means for settlingdisputes.Algeria hopes that the people of Western Saharawill exercise their right to self-determination. Weurge Morocco and the Frente Polisario to act in goodfaith and initiate formal talks  under the auspices ofthe United Nations  with a view to reaching a just andlasting solution  pursuant to the norms and provisionsof international law.The search for peace  security and development isa priority for us all. That commitment was formallyreaffirmed by the countries of the Non-AlignedMovement  including Algeria  at the Movement’ssixteenth summit  held in Tehran last August.We support the commitment of the United Nationsto conflict prevention through its unf lagging diplomaticefforts  and we appreciate our Organization’s role inpromoting appropriate solutions to major crises withinthe context of its tireless and comprehensive efforts tobring about development.Algeria is a member of the special joint committeeof the United Nations and the League of Arab Statesto monitor the Syrian crisis. We supported Mr. KofiAnnan and we will do the same with his successor Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  with a view to reaching apolitical solution to the acute crisis that is unfoldingwithin that fraternal country.In our region today  we are facing new risks andthreats that point to a return of terrorism in its moreviolent manifestations  along with its interrelatedscourges of organized crime and trafficking in drugsand weapons. It is in that context that we have toconsider the complex situation in brotherly Mali. Thatcrisis seriously threatens the security of the countries ofthe Sahel. In fact the deep  root causes of the situationcan be attributed to the ills of severe underdevelopment and abject poverty. Algeria acts in concert with theAfrican Union  the Economic Community of WestAfrican States and other regional actors concerned witha view to reaching a peaceful and lasting settlement ofthe crisis in Mali.The roles played by the General Assembly andthe Security Council are essential for the preservationand building of peace throughout the world and forthe realization of the principles and purposes of theUnited Nations Charter in the areas of internationalcooperation and development. Moreover  the missionsof those two principal and complementary organs arebased on legitimacy  contrary to the deadlock in thereform process that began years ago. We must thereforedo everything possible to ensure that the GeneralAssembly  the most representative organ of the UnitedNations  reclaims all its competence in that context.The working methods and membership of the SecurityCouncil must be revised to ensure its democratization interms of new permanent and non-permanent membersfrom the developing world  in particular from Africa the cradle of civilization.Algeria is proud to celebrate this year the fiftiethanniversary of its independence and of its membershipof the United Nations. Faithful to its principles Algeria has made a wise contribution to the completedecolonization of Africa. Today it enjoys peace withits neighbours with a view to completing the processof regional integration. Algeria would like to becomea member of the Human Rights Council  for whichit is a candidate for the period 2014-2016  in order tocontinue defending the values on which its history andits determination to overcome adversity is based.Everyone knows that the road of human rightsis littered with many pitfalls and obstacles  such asauthoritarianism  xenophobia  poverty  discriminationand unilateral economic sanctions. In that regard  theembargo on Cuba  which has lasted for more than half acentury and has created deprivation  is both unfair andanachronistic.Furthermore  attacks on Islam and Muslims area violation of human rights and a threat to peacefulcoexistence among peoples. We should all fight againstthe phenomenon of Islamophobia  which is based on axenophobic ideology that erroneously likens Islam toterrorism. That phenomenon must be fought. In thatcontext  the tragic events engendered by the infamousvideo concerning Islam and its Prophet are reprehensiblein many respects. Similary  Algeria condemns acts of violence perpetrated against diplomatic officers andmissions  which are vehicles for friendly relationsand cooperation among peoples. Algeria proposes aninitiative under the auspices of the United Nations toidentify the ways and means to organize a responsethat puts an end to such hateful events  which threateninternational peace and security. In that regard  wecannot forget that the appropriate and responsible useof freedom of expression should also endow our worldwith a more human and brotherly face through thepromotion of dialogue among religions and cultures.At the sixty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly  Algeria would like to welcome the Stateof Palestine as a new Member of the United Nationsfamily  recognized within its 1967 borders  withAl-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. We believe that thetime has come for Palestine to be fully represented atthe centre of this irreplaceable international forum  theUnited Nations. Recognition of the legitimate rightsof the Palestinian people to sovereignty and self-determination is an inalienable right and a necessaryprecondition for a just and lasting peace in the MiddleEast  which is currently being prevented by the Israelipolicy of occupation.In addition  the creation of a zone free of weaponsof mass destruction in the Middle East is an importantconfidence-building measure. In that regard  we supportthe efforts of the Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs of Finland  Jaakko Laajava  as facilitator forthe conference on the establishment of a Middle Eastzone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons ofmass destruction  to be held before the end of this yearin Helsinki.Algeria is committed to a global and ambitiousagreement to protect the environment and promotesustainable development. In that regard  we are gratefulto the Group of 77 and China  which we have the honourto preside over this year  for its constant support andcooperation  which has made it possible to achieve theresults of the United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment  the strengthening of the NairobiWork Programme and the preparations for the nextconferences on climate change and biodiversity. Algeriaurges Member States to shoulder their responsibilitiesin implementing the commitments entered into underthe concept of common but differentiated responsibility that is  namely  the financing of the transfer of know-how  technology and capacity-building in the area ofsustainable development. The President of the Republic  Mr. AbdelazizBoutef lika  has given new impetus to the programme ofreforms aimed at strengthening the democratic process the rule of law and the advancement of women. Thelegislative elections of 10 May 2012 yielded a significantincrease in women’s representation  with 146 womenMembers of Parliament  representing one third of theLower Chamber.Our country has made tangible progress in thepolitical  economic and social areas  and we continueour efforts to establish and consolidate our democraticfreedoms based on the principle of equal opportunityembodied in our Constitution. Those steps have enabledour country to achieve in general the MillenniumDevelopment Goals prior to 2015. That led to Algeriabeing chosen as one of the 50 countries selected by theUnited Nations for consultations on the MillenniumDevelopment Goals and the post-2015 developmentagenda.In conclusion  I thank members for their attentionand wish them every success in the work of our session."
"51",2115,"ECU",67,2012,"﻿Mr. President  I would like to extend to you thecongratulations of the Government of Ecuador on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly atits sixty-seventh session  for which we will providewhatever support you need to help achieve theinternational agenda’s commitments  especially thosethat have to do with revitalization of the Assembly.We are participating in this important forum withthe clear purpose of sharing our ideas and proposals forthe international system that governs us. We are wellaware that the United Nations system was conceivedin the middle of the last century and that its structureis based on  among other things  the principles of humanism  multilateralism and the equality of Statesbefore the law. Since then  the great majority ofcountries have fought to see those principles compliedwith  but there have also been countries whose powerhas wrongfully enabled them to fail to live up to theprinciples and to their obligations within the system.The world has changed substantially since theroad map for the United Nations was designed  and itsfunctions must adapt to the new demands of internationalrelations  characterized by exchanges of informationand communications and by interdependent economies.We believe the time has come to end the illegitimatepolitical exploitation of United Nations bodies bycertain Powers  which continue to exert political andeconomic pressure and even to intervene militarilyin sovereign States whose Governments criticize theinternational status quo or focus on different ideologiesfrom those promoted by some Powers  or whose publicpolicies are opposed to the economic interests of largetransnational companies. Such pressure delegitimizesthe system and distorts multilateralism itself.In the five years of President Rafael Correa’sGovernment  Ecuador has regained sovereignty indecision-making on its internal and internationalpolicies  pursuing decisions that promote a horizontalrelationship between countries with the same rights andobligations. In those five years Ecuador has supportedpeace. That is why we have expressed our concernabout the terrible consequences for human beings thatresult from military interventions conducted by thePowers  and why we are calling loudly for dialogueand for respect for human rights and the people’s self-determination in all countries in conflict. We havehad enough of geopolitical visions that are imposed byforce  destroying human rights. In that regard  Ecuadorwelcomes with great hope and enthusiasm the dialogueprocess in the sister Republic of Colombia  which isthe bravest step that the Government of that fraternalcountry could have taken.Today the world is experiencing constant changesin the distribution of power. New regional Powers haveemerged in the past 20 years and have begun to playa decisive role in international politics and security.Russia  China  India  Brazil  Mexico  South Africa Argentina  Indonesia  Venezuela and the developingworld  in general  are now the drivers of the globaleconomy. It is therefore a political imperative thatmultilateralism be strengthened and promoted withregard to respect and equality among States. It is important to point out that Latin Americancountries committed to multilateralism  in responseto unilateral actions that undermine internationalstability  have established regional institutions  suchas the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of OurAmerica — Peoples’ Trade Agreement (ALBA)  theUnion of South American Nations (UNASUR) and theCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States.Such bodies are restoring the principle of universalrepresentation in global governance and endowing it withnew characteristics so as to adjust it to today’s politicaland social reality. However  while such countries andorganizations seek to keep the institution of inter-Statework alive  the continuing unilateral actions of certainPowers without consultation jeopardize the ability ofmultilateral bodies to provide legitimate and validresponses to international needs and problems.In that context  Ecuador believes that theweakening of the decision-making system in the UnitedNations undermines international law. Open dialogueis therefore needed in order to effectively reform ourOrganization. We believe that it is time to begin astructural reform of the United Nations that makes itmore democratic and up to date and that prevents thepolitical and illegal use of its bodies. The system willbe truly democratic  as it claims to be  when everyoneaccepts that each country has a vote and that themajority decides in a democratic  free and sovereignway  without a small group of States that represents2.5 per cent of the Organization’s membership beingable to veto the remaining 97.5 per cent.We must of course restore the fundamental principlesof the United Nations  namely  the legal equality ofStates  international social justice  unconditionalrespect for international law  the protection and defenceof all human rights  cooperation and the promotionof the mutual interests of nations  respect for thesovereignty of States  the free self-determination ofpeoples  non-intervention in the internal affairs ofother States  the elimination of wars of aggression andthe peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue without recourse to the threat or  worse still  the use offorce. But  above all  we must restore the principle ofcollective action. As a result  we must give it values such as democracy  universality and supranationality.In order to be effective and efficient in its workto maintain international peace and stability  the newmultilateralism should not uphold the veto power orthe existence of an exclusive club  whose members are a small group of countries that decide the system’sfuture and other measures that affect the remainingcountries. The new system would require all countries as equals  to be equally represented in decision-makingthat affected the international system. It should notallow non-compliance with international standards bysome States  but must rather demand strict adherenceto international law and full respect for internationaljudicial authority as the only way of promoting peacefulcoexistence among nations.Ecuador supports the comprehensive reform of theUnited Nations system and the democratization of theinternational decision-making bodies. We advocatea comprehensive reform of the Security Council thatincludes decisions on membership categories  the vetoissue  regional representation  the size of an expandedSecurity Council and its working methods  and itsrelationship with the General Assembly — in otherwords  a comprehensive change in its compositionand operation. The idea is to make the Councilrepresentative  democratic and effective to enablethe international community to have an appropriatecollective security system. We believe that we mustwork on that proposal  study it  discuss it and decideon it together.Our country also calls for a comprehensiverevitalization of the General Assembly. We proposethat its role as the main depositary of global sovereigntybe fully recognized within the United Nations systemsince it is only there that all members are represented.The General Assembly should therefore have theability to discuss and take binding decisions on allsignificant issues on the international agenda  includinginternational peace and security.An example of the imbalance and lack of democracyof the current United Nations system that clearly reflectsthe urgent need for its reform is the situation in whichthe abhorrent blockade on the sisterly Republic of Cubacontinues because an economic and military Power isable to impose its will and political view despite thecontrary decision of 186 countries. Then again  theUnited States cannot continue to include Cuba on itsspurious list of countries that sponsor terrorism simplybecause of an ideological unwillingness to accept thatthe island has survived its forced isolation. Arbitrarinesshas played a great part in that issue.Cuba has declared that its territory has never beenused nor ever will be used to organize  finance orcarry out terrorist acts against any country  including the United States. Similarly  the prominent formerUnited States President  Jimmy Carter  has stated thatthe role of Havana as a guarantor in the peace talksbetween the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias deColombia and the Colombian Government refutes anyargument about the need for Cuba to remain on thatlist. The former President  whom we consider a friendof the Latin American cause  said that a more sinceredialogue could take place between the two countries ifthe United States were to remove Cuba from its list ofState sponsors of terrorism. We share and support thatview.Consistent with Ecuador’s recognition of thePalestinian State within the 1967 borders and withEast Jerusalem as its capital  my country supportsthe inclusion of Palestine as a full Member of theOrganization. Likewise  Ecuador reiterates its supportfor the historic rights of the Argentine Republic overthe Malvinas Islands. The specific and anachronisticsituation of those Islands should pave the way forrenewed direct negotiations with the United Kingdom as called for by Argentina. That appeal has beenreiterated in several resolutions of the relevant UnitedNations bodies.For Ecuador  it is essential that disputes  includingthose related to borders  be resolved peacefully.Ecuador has successfully achieved that.Ecuador has also worked to strengthen thefundamental institutions of international law  such asthe inviolability of diplomatic missions  as providedfor in the 1961 Vienna Convention on DiplomaticRelations. I wish to recall that  a few weeks ago  theGovernment of Ecuador had an unexpected diplomaticdispute with the Government of the United Kingdomon exactly that issue. In response  Ecuador advocatedthat various multilateral forums adopt resolutionsaffirming that principle of international law. We mustsay with deep gratitude that Ecuador received theresolute support of the Governments of States membersof UNASUR  ALBA and the Organization of AmericanStates and of other Governments  such as that ofRussia  condemning any attempt at forced entry into orviolation of diplomatic premises.The Government of Ecuador accordinglycondemned the terrible events of 11 September  whenthe United States diplomatic mission and consulate inCairo and Benghazi were attacked by armed groupswith a tragic loss of life  including that of the United States Ambassador to Libya  Christopher Stevens.Ecuador stands in solidarity with the people of theUnited States and reaffirms its condemnation of thoseviolent acts against United States personnel in Libyaand Egypt. Once again  we declare our respect for theinviolability of the premises of diplomatic missions.My country believes that it is essential forinternational organizations to support and promote theobservance and development of all human rights. Thatshould be their ultimate objective  not just a politicallycorrect way to make a discussion attractive or to justifyimplementing a geopolitical outlook on differentcultural realities. Human rights are a principle that islived every day and that is constantly developed andupheld. It is a principle including all of humankindwith no exception  no discrimination  no categories andno prioritization. The principle admits no reservationsor double standards. It is either completely defendedand we submit to it  or it is rejected. But conditioned partial compliance is not admissible. We are  of course speaking of the progressive development of internationaland national instruments governing human rights andthe legal international bodies that ensure compliancewith those instruments.To write on paper that all men and women aroundthe world are equal without applying it in practice isnothing but hypocrisy. Human rights  as a whole  canbe summarized in the right to life. The question is:how many thousands of human beings must continueto be sacrificed in the name of the abstract principlewithout understanding  without really feeling what theconcept is. When will humanity ask  for example  ifthe defence of democracy in its Western version or theaccumulation of transnational capital and the expansionof organized crime constitute sufficient justificationfor the sacrifice of tens of thousands of human lives orfor the destruction of the planet.In order to guarantee the rights of human beings deepen their social and economic development  andachieve the harmony of nature while being fullyresponsible towards all generations  Ecuador haschanged some traditional policies since the adoptionof the new Ecuadorian Constitution in 2008. Weunderstand that we must overcome the archaic conceptthat the rule of law consists of laws carved in stonethat were approved at some time in history but areobsolete and out of date today. The law cannot beabstract  because in essence it is a living thing neededto give security to human beings  and it cannot be divorced from reality. That is why we also advocatethat the standards that are part of international legalcoexistence should be discussed and updated  becausetheir forced application leads to chaos and weakens therule of international law.From that point of view  our Constitution callson us to live in a constitutional State of rights andguarantees. The fundamental objective is what is calledin the Quechua language sumak kawsay  or “the rightto a good life” of people and nature  knowing how tolive fully  without any discrimination. It is based ondignity  solidarity  equality and the complementarityof people  cultures  nationalities  people’s social groupsand countries in general.It is the commitment to being human that calls onus to encourage tolerance  respect and full support foreverybody  especially those afflicted with disabilities.Ecuador has been nationally recognized on that front because  in the last five years  it has maintainedthe highest ratings for effectiveness in programmesupport and reintegration into daily life of our brothersand sisters with disabilities. The strength of ourVice-President Lenín Moreno Garcés in his battleagainst discrimination against people with disabilitieshas made it possible for him to be globally recognized.Admiration of his programmes has led to his beingnominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.Since human beings are at the centre of thecovenant of the popular revolution  we have given fullsupport to those who suffer persecution because oftheir political ideas and sexual preferences. My countryhas the largest number of refugees in Latin Americaand one of the largest numbers in the entire Westernhemisphere. Almost 60 000 people living in Ecuadorare refugees. We also have around 500 000 economicmigrants. That has led to recognition and expressionsof gratitude by United Nations bodies. Because peoplein the situation of being refugees and asylum-seekershave been incorporated into Ecuadorian society  theyreceive political and social protection as well as aneconomic subsidy from the Ecuadorian State.Social groups that traditionally were discriminatedagainst in Ecuador for ethnic or cultural reasons havealso seen a substantial improvement in their situation.That is shown by the indicators for education  healthand housing. But above all  President Rafael Correa hasstressed that action to benefit the poorest is the mainobjective of State policy. The incorporation of socialgroups into the active life of the country has taken place  with full respect for their ancestral culture andtheir traditions  customs  beliefs and political views.We are also one of the countries that hasstrengthened gender equality  the development of therights of women  and the application of affirmativeaction measures that cut across public policies in allthe functions of our Government. However  thosesuccessful changes have led to a reaction from sectorsof traditional power  both inside and outside Ecuador.Just yesterday  we noted the second anniversary of anattempted coup d’état and assassination. But thingshave changed. The empowerment of citizens fullyidentified with the Government has made it possible toovercome this year’s crisis as well as an internationalmedia campaign of criticism and misinformation on theactivities and achievements of our country.I would like to highlight from this rostrum thatEcuador is the first country in the world to haverecognized the rights of nature in its Constitution.Nature stops being a passive object and becomes anactive subject. In that connection  the Constitutionof Ecuador states that Mother Earth  or Pachamama where life reproduces and flourishes  has a right tofull respect for its existence and the maintenance andregeneration of its vital cycles  structure  functions anddevelopmental processes. By recognizing those rights we close the circle of the complementary relationshipwith the rights of human beings. The Constitutionof Ecuador has led to major progress in legal andenvironmental areas. It overcomes the human-centredvision of law prevailing in the world. We aspire toopen a discussion in this forum aimed at preparing auniversal declaration on the rights of nature.In the environment  Ecuador is one of the leadingpromoters at the international level of environmentalsustainability policies. We have developed newinitiatives in the fight against climate change  suchas the “net avoided emissions” mechanism. That hasmade the Yasuní-ITT initiative an innovative sovereigndecision. We have also planned to protect naturalresources and the cultures of several ethnic groups inthe Amazon region and have accepted the responsibilityto reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.In that context  Ecuador has been a leader in theregional debate on a model for domestic sustainabledevelopment. At the same time  together with theregional Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas bloc  wehave played a critical role within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  and wehave noted the scant political will  especially in thecountries in the North  to let themselves be subject tolegally binding commitments to reduce greenhouse-gasemissions. Ecuador has proposed  on the internationallevel  an alternative sustainable participatorydevelopment model.When it comes to promoting human rights and thefreedom of expression  the Government of Ecuadorhas been faithful to its tradition  which is to protectthose who seek refuge in its territory or its diplomaticmissions because they are victims of politicalpersecution  and has granted diplomatic asylum to theAustralian citizen Julian Assange in response to hisrequest to the President of the Republic of Ecuador andafter an exhaustive judicial assessment. That has been aunique opportunity for the world community to debatethe process of asylum in that context and to observethe political  legal and human repercussions of itsapplication within the framework of the strict respectfor international law. Ecuador is proud of having takena sovereign decision in a legal procedure that protectshuman beings anywhere in the world.Our country promotes the reform of the multilateralUnited Nations system through example and not justin words. We have also undertaken an unprecedentedinstitutional reform of our own. The results have beenhighly satisfactory  with outstanding levels of growthand poverty reduction. I want to mention just a fewfigures  so that members can have a clear idea of ourachievements. Under the Government of the Citizens’Revolution  the poverty rate has been reduced from36.7 per cent to 25.3 per cent  a reduction of more than11 per cent. Extreme poverty  that is  abject poverty has come down from 16.5 per cent to 9.4 per cent. Wehave reduced the Gini coefficient from 0.55 per centto 0.47 per cent. For the first time in our two centuriesas a republic  the extreme poverty rate for Ecuador’spopulation is below 10 per cent. An annual educationbudget of $858 million has now grown by a factor of5.1  to $4.366 billion. Payment of external debt is notmore than 4.2 per cent of gross domestic product  whileour spending on public social services stands at 11 percent of gross domestic product.Every international agency that has reviewedour macroeconomic numbers and social spendingagree that the changes in our country are drasticallyimproving the lives of our citizens. We have not settledfor mere words  but  rather  our country’s success story is written in concrete  practical actions as part of anational development plan  overseen and managed bythe President of the Republic himself  that is bringingrapid change to our country — and without the usualsocial ills that result from the prescriptions of theinternational financial institutions. On the contrary ours is a participatory model founded in solidarity.We have not neglected foreign direct investment which we believe essential to our development strategy so long as it complements our national initiatives including our national development plan. I state withpride that the Constitution of the Republic of Ecuadoris the first in the world to define legal security as ahuman right in itself  respect for which and the directapplication of which are guaranteed by judicial administrative and constitutional authorities.Nevertheless  we believe that progress for Ecuadoror for any other country is at risk if the internationalsystem  either because of general indifference orbecause of interests that run contrary to global well-being  feeds a new era of anarchy in which unilateralactions or geopolitical conflicts predominate. For thatreason  we would like to take this opportunity to reiteratethe need to rehabilitate and revitalize multilateralism to upgrade international mechanisms and strengtheninternational law  so as to safeguard international peaceand security and a healthy environment  which are thenecessary ingredients for worldwide development andprosperity. We want to use this platform to urge theinternational community and the representatives of allthe countries of the world to join in demonstrating theresolve  bravery and political will to drive the creationof a new international order — new in being more just more open  more participatory and more democratic."
"52",2160,"EGY",67,2012,"﻿It gives megreat pleasure to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić and hisfriendly country on his assumption of the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its current session. I wish himevery success in his task.I would like to express my sincere appreciationto the former President of the General Assembly Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  and the brotherlyState of Qatar for their outstanding stewardship of theprevious session. I would also like to pay tribute to theSecretary-General for striving tirelessly to preserve therole of the Organization and enhance its effectiveness.I assure him of Egypt’s support in all efforts extendedfor that purpose.My presence here today to address the GeneralAssembly has multiple significance. I am the firstEgyptian civilian President elected democraticallyand freely  following a great peaceful revolutionhailed by the entire world. The revolution enjoyedgenuine legitimacy thanks to the efforts and will ofall Egyptians  inside and outside of Egypt  and by thegrace of God. Today  every Egyptian shares a senseof self-confidence that allows each of them to claim ahigher moral and cultural ground.We have taken several effective steps on the roadtowards establishing the modern State aspired to byall Egyptians — one that is in tune with the present based on the rule of law  democracy and respect forhuman rights  a constitutional State that will notcompromise the values firmly embedded in the souls ofall Egyptians  a State that seeks justice  truth  freedom dignity and social justice.The Egyptian revolution that was founded on thelegitimacy that I represent before the Assembly todaywas not the product of a f leeting moment  or a briefuprising. Nor was it the product of the winds of changeof a certain spring or autumn. Rather  that revolution and all the ones preceding it and following it in theregion  were triggered by the long-term struggle ofindigenous national movements seeking a life ofpride and dignity for all citizens. It therefore reflectsthe wisdom of history and is a clear warning to thoseattempting to put their interests before those of theirpeoples.We are therefore striving to realize a new visionof Egypt that will serve as a programme of actionfor the world and that will guide our cooperationwith the international community in a spirit ofequality and mutual respect through the promotionof non-intervention in the affairs of States and theimplementation of international principles  agreementsand instruments. Today we reiterate our commitment particularly to the Charter of the United Nations  whichEgypt took part in drafting.From that perspective  we continue efforts toresolve problems and address their root causes  withoutrelinquishing the principles of law or well-establishedvalues that  if compromised  could lead to graveinternational consequences if the rational and sincereamong us choose not to pay heed.The first issue that the global community mustexert all efforts to resolve  on the basis of justiceand dignity  is the Palestinian cause. Many decadeshave passed since the Palestinian people expressedtheir desire to regain their full rights and build theirindependent State  with Jerusalem as its capital. Despitethe continued struggle of the people via all legitimatemeans to attain their rights  and despite the acceptanceby their representatives of the resolutions adopted bythe international community as a basis for resolvingproblems  this issue of international legitimacy has todate  unfortunately  remained without a resolution toachieve the hopes and aspirations of the Palestinianpeople. And the resolutions agreed on the issue remainfar from implementation.The fruits of dignity and freedom must not remainout of reach of the brotherly Palestinian people. It isshameful that the free world has accepted  withoutregard to the justifications provided  the continueddenial  by a member of the international community  of the rights of a nation that  for decades  has longedfor independence. It is also disgraceful that settlementactivities have continued in the Palestinian territories along with the delay in implementing decisions ofinternational legitimacy.Proceeding from the perspective of defendingtruth  freedom and dignity  and from my duty tosupport our Palestinian brothers and sisters  I placethe international community face to face with itsobligatory responsibilities requiring the achievementof a just and comprehensive peace  an end to all formsof occupation of Arab land and the implementation ofrelevant international resolutions. I call for immediateand significant measures to put an end to occupation settlement activities and any alteration to the identityof occupied Jerusalem.I call for peace that will establish a sovereignPalestinian State and achieve the security and stabilitylong sought by the peoples of the region. On the samebasis  I assure the Assembly of Egypt’s full support ofany course of action that Palestine decides to follow inthe United Nations.I call upon all Member States  just as they havesupported the revolutions of the Arab peoples  toextend their support to the Palestinians and theirendeavour to recover the full and legitimate rights of apeople struggling to regain its freedom and establish anindependent State of Palestine  based on the inalienablerights of the Palestinians.We are determined to work to pursue all efforts ofthe Palestinian people  in support of them and side byside until they freely regain all rights for all segmentsand communities of the population.From this rostrum and at this eminent gathering I must address the issue that weighs heavily upon allof us  namely  the bloodshed and the human tragedy inSyria. The bloodshed must be halted immediately. Thatis our first concern. The blood being shed in the land ofbeloved Syria is far too valuable to continue to lose dayand night. The brotherly Syrian people  who are dearto the hearts of every Egyptian  deserve to hope for afuture of freedom and dignity. That is the essence ofthe initiative that I proposed in the Holy City of Meccaduring the recent month of Ramadan  and which I havereiterated on subsequent occasions. It aims to avoid theworst; to check the continued suffering of the Syrianpeople and the devolvement of the conflict into a fullscale civil war — God forbid — with concomitant negative effects extending beyond Syria and itsimmediate neighbours.Egypt  along with the three other countries involvedin our initiative  has held meetings that manifestedmany areas of commonalities. We will continue to workto put an end to the suffering of the Syrian people andprovide them with an opportunity to choose freely theregime that best represents them.After the current regime comes to an end — theregime that is killing its own people day and night — theSyrian people will choose  by their own free will a regime that represents them and that places Syriain its proper position among democratic countriescontributing to the common march of the Arab peoplebased on its solid  legitimate  regional and internationalrole.I would like to emphasize here that the initiative isopen to all. It is not just the purview of its four startingparties  but is open to all who wish to positivelycontribute to resolving the Syrian crisis and suffering that we are all responsible for.All of us  the world over  must actively endeavourto put an end to the tragedy. It is the tragedy of the age and our duty is to end it.Egypt is committed to continuing its sincere effortsto put an end to the catastrophe in Syria under an Arab regional and international framework that preservesthe unity of that brotherly State. It would involve allfactions of the Syrian people without ethnic  religious orgender discrimination and would spare Syria the dangerof foreign military intervention  which we oppose.Egypt is also committed to supporting the mission ofMr. Lakhdar Brahimi  Joint Special Representative ofthe United Nations and the League of Arab States forSyria  and to continuing the current efforts aimed atunifying the Syrian opposition and encouraging it topropose a comprehensive unified vision of an organizeddemocratic transfer of power by measures that preservethe rights of all constituencies in Syria  and maintaintheir essential positions in the new Syria — like thenew Egypt.I cannot fail to reiterate Egypt’s commitment toworking with the other Arab countries to ensure that theArab nation reclaims its rightful position in the world.That is an integral component of Egypt’s vision ofnational security and of the larger homeland extendingfrom the Arab Gulf to the Atlantic Ocean — an area that thrives with opportunities for cooperation andconstructive engagement with the entire world.Egypt also believes that the extremely valuablecontribution of the Arab nation within the wider Islamicsphere is of vital necessity in promoting joint actionwithin the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).Egypt will make every effort to ensure that the nextOIC conference  to be held early next year in Egypt will strengthen mutual understanding between Islamiccountries and the rest of the world and set in motionthe principles of the dialogue among civilizations  byeliminating the causes of misunderstandings used byfanatics on both sides to prove  wrongly  that differencesamong people are great and to achieve political goalscompletely unrelated to the noble ideals of religions human values or ethics.Today more than ever  our brothers and sisters inthe Sudan need the Assembly’s support. The Sudanis seeking to achieve stability and developmentand is working to build sound and ideal relationswith South Sudan. I believe that the nascent State together with the Sudan  is ready to become a centreof cooperation between the Arab world and Africancountries. The Sudan has made great sacrifices in itsquest for peace and stability. It has committed itselfto the implementation of the Comprehensive PeaceAgreement. It was also the first country to recognizethe nascent State of South Sudan. But let me be frank:it has not received the support it deserves. It is now hightime for international efforts to rally in support of theSudan and to work on settling differences between theSudan and its neighbour to the south in order to resolveall outstanding issues.An early success of the brotherly Somali peopleduring the difficult transitional phase was to elect HisExcellency Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as President which is a positive step towards unity and stability aftera very difficult period. I call upon the United Nationsto continue to support the Somali Government’s effortsto fend off those seeking to hinder its efforts to achievestability  reconstruct State institutions and realize theaspirations of the Somali people for a better future.The principles of justice and right are linkedto achieving security and stability in the world particularly in the Middle East. Over many long years some have wrongfully sought to maintain stabilitythrough oppression and tyranny. Some of us have  alas applauded their bad deeds. But now that the peoples of the region have regained their freedom  they willneither tolerate  nor permit  being deprived of theirrights  by either their own leaders or outside forces.The will of the people  especially in our region no longer accepts the continued non-accession ofany country to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) and the non-application of thesafeguards regime to that country’s nuclear facilities especially if such action is coupled with irresponsiblepolicies or arbitrary threats. In that regard  theinternational community’s acceptance of the principleof pre-emption or attempts to legitimize it represents aserious matter that must be firmly confronted to avoidany tendency to promote the law of the jungle.Cognizant of the danger that the status quorepresents to the security of our important region  withits natural resources and trade corridors  Egypt stressesthe necessity of mobilizing international efforts toconvene the special conference on declaring the MiddleEast a nuclear-weapon-free zone that is also free ofother weapons of mass destruction  before the end ofthe current year  with the participation of all concernedparties  without exception.I should like to say very clearly that the onlysolution is to eliminate all nuclear weapons and all otherweapons of mass destruction. There is no alternative.At the same time  we also emphasize the right of allcountries of the region and of the world  includingEgypt  of course  to the peaceful use of nuclear energywithin the framework of the NPT  with a commitmentto honour their obligations in that respect and providethe necessary guarantees to the countries of the region so as to avoid any doubt surrounding their peacefulnuclear programmes.In our view  the concepts of justice  truth anddignity form the basis of the framework for governinginternational relations.A review of international relations wouldundoubtedly reveal the extent of the injustice thathas been inf licted upon the African continent. I donot think it necessary to enumerate all the previouspledges that have been made in the Hall to boostdevelopment and economic growth in Africa throughaid and investment. The world has a responsibility tosupport Africa’s efforts beyond mere promises andgood intentions; it must provide the assistance neededfor African countries to recover the treasures that werestolen from them over successive eras  the last of which being the period when some thought that supportingunjust regimes would help to achieve a false stabilitythat protected their interests  while those regimesmerely spread corruption and allowed for wealth to besmuggled outside their countries.I am aware that the desired goals can only beachieved through the active participation of the peoplesof the continent and their assumption of their ownresponsibilities. That is something that we as Africansare ready and willing to undertake in our quest for abetter future for our countries. Today  we as Africanshave to create for our continent a new set of ambitiousgoals that would ensure that we are on the right tracktowards sustainable development  the fulfilment of ouraspirations for a better future and the real participationof Africa in the international order. I assure theAssembly that Egypt will continue to support itsbrothers and sisters in Africa  and that it is ready tocooperate with any stakeholder or party in or outsidethe continent to raise living standards in Africa throughthe exchange of expertise and successful practices.As we contemplate the current international order we feel that there is a need to work diligently to repairit  based on principles that would renew its legitimacyand preserve its credibility. That is a legitimate demandof peoples and nations as they seek to participatein shaping a new world and a better future for theirchildren.Revitalizing the role of the General Assemblyas a democratic forum that expresses the will of theinternational community and reforming the structureof a Security Council  which still reflects a bygoneera  must remain our highest priorities and must beundertaken with due seriousness.I would like to emphasize the need for the UnitedNations to give special attention to women’s issuesand youth issues. During the Non-Aligned Movementsummit in Tehran  I proposed a new initiative to establisha United Nations body dedicated solely to youth issues giving particular attention to education  training employment and improving youth participation inpolitical life. The aim is to build the capacity of futuregenerations to achieve their aspirations.Egypt would like to stress that the internationalsystem will not be fixed as long as we have doublestandards. We expect from others  as others expect fromus  respect for our cultural specificities and religiouspoints of reference. The world beyond our region should not seek to impose on us concepts or culturesthat are unacceptable to us  nor should they politicizecertain issues and use them as a pretext to intervene inour affairs.What Muslims — and migrant Muslims — areexperiencing in a number of regions worldwide interms of discrimination  basic human rights violationsand vicious campaigns against what they hold sacred  isunacceptable. The behaviour of some individuals in thatregard is absolutely unacceptable. We reject the insultsheaped upon the Prophet of Islam  Muhammad — peacebe upon him — as unacceptable. We oppose those whohurl such insults. We will not allow anyone to insult theProphet in word or in deed. It runs counter to the mostbasic principles of the Charter of the United Nations.Unfortunately  such practices have acquired a nametoday — Islamophobia.We all have to work together. We must join handsin confronting regressive ideas that hinder cooperationamong us. We must move together to confrontextremism  discrimination and incitement to hatredof others on the basis of religion or race. The GeneralAssembly and the Security Council have the primaryresponsibility for addressing a phenomenon that isstarting to have clear implications for internationalpeace and security.The obscenities that I have referred to  which arepart of a recent organized campaign against Islamicsanctities  are unacceptable and require that we take afirm stand. We have a responsibility at this internationalforum to look into how we can protect the world frominstability and insecurity.Egypt respects freedom of expression — a freedomof expression that is not used to incite hatred againstanyone and that is not directed towards a specificreligion or culture. We support a freedom of expressionthat addresses extremism and violence and does notdeepen ignorance or disregard others. As we have saidbefore  we firmly oppose the use of violence as a meansof expressing objection to obscenity and indecency.Before I conclude  I must say that the severityand recurrence of financial and economic crises mustlead us to a review of the international economicdecision-making processes that affect the fate ofpeoples who have not participated directly in thoseprocesses but yet are unfortunately the first to bear theirnegative impacts on growth  trade  the environmentand the social fabric of society  as a result of unfair trade rules and practices and conditionalities imposedon the transfer of technology and access to necessaryfinancing for development. We urgently need a newpeople-centred form of global economic governance thataims at consolidating cooperation between developmentpartners on the basis of mutual benefit and interests.I have laid out our vision  which is shared by theEgyptian people. I have also attempted to brief ly outlineEgypt’s views on the main issues  which is to say thevision of Egyptian youth  children  women and men Muslim and non-Muslim  on all important questions inthe Middle East  Africa and the rest of the world. Fromthat perspective  I am sure that the United Nations iscapable of assuming its intended role of effectivelyaddressing all global and regional issues and challengesthrough dialogue  understanding and joint cooperation in accordance with the principles of international law.Post-revolutionary Egypt will spare no effort todeal sincerely with all Members of the Organization.We will always remain in the forefront of internationalendeavours aimed at achieving freedom  justice  socialjustice and dignity for all peoples  as well as securityand stability for all our countries.I look forward with great optimism  and I seethe peace that we call for prevailing all over theworld — a peace based on justice and conferring onall their undiminished rights  a peace that does notdiscriminate between people for any reason. That peacewill not come about until we all cooperate  until werealize that we are all equal and share many aspirationsand ambitions. That is the peace whose message I bringto to the Assembly — a peace of right and justice stability and development  interdependence of interestsand benefits  love and mutual respect. I do not believethat achieving this will raise difficulties for any of usif we extend the hand of cooperation  sincere intentionand righteous work. God is our witness. We are allhopeful that we will see a better future for the world."
"53",2184,"ERI",67,2012,"﻿Let me start by extending mysincere congratulations to the President of the GeneralAssembly and his country  Serbia  upon his election to preside over the sixty-seventh session. I am confidentthat  with his extensive experience and diplomatic skill he will lead this session of the General Assembly toa successful conclusion. I pledge the support of theEritrean delegation for his noble efforts for the commongood.I wish to pay profound tribute to the outgoingPresident  Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  for hiscommendable work at the sixty-sixth session of theGeneral Assembly. He indeed served us well. I wouldalso like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon forhis leadership and his report (A/67/2) on the work ofour United Nations at the outset of this general debate.Almost seven decades have elapsed since theestablishment of the United Nations  and  undoubtedly the world has seen much political  economic  socialand technological progress. However  it is clear thatthe United Nations has not succeeded in its paramountpurpose of saving humankind from the scourge ofwar. In the past 67 years  there has hardly been one inwhich no war raged somewhere in the world. What isparticularly significant is the fact that in most of thesewars  the major Powers were the main architects andactors — those same Powers which  by virtue of theirposition in the Security Council  should have shoulderedthe greatest responsibility in the maintenance of peaceand stability.On another front  and again despite the progressmade  in the twenty-first century  hundreds ofmillions of people in the developing world  as well asin developed countries  continue to suffer from thescourge of poverty  easily preventable diseases andavoidable premature deaths.In addition to the twin scourges of war andpoverty  our world now faces an environmental threatthat puts human livelihoods and survival at risk. It istherefore disconcerting that the current global political economic and security architecture is inadequate toaddress the challenges that we all face. The UnitedNations system  as has been repeatedly pointed out is indeed outdated. The General Assembly has beenemasculated. The Security Council is dominated byone powerful permanent member  and is increasinglybecoming paralysed. Change is being resisted bythose who believe they have benefited from the old anachronistic order. Respect for the sovereign equalityand territorial integrity of nations and non-interferencein their internal affairs — which constitute thepillars of international law and the Charter of the United Nations — are being eroded and wilfullyf louted. The noble aims of protecting human rightsand civilian lives are being selectively and cynicallyemployed to justify military aggression  externalintervention and imposition of sanctions — collectiveas well as unilateral — to destabilize nations  changeGovernments and gain economic advantages.This summary assessment  Eritrea believes  isshared by the majority of States Members of the UnitedNations. It is indeed the position of Africa  of mostdeveloping countries  the Non-Aligned Movement  theemerging Powers and many in the developed world.What this emerging consensus now needs is a concertedand coordinated effort to effect real change  includingin the United Nations system  that would lead to a morepeaceful  just and equitable world.No part of the world is in need of positive changemore than the African continent  which remainsmarginalized and almost voiceless. And yet Africa isa continent of massive potential  and there are alreadyunmistakable  if tentative  signs of its awakening. Anumber of African countries are taking serious stepsin the economic  political and social arenas and therevitalization of the African Union proceeds apace.We hope that this African initiative  which will have asalutary effect on the world economy and internationalgovernance  will be supported by a more conduciveinternational environment and by the United Nations.Eritrea is convinced that our subregion  the Hornof Africa  will overcome its current difficulties andmake a substantial contribution to the re-emergenceof a dynamic and prosperous Africa. Despite thedifficulties it has faced  it has made remarkable progressin providing and caring for its people and rebuildingits economy  and has embarked on modernizing itsinfrastructure  including developing renewable energy with the perspective of regional trade  investment andintegration. It will continue to work to ensure a life ofdignity and prosperity for its citizens  in a peaceful andcooperative region  and a more just and equitable world."

I joinothers in congratulating him on his work and wish himall the best in his new endeavours.Spain believes that the United Nations has afundamental role to play. That is why I wished toparticipate in this general debate  the first since I tookthe oath of office as President of the Government ofSpain. It is always an honour for a Head of Governmentto address the General Assembly. I do so today on behalfof a country that is committed to the internationalcommunity and to the pursuit of joint solutions to theproblems we face.The result of that commitment is our desire to serveonce again in the Security Council for the period 2015-2016. In my statement  I shall refer to the reasons for Spain’s resolve to work in the Council with an open andconstructive spirit  committed to peace and internationalsecurity  the promotion and protection of human rights and the search for sustainable development for all.In addition to the serious economic and financialsituation  the international community is facing todaymore numerous and more complicated challengesthan ever before. The Organization and its GeneralAssembly are key if we are to confront them. Year afteryear  we discuss those problems here and their possiblesolutions. For that reason  I believe that we should askourselves today if we have improved since last year.While it might seem otherwise  I believe we have.In one year  we have witnessed the unbreakablewill of the Arab citizens to consolidate democraticsystems in their countries. In Spain  we went through adifficult but successful transition to democracy. Hence we know that the road is not and will not be easy. Ourexperience can be useful for all Arab countries thatare going through transition processes. I reaffirm ourcommitment to building open  inclusive and democraticsocieties whose institutions satisfy the yearnings fordignity and for the development of its citizens. In thoseprocesses  there is no room for movements that promoteviolence  whatever its justification. Any attack oraggression against people or institutions is unacceptableand deserves our most full-throated condemnation.Last year  we also dedicated our efforts to findingsolutions to the crisis in the Horn of Africa  andespecially to the situation in Somalia. The difficultiespersist  but Somalia is advancing towards normality.Cooperation in the fight against piracy in the IndianOcean is stronger than ever  and during our recentpresidency of the Contact Group on Piracy off theCoast of Somalia  we moved forward in the search ofan international response to that criminal phenomenon.Similarly  humanitarian efforts in that region haveallowed for an improvement of the situation. Fourmonths ago  Spain and the World Food Programme(WFP) signed an agreement to locate the largest foodstorage facility in the world in the Canary Islands.The WFP facility will allow faster and more efficientresponses to food emergencies on the African continent.Afghanistan continues moving forward in thedirection of stability — a road that Spain has pursuedtogether with the Afghan people for more than adecade. In that effort  we have bequeathed resources infrastructures and  unfortunately  the life of many of our fellow citizens. My country will continue tocontribute to the development of Afghanistan and itssearch for much-needed stability and security.This year  in Rio de Janeiro  we reaffirmedour common vision in favour of an economically socially and environmentally sustainable future.Since their conception  Spain has been committed tothe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) withthe largest cooperation programme in its history valued at almost $1 billion  implemented through theSpain-United Nations Development Programme MDGAchievement Fund. Negotiations are under way to setnew goals for sustainable development and to bring theinstitutional structure in step with that commitment.Spain will maintain an active and constructive presencein the process.The fight against international impunity has alsoseen important advances this year. The InternationalCriminal Court initiated its first case against a Head ofState  demonstrating that the international communityis closer than ever to ending impunity for seriouscrimes. I would like to reiterate today the call for theuniversal ratification of the Rome Statute.I would like to make special mention of the valuableand increasing role that Latin America has playedin the development of the multilateral system. Theachievements and progress that the region has attainedin the consolidation of democracy  economic growthand regional integration are reflected in its greaterinternational presence.Latin America has shown its potential bystrengthening the multilateralism promoted by theOrganization. Spain is proud to share in that spirit atthe Ibero-American summits and will be hosting thisyear’s summit in Cádiz  Spain. That forum reflects theIbero-American community’s wager on the promise ofdialogue  equality and mutual respect  with our eyesfirmly set on the future.I believe that those steps forward  among others attest to an encouraging year  despite its difficulties. Itis proof that the multilateral system is responding to thepresent crisis and promoting respect for and the activeprotection of human rights  as well as the presence andparticipation of women in all areas regions. But  ofcourse  there are problems on which there has been littleor no progress at all or that have emerged throughoutthe present year. Those problems deserve as much if notmore of our attention in the 12 months that lie ahead. First of all  I would like to mention the crisis inSyria. A year ago  in the General Assembly  an urgentappeal was made to the Syrian regime to halt the abusesand crimes against its people. Despite the internationalcommunity’s efforts  the situation has not ceasedto deteriorate. Thousands of innocent victims  theunbearable suffering of the civilian population and theserious risk of the conflict expanding to neighbouringcountries compel us to act. Today  I reiterate the call toend all violence in Syria and urge President Al-Assadto accept his responsibility and make way for a politicalprocess that will allow a peaceful resolution to theconflict. We support the efforts of the Joint SpecialRepresentative  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  to reach thisgoal. The international community  the United Nations the League of Arab States and the European Unioncontinue to be prepared  through different mechanisms to come to Syria’s aid.In this uncertain regional scenario  Lebanon has sofar managed to keep itself on the margin of the spiral ofviolence  an achievement that has been reached in goodmeasure thanks to the contingent of United NationsInterim Force in Lebanon  in which Spain is an activeparticipant.Another year has passed without progress in theMiddle East peace process. We defend the idea thatthe solution to the conflict in the Middle East liesin the existence of two States  the Israeli State andthe Palestinian State  living in peace and security.Any delay in achieving that goal leads to growingfrustration that will affect the rest of the world. Theinternational community  and  above all  the actorsinvolved must have the courage to adopt the measuresand decisions needed to achieve that comprehensive just and durable peace that responds to the legitimateyearnings of both peoples. My Government  committedto the goal of peace  is convinced that the creation of aviable Palestinian State is a key element in the solutionof the conflict. It will bring beneficial effects for thesecurity and welfare of Israel  for the normalizationof regional relations and  finally  for the internationalcommunity as a whole. Until then  the parties mustavoid endangering the viability of a two-State solution.The situation in Mali and the entire Sahel regionis particularly serious. The humanitarian crisis hasbeen aggravated by political instability and an armedrevolt  which has deteriorated into terrorist movementsthat have caused considerable harm to the populationin northern Mali. Spain unreservedly condemns violence and supports the efforts of the United Nations the African Union  and the Economic Community ofWest African States to reach a solution to the crisis.Those efforts must count on the decisive support ofthe countries of the region  whose people also endureinsecurity caused by the situation. And above all  theprocess must be led by the people of Mali themselves who need to overcome their institutional crisis andre-establish the territorial integrity of their country.On other matters  I would like to highlight theefforts of the international community in general and ofthe E3+3 Group in particular to relaunch conversationswith Iran with the goal of eliminating all doubts raisedby the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)regarding its nuclear enrichment programme. Thoseconversations are sustained by the desire to reach apolitical and diplomatic solution and are an opportunitythat we hope all actors involved will take advantageof. We reiterate our appeal to Iran to comply withthe relevant resolutions without delay and to ratifyand observe the additional protocol of the IAEA’scomprehensive safeguards agreement.I would also like to express our support for the Six-Party Talks as a framework for finding a diplomaticsolution to the crisis raised by the nuclear programme ofthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We considerthat the country must put a stop to its nuclear activitieswith military aims in a complete and verifiable manner and it must comply with all Security Council resolutionson the matter and respect its commitments to the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.This year we have moved towards a more peaceful just and sustainable world. However  as reflected inthe cases I have just mentioned  much remains to bedone. To achieve this  Spain will continue to work withthe United Nations  for we believe that only througha concerted effort of the international community canwe find solutions. My country’s wish to serve on theSecurity Council in 2015 and 2016 responds preciselyto the conviction that in the Council Spain can continueplaying an active role in the search for joint solutionsto common problems. That conviction is supported bySpain’s accomplishments to date  by our demonstratedcommitment to multilateralism and by the initiativesled by our country in the search for internationalunderstanding and sustainable development.Spain will continue to contribute  to the best ofits ability  to peacekeeping operations by providing troops and through the United Nations operationalfield support base at Quart de Poblet  in Spain. Ourcommitment to the United Nations will remain firm as we actively participate in those initiatives that wehave been supporting in the past few years because webelieve that they are key to achieving the future wedesire.Disarmament and non-proliferation must be sharedobjectives for the entire international community. Webelieve that it is necessary to reactivate the Conferenceon Disarmament with an ambitious programme ofwork. Spain also supports renewing the GeneralAssembly mandate to proceed with the negotiationsof an arms trade treaty. We will continue to work fora solid  effective and legally binding document thatreflects the defence of human rights and internationalhumanitarian rights.As a member of the Human Rights Council  we willcontinue to defend the undeniable link between respectfor human rights and peace and security in the world.We will also continue to work towards a universalmoratorium on the death penalty.My country will continue to support negotiationswithin the United Nations of a comprehensiveconvention on international terrorism. Terrorism is avicious trait that unfortunately Spain knows very well.I would like to take a moment today to remember andpay tribute to all the victims of terrorism. In July  aHigh-Level Conference on Victims of Terrorismwas held in Madrid in the framework of the GlobalCounterterrorism Forum. There we reiterated thatvictims can plan an important role in the completedelegitimization  in both social and moral terms  ofterrorism. I wish to acknowledge the support of theSecretary-General and of the President of the GeneralAssembly in this task.We will continue to promote the goals ofUN-Women  after a first year full of work and results.In that regard  Spain  which has been the biggestdonor to this entity during its first year  maintains itscommitment to equality between men and women andto the efforts to put an end to violence against womenand girls.My country is a firm defender of dialogue andthe use of peaceful means to resolve controversies.For that reason  next Friday  together with Morocco we will present an initiative to promote mediationand to develop national and local capacities in the Mediterranean basin. The initiative will be the firstembodiment in that region of resolution 65/283 and ofthe work of the Secretary-General and the Group ofFriends of Mediation.Spain maintains its active commitment to a just enduring and mutually acceptable political solution tothe dispute in Western Sahara  a solution that providesfor the self-determination of the Saharan people inaccordance with the principles and objectives of theCharter of the United Nations. As a member of theGroup of Friends  Spain firmly supports the work of theSecretary-General  his Personal Envoy and the UnitedNations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara.Between countries that are friends and allies  asis the case between Spain and the United Kingdom a direct and sincere dialogue should make it possibleto overcome any differences. Therefore  I wouldlike to call upon the United Kingdom to renew thebilateral dialogue on the decolonization of Gibraltar inaccordance with the parameters indicated by the UnitedNations and enshrined in the Brussels Declaration of1984. We have already lost too many years.The efforts of the Member States of the UnitedNations will not be sufficient if they are not accompaniedby the necessary adaptation of the United Nations to thecurrent world. The Secretary-General has launched aprocess aimed at reforming the Organization  which mycountry is following closely. I would like to reiteratethat Spain supports his efforts  and we call upon the restof the Member States to continue their open dialogue onhis proposals  analysing them without any prejudicesand showing sufficient courage to break with the statusquo when necessary.In that regard  I should like to reiterate our supportfor the reforms of the Secretary-General in the area ofpeacekeeping operations. Likewise  Spain is a strongdriving force behind the Delivering as One initiative which is an essential undertaking aimed at modernizingthe United Nations system  improving its effectivenessand efficiency in the fight against poverty andinequality  and thereby making it possible to do morewith less. Proof of Spain’s commitment to that initiativeis the fact that my country has been the largest donorthereto  providing more than half of the total funding.Lastly  the Security Council must also adapt as quickly as possible  to the realities of the twenty-first century  which are very different from those thatexisted when it was created. In the coming months  we will continue to be open to dialogue on this issue and we hope that  under the leadership of PresidentJeremić  we will be able to find common ground amongthe different positions on the issue on which we canbuild a new Security Council that is more effective inclusive  representative and responsible to the GeneralAssembly.We are facing many challenges. Spain is stronglydetermined to contribute to those efforts so that in 12months  when we meet here again  the list of problemsbefore us is shorter and we can have a United Nationsthat is more effective and efficient than it was a yearpreviously. The United Nations will continue to be aguarantor of international peace and security  and adriving force for the protection of human rights and thepromotion of sustainable development for our futureand that of our children. The General Assembly cancount on Spain to participate in that endeavour with thesame determination as always."
"55",2256,"EST",67,2012,"﻿It is an honour once againto address the United Nations. This year I wouldlike to focus on responsibility. The recent years ofeconomic and financial turbulence have demonstrateda strong correlation between economic prudence andresponsibility in fiscal matters. We have realized  Ihope  that sustainability is not a term we apply onlyto development  but concerns all of us. Responsibilityand sustainability apply to the three broad topics I shalladdress today: human rights  good governance anddevelopment. But before doing so  I would like to speakabout diplomacy.The purpose of diplomacy is to prevent war.When diplomats are attacked we are all less secure.We know what we are talking about — we too havehad our diplomats attacked  mercifully without thehorrific consequences that occured in Benghazi.Therefore  the recent assaults in many parts of theworld on diplomats  embassies and consular premises are deplorable. Regardless of their motivations  suchacts are unjustifiable and must be universally andunequivocably condemned. All countries must fulfiltheir international legal obligation to protect diplomaticand consular properties and personnel.As recent events have demonstrated  when itcomes to human rights it is not enough merely to keepyour own house in order. As a conscientious memberof the international community  Estonia feels theresponsibility to do more globally. That includes payingattention to human rights violations in places torn byconflict  as well as doing more to stop and prevent theviolation of the rights of women and the child. It alsomeans making the most of new technologies in theservice of fundamental rights and freedoms. The needto take responsibility and do more is also why Estonialooks forward to becoming a member of the HumanRights Council and to working proactively towards thefulfilment of its mandate.Permit me to touch upon the developments inSyria. We have witnessed the complete breakdown ofany semblance of the rule of law. We continue to seeextensive human rights and international humanitarianlaw abuses. It appears that both sides have committedserious international crimes. Yet we still see no solution.We cannot look on and wait for the violence to spreadeven more widely. The Security Council — especiallyits permanent members — must overcome theirdifferences and find a solution to the bloodshed. Theleast that all parties must do is to allow for humanitarianaid to be safely delivered and to guarantee the securityof humanitarian workers. Without an end to the armedconflict  without peace  there can be no politicalprocess.But it is not only Syria that needs our attention.We should not avoid the problem of protracted conflictsthat have already waited for years to be solved. Weshall speak with one voice against continuing violationsof the territorial integrity of sovereign States and forthe secure return of all forcefully displaced persons.Moreover  more attention to conflict prevention wouldhelp to avoid such violations in the future.A stronger commitment to conflict prevention andto the enhancement of the rule of law can help to avoidviolent conflicts and the most heinous internationalcrimes. Under the principle of the responsibility toprotect  States committed in 2005 to protect theirpeople from ethnic cleansing  genocide  war crimesand crimes against humanity. Today the content of the responsibility to protect is not debated. The difficulty however  lies with its application: when Governmentsdo not live up to their responsibility  the internationalcommunity must react and act.The international criminal justice system especially the International Criminal Court  plays acrucial role in providing timely and decisive responsesto such crimes. Investigations by the Court may deterfurther atrocities  prevent their escalation or acceleratetheir end. It is therefore essential to cooperate with theCourt and apprehend those it has indicted.As a result of the evolving nature of militaryconflicts  civilian casualties tragically are on therise. Among civilians  women and children are themost vulnerable. When we take that into account Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)  on women peace and security  takes on a whole new immediacy.Furthermore  conflict-related sexual violence requiresmore attention. Such violence can easily lead to furtherwar crimes and crimes against humanity. Moreover in advancing the rights of the child  the InternationalCriminal Court’s recent decision to convict ThomasLubanga Dyilo was a significant achievement and will we hope  have a strong deterrent effect in the future toprevent crimes against children.The Crimean War  in the 1850s  brought the worldthe first extensive photographic reports of conflicts.Today  new media make it even more difficult to hidewar crimes both on and off the battlefield. Moderntechnology brings home the reality and horror of war.We must therefore recognize the important role oftechnology in advancing human rights.Freedom of expression is a human right  whether inthe city square  the press or in cyberspace. For the thirdyear in a row  Freedom House has ranked Estonia firstin the world in Internet freedom. We have joined thecoalition Freedom Online  a group of States workingclosely together to advance human rights online. Inaddition  Estonia looks forward to discussing activelymatters relating to Internet freedom in the HumanRights Council  which adopted a resolution on thattopic this year (resolution 20/8). The resolution was agenuine milestone affirming that fundamental rightsin the virtual world must be protected with the samecommitment as in the real world.Internationally  there are worrisome developmentsrelated to Internet governance. Too many countriesspeak about the dangers of a free Internet from a security perspective. The truth is  as we know well that cybersecurity is needed to prevent oppressiveGovernments and criminals from wreaking havoc. It isnot to prevent peaceful individuals from speaking theirminds or gathering information and exchanging ideas.Despite having experienced extensive cyber attacksduring the so-called Web War One  five years ago  Estoniadoes not support more rigid regulation and censorshipin cyberspace. Estonia is committed to an open  secureand reliable Internet. It is therefore imperative to ensurethat the International Telecommunication Union’s newregulation does not lead to the restriction of Internetfreedom and unnecessary limits to the free f low of ideasand information. In fighting cybercrimes  the BudapestConvention on Cybercrime provides the appropriateand primary legal framework at the global level.Globally  there is a deficit of good and responsiblegovernance. Its lack is the root cause of countlessother ills. But again  some progress has been made.I was proud to represent Estonia when I signed onto the Open Government Partnership  along withrepresentatives of 42 other countries. That multilateralinitiative aims to take concrete steps to institute a newmodel of governance to maximize the potential of newtechnologies and  most important  to tackle corruption.The information revolution we experience thesedays has assisted Estonia to successfully and rapidlytransform itself into a rule-of-law-based democraticsociety. Estonia was the first country where peoplecould cast their vote online in parliamentary andmunicipal elections. Just a few months ago weconducted our census for the first time to a large extentonline. This year more than 90 per cent of taxpayers inEstonia filed annual income tax returns via the Internet.E-government  e-school  e-medical prescriptionsand e-parking are examples of Estonian innovationin the field of citizen-friendly public services. Theyincrease transparency and help to prevent and cutdown corruption. They reduce costs. Most importantly however  they have increased the possibility to exercisefundamental rights and freedoms and improve inclusiveand responsible governance. Therefore  Estonia wishesto share its e-governance skills and to continue tofacilitate exchanges with partners worldwide.My comments on the need to do more apply to theUnited Nations too. Without reform  its global missionwill be unsustainable. We need change  ranging fromreforming the United Nations in the broadest sense tocutting the waste of paper. In an information age it is increasingly necessary to distinguish noise from signal to distinguish genuine data from spin.I have spoken thus far about what Governmentscan and must do. In our increasingly interconnected wired and wireless world  civil society and the privatesector play an ever-greater role. Governments benefitfrom involving non-governmental organizations entrepreneurs and private individuals in governance.Estonia and many other countries increasingly andsuccessfully do so. The challenge  however  is for theUnited Nations system — a multilateral organizationbased on modern  post-Westphalian States — to embracethose other actors and to involve them in findingsolutions and decision-making.Allow me to continue by sharing some thoughtsrelated to development and responsibility.Sustainable development is not a clichéd utopia;nor is it something forced on us from above. Truedevelopment can be nothing other than sustainable. Yetwe have seen unsustainability masked as development despite the contradiction in terms.Consider the global financial crisis. Burdening ourchildren and grandchildren with mountains of debt isimmoral  as is living at the expense of others. Growthwithout responsibility is illusory. We have learned thatthe hard way. Let us not make the same mistake again.We are another year closer to the deadline we setourselves for achieving the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs). Were they too ambitious? I do not thinkso. Aiming high is the least we can do. There is no pointin setting targets that we can be confident of achievingeffortlessly. Yet we must resist the temptation to selleverything as a success if that is not the case. Failure toachieve all the MDGs is no excuse not to set new targets.The world needs sustainable development goals. We arestill in a preliminary phase of the discussion. Let us aimhigh and do our best.Despite the world’s best efforts  millionsremain in poverty. The information technology (IT)transformation will create massive opportunities allover the world. We must  however  avoid a digitaldivide that would stymie this historic chance toaccelerate development in all parts of the world. I was amember of Kofi Annan’s high-level panel of experts oninformation and communication technology — alreadya decade ago — and I continue to be concerned aboutthe gap between the digital haves and have-nots especially because  by investing in IT  countries such as mine have leapt into modernity and transparency. Newinformation and communications technologies have thepotential to trigger the next industrial revolution  butgovernments cannot achieve it alone.Entrepreneurs expanding the range of globalknowledge networks are key partners in fightingpoverty and creating a more transparent economy.They can also make an outsized difference in theircommunities and the world. However  Governmentsmust provide a secure and fruitful environment forthose sorts of ideas to emerge and prosper. Twentyoneyears after restoring our independence  Estonia isan example where a combination of responsible freeenterprise  e-governance  international partnershipsand eco-friendly policies can put a country in the fastlane of development.Experience shows that if we fail to act responsibly we will  in the end  be forced to do so. Let us begin byacting responsibly."
"56",2302,"ETH",67,2012,"﻿I would like tocongratulate the President on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventhsession  and to thank him for the inspiring speech hemade at the opening of the general debate (see A/67/PV.6). We are confident that the spirit exemplified inthat speech will guide him during his presidency. Let mealso take this opportunity to express my appreciation tothe outgoing President.The reason I am here on this rostrum  making mymaiden speech to the General Assembly as Head ofGovernment of the new Ethiopia  is because we lost ourleader only a little more than a month ago. The passingof Prime Minister Meles Zenawi is a huge loss forEthiopia  and undoubtedly for Africa as well. He was aman of prodigious intellect who was uncompromisingin his insistence that Ethiopians and Africans shouldown and protect their development strategies and theirapproaches to governance and democratization. The lateEthiopian Prime Minister  and the party he led  havefacilitated the emergence of a new Ethiopia  rekindlingthe hopes of Ethiopians for the future and strengtheningtheir confidence in their ability to overcome adversity.Ethiopians proved their mettle  and what they aremade of  when they received the unexpected news ofthe tragedy with which the nation was faced. It is anhonour and a blessing to be the leader of a people whoare generous in paying tribute to those  like PrimeMinister Meles  who served them self lessly; a peoplewho have the maturity and wisdom to see  and evenlucidly articulate  who has done what for the nationand for the people of Ethiopia. That would naturallymake any human being who is given the opportunity tolead a country ask himself what more he can do for his people — not in words but in deeds  as our late PrimeMinister often emphasized. As might be expected doomsday scenarios for Ethiopia’s future were bandiedabout.But the people of Ethiopia — from north to south from east to west  across the length and breadth ofthe country — were categorical in stating in unisonhow much they embrace the unity of the country unity that celebrates their diversity and is built on thebedrock of their federal Constitution. Let me take thisopportunity to thank  on behalf of the Ethiopian peopleand myself  all those leaders and heads of delegationwho came to Addis Ababa to be with us at our time ofgrief. We cherish your friendship. I wish to reiterate mycondolences to the peoples and Governments of Ghana Malawi and Guinea-Bissau  who have also lost theirleaders recently.We Ethiopians are confident that we have comea long way. Never before in its modern history hasEthiopia had the kind of rapid economic growth thatit has witnessed over the last decade or so. Indeed  forthe first time in its modern history  Ethiopia has begunto see a bright light at the end of the tunnel in terms ofreal prospects for economic transformation. We are  forsure  on a hugely promising trajectory. Our Growth andTransformation Plan  to which our late Prime Ministerwas devoted  and which is now embraced by our people is designed to catapult our nation to a destinationthathas long eluded it but is now within reach.We go forward with full recognition of ourresponsibility  as the second most populous countryin Africa  to contribute to regional integration. Weforesee huge possibilities for bringing the countries ofthe greater Horn of Africa together. We have alreadygone some distance in playing a catalytic role in layingthe infrastructural basis for consolidating economicties with the countries of our region. The electric powerinterconnections and the road and railway networksthat we have built and are in the process of buildingwith Djibouti  the Sudan  Kenya and South Sudan areemblematic of our resolve to play our part in regionalintegration. We are confident that Somalia and others without exception  will follow suit.But our success hinges on a number of conditionsbeing met  none of which is amenable to our unilateralinitiative. First is the question of peace and stabilityand the challenge of extremism. Here  also  we havemade much progress. Somalia is gradually coming out of the woods. We salute all those  most particularly thecontributors of troops to the African Union Mission inSomalia  for the sacrifice they have made. The AfricanUnion (AU) has made an enormous contribution tolaying the basis for the progress that Somalia has made.We also acknowledge the very useful cooperationbetween the AU and the United Nations  includingtheir two Councils responsible for security. We have torecognize the role of partners as well. But much moreneeds to be done in Somalia to ensure that the newGovernment stands on its own feet. We would be naive however  if we believed that the enemies of peace ofSomalia and the region are completely defeated. Thatis why it is so critical that the momentum is not lostin Somalia and Somalia’s ownership of the processof national reconciliation is strengthened. We willcontinue to assist Somalia and the new President of thecountry  Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud  and the peopleof Somalia can count on that.We are pleased that there is also major progress inthe peace process between the Sudan and South Sudan.We are confident that the two parties will maintain themomentum towards durable peace  which is the basis forensuring the viability of both. We are indeed indebtedto former President Thabo Mbeki and the AfricanUnion High-level Implementation Panel for theirperseverance and commitment to peace between thetwo sisterly countries. What has been achieved by thetwo parties over the last few days  which culminated inthe signing of the much anticipated agreements on vitalmatters  is a significant breakthrough  which needs tobe consolidated and used as a basis for resolving theissues still remaining. We are confident that the twoparties appreciate how vital their joint effort for awin-win outcome is  not only for their peoples  but alsofor us all.Peace between the Sudan and South Sudan and aclose partnership between the two  above and beyondthe benefit it has for us all  has for us Ethiopians anadditional emotional and sentimental value. That wasan issue that our late Prime Minister  even as he wasstruggling for his life  was following with the sameintensity as before  and he continued to offer whateveradded value he could bring to bear on the peaceprocess. Let me thank both the Sudan and South Sudanfor placing their trust in us  as has been so manifest inthe deployment of the United Nations Interim SecurityForce for Abyei. Indeed  we are proud of our troops in Abyei  as we are of all our people serving under theUnited Nations f lag  including those in Darfur.Before I move on to the second challenge we face  Iwish to say a few words on broader issues that help putin perspective the challenge our region faces in securingsustainable peace and stability. The major war we haveto win is undoubtedly the war on poverty. The mostdifficult challenge we face here in developing the mosteffective means to wage that war is that of ensuring thatthe rule of law is observed  both in inter-State relationsand in the domestic sphere. At its most fundamentallevel  the struggle against extremism is one aspect ofthe struggle to ensure that the rule of law is respectedand the principles of tolerance are adhered to. Whereveran act of intolerance or a violation of laws occurs sometimes in an egregious manner  as in Benghazi  itneeds to be condemned.The second challenge we face in sustaining ourdevelopment agenda relates to a host of issues impingingon our capacity to ensure sustainable development.Let us be frank and admit that there is a huge deficitin international cooperation for the development ofboth low-income and least developed countries. Atthe end of the day  regardless of other impediments todevelopment  the major bottleneck for countries suchas Ethiopia for ensuring sustainable development andsuccessfully achieving the Millennium DevelopmentGoals is related to shortfalls in development finance.We said as much in the Paris Declaration on AidEffectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action and  recently  in the Busan Partnership for EffectiveDevelopment Cooperation  but the results have beenfew and far between. In our view  the current globaleconomic situation should never be allowed to detractattention from the critical need for development financeof low-income countries.The challenge in this area is compounded andmade even worse by climate change  which is a globalchallenge calling for responsible and wise leadershipat the international level. The response should relyon full commitment to the principle of common butdifferentiated responsibilities. However boring it maybe  something that is universally acknowledged bearsrepeating. Countries such as Ethiopia which did notcontribute to climate change are nonetheless those mostaffected by it. But  still  we recognize our obligation.That is why Ethiopia has already opted for a greengrowth path  and our current five-year Growth andTransformation Plan is based on developing a green economy  the strategy for which has already beenissued and is being implemented. We seek effectivecooperation in this endeavour.We had hoped that the United Nations Conferenceon Sustainable Development would achieve more thanit did. Nevertheless  we look forward to meaningfuland effective work by the working group on sustainabledevelopment  to which we are ready to contribute as bestwe can. We are also hopeful that the intergovernmentalprocess under the auspices of the General Assemblyin connection with financing for development will notturn into a filibustering exercise without any impact onthis issue  which is so critical for the development oflow-income countries.As I conclude  I wish to express my agreementwith previous speakers that the twenty-first centuryis indeed an African century. As mentioned by mybrother  the President of Ghana  out of the 10 fastestgrowing economies in the world last year  six wereAfrican countries. I should also mention that Ethiopiawas among the six. Africa is indeed changing  andchanging for the better. There is no greater humanrights violation than attempts to put obstacles in theway of the success of the ongoing transformations ofAfrica  which will have enormous salutary implicationsfor hundreds of millions of Africans.Africa is no longer the marginalized continentof the 1980s or even of the period a little later thanthat. Ethiopia will continue to play its part to ensurethe success of the transformation and the successof multilateralism under the auspices of the UnitedNations."
"57",2348,"FIN",67,2012,"﻿May I begin by congratulatingMr. Vuk Jeremić on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Letme assure him that Finland is fully behind him as hefulfils his important duties. We look forward to closecooperation with him.I have the pleasure and honour to address theGeneral Assembly for the first time as President of theRepublic of Finland. The United Nations is the forumto which our peoples’ expectations are directed whenchallenges that affect us all need to be addressed. Wein this Hall must recognize our responsibilities. We allmust be ready to shoulder them.A profound change is sweeping over the globe.Rapid economic growth in the countries of the globalSouth has already made greater well-being a reality forhundreds of millions of people. More people have thechance to lift themselves out of poverty. More peoplehave the opportunity for political participation. Thesedevelopments will make our world more just and lessprone to conflict. That is in Finland’s interest. It is inthe interests of us all.At the same time  the tectonic plates of economicpower are shifting. Global instruments are neededto manage that shift. The United Nations and thevarious “G Groups” need to work together better. Werecognize that such groups have an important role toplay in making the United Nations a more dynamic andrelevant player in the world economy.Finland sees itself as a responsible member of theinternational community — a good global citizen  ifyou will. We support the United Nations in word andin deed because it is in our national interest to do so.The United Nations is a genuinely universal forum forcooperation. It has unique legitimacy. For us  it is anindispensable means to promote international peaceand security  development and human rights. As asmall country — there are only some 5 million of usFinns — a world order based on respect for the UnitedNations Charter and international law is a must. It isnot an option.Finland is a candidate for non-permanentmembership in the Security Council for the term2013-2014. We wish to shoulder the responsibility thatmembership in the Council entails. We believe that we could make a contribution. Finland would approach theissues on the Council’s agenda as an engaged MemberState. We would be ready to look for constructive andeven-handed solutions to common problems. We believethat as a small and militarily non-aligned Member State we have what it takes. Finland’s candidacy enjoys thefull support of the other Nordic countries — Denmark Iceland  Norway and Sweden.The ability to prevent conflict around the worldremains the United Nations core mission. It is theyardstick by which United Nations successes orfailures are measured. It is the Security Council thatshoulders the main responsibility for the maintenanceof international peace and security.Peacekeeping mandated by the Council is animportant means at our disposal in that regard. Finlandhas participated in United Nations peacekeeping aslong as it has been a Member State. We are also ready toshare with other Members and regional organizationsthe expertise that we have gained with respect totraining peacekeepers. Our training centre  the FinnishDefence Forces International Centre  is at the service ofthe United Nations.Peacekeeping is indispensable but is not enough.Soldiers are needed to secure the conditions for peaceto begin to be built. However  in the end  peace isbuilt by civilians. That is why Finland has long paidspecial attention to civilian crisis management. Finnishexperts — police officers and experts in the rule oflaw  gender equality and human rights — participatein peacekeeping operations in many parts of the world.Effective mediation is also a must. Finland hasmade a strong contribution to mediating conflicts.My predecessor  President Martti Ahtisaari  won theNobel Peace Prize for his decades-long career as asuccessful mediator. At the initiative of Finland andTurkey  a resolution was adopted in this Hall last yearthat strengthened the normative basis for mediation(resolution 65/283). I am glad that the Secretary-General will soon make his guidelines on mediationavailable to all Member States  regional organizationsand other actors. I encourage him to make full use ofthe powers that the Charter grants him in that regard.Respect for the rule of law is part and parcel ofbuilding peace in post-conflict societies. Impunityoften leaves behind the seeds of another conflict. In thelong run  economic development is sustainable only ifthe rule of law is respected. It is encouraging that the High-level Meeting on the rule of law yesterday showedthat there is indeed the political commitment to furthersuch efforts.Respect for the rule of law instructs us to honourthe beliefs of others  but it also requires us to condemnall violence. Finland  together with the other Nordiccountries  will again introduce a draft resolution onthe protection of diplomatic missions in the GeneralAssembly. Upholding diplomatic rights and immunitiesis in our common interest.Poverty reduction is the ultimate means to securepeace in many parts of the world. That requires  aboveall  economic growth and a level playing-field for all.Development cooperation can assist  especially in theleast developed countries. Those countries that alreadysuffer the effects of climate change are particularlyvulnerable and in need of our support. Finland hasa record of being a reliable partner for developingcountries stretching over half a century. Despite thewell-known budgetary pressures within the eurozone  Finland has increased its outlay fordevelopmentcooperation to an annual level of about $1.5 billion inrecent years.Weapons of mass destruction remain an existentialthreat to international peace and security. Finlandhas been a strong supporter of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons from the verybeginning. The non-proliferation of nuclear weapons disarmament and the right to the peaceful use of nuclearenergy are all necessary parts of the whole.Finland is prepared to host a conference on theestablishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclearweapons and all other weapons of mass destruction thisyear. The task has been described as difficult but  restassured  we will do our utmost to complete it. Nuclearmaterial cannot be allowed to fall into the wronghands. Finland is on track to fulfil the commitmentsthat we undertook at the Washington conference in2010. National measures and international cooperationare both needed to stop nuclear terrorism. As a user ofpeaceful nuclear energy  Finland is strongly committedto continuing the process.Chemical weapons were totally banned someyears ago. The treaty is not yet universal  though.The Finnish Institute for Verification of the ChemicalWeapons Convention is an established and respectedinstitution. Should the need arise in the Middle East  Finland is ready to put its expertise at the disposal ofthe international community.The conventional weapons trade clearly needsbetter global regulation. It is regrettable that thenegotiations on the arms trade treaty ended withoutthe desired outcome. The goal is in sight  however. It isimportant to ensure that the process continues withinthe United Nations context. As one of the sponsors Finland continues to reach out for a substantive treatyand one that is as universal as possible.In Libya  the United Nations was instrumental inlaying the groundwork for a new and hopeful future forits people. In Syria  the tragic situation is  if anything getting worse. The Security Council has not been able totake the leading role that it is expected to take under theCharter with respect to threats to peace such as in thatcountry. The General Assembly has  on the other hand sent a strong signal that the international communitycannot remain indifferent. The killings of civiliansmust stop. All members of the Security Council mustcooperate to find a way out of the crisis. The authorityof the United Nations will suffer if efforts to end thecrisis move elsewhere.The Syrian conflict has overshadowed the MiddleEast peace process. That is something that the partiesand the international community can ill afford. A two-State solution  within which an independent  viable andcontiguous Palestinian State lives in peace and securitywith the State of Israel  is slipping out of reach. ThePalestinians have waited patiently. The negotiationsmust restart. That is the only way forward. Renewednegotiations need to result in a sustainable solutionthat leads to the establishment of a Palestinian State while respecting Israel’s legitimate security concerns.Settlements are squarely a contravention of internationallaw and a growing obstacle to peace.The Security Council has powers  but with authoritycomes responsibility. I hope that  in a few weeks  atan election held here in this Hall  Finland is entrustedby fellow Member States with such powers and theattendant responsibility for two years. Finland will actin the Council in accordance with the United NationsCharter and on the basis of our values. We will workconstructively and pragmatically in order to maintainand strengthen international peace and security to thebest of our ability."
"58",2392,"FJI",67,2012,"﻿On behalf of the PrimeMinister and the people of Fiji  I congratulate thePresident on his election and have full confidence inhis guidance of the sixty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly. I wish also to pay tribute to the tireless efforts of his predecessor  Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser through what has been an eventful and turbulent yearfor the global community of nations.The world is facing many challenges that demandour attention and collective action. As we all gatheredlast June in Rio de Janeiro for the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development  millionsof people were recovering from  or living through natural disasters. In Fiji  we experienced our worstf looding on record during the months of January andApril. Beyond the human cost  the economic damageto infrastructure  schools  businesses  agriculture andtourism — a sector that generates 33 per cent of Fiji’sgross domestic product — was immense  and we stillhave not fully recovered. Our f loods were by no meansthe world’s worst climatic disaster of the year; otherpeoples suffered much worse. But as a people who liveon a group of small islands in the South Pacific  we feelparticularly vulnerable.The ongoing failure of the international communityto seriously address climate change means that we willall see more frequent and more intense weather events.Those will erode our development gains and leave ourpeople feeling poorer and less secure  so it is clear thatit is indispensable to incorporate disaster risk reductioninto global and national development strategies.The post-2015 development agenda is now underdiscussion  and frameworks and modalities are beingdeveloped. However  our job with the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) is not complete. As aglobal community of nations that has committed tothose goals  we must give meaningful support to allthose States lagging in their progress. We must alsoensure that a post-2015 development agenda does notsimply delay the target date for the MDG indicatorsand goals. The development community can do muchmore  including meeting our agreed objectives fordevelopment funding.Fiji has embarked on a comprehensive reformprogramme not only to promote development  but alsoto improve the lives of our people. We have embracedthe Millennium Development Goals as they wereintended — to provide specific objective standards forimproving the lives of our people. We are the secondcountry in the world to introduce the pneumococcaland rotavirus immunizations as standard  with a viewto minimizing child mortality. That represents progresstowards meeting MDGs 4 and 5.But the reward is not in meeting the goals; thereward is in children who are healthier  families that areless burdened  and generations given a better chance tobecome productive adults. We must never forget thatbehind each of those Millennium Development Goalsare human beings — the citizens of our nations — wholook to us to provide opportunities for a fuller life. Westill have work to do particularly in meeting MDGs 1 3 and 6  and we are working on those as best we can.The particular case of small island developing Statesin meeting those goals and their specific challengeswill be addressed by the third Global Conference on theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates  to be held in the Pacific region in 2014. Thesuccess of the Conference will be measured in actions not simply in more words. Substantive preparationsfor the Conference must therefore be oriented towardstaking action and achieving specific goals.In addition to support for regional development Fiji is also taking the lead in the region on broadbandconnectivity. It is clear to us that broadband isan essential technology for improving education medicine  agriculture and environmental services.Broadband technology is especially important to usbecause it will help unite a dispersed people and helpdraw us closer to our island neighbours in the Pacific.If we take care to make it accessible  affordable andunderstandable  we will bring an entire universe ofwisdom and understanding to the smallest schools andremotest villages. Information need no longer be theproperty mostly of people who live in the cities or whoare attached to large institutions.Like all islands nations  Fiji relies on the ocean andits resources as our economic lifeblood and source ofsustainable development. While fish and other livingmarine resources have been vital to Fiji’s economyand livelihood  we believe that our efforts to exploredeep-sea mineral resources have greater potential provided that a precautionary approach with regard toenvironmental sustainability is ensured.The theme selected by the President for thisyear’s general debate  “Bringing about adjustment orsettlement of international disputes or situations bypeaceful means”  is most relevant in these times ofturbulence across the world. The United Nations mustcontinue to be at the vanguard of international peaceand security. It must be able to respond to new typesof crises  always with an aim to stabilize the places it enters and leave behind not just a state of peace andstability  but also an environment that fosters freedomand opportunity for the people.In that context  Fiji continues to play a role inpeacekeeping missions around the world that is farbeyond what is expected of a country of our sizeand level of development. We contribute troops andpolice personnel to operations in Iraq  Liberia  SouthSudan  Darfur and Timor-Leste. Fiji has responded toexigent requests by the Department of PeacekeepingOperations  above and beyond agreed contributions to ensure that peacekeeping operations in Iraq cancontinue unhindered  despite the additional burden ithas placed on our troops operating far from home andfor longer than envisaged. We believe that all nationsmust find ways to make the world safer  more humaneand more livable  and as a people we are proud that wecan make that contribution to global peace and securityand to the lives of citizens far away from us. That isnot just Government policy; it is a calling that is deeplyembraced by the Fijian people.Recognizing the role that peacekeeping missionswith expanded mandates play in helping to build thefoundations of a sustainable future  Fiji has in the pastyear also started to contribute in a small yet meaningfulway to the corrections and justice sector of peacekeepingmissions. Mentoring and strengthening corrections andjustice institutions is part of the process of allowingpost-conflict societies to take control of their owndestinies  and Fiji is pleased to be able to be a part ofthose unfolding stories around the world.Fiji has been honoured to be a part of that processin our own region through our contributions in Timor-Leste via the United Nations Integrated Mission inTimor-Leste (UNMIT). Following the successfulelections in Timor-Leste early this year  UNMIT will bein a position to wind down its operations later this year allowing the Timorese people to take full ownershipand control of their own destinies. Timor-Leste is nowan observer to the regional organization of which Fiji isthe current Chair  the Melanesian Spearhead Group  andwe trust that through that organization and the UnitedNations we will have many years of collaboration ahead.In the spirit of supporting self-determination Fiji continues to work through the DecolonizationCommittee of the United Nations to ensure that NewCaledonia’s right to self-determination  as expressed inthe Noumea Accord  is implemented faithfully by all parties. Fiji works through the Melanesian SpearheadGroup in monitoring the progress of implementationof the Noumea Accord. Additionally  at the Engagingwith the Pacific Meetings held in Fiji in 2011 and 2012 Pacific island leaders committed to supporting theinalienable right of the people of Ma’ohi Nui/FrenchPolynesia to self-determination. We look forward toworking through the United Nations processes and withall relevant partners in order to have the question ofMa’ohi Nui’s self-determination placed on the UnitedNations agenda again.Fiji is itself working through a period of reform andtransition. We are building a sustainable democracyfounded on the principle of “one person  one vote  onevalue”. Elections will be held under a new constitutionand electoral system no later than September 2014.Those elections will see the citizens of Fiji go to thepolls without regard to their race for the first time inour nation’s history. Fiji’s new constitution will bebased on some unassailable democratic principles: asecular State that recognizes our multi-faith society;a common national identity in which all citizens  notjust indigenous people  will call themselves Fijians forthe first time; a war against corruption  which inhibitsthe country’s development; an independent judiciaryto uphold the rights of every Fijian; social justice andthe elimination of all forms of discrimination  so thatevery Fijian is treated equally; good and transparentgovernance; and lowering the voting age to 18 to giveour young people a voice.We set up an independent ConstitutionalCommission in March to draft a new constitutionguided by those principles. It will be a constitutionof and for the people. Ordinary Fijians are seizingthe opportunity to put forward their views at publichearings throughout the country and to voice the issuesthat are most important to them. The Commission’srecommendations will be reviewed by a ConstituentAssembly in early 2013. This body  made up of a broadcross-section of Fijian society  will formulate the finaldocument through public discussion and debate. Thatwill set the scene for elections in 2014  for whichpreparations have already begun. Through a process ofelectronic registration carried out in July and Augustof this year  almost half a million Fijians have so farregistered to vote.Throughout this process  we have stayed true tothe principle that we in Fiji must determine our owndestiny  one that is inclusive and fair to all citizens. We are taking the time necessary to get it right. Wehave endured criticism and a degree of isolation at thehands of some of our traditional friends among theworld’s democracies. By now  those countries havebegun to recognize that we are serious about building asustainable democracy that is racially blind  that offersequal opportunity  and that protects all citizens fromthe tyranny of the majority. We need the support of theworld’s democracies  and we invite them to work with usin our quest to establish the kind of democratic systemthat they enjoy. After 40 years of strife and instability the work of true and sustainable democracy is justbeginning  and we ask the international community tosupport us.We have examined and redefined our world viewto help forge productive  friendly relationships withall nations of goodwill. In 2011  Fiji opened threenew embassies in Brazil  Indonesia and South Africa.We have expanded our diplomatic presence this yearby opening embassies in the Republic of Korea andthe United Arab Emirates. We want to learn more  toexchange more  to develop more  to trade more  andcertainly to contribute more through active and robustengagement with other nations.In the United Nations  Fiji pledges to work in themost constructive manner possible  and to respect theideals of the United Nations Charter. That includes theInternational Labour Organization (ILO)  with whichwe are engaged at the present moment. The FijianGovernment’s commitment to a future of equality andopportunity for all Fijians includes ensuring that therights of working people are protected and extended.The Constitutional Commission has receivedsubmissions from all sectors of Fijian society  includingtrade unions and public employees. We expect the newconstitution to help us continue to build an environmentthat promotes safe working conditions  protectsworkers from arbitrary actions  and allows workers toform unions. We seek to ensure that unions can takecollective action  as directed by their member workers and are subject only to restrictions that are generallyaccepted as protecting the public good. We also seek toprotect the rights of those workers who choose not toaffiliate with unions.The Fijian Government is committed to protectingworkers who are fortunate enough to have jobs andto ensuring that all workers receive fair wages.We are equally committed to creating employment opportunities for the young and less aff luent. As partof Fiji’s progress in reform towards democracy  weare reviewing our current labour laws to ensure theircompliance with the 34 ILO conventions that Fiji hasratified. The tripartite Employment Relations AdvisoryBoard is a key participant in this process. This yearalone  Fiji has ratified or adopted eight ILO instruments as recommended by the tripartite Board  including the2006 Maritime Labour Convention.By empowering Fijians  the Government isseeking to ensure that all citizens  regardless of ethnicbackground  are on a level playing field and in possessionof the tools needed to compete with their peers in theglobal community  improve their livelihoods and fulfiltheir dreams. By modernizing Fiji  the Government isseeking to make the country and its institutions andlegal system strong  independent and world-class.Fiji may be a relatively small country  but it hasbig aspirations. They include being a good globalcitizen  a leader by example among island nations and an actively engaged member of the internationalcommunity. In the spirit of constructive contributionto the global community and the United Nations  Iam pleased to say that at today’s ministerial meetingof the Group of 77 and China  Fiji was endorsed asthe Chair of the Group for the year 2013. Fiji takeson this responsibility with a deep sense of humility  awillingness to work collaboratively with all States  anda commitment to addressing the inequalities that existbetween developing and developed countries.As we look forward to a productive sixty-seventhsession of the General Assembly  we reiterate our fullsupport for and cooperation with the President and allMembers  with a view to advancing the objectives ofthis body and the aspirations of the global community."
"59",2439,"FRA",67,2012,"﻿This is thefirst time that I speak from this rostrum at the United Nations. It is a very moving moment for me becauseI understand what the United Nations represents  forour world  and what it has represented historically. I amalso aware of a sense of responsibility  because Franceis a permanent member of the Security Council andtherefore has duties. I am also here at this rostrum totalk about values that do not belong to any particularpeople  are not owned by any particular continentand are not the privilege of any particular part of thepopulation.I am here to talk about universal values  whichFrance has always proclaimed  and about the rightsof every human being  wherever they live: liberty security and resistance to oppression. Those valuesand those rights are all too frequently held in contemptin our world  especially as we face three main threats which we must tackle head-on. The first is the threatof fanaticism  which fuels violence. We have seenthat yet again in recent days. The second is the globaleconomy  which has been affected by a crisis and whichperpetuates intolerable inequalities. The third threat isthe disturbance in the climate system  which threatensthe very survival of our planet.The mission of the United Nations is to tackle thesechallenges and to find strong and just responses to themtogether. These responses must be just because withoutjustice  force is blind  and they must be strong becausewithout strength  justice is powerless.I am also here to express France’s confidence inthe United Nations. In recent years  we have been abletogether  to finally put an end to deadly conflicts  andwe have been able to prevent confrontations. However just as we are sending out 100 000 Blue Helmets whoact on our behalf — and I would like to pay tribute tothem — because of divisions  the blocking of our owninstitutions and inertia  the United Nations has not beenable to put an end to war  atrocities and attacks on therights of peoples.I would therefore  on behalf of France  draw oneconclusion that I would like to share with the Assembly.If we want to make our world safer  it is up to us to fullyshoulder our responsibilities. How can we do so?First of all  we can do so by reforming our ownOrganization  the United Nations. The Security Councilmust better reflect the realities of the world today. Thisis why I would once again recall that France supportsthe request for an enlargement of the Council madeby Germany  Japan  India and Brazil. But we are also in favour of an increased African presence  includingamong the permanent members. Having a seat on theSecurity Council is not a privilege justified by history and it is not a matter of satisfying some ambition relatedto economic power. No  having a seat on the SecurityCouncil means making the commitment to take actionto promote peace in the world. Indeed  we must act andact together  but act quickly  because it is urgent.The most urgent situation is in Syria. The Assemblyhas several times denounced the massacres carried outby the Syrian regime  called for those responsible to beprosecuted and expressed the desire for a democratictransition. But the ordeal of the population continues tothis day. There have been almost 30 000 deaths in thelast 18 months. How many more deaths will we wait forbefore we take action? How can we allow the paralysisof the United Nations to continue?I know one thing for certain: the Syrian regimewill never again take its place among the alliance ofnations. It has no future among us. This is why I havetaken the decision  on behalf of France  to recognize theprovisional Government representing the new Syria assoon as it is formed. That Government will itself haveto give guarantees that every community in Syria willbe respected and will be able to live in security in theirown country. Without further delay  I would ask thatthe United Nations immediately give the Syrian peopleall of the assistance and support they are requestingand  in particular  that the liberated areas be protectedand humanitarian aid be assured for refugees. As forthe leaders in Damascus  they must know that theinternational community will not stand by if they takethe unhappy decision to use chemical weapons.Another situation that is urgent is the fight againstthe most serious of threats to stability in the world namely  the proliferation of nuclear weapons. For severalyears now  Iran has been ignoring the demands of theinternational community. It shuns monitoring by theInternational Atomic Energy Agency. It does not keepits word or uphold Security Council resolutions. I hadhoped that negotiations could take place in earnest andthat steps could be outlined  but  again  no negotiationshave taken place. France will not accept such actions which threaten not only security in the region but peacethroughout the world.I therefore state once again that we are prepared toadopt new sanctions  not to punish the great people of Iran  but to tell their leaders that enough is enough andthat negotiations must be resumed before it is too late.The third urgent issue is at last to find a solution tothe Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The status quo is not aresponse; it is an impasse. France will make every effortto re-establish the basis for negotiations leading to thecoexistence of the two States in question; everyoneknows that this is the only solution that could lead to ajust and lasting peace in the region.The last of the urgent issues that I will mention although there are many others  might be the mostimportant one for us to focus on this week: the Sahel.The situation created by the occupation of territoryin northern Mali by terrorist groups is intolerable inadmissible and unacceptable. It is unacceptable notonly for Mali  which is affected by that terrorist threat but also for all countries of the region and beyond theregion — all of those that one day might be affected byterrorism.The African Union  which I commend  and theEconomic Community of West African States have saidthat they are prepared to take courageous decisions.The authorities of Mali have spoken; there is no time tolose. France will support any initiative that will enablethe Africans themselves to resolve that issue within theframework of international law  with a clear mandatefrom the Security Council. Mali must recover itsterritorial integrity  and terrorism must be eliminatedfrom that area of the Sahel.The role of the United Nations is to respond tourgent situations. But there is another objective thatshould unite us here  and that is development. TheUnited Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment  held in Rio  in which I participated  wasa disappointing stage for some and an encouraging onefor others. I believe that today we have an agenda thatshould encompass economic growth  poverty reduction social progress and environmental protection. That iswhat we need to do over the long term.The 2015 deadline for a climate agreement is fastapproaching. I wish to state here that France is ready tohost the United Nations conference on climate changeto be held at that time  because I want us to succeedtogether in meeting that challenge.In parallel  I would recall that one of thedisappointments of Rio was our failure to agree onthe creation of a major United Nations organization for the environment. That remains France’s objective.Such an agency would be based in Africa  becausethat continent  which has been neglected for too long is facing climate-related challenges. It would also behighly symbolic to entrust Africa with such a globalagency for the environment.With respect to development  I believe that weshould face reality. We will not achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals without new resources. Everyoneknows the budgetary limitations of our respectiveStates. That is why today  from this rostrum here at theUnited Nations  I am making an appeal for innovativefinancing  which would give us the means to enable ourorganizations to fight effectively against diseases suchas HIV/AIDS and malaria.I would like to commend the success of theInternational Drug Purchase Facility  which wasfinanced by a tax on airline tickets. That pathhas been opened  and today we must take anotherstep in that direction. I propose a tax on financialtransactions — which several European Union countrieshave already agreed to — aimed at slowing down themovement of capital or at least financing developmentand helping to fight health-related scourges. Francehas adopted such a tax. We have also made anothercommitment: to dedicate at least 10 per cent of thebenefits of that tax to development and to fight health-related threats and pandemics.That is the message that I wanted to send to theAssembly today: let us ensure that a global tax onfinancial transactions can be levied and that the benefitsit yields can be spent on development and fightingpandemics. That would be an excellent example of whatI call the globalization of solidarity  and one of the bestideas that today’s world could implement.But the mission of the United Nations is not onlyto fight financial instability or ensure that developmentremains at the centre of our concerns: it is to work tocounter all forms of instability. I am thinking here aboutdrug trafficking  a scourge that affects producing  transitand consuming countries. To combat drug traffickers who are frequently allied with terrorist networks  theUnited Nations must elaborate and implement a globalstrategy to fight against drugs.Arms trafficking also poses a major threat. Franceis firmly committed to the conclusion of a universalarms trade treaty. What the United Nations must defendand promote is a worldview that is based on respect for fundamental rights and freedoms. The Arab Springshowed that those values are universal and apply to allcontinents and countries.I want to welcome the events that took place inTunisia  in Libya  in Egypt. It is true that transitionsare not always easy. There are risks  and setbacks canoccur. Some may attempt  through violence  to reversethe progress made and the achievements gained. Francewill call on the new political authorities emanatingfrom democratic elections in those countries to wage anunrelenting combat against complacency  extremism fanaticism  hatred  intolerance and violence  whateverthe provocation may be  because there can never be anyjustification for violence.France wants to set an example. It is not tellinganyone what to do; that is simply its history and itsmessage. We want to be an example in the promotion offundamental freedoms. That is our combat  and we arehonoured to wage it. That is why France will continueto fight to abolish the death penalty  to ensure women’sright to equality and dignity  and to work towards theuniversal decriminalization of homosexuality  whichcannot be viewed as a crime but must be recognized asan orientation.We will continue to fight for the protection ofcivilians. Moreover  I recall that the Assembly affirmedthe principle that all States have the responsibility toensure the security of their civilians. If a State failsin that obligation  it is up to us  the United Nations to use the means at its disposal to meet it in its place.Let us not neglect that promise  as it can serve us. Iam thinking  in particular  of what is happening in theDemocratic Republic of Congo  where civilians are themain victims of clashes and where foreign interferencemust cease as soon as possible.Those are the goals that France will support anddefend at the United Nations. France has confidence inthe United Nations. We know that no State  howeverpowerful  can deal with emergencies  undertake thefight for development or overcome all crises. No Statecan do that  but  on the contrary  if we act together  wewill live up to our responsibilities. France wants theUnited Nations to be the centre and the framework forglobal governance  but do the States that make up theOrganization want that to be our purpose and goal?I say in all seriousness that when there is paralysis inertia and inaction  injustice and intolerance find theirplace. What I would like members to understand is thatwe must act in order to shoulder our responsibilitiesand to deal with urgent situations  such as Syria nuclear proliferation and the Sahel. We must also workfor another world that is based on development andinnovative financing and for the fight against healthcrises. We must act  always and together. Let us live upto the mission entrusted to us and to the expectations ofpeoples. That is France’s message."
"60",2464,"FSM",67,2012,"﻿I wish to join previous speakersin congratulating the new President of the GeneralAssembly and in commending the President of theAssembly at its sixty-sixth session for his excellentleadership. Allow me also to convey my deep respectfor the tireless efforts that His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has made as leader of theSecretariat and as a world statesman.Today our world continues to face numerousarduous challenges that require an urgent and collectiveresponse. Many of the gravest threats to the Statesmembers of the Assembly  including mine  the Federated States of Micronesia  are simply beyond the abilities ofour individual countries to single-handedly address even with our most aggressive and concentrated efforts.To speak before this body today is an honour and anopportunity that I must take to encourage internationalcooperation to help address those challenges.The biggest challenge we face today in Micronesiacontinues to be climate change  not just the projectionsof future loss and damage  but the dangerous impactsthat my people are experiencing every day. Sadly to date no significant progress has been made onclimate-change mitigation. Time and again  I haveasked  “How do I tell my people that their plight andtheir future lie in the hands of those most responsiblefor greenhouse gases?”From our point of view  we must step up ourcollective efforts to confront global climate changemore urgently and more creatively. What is needednow is to close the ambition gap. I therefore call on themajor emitters to step up their level of commitmentunder the Kyoto Protocol. Our very existence dependson it. Without international cooperation and assistance we are helpless against the adverse impacts of climatechange.Micronesia has barely contributed to the problemof climate change; it has  in fact  contributed to some ofthe solutions thereto. We actively participate in UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Changenegotiations and continue to advocate for significantcuts in greenhouse-gas emissions.We were therefore pleased with the agreementreached this summer in Rio to begin cooperation on aglobal phase-down in the production and consumption ofhydrof luorocarbons (HFCs). Micronesia first proposedamending the Montreal Protocol on Substances thatDeplete the Ozone Layer in 2009. Today it remainsthe ideal venue for a phase-down of the productionand consumption of HFCs  just as has been done withrespect to similar gases that HFCs were invented toreplace.To the rest of the world  the map may look fairlyempty on our side of the globe  but to all of us it isas much a homeland as any continental land mass. Wemust treat it accordingly  and we must defend it just asstrongly. And therein lies our second  closely relatedchallenge: the change in our ocean environment. Thatchange includes not only rising tides and temperaturesand ocean acidification  but also the damage caused byharmful and destructive fishing practices  pollutantssuch as mercury and oil  and other waste resulting fromunsustainable human activity. The abhorrent practice ofillegal  unreported and unregulated fishing continuesunabated  and urgent actions to reduce by-catch  fishdiscards and post-harvest losses must be taken.For us  as a Pacific small island developing State our livelihood  our economy  our culture and ourway of living are tied to a blue economy. We haverecognized that the conservation and sustainable useof the ocean and its resources are key elements inachieving sustainable development. We must fulfil ourcommitments made at Rio.My country welcomes the decision taken in Rioto hold a global conference on small island developingStates in 2014. Micronesia fully supports that decisionand reiterates its call to hold such a conference in one ofthe Pacific small island developing States.The rising cost of global energy continues to posea serious challenge to our socioeconomic developmentand sustainability. Small island developing States suchas Micronesia continue to rely heavily on importedfossil fuel despite the abundance of renewable energysources. Our unique and particular vulnerabilitiesoften translate into significantly higher costs for energyinfrastructure and fossil fuels. As a consequence  ourGovernments spend a high percentage of our limitedbudgets on fossil-fuel procurement alone  often at theexpense of the other sectors of our economies.To mitigate that situation  small island developingStates adopted the Barbados Declaration on AchievingSustainable Energy for All in Small Island DevelopingStates  which has become an annex to the outcomedocument of the United Nations Conference onSustainable Development  adopted last June. Thatis a concrete expression of the small islands’ owndetermination and ambition to promote renewableenergy  energy efficiency  energy access and low-carbon development.However  our transition to renewable energyrequires financing and new  appropriate and affordabletechnology. To that end  I must recognize and commendthe bilateral assistance already provided in that area bythe European Union  Japan  China  the United States France  Italy and Turkey  as well as others that are alsoassisting through other multilateral arrangements. Weurge other partners to join us to ensure sustainability.We also urge support for the Secretary-General’sinitiative on “Sustainable Energy for All”.Our health-care system is increasingly understress and facing constant challenges from the growingburden of non-communicable diseases  which hasreached epidemic proportions in the Pacific. While weaccept that the primary responsibility for health restswith our Government  we are seeking assistance fromthe international community in capacity-building institutional strengthening and policy formulation.While we recognize the contributing effects of nutritionand lifestyle in that epidemic  we are also mindful of thefact that climate change has magnified the challenge asa result of the threat it poses to food security and thetraditional lifestyle of Micronesians.The Federated States of Micronesia supports thegreater participation of women in social  politicaland economic development. We look to developmentpartners to enhance our investment in ensuring that thepotential of women is nurtured and realized throughquality education  health-care services and securitymeasures against domestic and gender-based violence.It is only appropriate that measures to empower womento be true participants in nation-building should belocally driven. We have embarked on mainstreamingwomen’s views  interests and contributions into nationaldevelopment policies. We recognize and appreciatethe assistance extended by the United Nations systemand our development partners to support our nationalpolicies to enhance gender equality.Turning to our Organization  the single most urgentneed is to reform the Security Council. Naturally  suchan important step must not be taken in haste. However after more than a decade of talking  we should be closeto finding an acceptable formulation. Success on thisissue will strengthen the Organization and stimulateand renew confidence in the Charter.My country subscribes to the principles of peace security and prosperity  as enshrined in the Charter ofthe United Nations. We are horrified by the senselesskilling of thousands of innocent civilians in Syria.Over the past two weeks  we have witnessed surgesin violence. We join the international community incondemning violence  in particular the attacks ondiplomatic missions  diplomats and personnel in Libyaand Egypt. We must be bold in our actions to preventsuch attacks. I call on Member States to continue theirefforts to find peaceful solutions to these conflicts especially the most challenging ones.The United Nations has the unique opportunityto address and solve the many challenges facing itsweakest and most vulnerable States Members. Thechallenge lies in how the Organization and its most ableMembers can turn their many ambitious statementsinto mobilizing the required resources to successfullyprotect the citizens of the world.We in the Federated States of Micronesia  facingour troubled world  continue to place our faith in theUnited Nations as we look towards future. Our isolationamid the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean no longershields us from the threat of international terrorism.Globalization has long had a foothold on our islandState. Facebook links us to the world.Allow me to end with a quote from my Constitution:“The seas bring together  they do not separate us ....We extend to all nations what we seek from each:peace  friendship  cooperation and love in our commonhumanity”."
"61",2507,"GAB",67,2012,"﻿Iwarmly congratulate the President on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. His election demonstrates the esteem in whichhe and his country  Serbia  are held on the internationalscene. I can assure him that he has the support ofmy country  Gabon. I also commend the outstandingwork done by his predecessor  Mr. Nassir AbdulazizAl-Nasser  during his presidency of the Assembly at itssixty-sixth session. And I would like to reiterate ourconfidence in the efforts that Secretary-General BanKi-moon is undertaking as the head of the Organization.Our world more than ever needs a dialogueof civilizations and cultures. In order to build amore peaceful world  it needs more tolerance  moreunderstanding and more respect among peoples. Duringthis session  we are called upon to redefine the outlinesfor better management of global challenges. I wouldlike to welcome the theme chosen by the President forthis session  namely  “Bringing about adjustment orsettlement of international disputes or situations bypeaceful means”  which will remain at the heart of ourcommon efforts and is indeed an ongoing quest.The debate we held yesterday on the rule of lawat the national and international levels was also adiscussion of the conditions for peace in our countriesand around the world. By maintaining our focus onthat goal and working together  we can better tacklethe challenges of an international context that is stillmarked by multifaceted crises  illustrated by manyhotbeds of tension around the world. That is shown bythe situations in the Middle East and Africa  which arestill of concern to us.The Syrian crisis  which arose as an extension ofthe Arab Spring last year  is having a destabilizingimpact on several countries of the Middle East region.We hope that the efforts undertaken by the Joint SpecialRepresentative  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  will help put astop to confrontation and will open up a dialogue.With respect to the situation in Mali  we condemnthe attempts to divide the country and the destruction ofthe World Heritage sites in Timbuktu. Gabon supportsthe efforts of the new transitional Government  theEconomic Community of West African States and theAfrican Union to try to re-establish territorial integrity.I urge the Security Council and Member Statesto support the United Nations integral regionalstrategy on the Sahel  which addresses issues ofsecurity  governance  development  human rights andhumanitarian concerns.When we served on the Security Council  wejoined other members in responding to the appeals ofthe Libyan people. The situation there is still dire  andwe encourage the United Nations to continue to work topromote political stability and reconstruction efforts.We reiterate our condemnation of the attack on theUnited States Consulate in Benghazi.With regard to the ongoing tensions in the easternpart of our brother country the Democratic Republicof the Congo  our collective support for the CongoleseState must be maintained in security  political andhumanitarian matters.I welcome the progress made in Somalia with theadoption of its provisional Constitution and the electionof the new President  Hassan Sheikh Mohamud  whomI congratulate and commend. Gabon will continue tohelp Somalia  as it did last year with humanitariancontributions. I commend United Nations and AfricanUnion involvement in Somalia. Thanks to the AfricanUnion Mission in Somalia and to Government forces security is improving even far outside Mogadishu. Ihave the highest praise for the country  whose troopspay a heavy price on the ground.I honour the memory of the first Prime Minister ofEthiopia  Meles Zenawi  who passed away on 22 August.All of us know of his work for peace in Somalia and theSudan  his commendable tenures as Chair of the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development Heads of Stateand Government Orientation Committee and his focuson climate change.It goes without saying that the crises and conflictsthat continue to ravage the world constitute a profoundbetrayal of the cry-from-the-heart aspirations of allpeoples for peace and security  justice  developmentand the equal sovereignty of States. Those cries comefrom the people of Palestine and Cuba  who long for abetter future. One wants recognition of a State living inpeace and security with its neighbours  within secure internationally recognized borders  while the otherwants an end to the economic  commercial and financialembargo it suffers under. The General Assembly hasmany times spoken out on the side of those two peoples’aspirations  through numerous resolutions  which mycountry has unequivocally supported.To fulfil the aspirations of all peoples  we need globalgovernance that is more balanced  more democratic better structured and based on the principles of theCharter of the United Nations. Such governance must be founded on the primacy of international law andrespect for the sovereignty of States in their quest fordemocracy and development.Throughout the coming sixty-seventh session wewill focus on certain priority issues  starting withvarious reforms of the Organization  especially therevitalization of the General Assembly  to make it betterable to play its part given the changes and current realitiesin the world. We must strengthen the Assembly’s roleas an active force and as the premier forum for globaldemocracy. Likewise  in its commitment to SecurityCouncil reform  Gabon continues to support permanentand equitable representation for Africa.As we did during our recent tenure on the Council we will continue our focus on mediation  preventionand the peaceful resolution of disputes and conflicts.We believe action must be taken before disputesescalate into armed conflict  sparing the heavy expenseof peacekeeping operations. But current realities forceus to focus also on new  cross-cutting threats to peaceand security  including trafficking in small arms andlight weapons and maritime piracy  which is ravagingthe Gulf of Guinea.That is why we are working along withother countries in Central Africa to put in placeconfidence-building measures  including the earlywarning mechanism for Central Africa. We greatlyappreciate the support offered by the United NationsRegional Office for Central Africa  which my countryhosts  in promoting peace.During my tenure as Acting Chairman of theEconomic Community of West African States  I willemphasize regional integration as a means to commoneconomic development and strengthening peacefulconnections among member States.We know that the conflicts shaking the world havenumerous and complex causes. Any lasting settlementof those crises requires an approach that combinessupport for institution-building and governance in theaffected countries with initiatives to revitalize theireconomies. Gabon will therefore follow with greatinterest the issue of an increased role for the Economicand Social Council.Many countries remain concerned with economicconditions. We must therefore rethink our approachesto sustainable development initiatives. We must reflectclearly on the post-2015 development agenda  especiallyon how to coordinate the Millennium DevelopmentGoals and the sustainable development goals enunciatedin the outcome of the United Nations Conference onSustainable Development (Rio+20) (resolution 66/288).It is also crucial to break the impasse in theWorld Trade Organization by rethinking the basis fornegotiations. We will thereby be better able to promotethe tripartite model of aid together with investment andtrade towards sustainable development.During last year’s session I referred to workin progress in my country towards the goal we setfor ourselves to become an emerging country by2025. Since then that initiative has begun to produceresults in the creation of strategic infrastructures strengthening the rule of law and social  politicaland economic reforms. We continue to take steps todiversify our economy through local promotion of thenatural resources we export  which encourages wealthcreation and employment. Those efforts must be basedon sustainable management of our forests and theirbiodiversity  which plays an important role in the globalenvironment. In that vein we are fighting poaching andthe illegal trafficking in protected species.I am also pleased at the adoption  on 21 June  ofthe outcome of the Rio+20 Conference  which reflectsthe international community’s recognition of the needto work together to promote sustainable developmentthrough the joint efforts of individuals  Governments civil society and the private sector. Along those lines Ihave instructed my Government to rethink our country’sinstitutional framework for sustainable development with an eye to enacting legislation on the subject.Gabon is also pursuing the opportunities offered by agreen economy in eradicating poverty.We are also continuing to develop our humanresources  our financial services capabilities  newinformation technologies and ecotourism. Givencurrent economic challenges  I recently institutedmeasures to improve the daily lives of my fellowcitizens by tackling the cost of living — for instance by suspending customs duties and the value added-taxon several basic items and building materials.In the social arena  we have put in place a nationalsystem of health coverage for all strata of Gabonesesociety. That coverage  which is part of our fight againstHIV/AIDS  includes free antiretrovirals and prenataland maternal care for all infected pregnant women.At the political level  we have introduced biometricsto improve the organization of the next elections. We continue our efforts to talk with all leading players inthe nation  in particular through the National Councilfor Democracy.Together  those actions strengthen the climate ofpeace bequeathed to us by my illustrious predecessor thereby creating an environment conducive to the well-being of citizens and to the security of investmentsneeded for the development of the country. We aretherefore ready to welcome diversified and mutuallybeneficial partnerships and look forward to doing so.Our countries and the international community asa whole must today overcome considerable challenges.Our efforts can fulfil the aspirations of our peoples onlyif we cooperate to achieve global governance based onrespect for the rule of law  dialogue among peoples conflict prevention  protection of the environment andbiodiversity. Our ultimate goal must be  above all  thewell-being of our peoples.It is in that spirit that my country will continue tomake its contribution both in our Organization and inour common work for peace  security  development andprosperity for all."
"62",2554,"GBR",67,2012,"﻿I am proud thatthis year Britain welcomed the world to the Olympicand Paralympic games and put on a great display showing that while we may have only the twenty-second-largest population in the world  we can roll outone of its warmest welcomes.I am honoured  too  that in the coming year I havebeen asked to co-chair the high-level panel designed tohelp us build on one of the greatest achievements of the United Nations  the Millennium Development Goals.Britain takes that work very seriously. I am convincedthat we need to focus more than ever on the buildingblocks that take countries and people from poverty toprosperity. By those building blocks I mean the absenceof conflict and corruption and the presence of propertyrights and the rule of law. We should never forget thatfor many in the world the closest relative of poverty isinjustice. Development has never been just about aidor money  but I am proud that Britain is a country thatkeeps its promises to the poorest in our world.A year ago I stood here and argued that the ArabSpring represented an unprecedented opportunity foradvancing peace  prosperity and security. One yearon  some believe that the Arab Spring is in danger ofbecoming an Arab winter. They point to the riots onthe streets  to Syria’s descent into a bloody civil war  tofrustration at the lack of economic progress and to theemergence of newly elected Islamist-led Governmentsacross the region.But I believe those people are in danger of drawingthe wrong conclusion. Today is not the time to turn back but to keep the faith and to redouble our support for opensocieties and for people’s demands for a job and a voice.Yes  the path is challenging. But democracy is not  andnever has been  simply about holding an election. It isnot one person  one vote  once. Democracy is aboutestablishing the building blocks of true democracy:the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law with the majority prepared to defend the rights of theminority; the freedom of the media; a proper place forthe army in society; and the development of effectiveState institutions  political parties and a wider civilsociety.I am not so naive as to believe that democracyalone has some magical healing power. I am a liberalConservative  not a neo-conservative. I respect eachcountry’s different histories and traditions. I welcomethe steps taken in countries where reform is happeningwith the consent of the people. I know that everycountry takes its own path  and that progress willsometimes be slow. Some countries have achievedstability and success based on tradition and consent.Others have endured decades in which the institutionsof civil society were deliberately destroyed  politicalparties banned  free media abolished and the rule oflaw twisted for the benefit of the few. We cannot expectthe damage of decades to be put right in a matter ofmonths. But the drive for opportunity  justice and the rule of law and the hunger for a job and a voice are notresponsible for the problems in the region. In fact  quitethe opposite: the building blocks of democracy  faireconomies and open societies are part of the solution not part of the problem. We in the United Nationsmust step up our efforts to support the people of thosecountries as they build their own democratic future.Let me take the key arguments in turn. First  thereare those who say there has been too little progress that the Arab Spring has produced few tangibleimprovements in people’s lives. That is not right. Lookat Libya since the fall of Al-Qadhafi. We have seenelections to create a new Congress  and now plans tointegrate armed groups into the national police andarmy. None of that is to ignore the huge and soberingchallenges that remain.The murder of Ambassador Chris Stevens was adespicable act of terrorism. But the right response isto finish the work that Chris Stevens gave his life to.That is what the vast majority of Libyans want  too  aswe saw so inspiringly in Benghazi last weekend  whenthey took to the streets in the thousands  refusing toallow extremists to hijack their chance for democracy.The Arab Spring has also brought progress inEgypt  where the democratically elected Presidenthas asserted civilian control over the military; inYemen and Tunisia  where elections have brought newGovernments to power; and in Morocco  where thereis a new Constitution and a Prime Minister appointedon the basis of a popular vote for the first time. Evenfurther afield  Somalia has also taken the first vital stepforward by electing a new President. So there has beenprogress. None of it would have come about withoutpeople standing up last year and demanding change or without the United Nations having the courage torespond to those crises.Secondly  there is the argument that the removal ofdictators has somehow started to unleash a new wave ofviolence  extremism and instability. Some argue that ina volatile region  only an authoritarian strong man canmaintain stability and security. Or even  some argue that recent events prove that democracy in the MiddleEast brings terrorism  not security  and sectarianconflict  not peace. Again  I believe we should rejectthat argument.I have no illusions about the danger that politicaltransition can be exploited by violent extremists. Iunderstand the importance of protecting people and defending national security. Britain is determinedto work with our allies to do that. But democracyand open societies are not the problem. The fact isthat  for decades  too many were prepared to toleratedictators like Al-Qadhafi and Al-Assad on the basisthat they would keep their people safe at home andpromote stability in the region and the wider world. Infact  neither was true. Not only were theose dictatorsrepressing their people  ruling by control not by consent plundering the national wealth  and denying peopletheir basic rights and freedoms  they were fundingterrorism overseas as well. Brutal dictatorships madethe region more dangerous not less; more dangerousbecause those regimes dealt with frustration at homeby whipping up anger against their neighbours  againstthe West  against Israel; and more dangerous  too because people denied a job and a voice were given noalternative but a dead-end choice between dictatorshipand extremism.What was heartening about the events of TahrirSquare was that the Egyptian people found their voiceand rejected that false choice. They withheld theirconsent from a Government that had lost all legitimacy and they chose instead the road to a more open and fairsociety. The road is not easy  but it is the right one. Ibelieve it will make countries safer in the end.Next  there are those who say that  whatever mayhave been achieved elsewhere  in Syria the Arab Springhas unleashed a vortex of sectarian violence and hatredwith the potential to destroy the whole region. Syriadoes present some profound challenges. But those wholook at Syria today and blame the Arab Spring have gotit the wrong way round. We cannot blame the peoplefor the behaviour of a brutal dictator. The responsibilitylies with the brutal dictator himself.Al-Assad is today inf laming Syria’s sectariantensions  just as his father did as far back as the slaughterin Hama 30 years ago. And not only in Syria; Al-Assadhas colluded with those in Iran who are set on draggingthe region into wider conflict. The only way out ofSyria’s nightmare is to move forward towards politicaltransition and not to give up the cause of freedom. Thefuture for Syria is a future without Al-Assad. It has tobe based on mutual consent  as was clearly agreed inthe International Conference on Syria held in Genevain June. If anyone was in any doubt about the horrorsthat Al-Assad has inf licted on his people  just look atthe evidence published this week by Save the Children:schools used as torture centres  children used for target practice. A 16-year-old Syrian called Wael who wasdetained in a police station in Daraa said: “I have seenchildren slaughtered. No  I do not think I will ever beOK again...lf there was even 1 per cent of humanity inthe world  this would not happen”.The blood of those young children is a terrible stainon the reputation of the United Nations. In particular it is a stain on those who have failed to stand up tothese atrocities and those who in some cases aidedand abetted Al-Assad’s regime of terror. lf the UnitedNations Charter is to have any value in the twenty-first century  we must now join together to supporta rapid political transition. At the same time  no oneof conscience can turn a deaf ear to the voices ofsuffering. Security Council members have a particularresponsibility to support the United Nations appeal forSyria. Britain  already the third biggest donor  is todayannouncing a further $12 million in humanitariansupport  including new support for UNICEF’s workto help Syrian children. We look to our internationalpartners to do more as well.Of course  the Arab Spring has not removedovernight the profound economic challenges thatthese countries face. Too many countries face fallinginvestment  rising food prices and bigger trade deficits.But it is completely wrong to suggest that the ArabSpring has somehow created those economic problems.It is a challenging time for the world economy asa whole. There was never going to be an economictransformation overnight  not least because far frombeing successful open-market-based economies  manyof these countries were beset by vested interests andcorruption  with unaccountable institutions. That has one might say  created a double problem. Not justfragile economies  but worse  people were told they hadexperienced free enterprise and open markets whenthey had experienced nothing of the sort.So we must help these countries unwind the legacyof endemic corruption  military expenditure theycannot afford  natural resources unfairly exploited; inshort  the mass kleptocracy that they suffered under fortoo long.While I am on the subject of stolen assets  we alsohave a responsibility to help these countries get backthe stolen assets that are rightfully theirs  just as wehave returned billions of dollars of assets to Libya. Itis simply not good enough that the Egyptian peoplecontinue to be denied those assets long after Mubarakhas gone.Today  I am announcing a new British task force towork with the Egyptian Government to gather evidence trace assets  work to change European Union law andpursue the legal cases that will return the stolen moneyto its rightful owners  the Egyptian people.Finally  perhaps most challenging of all for Westerncountries like mine  is the argument that electionshave simply opened the door to Islamist parties whosevalues are incompatible with truly open societies. Myresponse to this is clear. We should respect the outcomeof elections. But we should not compromise on ourdefinition of what makes an open society. We shouldjudge Islamists by what they do.The test is this. Will they entrust the rights ofcitizenship to fellow countrymen and countrywomenwho do not share their specific political or religiousviews? Do they accept that  unlike the dictators theyreplaced  they should never pervert the democraticprocess to hold onto power if they lose the consentof the people they serve? Will they live up to theircommitments to protect the rule of law for all citizens to defend the rights of Christians and minorities andto allow women a full role in society  in the economyand in politics? The truth is this: we cannot buildstrong economies  we cannot build open societies andwe cannot have inclusive political systems if we lockout women. The eyes of the world today may be on thebrothers  but the future is as much in the hands of theirmothers  their sisters and their daughters.Holding Islamists to account must also mean thatif they attempt to undermine the stability of othercountries  encourage terrorism instead of peace orpromote conflict instead of partnership  we will opposethem. That is why Iran will continue to face the fullforce of sanctions and scrutiny from the United Nationsuntil it gives up its ambitions to spread a nuclear shadowover the world. It is also why we should not waver fromour insistence that Hamas give up violence. Hamas mustnot be allowed to dictate the way forward. Palestiniansshould have the chance to fulfil the same aspirations fora job and a voice as others in the region  and we supporttheir right to have a State and a home. And Israelisshould be able to fulfil their own aspirations to live inpeace and security with their neighbours.Of course there are challenges in working withGovernments that have different views and culturaltraditions. But there is a fundamental differencebetween Islam and extremism. Islam is a great religionobserved peacefully and devoutly by more than 1 billion people. Islamist extremism is a warped politicalideology supported by a minority that seeks to hijackthat great religion  to gain respectability for its violentobjectives. It is vital that we make that distinction.In Turkey  we see a Government with roots inIslamic values but with democratic politics  an openeconomy and a responsible attitude to supportingchange in Libya  Syria and elsewhere in the region.I profoundly believe the same path is open to Egypt Tunisia and their neighbours. We must help them takeit. Democracy and Islam can flourish alongside oneanother. Let us judge Governments not by their religion but by how they act and what they do. Let us engage withthe new democratic Governments in Egypt  Tunisia andLibya so their success can strengthen democracy  notundermine it.There is no doubt that we are in the midst ofprofound change and that many uncertainties lieahead. But the building blocks of democracy  faireconomies and open societies are part of the solution not the problem. Indeed  nothing in the last year haschanged my fundamental conviction. The Arab Springrepresents a precious opportunity for people to realizetheir aspirations for a job  a voice and a stake in theirfuture. We in the United Nations must do everythingwe can to support them."
"63",2578,"GEO",67,2012,"﻿It is always a greathonour for me to address the General Assembly. TheAssembly gives us a unique opportunity to debate thekey challenges of our world and time  and to identifyand confront the problems that our nations are facing.It is a moment of collective ref lection and it should bea moment of truth.Today  20 months after the act of despair of ayoung Tunisian citizen that strongly shook the worldand generated so many hopes around the globe  manypeople have doubts.Some are telling us that the images of liberationand joy seen around the world have been replaced bybroken promises  despair and chaos  that the worldwas better off when fewer people were free  and thatthe international system was more stable when fewersocieties were open.I have come here today to make the oppositeargument. I have come here today to make the case foropen societies.After the horrible attack on the United Statesconsulate in Benghazi and the death of AmbassadorChris Stevens  I called the American Ambassador inGeorgia to convey my condolences and to speak to him to share my sorrow and express my support for thisunique nation.I was struck by what he told me. I was struck bythe fact that American diplomats  beyond their pain andtheir anger  still believed so clearly that the liberation ofLibya was fundamentally a good thing. Just a few daysago  the United States Ambassador in my country wasproved right by the demonstrations held by the citizensof Benghazi  who went out to protest against extremist  militias and to show their support for the achievementof peace and prosperity in their own country.I was also struck by the visit last week to the UnitedStates by Aung San Suu Kyi  the joyous reception thatAmerica gave her  and her desire to come and tellher story with serenity and determination  a story ofprogress towards freedom in the face of seeminglyimpossible odds.Twenty months after the act of despair and tragicdeath of Mohamed Bouazizi  there are many whodoubt the cause to which Ambassador Stevens gave hislife  who doubt the vision of Aung San Suu Kyi  whodoubt freedom. I am totally certain that the skepticsare wrong. A free society has never meant a societywithout problems. On the contrary  an open society hasproblems  exposes them  shows them  deals with themand does not neglect them  because it keeps argumentsopen and gives Government a chance to be accountable.An open society is a place where improvementsare often reached through noisy  painful and chaoticprocesses. Montesquieu wrote a long time ago that ifeveryone agrees with the Government and everyoneagrees with one another  that is not a country; that is acemetery.I speak from personal experience. My own countryconfronted democracy’s challenges once again this pastweek when evidence emerged of abuses in our prisonsystem. The facts were sickening  and our responsibilitywas clear. Our reaction was swift  and we did whatdemocracies must do. We identified those responsible and they were all arrested. Two Government Ministershave resigned  and we put in charge of the prison systemits fiercest critic: the Georgian human rights defender Georgia’s ombudsman. That is how democracies learn;that is how we improve.That is how my own Government has overcomepast errors and challenges to emerge stronger  moreeffective and ever more committed to building andinstitutionalizing an open society.It is clear that there are no shortcuts to accountability and no fast-track lines to freedom. Building andmaintaining an open society entails a painful learningprocess and significant risk-taking. But the conclusionwe must draw in this respect  from Georgia to theevents in Myanmar  is this: such risks are worth taking.I am speaking to the Assembly on the eve of crucialelections in my country. I realize clearly the magnitude of the challenges that face this body and this troubledworld  from the menace of nuclear proliferation toglobal warming and poverty. But today I ask forthe Assembly’s attention with respect to the eventsunfolding in Georgia  because I believe that they arepart of the broader  global question facing us today:whether the quest for democracy and freedom can andwill endure.I came here to say that Georgia will remain an opensociety. That is the choice of our citizens  and there isno alternative to this. On 1 October  my nation willvote in parliamentary elections. We look forward tothat day and to the opportunity to renew and strengthenthe fundamental social contract that allows citizens tofreely judge and choose their leaders.Georgia has conducted several elections in recentyears  all of which were monitored by internationalobservers and all of which were free and fair. We live ina world in which yesterday’s accomplishments are neverenough  and I have made a commitment to the effectthat this year’s vote will be even more free and fairthan the previous ones. We have taken numerous stepsto pursue that goal. We have increased public fundingand given free airtime on all national channels for adsfrom all political parties  in addition to whatever theycan buy with their own money. We have proposed to allnational television channels a “must carry/must offer”requirement  to ensure that all private cable networks large and small  broadcast all news-based television and they have accepted that proposal.We have welcomed the first televised debate in ourcountry’s history between candidates for Prime Ministerand heads of candidate lists. We have initiated a codeof conduct to eradicate political intimidation  the useof administrative resources  vote-buying  campaign-related violence and hate speech in any shape or form which for so many years was used to promote hatredagainst ethnic and religious minorities.Regrettably  not all actors in the Georgian politicalarena share those principles  and some are purposefullyworking to undermine the legitimacy of Georgia’sdemocratic institutions — how they are perceived athome and by the international community.Our response to deliberate attempts to short-circuit our democracy is straightforward: democratic transparent and rule-of-law-based processes will notbe compromised. This is not only my demand; it is thedemand of the people of Georgia.Georgia is a young democracy  and we know thevalue that comes from partnerships and engagementwith the international community. As in the past we have once again opened our doors and invitedcredible international election monitors to visit ourcountry  including the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe  the European Parliament  theNATO Parliamentary Assembly  the United StatesCongress and respected international non-governmentalorganizations.To date  the interim reports of almost every electionobservation mission have consistently underscored thatthese are the most competitive elections in Georgia’shistory. On 1 October  notwithstanding significantattempts to undermine that dynamic  the Georgianpeople will make their decision. I am confident thatGeorgian democracy will prevail and reject those whoseek to close Georgia’s doors.Georgian democracy will prevail if  and only if Georgian elections remain a Georgian process. Today in this forum  I am obliged to draw the Assembly’sattention to externally generated security threats tomy country. The European Union monitoring missionhas just announced that Russian forces are currentlyundertaking a massive  illegal military buildup occupying territory inside Georgia  on the formerterritory of South Ossetia  which is within Georgia’sinternationally recognized borders.Even as we speak  they are bringing offensiveweapons and troops inside our internationallyrecognized borders.The Russian military has made the extraordinarydecision to hold large-scale military exercises in theNorth and the South Caucasus on the eve and aroundthe time of our elections. One cannot imagine anapproach more provocative and irresponsible thanthat of mobilizing military forces during this crucialmoment of any nation’s democratic life.There has been involvement by Russia for months:first  billions of dollars in Russian money came into theGeorgian election campaign. Lots of other resourceswere allocated  and now Russian troops are trying to besome kind of background players in this process. Thatis why I call today on all our allies and friends  and allmembers of goodwill in the international community not to ignore or dismiss this worrisome development.I would like to use this opportunity to ask the worldto pay attention during the next few days  to speak ina unified voice against these threats  in support of oursovereignty and democratic institutions.In short  the vigilance and engagement of MemberStates is required to ensure that history does not repeatitself and that 2012 does not become a repeat of 2008  orespecially of 1921  when Russia ended our independenceand we became a place that was dominated by violenceand oppression for 70-plus years.We should look at what has happened in recentyears. We had a massive-scale invasion by Russia the successor to the Soviet Union  in 2008. We are acountry of just 4.7 million people — less than 5 millionpeople — and that country is 100 times larger  andwell armed. If we look at history  we see that duringthe twentieth century it invaded many countries. TheSoviet Union invaded Baltic countries; it invaded largeparts of Poland and ended its independence.In 1956 the Soviet Union invaded Hungary  killedits President and ended its independence. In 1968 itinvaded Czechoslovakia  deposed its Government andended its independence. In 1979 it invaded a muchbigger country than Georgia  Afghanistan  killed itsPresident within one hour and ended its independence.In 2008 it invaded our country  a smaller country thanany of those I have mentioned  and occupied part of itsterritory.However  none of the strategic goals of the Russianinvasion was achieved. They had three explicit goals ininvading Georgia. The first was to depose the GeorgianGovernment  end Georgian democracy and physicallydestroy Georgia’s leadership. Those are not my wordsor a conspiracy theory. That is what they themselvesovertly stated in every open and closed internationalforum. The second goal was to shut off the energy supplyfor different regions of the world and to monopolize theenergy supply in the part of the world where Russialies. That totally failed. Georgia is developing and itsenergy corridor is developing. The third goal was tostop the enlargment of NATO and to halt any kind ofinclusion of the region into international organizations.Russia also failed at that goal.We often say that after the Russians failed tophysically destroy the Georgian leadership  failed tosucceed in any of the purposes of their invasion andbasically were forced to stay where they are  withinoccupied territories — in what most of the world and most international organizations call illegallyoccupied territories  meaning that they will have towithdraw — now they are trying to undermine usbecause they have a strong sense of unfinished business.It is not just the fate of a small country of lessthan 5 million people that is being played out in thisscenario. The fate of the whole post-Soviet space isbeing played out  affecting 400 to 500 million people.Because Russia failed to destroy Georgian democracyin 2008  countries in Central Asia such as Ukraine andBelarus  people in the Republic of Moldova and EasternEurope  all think that freedom is the right choice afterall and that even the smallest free country cannot beundermined and destroyed if it stands strong and unitedand if the international community is there to help. Thatsets a very bad example from the Russian point of view.On the other hand  because of Georgia’s reformsand because of our openness to the great nation ofRussia  we introduced visa-free travel for tourists fromRussia. One million tourists will travel to Georgiafrom Russia this year and they will take back 1 millionstories of successful development  of a country withnew hospitals  with new cities  with sharply reducedpoverty — a country moving towards universal healthcoverage and that has enjoyed double-digit growth  andis this year enjoying 8 per cent growth. It is a countrythat  even without oil and gas  is looking much betterthan most of the Russian region. Indeed  Russia’s then-President Medvedev had to acknowledge twice in oneweek  in an open forum of journalists and his ownparliament  that Georgian reforms were so successfulthat Russia had no choice but to study and copy them even if they hate the Georgian leadership.That is the ideological issue. That is why they wantus out. That is why they want Georgia off the map. It isbecause if Georgia survives and if Georgia continues it sets a bad example for all the others  including theRussian people themselves  from the point of view ofthe present Russian Government. The prison scandalwe had recently involved things that happen almostevery day in Russia  and are reported on social mediain Russia as frequently  and no one there gives a damnabout it. In the first case that came up in Georgia  twoministers and scores of others were arrested  which alsosets a bad example in the eyes of people who want tosuppress freedom. That is why it is so important thatGeorgian democracy is back and safe. It means that thewhole post-Soviet space  our whole part of the world will move in the right direction.I call on the world to pay attention and send theright signals. I make the call knowing what ourresponsibilities are. In the face of the threats confrontingus  our commitment to democracy and transparency ismore important than ever. We remember the words ofthe American founding father who said that whoeversacrifices his freedom for security deserves neither.That is not just our response; it is the best response. Ourtransformation and the hostility it has generated amongthose who feel threatened by freedom have continued tomake Georgia a test case for the entire region. What is atstake in Georgia today is the very idea that democracycan thrive in our part of the world.Our common legacy from the dark time of the SovietUnion is now almost gone from Georgia. Organizedcrime — and Georgia was a hotbed of organizedcrime — is now almost gone from Georgia. Most ofthat legacy has migrated to other countries  includingRussia. Corruption  coercion  intimidation  oppression cynicism and despair: we condemn that way of life  thatway of Government and of being governed. No  we can we should and we will overcome that legacy. We aredoing it in Georgia and it can be done everywhere else.Will we face strong opposition? Yes. And we arewell placed to say that  since our country is regularlythreatened with destruction and annihilation  for thevery reason that we choose another path — the path offreedom  the path of transparency and accountability the path of meritocracy and an open society — weknow how difficult it is to overcome those forces. Butwe know we can.Sovietism and post-Sovietism is not a fate.Organized crime and violence is not a fate. Slaveryis not a fate. Limited sovereignty as Brezhnev oncedefined it and Putin reshaped it is not a fate. Everycountry represented here is a free nation. We are allfree peoples  made up of free individuals  and ourfuture depends on us  on what we want and what we do.There is nothing easy about saying this  and I donot say it lightly. The Georgian people know the priceof freedom and still they think their freedom is worthit  because with freedom comes development andhappiness  true stability and true peace. Our regionwill one day become a zone where free people interactpeacefully  where respect will replace contempt.All the peoples of Central Asia and Eastern Europe Ukraine  the Republic of Moldova and Russia  theSouth Caucasus and North Caucasus  should hold hands together and shout down the voices of the past. Powerfulvoices continue to send the message that democracy transparency and accountability are not possible. Theysay that freedom  meritocracy and respect for humanrights are fundamentally alien. Georgia has proven themwrong. Our survival story has proven them wrong  justas many here today have in the past. As we have beenlearning from many people in the Hall  our efforts haveshown that corruption  intolerance  intimidation  fearand violence are neither cultural nor inevitable.Advanced democracy is a sign of a mature society.It is not easy to govern. Dissent  pluralism and vibrantdebate  which are threats to others  are strengths to us.Our view is clear. One cannot gain enduring stabilityat the expense of liberty  and one cannot ensure lastingprosperity by sacrificing individual rights. Those shortcuts never succeed in the long run.In every culture  in every society  in every cornerof the world  people will ultimately demand the rightto choose their own future. Only Governments thatmeet that demand will achieve true stability. Thefundamental contract is not always without difficulties.Governments that commit themselves to the processmust be prepared for turbulence and disagreement.What is difficult for elected leaders is often beneficialfor citizens; what is challenging for ruling parties isoften necessary for the State. In pursuing the goals offreedom and accountability  our common efforts mustbe governed by the rule of law and a commitment torespect these fundamental principles. Violence andintimidation can never be legitimized  and a minoritycan never forcibly impose its views on the will of themajority. Guns  money  threats  hatred  blackmail andfear cannot be allowed to hijack the process.At the same time  we recognize the potential threatof a majority trampling the rights and liberties of aminority. We respond to that threat by protecting theright to dissent  we respond by promoting pluralism we respond by allowing every voice to be heard. Andwe respond by the law. I can testify to how difficult theprocess is  but I can also state unequivocally that nolasting alternative exists.I want finally to share with the Assembly myhope and my trust. A few days from now  Georgiansfrom all social  religious and ethnic backgrounds willcollectively decide their future in an unoccupied partof our territory. They will express diverse opinions andwishes  and a new future for our nation will emerge.Openness will be further enshrined. Transparency willbe strengthened  and public accountability confirmed.The main thing that will be confirmed is that Georgiawill not go back. It will not be dragged back underany pressure  under any dirty money from the North under any threat of military exercise or direct militaryinvasion or mass-scale disturbances or the emergence ofsome kind of militias emerge  as some have threatened.It is not going to work.According to the European Union  we are the safestcountry and the least corrupt country in Europe withstrong Government institutions that cannot be bribedand cannot be undermined. By constantly renewing thesocial contract  which is at the heart of every democraticnation  we will ensure that democratic principles andpractices are with us for good.I trust the Georgian people. I trust the internationalcommunity and I trust that they will not allow othersto destroy the will of my people or destroy my smallnation’s choice. I stated earlier that democracy isa difficult  sometimes noisy system. It presentschallenges to those in and outside Government  and itforces leaders to place their trust in society. Personally I see no credible alternative  and I saw no better reasonto take risks. Fear is the paramount weapon of autocrats while trust is a definition of democrats.Let us all trust our citizens  even if autocraticforces much bigger than us are threatening us. Thebest defence for my country is openness  democracy transparency and the work of institutions against allof those forces  against all the international mafiasand against social and international pressures thatcontravene international law. Let us defend theinstitutions that support  strengthen and preserve ourchoice to be open and free."
"64",2625,"GHA",67,2012,"﻿In accordance with Ghanaiantradition and custom  I would like to begin with a basicbut essential courtesy by expressing  on behalf of theGovernment and people of my beloved country  ourdeepest gratitude and most profound appreciation to theUnited Nations and to the numerous world leaders whomourned with us following the sudden and untimelydeath of our former President  Mr. John Evans AttaMills. Ghanaians were touched by the many heartfeltmessages of condolence and the glowing tributes thatpoured in from all over the globe. Those messages ofgoodwill strengthened us and enabled us to transcendthe adversity of an occurrence that was unprecedentedin the history of Ghana.Mr. Mills was a dedicated and honourablestatesman. He committed himself to bringing aboutimprovement not only in the lives of Ghanaians but alsoin the lives of all other Africans  and indeed in the livesof individuals throughout the world. His death was asignificant loss  and I am certain that he will be sorelymissed by the international community.With the first-hand knowledge of what it meansfor a nation to lose its leader  I also want to take thisopportunity  on behalf of all Ghanaians  to extendcondolences to the people of Ethiopia  Malawi andGuinea-Bissau  who also suffered the untimely demiseof their sitting Presidents. May the souls of these greatmen  who gave so self lessly and helped to move ournations forward  rest in perfect peace.One of the lessons that I learned from the tragedyof Mr. Mills’s death — and it is a lesson worthsharing — is that it is during times such as these  timesof great sorrow and pain  that we often reveal the veryessence of who we are. That is as true of nations as it is of individuals. Over the past few months  Ghanaianshave shown ourselves to be resilient and respectful ofthe values that promote peace and the institutions thatsafeguard the stability of our democracy. In our processof healing from that great loss  we have become moreunited and more determined to stay the course that webegan in 1957  when we became the first sub-SaharanAfrican nation to gain independence. In the processof healing  we have become more confident than everbefore in our ability to create a better Ghana for ourchildren.Today’s assembly of Heads of State is being held ata most critical time. Our world is being confronted witha number of significant challenges. War  conflict andstrife are very much features of our present existence.Poverty  disease and famine continue to cripple thelives of many. Oppression  discrimination  illiteracyand unemployment still stif le the potential and shatterthe hopes of millions.Although examples of such conditions can be foundon every continent  for a while  whether rightly orwrongly  they seemed to be automatically and primarilyassociated with Africa. Perhaps that is why it gives mesuch great pleasure to lead my address to the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session with news ofprogress from Ghana and stories of success from theAfrican continent. Today  Africa boasts of some of thefastest-growing economies in the world  with Ghanabeing one of them. The number of countries engaged inconflict is steadily decreasing year after year. As thathappens  we are also witnessing a steady increase in thenumber of countries that are governed along democraticlines. As is true of all new democracies  those systemsare not without their f laws. While they may not beperfect  however  they are promising.In fact  three African countries that lost theirleaders this year — Ethiopia  Malawi and  of course Ghana — experienced seamless and peacefulconstitutional transitions of power to a new leadership.Members can see that  right now  something spectacularis happening in Africa. Growth is taking the placeof stagnation; tranquillity the place of turmoil; anddemocratic governance  founded on the rule of law  theplace of dictatorship.There is no denying the visibility and viability ofsuch significant developments. At the very least  theyrequire a re-examination of the long-held views andmisconceptions about the African continent. Those developments must also find expression in the mannerin which developed nations relate to Africa. In manyways  that is already taking place  but the shift has onlyjust begun. There is still much room for improvement.However  I am inspired by what I see  which arelimitless possibilities for Africa and its engagementwith the rest of the world.As the United Nations Human Development Indexattests  we in Ghana have made tremendous strides in anumber of areas  with the aim of improving the livingconditions of our people. Ghana is on track to achievethe targets set under the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. Significant progress has been made in thefollowing areas: reducing poverty  gender parity inschool enrolment  universal primary education  theprovision of safe drinking water and the fight againstHIV/AIDS.Unemployment is a challenge that exists on aglobal scale. Nearly all nations  be they developed ordeveloping  are grappling with finding ways to tacklethat potential threat to their economic stability. InGhana  we are attempting to deal with the problem asaggressively and as effectively as possible by findinglong-term and sustainable solutions. That includes aprogramme that we will launch to encourage youngpeople to become entrepreneurs  owning their ownbusinesses and thereby becoming employers ratherthan employees.In Africa  to say that the youth are our future isslightly misleading. Nearly 60 per cent of the continent’sentire population is below the age of 35. Our youngpeople are not only our future  but also our present. InGhana  we have been working assiduously to empowerand support our youth so as to ensure that they will notbe left behind owing to fast-changing global economic educational and social priorities.The Government is implementing several socialprotection programmes across various sectors to cushionthe poor and the vulnerable and to ensure that the fruitsof our economic growth are distributed equitably. Underthose programmes  massive investments have beenand are still being made in education  health care  themodernization of agriculture  the social infrastructureand direct payments to the poorest households.In furtherance of our battle against HIV/AIDS  anew five-year national strategic plan has been launchedto consolidate the gains already made in reducing theprevalence of the disease. Under the new plan  our targetis to achieve the virtual elimination of mother-to-childtransmission and to expand access to antiretroviraltherapy for persons living with HIV/AIDS.The Government of Ghana has committedapproximately $80 million as its contribution to thefinancing of the new strategic plan. However  that isnot enough. We now find ourselves in a rather ironicsituation that is threatening the advances we have madethus far. Ghana  like several other developing countriesthat have made remarkable headway in combatingHIV/AIDS  is becoming a victim of its own success.As the numbers associated with the disease — therates of infection and the mortality — go down  sotoo do the figures in the global funding for HIV/AIDSprogrammes. That leaves a considerable financing gapfor many African countries  such as Ghana  that aretrying not only to maintain their progress but also tomove closer to the complete eradication of the disease.In 1992  under the Constitution of its fourthrepublic  Ghana established itself as a multipartydemocracy. Since then  we have held five successfulelections  which have resulted in the smooth transferof power from one democratically chosen leader toanother. When it comes to transparency in the electoralexercise  Ghana is  in fact  held up as an example ofexcellence.We are just a few weeks away from conductingour sixth presidential and parliamentary election. AsPresident  I wish to assure the international communitythat that election will also be free  fair and peaceful.I am so certain of our stability through that processthat I extend a warm welcome to any individual ororganization that would like to come and monitor ourelections.The commitment to peace that I have pledged inthe past  and which I am pledging anew today  is inkeeping with a long-standing tradition that Ghana hasestablished domestically and internationally. In the1960s  when Ghana deployed 8 800 soldiers to whatis now the Democratic Republic of Congo  it went onrecord as the first African country to participate ina United Nations peacekeeping mission. Since then Ghana has continued to be an active and key partnerin the United Nations peacekeeping programme. It wasrecently ranked among the 10 largest contributors ofpersonnel to peacekeeping operations over the years.Currently  we have troops in five peacekeeping theatresthroughout the world.Ghana’s consistent championing of peace is neitheraccidental nor coincidental  but by design and bydetermination. We have always recognized that peace iscritical to development and to the overall improvementand enrichment of our people’s lives. It is therefore nowonder that  in 1961  when United States PresidentJohn F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps  its veryfirst mission was in Ghana.In the past two decades  Ghana’s position on peacehas been tested again and again as the West Africansubregion was ravaged by one civil war after another.However  we held firm to that position and will continueto do so.Because Ghana wishes to coexist harmoniouslywith all our neighbours  when legislating policy  weare always conscious of the importance of peace. Whenoffering asylum or a safe haven to refugees  we arealways protective of our borders  making certain thatpolitical conflict and ethnic tension do not cross overonto our soil. The unfolding tensions in Côte d’Ivoireand Mali have been and continue to be of particularconcern to us.Let me say that Ghana will not allow its territory tobe used to destabilize any other nation. We will not bethe storehouse for any resources or weapons that maybe used to disrupt the peace and development of anothernation. We will not harbour any individual or groupwhose intent is to use Ghana as a base of operations toundermine the safety and security of our neighbours.We will work under the ECOWAS protocol andwill utilize whatever other tools of diplomacy areat our disposal to ensure that security and peace areestablished in Mali and Côte d’Ivoire and that thosecountries find a place alongside their fellow Africancountries in the continent’s march forward towardsprosperity.Ghana has a strong belief in the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. Under the principleof the self-determination of peoples  Ghana was thefirst sub-Saharan country to emerge from colonialdomination. Our nation’s founding father  Mr. KwameNkrumah  proclaimed that the independence of Ghana ismeaningless unless it is linked with the total liberationof the African continent. In keeping with that right ofself-determination  we wish to restate our support for anindependent  prosperous Palestinian State  coexistingpeacefully with a free  stable Israeli State.We also reiterate our opposition to the continuousblockade on Cuba and call for an immediate lifting ofthat embargo.The twenty-first century can readily be describedas the century for Africa. Last year  of the 10 fastestgrowing economies in the world  six were African.Ghana  my own country  posted one of the highestgross domestic product growth rates  reaching as muchas 14 per cent. Foreign direct investment amountedto some $1.5 billion across various sectors. That typeof sustained growth in combination with security anddemocracy can only ensure an Africa that will bear noresemblance to the ghost of its former self. It will be anAfrica where we create equal opportunities for womento realize their full potential and where there is respectfor the rights of all human beings. The new Africa willwean itself from handouts and humanitarian relief. Itwill not continue to succumb to the corruption andoppression of despots.The new Africa will stand on the world stage asa mutual partner. True partnership  of course  mustbe based on equality. When the founding fathers ofthe United Nations established the Security Councilsome 66 years ago  it was based on the reality of thetime. Almost seven decades later  the paradigms anddynamics of the world have shifted dramatically. Thelines that divided our world and categorized it intohierarchies of first and third worlds — those lines weredrawn by settlers transforming once sovereign landsinto colonies and territories — all of those boundarieshave now become blurred.Technology has made information moreimmediately accessible to the general public andindividuals more accessible to one another. The worldthat we know today is not the same world our fathersand grandfathers knew. Our world is smaller  moreintegrated and familiar.The current realities call for greater inclusion inorder to consolidate our common security. They informGhana’s call for an expansion of the Security Councilto admit more members in order to have a meaningfulimpact on the many challenges that we all face. Africais ready for that true and sincere partnership. Our timehas come."
"65",2671,"GIN",67,2012,"﻿On behalfthe delegation of Guinea  which I have the greathonour to lead  I would like first of all to congratulatethe President on his election to guide the work of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session at a timewhen our Organization is facing multiple challenges.That mark of trust placed in him is a vibrant tributeto his country  the Republic of Serbia  as well as tohis recognized diplomatic qualities  which augur wellfor the success of our deliberations. His predecessor Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  of Qatar  deserves ourgratitude and thanks for his excellent work. I should alsolike to express my Government’s highest appreciationto the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for hisdynamism and determination in the exercise of hismandate.The theme of this session  “Bringing aboutadjustment or settlement of international disputes orsituations by peaceful means”  lies at the very heart ofthe uncertainty that weighs on the future of humanity.The emergence of new forms of violence at the handsof numerous actors and non-State groups  internationalterrorism  and above all the proliferation of small armsand light weapons  all constitute grounds for concern.While inter-State conflicts have decreased in recentyears  intra-State conflicts in certain regions of theworld have led to political instability  general insecurityand human tragedies  with their attendant economic social and environmental crises.It follows that the peaceful settlement of disputes as a fundamental principle of international relations is becoming more indispensable than ever for themaintenance of international peace and security. Thatprinciple requires sustainable preventive strategies andconcerted efforts on the part of regional and subregionalorganizations along with international developmentpartners. The critical need for States to promote anddefend the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations Charter and of international law is the bulwarkpar excellence against attempts against the territorialintegrity and sovereignty of States.International mediation as a means of preventionor a way to end violence through dialogue  along withnegotiation and the achievement of final agreements should be given pride of place. In that context  theGuinean delegation encourages the rapid deploymentof mediators and experts. It also wishes to offer itsemphatic support to the Secretary-General’s initiativeencouraging the role of women in the mediation process.In developing States  especially in Africa mediation and settlement mechanisms should bestrengthened through capacity-building and theallocation of sufficient resources to assure a holisticand effective approach. The institutionalization at thenational  regional and international levels of a cultureof peace that includes dialogue between civilizationsand religious tolerance is the irreversible path towardsa world of solidarity and peace.In West Africa  where the northern part of ourneighbour  Mali  has been occupied for monthsby terrorist and rebel groups  the strengthening ofdemocratic institutions and the restoration of territorialintegrity constitute the primary challenges of note.Guinea reiterates its support for the initiatives of theEconomic Community of Western African States andthe African Union in their search for a solution to thatcrisis  whose effects on the countries of the subregioncould well be devastating. In that regard  Guinea joinsthe Government of Mali in urgently demanding theSecurity Council to deploy an international contingentto restore the territorial integrity of that brother country.In Guinea-Bissau  the consolidation of peace andstability requires the restoration of all democraticinstitutions. With respect to the Great Lakes countries we support the efforts of the international communityand the Central African Economic and MonetaryCommunity  which seek to restore peace and securityin the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of theCongo  which is fundamental for the stability of thatcountry and the region.In the Horn of Africa  there has been encouragingprogress with respect to the peace process in Somalia.The implementation of a new federal Parliament  theadoption of a new interim Constitution and the electionon 10 September of Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamudas President of the Republic  all demonstrate thecommitment of the Somali people  the IntergovernmentalAuthority on Development  the African Union andthe United Nations to support peace  democracy and reconciliation in that country. The Government ofGuinea would like  at this time  to express its warmestcongratulations to the African Union Military ObserverMission in Somalia.Guinea also supports the ongoing negotiationsbetween the Governments of the Sudan and South Sudanregarding post-independence issues  in accordancewith the African Union road map of 24 April 2011 as approved by the Security Council in its resolution2046 (2012). We welcome the agreement reached by theparties on sharing petroleum revenue.In the Middle East  the restoration of lastingpeace in the region must of necessity depend on thecreation of an independent Palestinian State  livingin peace and security side by side with the State ofIsrael. The situation in Syria increasingly cries out tothe international community. We urge the concernedparties to spare no efforts to halt the violence  protectthe population and restore peace. My Governmentreaffirms its support for the declaration on Syria ofthe recent extraordinary session of the Organization ofIslamic Cooperation.The adoption on 21 June of the outcome document(resolution 66/288  annex) of the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)offered the international community an opportunityto renew its political commitment to sustainabledevelopment in all its dimensions — economic  socialand environmental. The priority of the internationalcommunity today should be the effective implementationof the commitments made to take into account thelegitimate concerns of all countries  in particular inAfrica. To that end  Guinea remains convinced thatdefining a post-2015 development agenda must takeinto account the complementarity of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the sustainabledevelopment goals resulting from Rio+20 in order toensure maximum benefit from the subsequent synergy.In consideration of Africa’s post-2015 developmentagenda  at the proposal of my country  the fifth JointAnnual Meetings of the African Union Conference ofMinisters of Economy and Finance and the EconomicCommission for Africa Conference of African Ministersof Finance  Planning and Economic Development  heldin Addis Ababa in March  and the seventeenth session ofthe High-level Committee on South-South Cooperation held in New York in May  agreed to promote South-South and triangular coalition. South-South and triangular cooperation is nowbecoming a new modality for international cooperationin order to deal with the debt and financial marketcrises and the lack of traditional official developmentassistance and implement international developmentgoals  such as the MDGs and the Istanbul Programmeof Action  among others. From this rostrum  I wouldlike to launch an urgent appeal to all Member Statesand development partners to support that innovativeinitiative of solidarity by the international communitytowards Africa. The continent remains the weakest linkin the international development mechanism despite itsvast potential and its economic performance in recentyears.Since the election in 2010 of President Alpha Condéto the highest office  the Government has undertakenan vast programme of democratization and political institutional  economic and social reforms. At thepolitical level  a law on the fair reconstitution of theIndependent National Electoral Commission  adoptedby the National Transition Council  was approved bythe President. We hope that that will open the way forthe holding of legislative elections by the end of theyear.I would like to reiterate the Government’scommitment to continuing to promote human rightsand to ensure public freedoms. To meet the variouschallenges facing the country following the 2010presidential election  the Government has submittedto the Peacebuilding Commission a request for supportand assistance in three priority areas  namely  nationalreconciliation and unity  security sector reform andyouth and women’s employment.Those priorities resulted in a statement ofmutual commitment  adopted here in New York on23 September 2011 in the presence of our Head ofState. A year later  the implementation of those mutualcommitments has produced encouraging results thanksto the significant efforts of the Government  the UnitedNations and other partners. I would especially like towelcome the significant progress in security sectorreform  in particular the biometric census of troops andthe retirement of nearly 4 000 soldiers.In order to build on those achievements  we believethat Guinea and its partners should benefit from themomentum and trust created by those initial steps tocontinue the reform by extending it to all componentsof the security sector  in particular the police and the judiciary. We are convinced that strengthening thesecurity and stability of the country and of the subregiondepend on that.In the economic and social field  there has beensignificant progress in combating the macroeconomicimbalances and in improving prospects for growth andpeople’s living conditions.Those policies enabled Guinea to reach thecompletion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor CountriesInitiative a few days ago  following meetings of theExecutive Boards of the International Monetary Fundand the World Bank. The subsequent foreign debt reliefwill make it possible to release significant financialresources to investment in basic social services toalleviate poverty. The normalization of relations withcreditors  restoring the State’s credibility  will promoteaccess to new foreign financial resources. However the Government of Guinea is aware that reaching thecompletion point is only a first step and that manychallenges must be overcome to launch the countryon the path of sustainable growth. Our objective is torapidly raise the country to the ranks of an emergingeconomy through the exploitation of its naturalresources.I would like to conclude by reiterating Guinea’sfirm support for efforts to reform the GeneralAssembly and the Security Council so as to strengthenthe effectiveness and democratic governance of ouruniversal Organization."
"66",2710,"GMB",67,2012,"﻿I have the singularhonour of reading the statement of His ExcellencyMr. Al Hadji Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh  the President of theRepublic of the Gambia  who would have loved to behere today but was unable to so  owing to unavoidablecircumstances. However  he sends his best wishes to allpresent. I will now read his statement.“First and foremost  I thank Allah  theAlmighty  for making another annual gatheringof world leaders possible. I would first like to congratulate the President on his election andwish him success in his tenure as he manages theaffairs of the Assembly. Let me also pay tribute tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for histireless leadership and sterling contribution to thecreation of a better world for all.“Our world unquestionably continues to beplagued by numerous challenges that can be solvedonly through our collective response. Multilateraldiplomacy and institutions surely offer the besthope yet for tackling our development conundrums protracted conflicts and man-made and naturaldisasters.“Peace and security will always remain acornerstone of the Organization and for that reasonmy delegation is concerned with the matter andwelcomes the President’s choice of the theme‘Bringing about adjustment or settlement ofinternational disputes or situations by peacefulmeans’.“As we speak  many conflicts are raging aroundthe world in ways that challenge the credibilityand clout of the Organization. The paralysisdisplayed by our common security mechanisms  forexample  is astounding. Geopolitical interests havetrampled the goodwill and humanitarian concernsthat should compel us all to address those raginginfernos — be they in the Middle East  Asia  Africaor elsewhere. Our collective security will continueto be undermined by geopolitical considerations unless and until we find the courage to reform theSecurity Council. Ongoing conflicts  for examplein Mali  Guinea-Bissau and Syria  are all recentcases in point. The Security Council should not bethe stumbling block in the way of the settlementof disputes by peaceful or other means. Rather  itshould be a more helpful institution.“My delegation is fully aware of the need forthe peaceful settlement of some of the conflictsin Africa  but we are equally aware of the needfor robust action in dealing with the spoilers andmerchants of death and misery in the continent.The Economic Community of West African Statesis working to find solutions to all those conflictsbut needs  of course  the support of the internationalcommunity.“We see the role of the Security Council asa partner and enabler of decisive action  but timeis running out. The elements of doom have been emboldened by our inaction. The United Nationsand the United Nations Office for West Africa mustwork decisively to address the conflicts in Maliand Guinea-Bissau without delay. The engagementof the African Union (AU) will undoubtedly becrucial. Terrorists  drug dealers and organizedcriminal networks should be stopped in their tracksat all costs before it is too late.“The relevance of the Organization has at timesbeen questioned  but one element that remainsunchallenged is its character as the best forumfor confronting global challenges. As we conveneto discuss the issues of climate change  economiccrises  financial turmoil  food insecurity  conflicts fighting disease and poverty  or the special interestsof Africa  the convening power of the United Nationsconfers a legitimacy that is indeed unparalleledelsewhere.“As developing countries  we therefore believein the work that this Organization of ours does  andit is for that reason that we will support the efforts ofthe President of the General Assembly to revitalizeit — as the voice for the voiceless.“We also use this forum to call on theinternational financial institutions to open upand embrace overdue reforms. They should betransparent and inclusive and raise the profileof their smallest members  such as low-incomecountries or least developed countries (LDCs). Wecall on them to embrace the Istanbul Programme ofAction for LDCs.“The Istanbul Programme of Action must notbecome a string of broken promises  unfulfilledcommitments and weak resource mobilization as happened with its predecessors. As LDCs weare ready to hold ourselves accountable for theimplementation of the commitments we made inIstanbul. We are equally ready to meet the targets setout in the Programme. It is therefore our collectivehope  expectation and belief that our partners andthe rest of the international community will alsofulfil their commitments and uphold their part ofthe bargain. Let us work together to bring aboutthe graduation of half of the LDCs by 2020  in linewith the target we set ourselves. It is achievable ifwe all forge the appropriate global partnerships forresource mobilization. “The scorecard on the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs) shows that  while some achievementshave been made with regard to some of the Goals  agreat deal still remains to be achieved. My countryhas achieved some of the key elements of the MDGsand is on track to meet all of them. In view of thefact that 2015 is just around the corner  we needto do more to mobilize the remaining resourcesrequired to further improve the critical links neededfor success on the achievement of the MDGs.“Critical to the achievement of the MDGs willbe the scaling up of resources by enhancing theglobal partnerships that we have forged for theGoals. We must mobilize the modest resourcesthat are needed so that 2015 will not be anotherunfulfilled milestone.“The United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment (Rio+20) has defined the mechanismsthrough which sustainable development goalsshould be negotiated and agreed upon. It is our hopethat the consultations on the post-Rio mechanismswill be inclusive  transparent and representative.Beyond managing the depleting resources of theEarth  we must all push for ambitious and realisticgoals and targets on sustainable food  water andenergy. We must also take into account the specialsituations of LDCs and other vulnerable groups ofcountries.“My delegation is of the strong belief that  inthe euphoria for sustainable development goals  thedrive towards the achievement of the MDGs mustnot be compromised in any way. We must holdourselves accountable for meeting the Goals by2015  and not try to shift the goalposts when thedeadline is close at hand. We must also lay a solidgroundwork for the post-2015 development agenda.“For developing countries to continue to benefitfrom the appreciable growth they are experiencingand in order not to compromise their capacitiesto provide education  health care and other socialservices to their peoples  debt cancellation orforgiveness is still a key element. Debt servicingstill poses a major threat to our ability to attainsustainable growth. It is our belief that our partnersand the Bretton Woods institutions should considerthe further extension of the Heavily Indebted PoorCountries Initiative. “As we strive in the Sahel to deal with droughtand the crop failure of the past year  allow meto thank the Secretary-General for his laudableefforts  as we heard today  through his initiativefor the Sahel and for his plans to assist the region including Mali. We thank him for that initiative which we look forward to seeing realized. We alsothank all our development partners for the supportthey have rendered  both to my Government and tothe Sahel. We are grateful for their solidarity andhumanitarian support. In view of the perennialnature of food insecurity in our region  it is myhumble and considered view that the internationalcommunity needs to do more to render greatersupport to the agricultural sector of our economies.“The role of the small-scale farmer needs to beboosted  and we must  through global partnerships fast-track the numerous agricultural initiatives thathave been announced to support African agriculture.Agricultural systems across Africa need to be mademore resilient in terms of inputs  technologicalknow-how  scientific research and the setting upof related training institutions. The African farmerneeds to benefit from modern farming techniquesand technology. In that context  I would like tothank the Government and people of Australiafor their outstanding generosity towards boostingagriculture and food security in Africa.“With the establishment of UN-Women the United Nations took a great step forwardin mainstreaming the gender dimension into itswork. As an ardent supporter of women’s rightsand participation in all sectors of society  I mustcommend UN-Women for the way it has beenevolving. We look forward to the establishment ofits regional offices. We will work with all concernedto advance the promotion of the rights of womenand girls  once we assume our position as a memberof the Executive Board. Advancing the welfare ofwomen  which starts with girls as future women will always be a priority for my Government.“Africa is indeed witnessing a revolution ininformation and communications technology which is a critical sector for us. Our consideredview is that  with the completion of the AfricaCoast to Europe submarine cable network  therewill be an even greater transformation in that veryimportant sector. It should further help to increase the transfer of critical technology for the economicadvancement of our peoples.“In that project we see a great opportunity forSouth-South and North-South cooperation in waysthat will revolutionize education  agriculture andthe provision of health care  among other areas.We therefore call on our partners to support thegrowth of the information and communicationstechnology sector with a view to enhancing ourproductive capacity  while also generating youthemployment  since youth unemployment is one ofthe greatest threats to humankind and to our socialand economic advancement. We must thereforeform partnerships across the globe to address thatdangerous phenomenon  which is a disaster waitingto happen.“Allow me to address some recent conflictsthat threaten the peace and stability of Africa andthe world at large. Our youth  for example  arebeing sucked into conflicts and a life of crime  withtheir productive talents being wasted. Our modestgains are being wiped out through instability  andeven our societal cohesion is seriously threatened.If we do not act fast now  we risk creating moreupheavals  which will overwhelm our capacity tocontain them. The international community willtherefore pay a very high price if it does not wakeup from its slumber and solve the situations in Maliand Guinea-Bissau that I highlighted earlier.“In West Africa  our ongoing securitychallenges are being compounded by suchsituations. ECOWAS should not be left alone toshoulder the burden of those conflicts. I am elatedby the fact that  this morning  the issues of Mali  theentire Sahel and the Maghreb were discussed. TheAU and ECOWAS are ready  and I hope that theinternational community  particularly the SecurityCouncil  is also ready. The AU is ready to act tosalvage the situations in Mali and Guinea-Bissau.The Security Council must  as I have said  act witha sense of greater urgency. We cannot let terrorists drug dealers and organized criminal gangs establisha sanctuary in our backyard.“In line with our foreign policy  the Gambiastands ready  as always  to contribute meaningfullyto the settlement of such conflicts. The level ofsteadfastness shown in solving the conflicts inLiberia and Sierra Leone some years ago must now  we hope  equally be shown in Mali andGuinea-Bissau.“The situation in Darfur continues to occupythe attention of my delegation  as well. We call formore dialogue in finding a lasting solution to thatmajor conflict. We are equally concerned about thelingering conflict between the Sudan and SouthSudan. Dialogue is essential  and is the only wayforward to solve that conflict. The parties mustimplement the recommendations of the AfricanUnion High-level Implementation Panel and thoseof the road map.“As they embark on settling the outstandingissues  we urge our brothers and sisters todemonstrate the same magnanimity andextraordinary statesmanship that characterized theestablishment of the independence of South Sudan.They should remember that they will be neighboursforever and  as such  are mutually dependent uponeach other for their national security.“Let me commend the forces of the AfricanUnion Mission in Somalia  the United Nations andthe African Union for the progress that they aremaking in Somalia. The pressure must be sustaineduntil all of Somalia is liberated and is placed underthe sole authority of the Somali Government.Insecurity and piracy must be stamped out. Thespoilers must be denied sanctuary  lest they continuedestabilizing the whole of the Horn of Africa.“As we dwell on such situations  we are equallyconcerned about the conflicts ravaging the MiddleEast. Afghanistan  for example  has been in a stateof unrest for too long. It is time that Afghans begiven enough space and capacity to solve theirproblems. Home-grown and inclusive dialogue andnational reconciliation are the best way forward tolasting peace and stability in that country.“We all witnessed the dramatic and historicevents that have recently transformed parts of theMiddle East and Africa. It is therefore our hope thatthose transformations will endure and will nurturethe ideals of peace  security  development anddemocracy. We must not lose sight of some of thenegative concomitant effects of those upheavals  asis currently evident in Syria.“My delegation believes that the Annan plancould have brought about stability and could have provided the space for dialogue among the parties if it had been given a chance. It seems that thereis lack of goodwill and trust among the parties as well as the invisible hand of external elementsdetermined to achieve a particular outcome. Syriais now a deeply divided society. The internationalcommunity is partly to blame on account of itsinaction.“The Palestinian situation is indeed deplorable.It has deteriorated to the point that a one-Statesolution may be inevitable. In defiance ofinternational law  human decency and restraint Israel  the occupying Power  is imposing a de factosituation on Palestinians through its despicablesettlement activity and land seizures. The sadreality is that it is the mechanisms of the SecurityCouncil  which are constantly invoked  that furtherdelay or stifle the action necessary to bring aboutlasting peace in Palestine. Israel’s excesses namely  the land seizures  settlement activity  massimprisonment of Palestinians  denial of revenue maiming and murder of Palestinians by the Stateapparatus and many others  must be halted. Thetruth is bitter when told  but it will set us all free.“Let me also address some burning politicalissues of our time. The embargo imposed on Cubaby the United States 50 years ago is still in placefor no justifiable reason. Even if perhaps it madesense at the time  keeping it in place today doesnot make any sense at all. It is shameful that  in thetwenty-first century  a Cold War relic remains themain stumbling block between the establishmentof good-neighbourly relations and the rejection ofempty political cacophony in some quarters. Wetherefore call upon the United States to lift theembargo and throw it into the dustbin of history where it rightfully belongs.“My delegation would also like to use thisrostrum to appeal to the collective membership ofthe United Nations  including China  to contributeto opening the avenues for Taiwan’s membershipin the various funds  agencies  treaty bodiesand programmes. That would only enhance theeffectiveness of those bodies for our mutual benefit.The world  not only Taiwan  stands to benefit. Weall agree that Taiwan is a key player in technology international trade  politics and many other areas. Ithas enduring ties with China. We therefore appealfor the practical extension of the rapport that Taiwan has with China to the international stage. Chinaconducts trade  business and tourism with Taiwan.As I speak  both are engaging in discussing a rangeof bilateral issues. The rest of the internationalcommunity  including the States Members of theUnited Nations  should follow suit. Avenues fordialogue must be opened.“The stalled reform of the Security Councilis disheartening and even dangerous. Year in andyear out  we come to the General Assembly. Wemeet in various forums to discuss the issues. Wehold dialogues and exchanges and come up withproposals. Then we get nowhere. I will mentionwhat Kofi Annan said at the time of launching hiswell-known report “In larger freedom: towardsdevelopment  security and human rights for all”(A/59/2005)  namely  that no reform of the UnitedNations is complete without the reform of theSecurity Council. I think that is critical. It is as validnow as it was when it was said seven years ago.The resistance to change should come to an end.The paralysis of the reform agenda must come toan end. We cannot afford as a group to be in a stateof coma when larger regional interests  especiallythose of Africa  are at stake and get shunted aroundor jettisoned. Africa needs to be at the table and wewill not budge on that demand  as previous speakershave said and as our heads of State have reiteratedhere. We must reform or risk delegitimizing theactions taken  and the decisions made  in the nameof our collective security.“Allow me  at this point  to recognize theappointment of His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson the new Deputy Secretary-General of the UnitedNations. We have confidence in his abilitiesand experience as an astute statesman. We arealso aware of his keen interest in Africa and hisengagement with our continent at various periodsin his diplomatic life. We therefore look forward tojointly advancing the special needs of Africa withhim under the guidance of the Secretary-General.“On a final note  it is my hope that the nextPresidents of the General Assembly will considerother themes beyond that of peace and security although there can be no doubt that peace and security are critical. Where possible an intermarriageof themes might also be considered.”I wish all members a successful General Assemblysession."
"67",2789,"GNQ",67,2012,"﻿I wish first to express my Government’scongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventhsession and a former Minister for Foreign Affairs ofSerbia  on his country’s election to preside over theAssembly. We are very happy about that because  bothin the past and currently  his country has played anactive role in eliminating tensions and inequality and instrengthening the rule of law in international relations.We are firmly convinced that  during his tenure  theproceedings of the General Assembly will be conductedin a climate of consensus and solidarity among MemberStates.The current session of the General Assemblyis being held at a time of turmoil  when many Statesare experiencing internal tensions  there is an acuteeconomic crisis  developing countries and theiremerging economies are encountering difficulties  theenvironment and the atmosphere are deteriorating  andother major catastrophes have caused the loss of humanlives and the destruction of infrastructures vital tohumankind.The major efforts made by the Secretary-General through the United Nations system have notbeen sufficient to have a decisive impact. Greatercommitment  joint action and unified approacheson the part of all States are required to combat withdetermination the problems of concern to everyonetoday. In point of fact  the Secretariat has stressedthe main outlines of the problems  which constitutethe agenda for the current session — for instance developing countries’ need for economic growth  themaintenance of international peace and security  thedevelopment of the African continent  the promotionof human rights and the provision of humanitarianassistance  the promotion of justice and internationallaw  disarmament  and the need to combat drugtrafficking  terrorism  the use of mercenaries  piracyand other crimes.The Republic of Equatorial Guinea wishes to stressthat of all those problems none has been more destructive than underdevelopment  which the United Nations mustnot look upon with indifference. The annual victims ofhunger and the diseases in the developing world exceedthe number of victims of hostile confrontations recordedeach year worldwide. The adverse effects of illiteracy the lack of housing  and malnutrition experienced indeveloping countries are greater than those causedby natural disasters. In our times  ignorance and thelack of scientific and technical know-how owing tounderdevelopment are more detrimental to a humanbeing than terrorism and drug addiction. In view ofall those adverse circumstances  we propose that theEconomic and Social Council adopt special programmesto assist the least developed countries  with a view totheir overcoming the lack of basic infrastructure whichis hampering their development — programmes that themore developed countries should commit to supportingand that could serve as a basis for mutually beneficialcooperation among affected States.We cannot imagine the promotion of humanrights in a society subject to the restrictions ofunderdevelopment. From basic human dignity itself toall the other rights necessary for a dignified existence including physical and moral integrity  freedom and finally  well-being — these are what determine whetherpeople fully enjoy their universally recognized rights.There can be no question as to which comes first human rights or economic development. We mustrecognize that human rights cannot be be enjoyed bypeople engulfed in underdevelopment.With respect to combating underdevelopment we welcome the fact that Africa has already begunpromoting programmes for economic development andmodern democratic systems  which are liberating theirpeoples from underdevelopment despite many obstaclesthat still obstruct progress and attempts at perpetuatingnew colonialist interests in Africa. Most of the internalconflicts in Africa are supported by foreign interests thattry to ensure their continued presence in the continent.As the saying goes  “If the river runs backwards  it isthe fishermen who win”.We ourselves in Equatorial Guinea are veryhappy with the progress made in our economicdevelopment programme  which seeks to achievean emerging economy by 2020 through the use ofthe resources provided by the exploitation of oil andnatural gas. Thanks to those resources  we are morethan meeting most of our needs in infrastructure including roads  hospitals  schools  vocational training centres  universities  ports  airports  the drinkingwater supply  telephone communications  air  sea andland transportation  urban development  housing andelectricity. In parallel to that programme  we haveadopted radical political reforms  appropriate to therapid development that the country is experiencing so as to ensure the strictest possible control of theGovernment’s activity  to give greater freedoms to thepeople and to protect human rights to the utmost. Underthose reforms  a leader may not remain in office formore than two terms. Parliament is being expandedfor a more universal representation of the people.Economic and social decisions are to be taken on thebasis of technical criteria and in the interests of society.The President must by law be assisted by an advisorybody. The independence of the judicial and legislativepowers is being strengthened. A body to monitor andaudit public and private economic activity is beingestablished. Lastly  an authority to protect and ensurehuman rights is being set up. A transition Governmenthas been formed to implement those reforms withineight months.My Government has always been very responsiveto the issue of humanitarian assistance. In that regard Equatorial Guinea proposes the establishment of atrust fund of the Food and Agriculture Organization ofthe United Nations (FAO) for food security in Africathat will be open to less developed countries. Fromthis rostrum  we announce an initial contribution of$30 million. We call on African countries and otherdonors to make their contributions in support of thatinitiative.My Government’s humanitarian spirit hasalways aspired to setting up initiatives that supporthumankind’s development. Equatorial Guinea thereforeestablished the Equatorial Guinea UNESCO prize toencourage the scientific community to research thepossibility of finding life-saving cures  in particular forthose suffering from AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis.The Director-General of FAO agreed to the initiative toset up such a fund.With regard to the other important items on ouragenda  we understand that international peace andsecurity essentially depend on respect for the principlesof international law: respect for the independence national sovereignty and territorial integrity ofeach State; the sovereign equality of nations andnon-interference in the internal affairs of otherStates; respect for  and compliance with  international commitments; and the promotion of mutually beneficialand fair friendship and cooperation relations amongStates.Those norms are the basis for promoting justiceand law in international relations  and no State orgroup of States should step forward to police theirimplementation. Such an act usurps the authority ofthe United Nations and undermines its effectiveness.The United Nations should impose its authority at theinternational level  avoiding any possible manipulationthrough external pressure from those that violate thespirit of its principles.Meanwhile  Equatorial Guinea endorses the wishesof the entire African continent to obtain a response to oneof its legitimate demands  made on various occasions namely  Security Council reform by increasing thenumber of Council members in both categories andreserving two seats as permanent members and fiveas non-permanent members for the African region.Democratic principles and the law are advocated at theUnited Nations. Africa claims its rights  including inthe Security Council. Africa wishes to participate inthe taking of decisions that affect its future.With the assistance of all  we will succeed inadopting appropriate measures to reduce the tendencytowards unilateralism and hegemony in internationalrelations. We will succeed in mitigating the effectsof policies that threaten the peace and sovereigntyof States and that oppose the economic and socialdevelopment of peoples  thereby significantly violatingthe principles of international law.With regard to disarmament  which EquatorialGuinea fully supports even though it is neither amanufacturer nor a consumer of any sophisticatedweapons of mass destruction  we believe that thereshould be no ambiguity on that issue. One cannot havethe best of both worlds.We do not believe there to be a threat from otherplanets of the solar system or other bodies in outerspace. The possession of nuclear weapons or weaponsof mass destruction is a disgrace to today’s humankind which is preparing its own destruction. So who shouldarm themselves and who should be disarmed? Theend of the Cold War was supposed to also mean theend of the arms race. It is now time for humankind tobuild its own future instead of wasting resources onextermination plans. Those that adopt embargoes against certainGovernments should not be insensitive to theirrepercussions and to the suffering that they causeto the population  in particular the most vulnerablesectors. Such measures run counter to the MillenniumDevelopment Goals adopted by the United Nations.Sanctions and embargoes  whatever their real nature should always take into account the humanitariancomponent with regard to the people who are suffering.Therefore  we would suggest that the rights of theindividual be given priority whenever any kind ofsanctions are adopted. Accordingly  we appeal for thesuspension of the embargo against Cuba.We will return to Equatorial Guinea with thesincere hope that the sixty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly will be a milestone in the process ofhumanizing international relations."
"68",2835,"GRC",67,2012,"﻿Iwould like to thank the outgoing President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-sixth session  Ambassador NassirAbdulaziz Al-Nasser of the State of Qatar  and tocongratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić of the Republic of Serbiaon his election to the presidency of the Assembly at thesixty-seventh session. I also want to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  who tirelessly carries on at thehelm of our Organization in an ever-shifting globalenvironment.I wish to affirm our endorsement of the positionsvoiced in the statement made by the observer of theEuropean Union. As always  Greece remains fullycommitted to the United Nations  to the values of peace security  and to raising the living standards of peopleall over the world so that they may lead lives of dignity.At the recent High-level Meeting on the rule of law the States Members of the United Nations reaffirmedtheir commitment to one of the most important principles underlying the international order  which should be ourguide in the conduct of diplomacy and internationalrelations. We fully agree with the Secretary-General’sopinion that freedom of expression is a fundamentalright and privilege belonging to all people  without anydiscrimination  and should not be abused by anyone ina disgraceful and shameful way.Unfortunately  there are those who will doeverything to provoke  as we have witnessed againrecently in the provocative and unacceptable moviewhich denigrates Islam. Nevertheless  we shouldstrongly condemn all forms of violence  and  inthis particular case  the violence against diplomaticmissions. There is no justification for it. After all  themeasure and limit of every right is the respect of theright of the other.Greece is dedicated to United Nations efforts toenhance international cooperation on the promotion andprotection of human rights. We have therefore decidedto present our candidacy for membership in the HumanRights Council for the 2013-2015 term. In this context we also support the adoption of the European UnionStrategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracyand the appointment of the European Union SpecialRepresentative for Human Rights as important stepstowards a more coherent European policy and approachto human dignity.The need to respect and protect human rights andhumanitarian law is now as urgent as ever. In fact illegal migration in the Mediterranean region has givenrise to a humanitarian crisis. That is why Greece hasintroduced major legislative and institutional reformsin the fields of asylum and migration.I now turn to one of the main pillars of United Nationsaction: peace and security. Greece’s neighbourhoodhas often been at the centre of serious  interrelatedsecurity challenges. My country has consistentlyplayed a stabilizing role  which we have accomplishedthrough the pursuit of a policy of peaceful resolution ofdisputes  within the framework of the United NationsCharter  based on respect for international law and theprinciples of sovereignty  independence and territorialintegrity. Despite the economic and financial crisis Greece has continued to participate actively in a numberof United Nations missions and operations around theworld  including in Kosovo and Afghanistan and in theanti-piracy efforts off the coast of Somalia. Security in the Middle East remains a crucial questfor the countries of the region and the world community.Greece maintains historic ties of friendship  cooperationand mutual respect with its neighbours in North Africaand the Middle East — countries that  following themomentous events of the Arab Spring  are movingtowards successful electoral processes and towardsbuilding democratic institutions. The European Unionshould be there  right by their side  as they build theirfuture.However  we have not seen successful outcomeseverywhere. In Syria  demonstrators faced tanksand a brutal crack-down. On numerous occasions wehave called on President Al-Assad to open the wayfor a transitional authority  comprising all sections ofSyrian society. Yet  we are still in a prolonged bloodystalemate that jeopardizes the present and the future ofthe Syrian people  and stability in our region. The resulthas been no less than 29 000 victims  250 000 refugees 2.5 million Syrian citizens in need. We are convincedthat a Syrian-led political solution is still achieveable and we see no alternative to such a solution. Greecebelieves that there is no military solution to the Syrianproblem.Peace and security in the Eastern Mediterraneancannot be achieved without a just  lasting andcomprehensive solution of the Palestinian issue  on thebasis of a two-State solution. We regret the prolongedstagnation in the direct negotiations between the twoparties. It is only through negotiations that peacecan finally be achieved. We believe that unilateralactions cannot fulfil Israel’s quest for security or thePalestinians’ aspirations for statehood  which we fullysupport. The two-State solution should remain feasibleon the ground.I would now like to outline the current positionon some salient issues concerning our immediateneighbourhood. The issue of the name of the formerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia is  beyond its semanticdimension  an important piece in the puzzle of puttingto rest irredentist notions and attempts to rewritehistory in our region. I have been informed of whatthe representative of the former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia said today in the General Assembly (seeA/67/PV.12). Distorting reality in front of the entireinternational community and using nineteenth-centuryrhetoric in the twenty-first century is counterproductiveand will lead us nowhere. Populism and nationalismmake up the worst possible mix for the promotion of anyone’s national interests and the stability of ourregion.Greece believes that the solution lies in a fairsettlement. That would be a name with a geographicalqualifier  since Macedonia is a geographical region thatoverlaps the territories of three countries  the largestpart being in Greece  followed by Bulgaria and thenthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. And ofcourse the name must be used in relation to everyone;it is an erga omnes obligation  to use the Latin phrase.When we resolve this issue  we will be able to realizethe vast potential in our relations  to our mutual benefit and Greece will be the former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia’s staunchest ally and friend in its efforts tofulfil its Euro-Atlantic aspirations. After all  as is wellknown  Greece is the most important economic partnerof the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  with alarge presence of Greek companies operating there. Wealso support the European Union-facilitated dialoguebetween Belgrade and Pristina  and we welcome theconstructive approach to the talks on the part of theSerbian leadership. Dialogue is the only way to resolveproblems in Kosovo  while unilateral measures andescalation  especially in the north  should be avoidedby all means.Less than two years from now  Greece’s EuropeanUnion presidency will launch Agenda 2014  whichaims to reinvigorate the European perspectives of allour neighbours in the Western Balkans. Elsewhere inour immediate neighbourhood  Greece is consistentlypursuing stronger cooperation with Turkey  through awide range of initiatives  so that we can improve ourrelations to the benefit of both peoples. Moreover Greece continues to support Turkey’s candidacy for fullmembership in the European family  on the condition of course  that all relevant membership criteria are metand that the necessary reforms are carried out. It is of theutmost importance that Turkey gives tangible signs offull respect for international law and abandons attitudeslike the standing threat of casus belli against Greece  orits attitude vis-à-vis Cyprus  which undermines effortsto build trust.That brings us to the Eastern Mediterranean as awhole  where Greece continues to play its role as a forcefor peace and stability. Greece supports the efforts ofthe Government of the Republic of Cyprus to pursuenegotiations with the Turkish Cypriot community under United Nations auspices  aimed ultimately atreuniting the island  according to United Nations resolutions and taking into account the fact that theRepublic of Cyprus is a member of the EuropeanUnion  which currently holds its presidency. However after 38 years  the division of the island continues andthe results of the talks have been disappointing  owingto Turkish-Cypriot intransigence about engaging inconstructive talks. We applaud Cyprus’s decision to acton its sovereign right to exploit the natural gas depositsin its exclusive economic zone.We are forging partnerships with other emergingenergy players in the region  including Israel andthe Arab countries  with which we enjoy traditionalrelations of friendship and trust. Greece is contributingto bringing stability and economic growth to the EasternMediterranean  in order to promote energy securityand diversification of sources and suppliers for theEuropean energy markets. A resolution of the Cyprusissue would have a tremendously positive effect  notjust for the Cypriots themselves but for Greek-Turkishrelations and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean asa whole.I will conclude with a few words about theeconomic crisis that Greece is confronting with thehelp of its partners in the European Union and theinternational community. The new tripartite coalitionGovernment in Greece is implementing an ambitiouseconomic adjustment programme in order to improve itsmacroeconomic outlook and achieve fiscal adjustment while at the same time addressing structural reformsaimed at growth and job creation.That effort has produced impressive results especially a significant reduction of the primarydeficit. At the same time  the Greek economy hasregained more than 50 per cent of its competitiveness inrelation to its global trade partners  while the businessand investment climate is on a positive path. We aredetermined to continue along that path  bearing in mindthat the Greek people are suffering tremendously fromthe implementation of the austerity programme.In a broader view  it is evident that this crisis is notjust Greek or European. International economies areintertwined  and therefore ours is also a global crisis.In that respect  we need to examine measures aimedat generating all-inclusive and job-creating growth measures that will regenerate economies and diminishthe social impact of the crisis.The eurozone  with Greece at the forefront  ismaking a hard and painstaking effort and adopting new paths and ways to climb out of the deep economic crisis.The pivotal role and geopolitical importance of Greecein South-Eastern Europe  in the Eastern Mediterraneanand the Middle East will emerge as a result of theevents unfolding in our neighbourhood. It is indeeda stabilizing role  since our vital national interestsare aligned with the promotion of peace  stability prosperity and regional security. Our advantage isnot only our geographical position but also our strongpolitical will to become a cornerstone of stabilityand security  at a time when uncertainty dangerouslythreatens our region.During the past two years  Greece has beenportrayed by the global media as a country definedby its economic need. It is true that our country isexperiencing a painful transition leading to economicrecovery and growth. It is also true that the Greekpeople have known in their 3 000 years of history crisesmore serious than the present one. We survived. Weexcelled. Let me assure the General Assembly and thefamily of nations that Greece will make it.We will make it because Greece is larger than itsgeographical size and more precious than its presentfiscal reality. Through knowledge  science and art Greece is there when progress takes place. Throughdemocracy Greece is present as a global civilization.Through Olympism Greece unites humankind. Throughour merchant f leet and our maritime tradition we carrygoods all around the world. Through our love for lifewe constantly remind the world that progress shouldalways be measured on the human scale. Through andby our legacy we will make it once more.We will make it because Greece is not aboutasking. Greece is about offering. Let us not forget thatGreece holds intrinsic value in the hearts and mindsof people irrespective of nationality  race and religion.And that gives us the moral power  the support and theencouragement  along with our partners in Europe  togive to the world and to win our current fight."
"69",2876,"GRD",67,2012,"﻿I am honoured to addressthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session onbehalf of Mr. Tillman J. Thomas  Prime Minister ofGrenada  and the people of Grenada.Grenada commends the work of the United Nationsover the past year  with special commendation for theleadership and stewardship of the outgoing President Qatari diplomat Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser.Looking ahead  we place our confidence in you  Sir and your team  and look forward to your guidance ofthe work this year under the general theme “Bringingabout adjustment or settlement of international disputesor situations by peaceful means”. We extend Grenada’sfull esteem and support to our able Secretary-General Mr. Ban Ki-moon  whom we thank for his continuedleadership and service to Member States.Grenada recommits unwaveringly to the principlesof the United Nations  as embodied in the Charter.Our commitment in national and international lifeto the norms of peace  equality and justice  and tohuman rights and multilateralism  is clear. Over thepast year  Grenada ratified and deposited instrumentsof ratification with the United Nations  including for the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.In ratifying the Rome Statute  Grenada became theMember State that brought that Treaty into force. Thatexemplifies our commitment to the principle of therule of law  which resonates with every Grenadian asa result of our enthusiasm for justice and for endingimpunity. Grenada welcomes the Declaration of theHigh-level Meeting of the General Assembly on theRule of Law at the National and International Levels(resolution 67/1) of 24 September  and expects to makea voluntary pledge.On the domestic front  in April Parliament passedthe End Violence against Women Legislative andPolicy Reform Bill. Aware that by itself the passageof a law is insufficient to change society’s entrenchedcultural attitudes and practices  we are also embarkingon public education and on strengthening the capacityof Government departments  among other things.We will continue on that path to secure the rights ofpeople  for we are convinced that law and security arethe sine qua non for the facilitation of the peacefulsettlement of disputes  which is itself the foundationfor an international environment of peace. Indeed democracy  good governance  social inclusion  conflictresolution  development and sustained overall progressare all helped by the rule of law within our countriesand in the international system.Grenada is a small island developing State. Naturehas been especially generous to us  and our peopleare extraordinarily hard-working and big-spirited. Yetthe fruits of nature and of our own efforts have beenundermined by Hurricane Ivan in 2004  Hurricane Emily in 2005 and the advent in 2008 of the globalfinancial and economic crisis. That notwithstanding we remain confident that a pathway to success existsfor us  based on our own efforts and the support of theinternational community and this great Organization.From Grenada’s perspective  the highlight of thepast year has been the renewed international politicalcommitment to sustainable development; indeed interest continues to grow and to gain momentum.Sustainable development is one of our declared prioritiesin Grenada. It is a priority this year since the Secretary-General announced that sustainable development wouldbe the number one item on his agenda during his secondterm  and you  too  Sir  declared it a priority.In June  more than 120 heads of State andGovernment endorsed the paradigm of sustainabledevelopment in Rio  and the outcome document entitled “The future we want”  declares: “We resolve totake urgent action to achieve sustainable development”(resolution 66/288  annex  para. 12). Leaders agreed toarticulate policies and programmes that would promotesocially inclusive behaviour to quickly and equitablybring about prosperity and to do so in a manner thatwould instil hope and create livelihood opportunitiesfor those yet to come.Because of our tremendous green and blueendowments and the fact that our people liveintelligently with them  Grenada has long considereditself an island of sustainability. That describes aholistic policy framework that defines our consumptionand production path as spelt out in our five strategicdevelopment pillars: energy development; education health and wellness; information and communicationstechnology; tourism and hospitality; and agribusiness.Grenada is committed  then  to a path ofsustainability. Its determined efforts are led by ourenergy policy aimed at reducing fossil-fuel usage by20 per cent by the year 2020 and at being completelycarbon-neutral by 2030. The manufacturing sector israpidly emerging as a producer of indigenous green andorganic products  and the hotel sector is going green.It should be recalled that Grenada is building itselfback from the World Bank-determined loss of 204 percent of its gross domestic product as a result of thehurricane destruction we experienced in 2004 and 2005.We have made great strides with recovery due to thegenerosity of our neighbours and friends everywhere for which we remain forever indebted and grateful.Since 2008  our situation has been compoundedby the weight of the global financial and economicdownturn  which is dwarfing development effortsdue to loss of tourism and port receipts and evenof remittances. However  we recognize with deepappreciation that  as our economy has slowed in directresponse to the global economic crisis  our neighboursare again coming to our assistance.Grenada is defined as a middle-income country and yet its stability and growth are challenged byserious socioeconomic predicaments. We are facingthe high cost of fuel and food  costs associated withconfronting the illicit trafficking in drugs and smallarms and light weapons and related crime  and anincrease in unemployment and poverty.What is consistent in that context is that  like somany of the Caribbean and small island developingcountries  Grenada contributes least to the financialand economic crisis  greenhouse-gas emissions andthe production of arms and illicit drugs  and yet thosescourges have a disproportionate impact on us ascompared to the countries that produce them  and ofcourse our ability to respond effectively is far inferior.So what  then  is the way forward? The wayforward lies primarily in improvement of the domesticenvironment. We continue to achieve this through laws economic and social policies and our national spirit ofperseverance. Among our many initiatives  in January2013  for example  Grenada will be co-hosting a meetingin the Caribbean with business innovator Sir RichardBranson on ensuring the sustainable management ofour marine and coastal resources.Yet small island developing States need a far moresupportive international policy climate and affordablefinancing for a safe and secure way forward intogreater sustainability. That will be the way we hold onto the hard-earned progress made so far with respectto the Millennium Development Goals and how wewill be able to expand it. We hope then to be guidedby the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development framework to further support ourambitious economic and social transformation agenda.We continue to believe that peace and security anda reduction in military spending in the internationalcommunity will be good for a global economicrecovery  which in turn will be good for the financingof sustainable development. Unless there is recovery inthe large economies to which our own economic life remains tied  we will see no sustained recovery. Wetherefore call for commitments made to developingcountries to be met  and we remain willing partners inSouth-South cooperation.The staggering loss of life in Syria must bebrought to an end by all those responsible. We call fora politically negotiated and urgent settlement  and wereiterate Grenada’s support for the diplomacy workbeing carried out  inter alia  by the United Nations andthe Arab League. We call for policies of inclusion andopenness that will accommodate all just aspirations ofall members of society in the Middle East and elsewhere.We reiterate our call for a State for the Palestinianpeople in a negotiated two-State agreement with Israelthrough a peace plan. The injustices meted out to thePalestinians  including widespread unemployment poverty and displacement  must end now. ThePalestinian people  led by their Government  thePalestinian Authority  have our strong support for theirjust aspirations. We are convinced that the two nationscan coexist side by side in peace and harmony  like somany other countries.Grenada takes this opportunity to extend onceagain its heartfelt condolences to the Governmentand people of the United States of America and to thebereaved families of Ambassador Chris Stevens andhis colleagues. We deplore those senseless acts andcontinue to call for the improvement of the protectionof all diplomats serving abroad.Grenada calls for the cessation of the traffickingof weapons through our Caribbean region and for afirm and comprehensive  yet expeditious  agreement onsmall arms and light weapons. We also renew our callfor the preservation of the Caribbean Sea as a zone ofpeace and development and for the bringing of an endto the passage of nuclear waste in our waters.Grenada looks forward to the third GlobalConference on the Sustainable Development of SmallIsland States in 2014  and we call on the internationalcommunity to lend its fullest and broadest supportto that Conference. We further call on the GeneralAssembly to designate 2014 as the International Year ofSmall Island Developing States so as to raise awarenessof the special situation of small island developingStates (SIDS) and to mobilize international supportfor their sustainable development. Support for SIDSfrom China in energy efficiency and from Norway in renewable energy is already forthcoming  as is supportfrom Australia.Without a legally binding climate regime to upholdenvironmental integrity  Caribbean and other smallisland States would lose the opportunity for achievingsustainability soon  and some could even disappear. Wetherefore see the upcoming eighteenth Conference of theParties to the United Nations Framework Conventionon Climate Change in Doha  Qatar  as an opportunityto move decisively away from that scenario  and wewelcome the commitment of the European Union toagreeing to an ambitious second commitment periodof the Kyoto Protocol and to climate financing. Wecall on other developed countries to do likewise  andon the Secretary-General to encourage States partiesto move steadfastly towards finalizing a new bindingclimate treaty by 2015 and a gap-free period of climatefinancing starting in January 2013.If the United Nations is to continue to lead the way insustainability  peace and security  it must be reformed.The centrepiece of that change must be reform of theSecurity Council  particularly so as to include a seatfor small island developing States. Only a revitalizedUnited Nations can continue to play its historicrole in guiding the world  its international financialinstitutions included  through the geopolitical volatilitythat is destabilizing the global economic and financialorder. Reorganization should not mean  however the loss of vital country programmes  especially forsmall countries. The United Nations must continue itsirreplaceable work on behalf of women  and Grenadais pleased to serve on the board of UN-Women and tocontribute to its endeavours.Revitalization and reform must also take place inthe Caribbean. To that end  we call for the completeremoval of the economic  commercial and financialblockade of our sister Caribbean State of Cuba. TheUnited States embargo against Cuba  now almost50 years old  is in complete contradiction to the spiritof the United Nations Charter. Removal of the embargohas been specifically called for by the leaders of theCaribbean Community as well as by an overwhelmingmajority of States Members of the United Nations. Cubaplays a significant humanitarian and development rolein the Caribbean and its economic liberation from theembargo will allow it to contribute even more throughthe dynamic of growing South-South cooperation.Furthermore  Cuba is now playing a facilitating andmediating role in one of the hemisphere’s longest political crises and thus making a major contributionto peace and security in the Latin American andCaribbean region.Two years after the unfathomable national disasterin our sister nation of Haiti in 2010  thousands ofHaitians are nonetheless still homeless and suffering as their Government remains without sufficient meansto complete national rebuilding. Grenada extends itsthanks  first and foremost  to all who have pledged andrealized those pledges for the benefit of the Haitianpeople  for we are but one in the Caribbean. Grenadaremains steadfast in its commitment to this imperative and we renew our appeal to the international communityto fulfil all its commitments and  where possible  toincrease its contributions to the humanitarian anddevelopment needs of Haiti.Just some 100 days ago in the city of Rio de Janeiro our Prime Minister  Mr. Tillman Thomas  said:“The United Nations is indispensable to thefuture we need. Grenada considers the UnitedNations to be best placed for decision-makingaffecting the international body politic. Indeed the United Nations has the full legitimacy neededto command authority [and] secure consensus andthe necessary trust among all global stakeholders.We recommit to the United Nations and support itsreforms.”To conclude  on 6 August  Grenada made history winning its first Olympic medal  a gold in the men’s400-metre race  thus becoming  according to onecalculation  the country with the highest medal percapita ratio in the world. Our people have not yetceased to celebrate winning gold. Another enduringact celebrated around the world  however  was thegraciousness demonstrated by the eventual winner Kirani James  when he embraced and exchanged bibswith his co-competitor Oscar Pistorius  the outstandingdouble amputee from South Africa  who despiterunning an extraordinarily good race came in secondbehind the soon-to-be Olympic gold medallist. It wasa simple Grenadian gesture of admiration  friendshipand solidarity  but one that underscores that the humanspirit must prevail in relations among individuals and we dare say  among nations. That one simple act ofrecognition of the right and  far more important  thenobility of another human being transformed tworunners into two brothers  one South African  oneGrenadian  one shared humanity. We name that the Kirani spirit  and we chargethis institution with the Kirani spirit — “charge” asin giving it energy; charge as in commanding to dolikewise; charge as in holding the collective responsiblefor our humanity; charge as in charging each nation andeach people with their own big-spiritedness."
"70",2923,"GTM",67,2012,"﻿At theoutset  allow me to greet Mr. Vuk Jeremić  President ofthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Atthe same time  I would like to express my appreciationto Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his stewardshipduring the previous session.I have the honour to represent Guatemala forthe first time before this highest organ of the UnitedNations. Guatemala  and my Government in particular will always support any initiative that furthers thenoble objectives and principles of the United Nations summarized in the words “peace”  “development” and“human rights”.My country is committed to the peaceful settlementof conflicts  which is the central theme of our debate.In that spirit  in late 2008 we agreed to sign a specialagreement with our neighbour  Belize  seeking aresolution of a long-standing territorial dispute throughthe International Court of Justice. Our Congressunanimously approved the agreement  and on October6  2013  simultaneous plebiscites will be held in bothcountries to democratically ratify our commitment toresorting to the International Court of Justice.Furthermore  we Guatemalans lived through anarmed conflict that lasted 36 years. I was a soldier whoparticipated in that conflict. And because I know war  Ihighly value dialogue. That is why in 1996 I was one ofthe signatories of the peace accords in my country. Thatmotivates me to reaffirm my support for the President’swise decision to convene this session to discuss thepeaceful settlement of conflicts.My Government has set three overarching objectivesin order to advance firmly and sustainably towards aGuatemala that fully enjoys the benefits of peace. First we have proposed the Hambre Zero initiative  whichseeks to reduce the chronic malnutrition that affectsover 40 per cent of our children below five years of age.That reduction will be sustainable only if we are able tobetter develop our rural areas in order to permanentlyreduce the poverty of families living off the land particularly indigenous families.Secondly  my Government is promoting a pactfor security  justice and peace  which seeks to reducethe social violence that afflicts our country. In takingoffice  I found a country with high levels of violence;as a result  reducing those levels has become a priority of my Government. We are certain that we can attainprogress in that area  since the indicators over the pastnine months alone already show a notable decrease of13 per cent in the number of homicides compared to thesame period last year. I can therefore state that  withoutbeing satisfied with those indices  we are nonethelessmoving in the right direction in fulfilling our promiseof reducing the levels of violence and increasingsecurity in Guatemala in an environment of full respectfor human rights. In this endeavour  we work closelywith neighbouring countries  and especially with ourCentral American brothers.Thirdly  we are campaigning on the economicfront through the Fiscal and Competitiveness Pact.Fiscal affairs have been one of the weaknesses of ourinstitutional arrangement  and for this reason  duringthe very first days of my Government we successfullypromoted a fiscal reform  approved by Congress  thatincreased our fiscal receipts by 15 per cent  allowingus to maintain a stable macroeconomic environmentby reducing the fiscal deficit without having to reducepublic expenditures. At the same time  fiscal stabilityis allowing us to stimulate private investments thatgenerate employment opportunities; that is  dependablejobs  as demanded by our citizens.Unfortunately  our efforts in relation to the threechallenges previously mentioned — lowering chronicmalnutrition among children  reducing violence  andpromoting employment — are nullified in part by thescourge of drug trafficking. At least 40 per cent of thehomicides in our country are linked to the illicit drugtraffic  and my Government is obligated to allocatescarce fiscal resources to combat transnational gangsthat operate between the producing countries in theSouth and the consuming countries in the North.Moreover  my country has gradually been transformedinto a producer and a consumer of drugs  therebycompounding an already difficult situation.The existing framework  born out of theinternational conventions adopted during the pastfive decades and currently in force  has not achievedthe desired results. The consumption markets expandinstead of decreasing; the number of producer countriesand the type of drugs available tend to multiply; and theroutes chosen for marketing and trafficking are trendingtowards diversification. The drug problem is growing insize and complexity. It involves an increasing numberof countries and persons. Clearly  it is a transnationalphenomenon  and it is for that reason that I raise it inthis universal forum.It seems that the basic premise of our war againstdrugs has serious shortcomings since  unfortunately  ithas not been possible to eradicate drug consumption. Ibelieve that the time has come to accept this fact and toadapt our fight against the scourge in such a way as totake into account the new realities.Our youth  the group most affected by drugconsumption  demands more effective responses fromus. Let us realize that the problem is more a publichealth issue than a matter for criminal justice anddeal with it accordingly. We must offer treatment prevention  social protection  economic opportunitiesand development for the communities involved in thedrug market. Let us not fill our jails with thousands ofyoung people  who would have a different kind of lifeif we were to approach the problem in a different way. Iinvite the Member States assembled here to jointly seekavenues that will enable us to offer our young people amore promising future  improving their opportunitiesfor a better life and at the same time reducing violenceand poverty.Fifty years provides sufficient time for us toevaluate results  to gauge what we have achieved and toconclude why we do not have the results we had hopedfor. In that regard  I also call on Member States to reviewthe international regulations that currently govern ourglobal policies regarding drugs. The Single Conventionon Narcotic Drugs of 1961  as amended by the 1972Protocol  the Convention on Psychotropic Substancesof 1971 and the United Nations Convention againstIllicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and PsychotropicSubstances of 1988 must be evaluated on the basis of itsresults and brought up to date to allow us to achieve thedesired outcomes. That is a serious challenge that mustbe addressed in all earnestness so that we can have arespectful and frank multilateral dialogue  informed byclear scientific evidence regarding the best strategiesavailable to ensure that our young people are protectedfrom the scourge of drugs.In that regard  last April the Heads of State andGovernment of the Western Hemisphere met for theSummit of the Americas in Cartagena de Indias. Ourhost  Mr. Santos Calderón  President of Colombia invited us to discuss new avenues to combat drugtrafficking. The agreement reached was that we shouldundertake studies to assess new alternatives  which we would discuss next year  in June  at a meeting of theOrganization of American States in Guatemala. Thatis a step in the right direction and one that we believeshould be emulated at the global level.In the same spirit  Guatemala would like to proposethe establishment of a group of countries that are welldisposed to reforming global policies on drugs. Thegroup would bring together Governments that areinterested in promoting in appropriate internationalforums an objective and rigorous assessment ofprevailing policies and inconsidering new  creativeand innovative alternatives. We must seek such newavenues responsibly and tenaciously  and I am sure thatwith the cooperation of all producing  consuming andtransit countries  we will succeed.Allow me to stress that it is not a matter ofabandoning the fight against the scourge of drugs.Rather  it is a matter of arming ourselves better andresponding with greater effectiveness and clarity because our children and grandchildren deserve a moreintegrated and effective response from the internationalcommunity.I would like to conclude my thoughts by reaffirmingthat Guatemala will not renege on any internationalcommitments to which it is party. We have no desirefor unilateral action  which would only sow chaos andconflict when the response should be a global one. Wewill wait patiently to change our policies in Guatemalauntil the international community moves forwardand arrives at a new consensus. At the same time however  I commit my leadership to moving forwardon evaluating the global policy on drugs  so as to makeit more effective and based on current internationalstandards that reflect the challenges and realities of thetwenty-first century.Before concluding  I would like to brief ly raise threepoints that I believe to be important to this meeting ofthe General Assembly. First  as a demonstration of ourcommitment to defending and promoting human rightson all fronts  on 14 January I said that Guatemala wouldseek to ratify the Rome Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court and thus become a party to the Statute.I am pleased to report that  on 2 April  we deposited ourinstrument of ratification.Secondly  in that same speech  I indicated thatwe would make it a priority of our foreign policy tocontribute to the ideals of democracy  justice and peace within a framework of absolute respect for international law. In that regard  I indicated that Guatemala wouldfulfil its duties on the Security Council responsibly andin a constructive spirit. I believe that so far we havekept that promise  and we are pleased that in six daysGuatemala will assume the presidency of the Councilfor the month of October  and we will continue to actresponsibly.Thirdly  regarding the events of recent weeks  wereject all acts that defame religions. At the same time we condemn violence in any form  including assaultson diplomatic missions. Such expressions of intoleranceoffend us all.Finally  I would like to recall that  on 21 December Guatemala will celebrate the beginning of a new eraaccording to the Mayan calendar. That era  13 Baktun marks the start of a very positive new age that willenable and invite us to renew physical and spiritualenergies in an atmosphere of peace  cooperation anddialogue. All heads of State and Government are invitedto join us in Tikal National Park to share in the dawn ofthis new era. The Mayans of yesterday and today  andall Guatemalans  await them with open arms."
"71",2966,"GUY",67,2012,"﻿It is a distinct honour for meto speak today for the first time as President of theRepublic of Guyana in this general debate of the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly.To the President of the Assembly at its sixty-seventhsession  I extend my delegation’s sincere congratulationson his election. I also pay tribute to his predecessor  HisExcellency Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  who presidedover the sixty-sixth session with distinction during atrying period for this body. The Secretary-Generaldeserves commendation for his unstinting serviceto the Organization and our continued support as the United Nations negotiates the many issues that confrontour world.The present international system is characterizedby change and crises. A tide of change is evident at alllevels  from the local to the global  and it is either beingprecipitated or accompanied by multiple crises withinthe global community.In the economic realm  continuing adverseconditions stymie global efforts to achieveinternationally agreed-upon development objectives.Recovery from the global financial crisis is at bestincipient and sluggish. Several of the major contributorsto global output are grappling with unsustainable fiscalbalances that hinder their ability to stimulate lastingrecovery. The problems in those economies continueto place a drag on global growth. Compounding thosedifficulties is the slowdown in output in major emergingeconomies. Naturally  those events have had seriousnegative impacts on developing countries.Although more resilient than in earlier times developing countries have paid a heavy price as a resultof the present difficulties in the world economy. Thathas been reflected in growth that is generally lower thanpre-crisis levels. Already grappling with adverse tradingarrangements and the consequences of an inconclusiveand disappointing Doha Development Round  the plightof developing countries has been made worse by theprolonged global slump. Many of the gains made before2008 have been erased by the continuing difficulties inthe world economy. The small  vulnerable economies ofthe Caribbean face special challenges  compounded bygenerally high levels of indebtedness and falling exportrevenues.It is within the unfavourable international climatethat we have to judge our own performance. Guyanahas had to face many serious challenges. However we have worked steadfastly to build a more resilienteconomy and country. We have managed to forestallthe worst effects of the international economic crises.Over the past six years  we have achieved an economicgrowth rate of approximately 5 per cent per annum. Thegrowth rate is  I believe  the result of the investmentsthat we have been making in our people. More than30 per cent of our budget is dedicated to education health  housing  water and social programmes to helpthe most vulnerable.Today Guyana has achieved universal primaryeducation  and we have come a long way towards attaining universal secondary education. However significant challenges remain in reaching people in theremote areas of our country. If we are to encourage ouryouth to become responsible citizens and prepare themto be the leaders of tomorrow  we must ensure that oureducation systems allow for the development of theirfull potential.I am therefore honoured to join the Secretary-General in promoting the Education First initiative. Weare nonetheless conscious that the sustainability of ourgrowth and that of other developing countries will behindered if the weakness in the international economyis prolonged.Guyana therefore continues to advocate for reformof the graduation policies and aid allocation criteria ofthe international financial institutions to take accountof the structural vulnerability and level of economicresilience of small States  for measures to ease the debtburden  for renewed access to concessionary financingfor highly indebted middle-income countries and forthe strengthening of financial regulations.The international economic crisis has also led togrowing negative social problems. Despite great effortsby many countries  the war against narco–traffickingis far from over. That scourge has an impact on all ourcountries. It has also directly and indirectly engenderedthe growth in criminal activity in our region. Theavailability of guns in many societies — I would notethat we do not produce them — most of which has comeas a by-product of the narco-trade  has contributed tothe growth of gun crimes and murders in the regionand beyond. To deal with the problem  Guyana is readyto cooperate fully with the international community tobring the criminals to justice and free our people fromthe multiple dangers that drug trafficking creates.Even as our society advances  the issues we haveto deal with often seem to multiply. The issue oftrafficking in persons has also arisen over the pastdecade as a major concern. We join with all democraticand decent people throughout the world in condemningthat crime. Again  it is a campaign that requires a highlevel of cooperation. We are ready to play our part.If solving those collective problems requires greaterwill  then other transnational problems such as theclimate crisis require urgent  immediate and decisiveaction. Our failure to do so risks causing irretrievableharm to humankind. Despite the strong scientific and economic casefor action  the global response to the climate crisisfalls short of what is required in terms of both scaleand urgency. The projected level of reduction ingreenhouse-gas emissions is much too low. Scientistsare warning us of the catastrophic consequences if therise in greenhouse emissions is not halted. Alreadysome States are facing imminent extinction.To add insult to injury  the promise of fast-startfinancing made at Copenhagen a few years ago hasnot materialized. The result is that those most at riskare effectively deprived of the means to adapt to thatexistential threat. We cannot continue to deal withthreats to the survival of the planet with such casualness.As a low-lying coastal State  Guyana is mindfulof the dangers posed by climate change. We have beenat the forefront of the appeals to the internationalcommunity to match its concern with tangible action.It is clear that some countries are taking the issueseriously. Norway has led the way by giving tangiblesupport in fighting climate change. Guyana  for itspart  has chosen to pursue a low-carbon developmentstrategy in order to ensure economic growth  socialprogress and environmental sustainability for presentand future generations of our citizens.But  as our experience patently demonstrates  thatpath is not without its hurdles. Just three short monthsago  in Rio de Janeiro  we renewed our collectivecommitment to sustainable development and toensuring the promotion of an economically  sociallyand environmentally sustainable future for our planet.We also agreed that the eradication of poverty wasthe greatest challenge facing the world today  and werecommitted ourselves to freeing humankind frompoverty and hunger as a matter of urgency.We need  therefore  as a matter of exigency  torespond to the plight of more than 1 billion of our fellowcitizens who bear the ache of hunger on a daily basis.They are found on every continent  in every city and inrural communities across the world.Their plight is worsening. Food prices are surgingonce again  and risk rising even further as severedroughts decimate crop yields. Those who suffer fromchronic hunger today cannot wait until the internationalcommunity agrees on a post-2015 developmentframework. They cannot wait until we craft newsustainable development goals. They need action now. The decades-long under-investment in agricultureand rural development needs to be urgently reversed iffood security is to be guaranteed on a sustainable basis.In line with the Five Rome Principles forSustainable Global Food Security  Guyana calls for anacceleration of the twin-track approach to enhancingdirect action against hunger for the most vulnerableand for promoting medium- to long-term sustainabilityin agriculture and rural development. In that context increased international support for the expansion ofrural infrastructure is critical.Ms. Flores (Honduras)  Vice-President  took theChair.If we are to maintain our credibility  we must avoidindecisiveness on the issues that afflict humankind. Weare only three short years away from 2015  the year weset for ourselves to reach important goals for improvingthe security of our planet and enhancing the quality oflife for all. We must do what we promised to do and wemust do so without delay.Greater alacrity is also needed in the area of politics where tensions and unrest in many corners of our globethreaten to undermine international peace and security.The tide of democratic change that has swept theplanet and raised the expectations of peoples for socialprogress and better standards of life in an environmentof enlarged freedoms is receding. Those legitimateaspirations deserve the respect and encouragementof the Governments concerned and the support of theinternational community. No people should be deniedthe right to live in dignity or to live a life free fromfear and want. At the same time  we must be careful toguard against the superimposition of agendas based onulterior designs that are alien to those noble aspirations.While we give solidarity and support where needed let us not forget that this body crafted an importantprinciple of self-determination.Human rights and fundamental freedoms are bestpreserved in an environment of peace and security.Respect for the rule of law and tolerance for the faithsand beliefs of all humankind must continue to be theguiding principles through which we build harmonioussocieties. While we condemn the attacks and insultsthat the recent film heaped on Islam  we believethat nothing of that nature can justify the murder ofdiplomats and the violence we have seen. We thereforeextend our sympathy to the people and Government of the United States of America on the murder ofAmbassador Christopher Stevens and others in Libya.We believe that the best homage we can pay to theirmemory is to work even harder for a just  peaceful andtolerant world.In concert with the proposed theme of this debate the United Nations must continue to pursue peacefulsolutions to political conflicts  no matter how slow andpainstaking the process may be.It is my country’s sincere hope that peace will sooncome to the Syrian people. Guyana urges the renewalof efforts to bring the warring parties to the negotiatingtable. The international community must contribute topeace and not to the exacerbation of strife and conflict.Any abandonment of its role in bringing peace to Syriawill result in greater suffering in that country andundermine security in that part of the world. The UnitedNations must therefore persevere in finding a peacefulend to the conflict. We therefore support the efforts ofthe Joint Special Representative of the United Nationsand the League of Arab States in trying to bring theconflict in Syria to a peaceful end.I also wish to underline Guyana’s strong supportfor the peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinianconflict. We are of the view that the resolution of thatconflict  which has lasted for too long  is key to a lastingpeace in the Middle East. Guyana recognizes the Stateof Palestine based on its 1967 borders and supports itsaspirations to full membership in the United Nations.The Palestinian people deserve the same rights aspeople everywhere: to live in dignity  security  freedomand independence  at peace with all their neighboursand with the right to move freely in their own land.Guyana is encouraged by the continuing efforts ofthe Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of SouthSudan to resolve their differences through negotiations.We are hopeful also that the people of Mali will beable to overcome their current crisis and restore thecelebrated legacy of Timbuktu.Having regard for the principle of the sovereignty ofStates set down in the United Nations Charter  Guyanawishes to place on record once again its firm oppositionto the economic  financial and commercial embargoimposed against its sister Caribbean State of Cuba. Wecall for an immediate end to the policy. Cuba has madegreat contributions to the social development of manydeveloping countries. The lifting of the blockade canallow it to do much more. The myriad challenges affecting our world todaypose a formidable test to the multilateral system thatembodies our collective aspirations for peace anddevelopment. Such challenges tax our collective resolveto act in the best interest of humankind.The United Nations was established at a timewhen the vast majority of the human family was notrepresented in its councils and most nations could notspeak on their own behalf. That is not the case today.The near universal representativeness of its membershipgives the United Nations unparalleled legitimacy amongworld institutions. The governance of the Organizationneeds major reform if it is to reflect the realities of thepresent time and give full expression to the aspirationsof the world’s peoples. For the Security Council  theimperative for reform is particularly urgent. I reaffirmGuyana’s steadfast support for timely reform of theCouncil through an expansion in both the permanentand non-permanent categories  with particular regardto the representation of developing countries.The United Nations must also be reformed in amanner that will enhance its contribution to globaleconomic governance  in keeping with the purposesof its Charter. The United Nations has an importantrole to play in addressing the democracy deficit indecision-making on such matters  which often havefar-reaching implications  particularly for small States.Reforming the United Nations along those lines willprovide it with greater legitimacy  which is key to itseffectiveness in the eyes of the world. That legitimacywill be enhanced by the delivery of results that meetthe expectations of the global citizenry in areas whereaction is most needed.In conclusion  allow me to recognize the great roleplayed by this body over the years in promoting worldpeace. It has done a lot to contain and resolve regionaland local conflicts. In our time  the United Nations hasbecome indispensable in tackling pressing global issues.We must therefore all work together to strengthen theOrganization so as to make it more effective in the faceof the many challenges that are ahead."
"72",3011,"HND",67,2012,"﻿Asalways  it is an honour to participate in this Assemblyof the peoples of the world  which pursues the ongoingstruggle  among others  for the universal principlesupheld since 1948. It is here and at this time that we cansee that we are different  precisely in this Assembly which reflects the wealth of our diversity. It is herewhere we work constantly to overcome our naturaldifferences  respond to our common problems andstrengthen the human family through agreed outcomes.The international community must be consistentin that objective. We must be partners and allies at alltimes  ready to put forward initiatives  solutions andreforms that strengthen the need for close cooperationin the joint responsibility to protect not only the rightto that diversity  but also the right to demonstrate it andto fully live it. All must participate in this forum  withno sister nation excluded or not invited. We are calledupon to ensure the full recognition of each and everyone  with complete security for all.In Honduras  for some years we have acknowledgedin all areas the need for a reform process thatensures respect for people’s rights. Our first action in accordance with our national law  was to inviteregional and international organizations to come toHonduras and see our proposals and our work. Wehave set up a unit to investigate crimes against sexualdiversity — lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender —under the Office of the Public Prosecutor. It focusesits attention on vulnerable groups and on furtheringdialogue with the broader civil society.On gender issues  the Honduran State has a policygender progamme  which is a technical and politicaltool to help women achieve full equality and fairness.My Government supports a 40-per-cent share of womenin elected posts in the 2013 electoral campaign and a50-per cent participation in the following election in2017. In April  the National Congress of the Republicadopted a law against trafficking in persons. That is ameasure of compliance by the State of Honduras withimportant recommendations on trafficking in personsdrawn up by international human rights bodies.As we continue our fight for indigenous peoples another essential part of our national plan and visionfor the country is to put an end to the exclusion of suchpeoples and those of African descent and to ensure their full and legitimate right to preserve their culture language  traditions and world view. I am accompaniedat this Assembly by a representation of all indigenouspeoples in Honduras. Last year  we held the first WorldSummit for People of African Descent in Honduras.Next year  we will hold a world summit on indigenouspeoples.Today’s world presents a range of new threats to ourcountries that are not traditional in form and that havecreated new dynamics. I am referring to the activitiesof transnational criminal organizations. According toresearch centres that track illicit economic activity  it isestimated that those groups now account for 10 per centof the global gross domestic product. Those activitiesinclude money-laundering  bribes  drug trafficking counterfeit  piracy and illicit trafficking in persons andweapons.That astounding amount of financial resourcesdangerously corrupts our societies and Governments. Inmy view  it has become a threat to international securitythat must be assessed  understood and fought againstby all members of the United Nations. My country andour citizens are victims of the insatiable appetite fordrugs in developed countries and of the greed of theproducers and traffickers  who become rich on hugeprofits stained with the blood of the innocent. Hondurasis neither a consumer or producer country. Moreover the traffickers come from the south and the north butthose who die are Honduran. The mothers who sufferare Honduran  as are the orphans.However  Honduras is not unaware of the problem.Despite our limited economic resources  we arefacing such challenges with the necessary resolveto find comprehensive and immediate solutions tothat situation. Our primary objective is to defend thesovereignty and territorial integrity of our territory inthe face of the aggression of which we are victims. Tothat end  by every means possible we must stop drugsfrom entering our country and ensure a completeprohibition of those that enter our national territory.We have therefore updated the regulatory frameworkand are reforming our institutions and security system.As violence and crime threaten our young people we have launched prevention programmes that canopen up better horizons and opportunities. Legaland institutional reform and the implementation ofprogrammes and projects to stop the violence havestarted to yield results. The most recent figures of the independent Violence Watch in Honduras show that therate of homicides has fallen by 8.5 per cent this year.That figure  added to the 10-per cent drop in the annualincrease just recorded  represents a total reduction in thehomicide rate of 18.5 per cent per 100 000 inhabitants.However  it is not only up to us victims to make aneffort. As was made clear at the Summit of the Americasand at the recent General Assembly of the Organizationof American States  combating organized crime  inparticular illicit drug trafficking and related criminalactivities  is a common  shared  but differentiatedresponsibility.At this great Assembly  I wish to underscore theresolute cooperation of Colombia and Chile and therecent memorandum of understanding signed betweenHonduras and the United States of America. Wealso welcome the most recent measures taken by theBolivarian Republic of Venezuela on the issue of f lightbans.With regard to Colombia  allow me to congratulateits President Juan Manuel Santos Calderón and hisGovernment on his initiative to put an end to 50 yearsof war among brothers. We commend the FuerzasArmadas Revolucionarias de Colombia for theirreceptiveness. We also welcome the cooperation of theBolivarian Republic of Venezuela  Chile  Cuba andNorway. We wish them every success and hope thatpeace will return to that country.I would also like to thank the United Nations Officeon Drugs and Crime for its full support and recognitionof the fact that we in Central America cannot face suchscourges alone. We must seek every mechanism and tryto be as creative as possible in dealing with that threat.With greater respect for human rights and morecitizen security  we will have more and better education.Honduras has therefore launched a significant reformprocess. The National Congress has adopted laws tobolster education and to ensure the participation of thefamily and the community. Our focus and key objectiveare to provide a sound foundation for our children andour youth. We support the right of teachers to disagreeand  on occasion  to demonstrate  but the rights ofchildren and young people to the education that theyreceive in their classrooms cannot be allowed to beinterrupted.Look at what is happening to us  according toUNICEF data. In Honduras  approximately 600 teaching days have been lost in State schools and colleges in thepast 10 years. That data is equivalent to three schoolyears of 200 days. That means that a boy or a girl whohas completed ninth grade in their studies has  in fact only received a sixth-grade education. Clearly  that isa step backwards for society in general. According tofigures from the Department of Education  in 2009  80school days were lost  in 2010  30 days and  in 2011 40 days. All those days correspond to calls for massiveteacher walk-outs. According to a study of the NationalIndependent University of Honduras  the country’sprincipal university  of the top 100 colleges  thatleading State college is ranked in seventeenth position.What an injustice.It is our poorest children and young people  thosewho cannot afford private education  who go to Stateschools. We are condemning them to remain victims ofthe most serious exclusion. Those who most need themare denied opportunities. Why do we not declare in thisAssembly of peoples that classrooms are sanctuaries ofeducation and must never be closed?We must continue our efforts to ensure greateraccess for the poor to the productive sectors of thenational economy. Rapid  fair and sustainable growthis the true productive development of the country and along with education and health care  the best way toreduce poverty and extreme poverty.From the Office of the President and the First Lady who is here with me at the Assembly  among others we are working on a very important conditional cashtransfer programme. It currently reaches 30 per cent ofour poor families. That is an immediate and specificresponse to social exclusion.Our geographic location makes Honduras one ofthe countries most vulnerable to climate change. Alongwith our socio-economic characteristics  that compelsus  both nationally and regionally  to remain constantlyvigilant in order to respond to natural threats anddisasters. That is why we deem it key to participate inall specialized forums  in particular the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development.Today and now  in this Hall  Honduras reiteratesits commitment to the international community to thecomprehensive reform of the United Nations system.That will help to strengthen the principle of universalityon the basis of just  fair and inclusive representation.The challenge is for us all and our commitment isuniversal. That is why we are gathered here now."
"73",3036,"HRV",67,2012,"﻿I am pleased to addressthe Assembly for the first time since assuming theoffice of Prime Minister of the Republic of Croatia.We live in times of rapid changes  some of whichare positive  others deeply troubling. The world isbecoming more interconnected  which strengthenseconomic opportunities and accelerates development.Advances in science and technology are bringingmeasurable progress for humankind. The profoundtransformations in North Africa have raised the hopesof people for real democracy and freedom. However  there is also much that is disturbing.Conflicts in many parts of the world are wreakinghavoc on innocent civilians. Our planet is experiencinggrowing environmental damage. The global financialand economic crisis is still negatively affecting themajority of countries in both the developing and thedeveloped world. International peace and securityare under strain from terrorism  extremism  poverty inequality  human rights abuses and persecution.In confronting such challenges  Croatia acts in theglobal arena on the basis of two fundamental tenets.We stand ready to assume our responsibility towardsour own citizens and our neighbours in the regionand to be a constructive actor in Europe and a reliablepartner to all peace-loving countries in the world. Weactively promote solidarity with vulnerable groupsand communities and with the poor  the needy  thedefenceless and the underprivileged. Responsibilityand solidarity are two central principles of ourengagement in the United Nations in the pursuit ofpeace and security and in advancing freedom anddemocracy  protecting human rights  enhancingsustainable development  respecting international law ensuring equality and social justice and promoting therule of law.This year  Croatia marks the twentieth anniversaryof its membership of our global Organization. We aregrateful to the United Nations for playing an importantrole in our country’s struggle for political independence international recognition and full territorial integrity.We have great expectations of the United Nations.As a beacon of multilateralism  it provides the only universal framework for finding common solutions tointernational crises and current challenges. However we must ask ourselves whether the United Nations doesenough and what we can do collectively to improve itsperformance.We support the United Nations reform process which seeks to enhance its accountability  efficiency effectiveness and transparency. United  we are strongerthan alone. But let me stress something. If each of ourcountries becomes more democratic  more developed better run  more stable and more responsible  ourcombined strength will rise exponentially.The topic of the general debate  namely  resolvinginternational disputes by peaceful means  is at the veryheart of the United Nations. The Organization was builtto prevent war and to keep the peace. We highly valuethe instruments of preventive diplomacy and mediationand other peaceful means of resolving disputes. Inparticular  we see merit in resorting to the InternationalCourt of Justice  the Permanent Court of Arbitrationand other existing institutions. We ourselves havedone so. We agreed to settle the border issue with ourneighbour  Slovenia  through arbitration.However  we must understand that  in the long run peace cannot be imposed on parties to a dispute. Eachsituation has its own pace and dynamics. However there should be no excuse for a lack of genuine effort.Moreover  without a thorough resolution of issues there can be no room for a true reconciliation processto take place. In that vein  it is reassuring to note thatsupport for the peaceful resolution of disputes comesfrom many parts of the world  including countries thathave opted to use military means to settle disputes withtheir immediate neighbours in the recent past.Not everyone  however  shares equal respectfor peace and international law. This year has beenparticularly unfortunate in terms of the efficiency ofthe United Nations in the area of conflict prevention mediation and the protection of civilians. We havewitnessed appalling events  and thousands of civilianvictims have been exposed to heavy arms and thebrutality of armed forces and paramilitary groups.The lack of univocal action against the most severeviolations of the United Nations Charter is deeplytroubling. We must resolutely counter such an obsessionwith violence and repression. We should not shy awayfrom our responsibilities.At this juncture  I must strongly condemn the recentkilling of the United States Ambassador to Libya. Peoplecome from different cultures  legal traditions  historicalbackgrounds and forms of Government. Violence cannever be an acceptable response to freedom of speech.Like many previous speakers  I stress theimportance of keeping strong international attentionon Syria. We align ourselves with the position of theEuropean Union on the situation in Syria. We see theneed for prompt action on two fronts. The immediatepriority is to stop the loss of life on both sides in theconflict  to provide humanitarian aid and assistance tothe Syrian people and to support plans for the country’seconomic and political stabilization. Further fightingand militarization will only exacerbate the suffering andmake a peaceful resolution of the crisis more difficult.In addition  we have to remain committed to pursuinga Syrian-led political transition that will meet thedemocratic aspirations of the Syrian people. Resolvingthe crisis is our common responsibility. We thereforecall unceasingly for the full respect of internationallaw  especially international humanitarian law  humanrights and refugee law.There is no peace without justice and there is nojustice without the rule of law and without the fightagainst impunity. We support concepts of humansecurity and the responsibility to protect  as well astheir implementation and improvement through anopen and constructive dialogue within the frameworkof the United Nations. We also support the work ofthe International Criminal Court. Undoubtedly  thereare sufficient conflict prevention tools at our disposal.The question remains whether we can muster enoughresolve to use them.Syria is the most recent and most striking exampleof the need for a greater role for preventive diplomacyand mediation in the early phases of a conflict. The laterwe engage  the more divided we are. Timely preventionis crucial for successful conflict resolution. Preventionis also indispensable for countering other threats thatdestabilize countries and societies. Let me cite anexample. If a country is forced to fight corruptionthrough its law enforcement bodies and the judiciary that is usually a sign that it is too late  that corruption hasalready left its corrosive imprint on society. Our goal isto invest efforts aimed at building a society in whichcorruption is not an endemic phenomenon  in whichelected officials in Government structures demonstrateresponsibility towards their public office. That in turn encourages citizens to foster a corruption-free culturethrough their daily behaviour. When leaders lead bypositive example  people tend to follow. That is becauseculture f lows from structure. That is also the reasonwhy  at the level of the United Nations  we provide ourfull support to the implementation  wider acceptanceand universalization of international legal instrumentson non-proliferation  arms control and disarmament countering terrorism and preventing corruption.The global economic crisis combined with theeffects of globalization has contributed to the riseof popular distrust in the capability of politicalleaders to deliver needed solutions. That calls forgreater responsibility  better governance and strongercooperation among States  civil society and the privatesector. The Croatian Government has made notableprogress in making its work more transparent andmore available to its citizens. As a member of theOpen Government Partnership initiative  we havebecome active in the fields of fiscal transparency access to information  information technology andcivil society participation. We are pleased to host theSecond European Outreach and Support Meeting of theInitiative on 4 and 5 October in Dubrovnik  where weexpect to see the sharing of best practices and furtherpromotion of cooperation between Governments andcivil society organizations.Croatia has undergone an extensive but successfulpolitical  economic and social transition in a fairlyshort period of time. For that reason  we have aspecial understanding and first-hand experience of theinterwoven nature of peace  security  development andthe promotion and protection of human rights. Todaywe are sharing our knowledge and experiences withcountries in the region of South-Eastern Europe and withcountries emerging from crises  where our post-conflictunderstanding in nation- and institution-building isparticularly relevant.Croatia is currently a Vice-Chair of thePeacebuilding Commission. My country stands readyto assume its responsibility for creating more relevant better-performing and more empowered peacebuildingstructures. Croatia has already joined the CivilianCapacity Project’s CAPMATCH initiative designed toaddress the State-building needs of fragile and conflict-affected countries by offering our help in various fieldsof expertise gained through our own political transition post-conflict rehabilitation and unique EuropeanUnion accession process. Promotion and protection of human rights at the universal level remains one ofthe cornerstones of the role of the United Nations inthe world. Further development of the capacity of theHuman Rights Council is of the utmost importanceif we are to address seriously and efficiently urgenthuman rights situations and crises.We give special attention to continually improvingthe degree of respect accorded the fundamental humanrights of women and girls in different post-conflictsocieties. Women and children do not have armies toprotect them or trade unions to negotiate on their behalf.Yet  more and more women are becoming the primarybreadwinners in their families. The empowerment ofwomen and their full and equal participation in societiesare prerequisites for security  economic opportunity effective governance and social development. Croatiawill also continue with its active contribution to thework of the United Nations human rights forums in particular safeguarding the rights of vulnerablemembers of society  such as lesbian  bisexual  gay andtransgendered persons  promoting the moratoriumon the use of death penalty and ensuring the right toconscientious objection to military service.In times of economic uncertainty  be it due tofinancial crisis or long-term poverty  some tendto downplay the importance of human rights or ofconsolidating democracy. Every day we witness the sadrealities of starving children  deaths from preventablecommunicable diseases  inadequate education andhealth systems  and the continuous degradation of theecosystem. Challenges we are facing require integratedsolutions across interconnected issues and thefurther strengthening of the multilateral architecture.We welcome the outcome of the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development and encourageits follow-up process. We look forward to moreenergetic work on the implementation of sustainabledevelopment goals  which should complement existingcommitments and encompass all three dimensionsof sustainable development — economic  social andenvironmental — in a balanced and synergistic way.Croatia sees the Economic and Social Council and itssubsidiary bodies as a cornerstone for the achievementof balanced integration of sustainable development.Croatia is firmly devoted to participation in thoseprocesses  in particular in the fields of education andgender equality. Education is a sector which buildsa firm foundation for responding to the challengesof pursuing a post-2015 development framework. of human rights at the universal level remains one ofthe cornerstones of the role of the United Nations inthe world.

In addition to having joined NATOsince 2009  Croatia will become the twenty-eighthmember of the European Union (EU) next year. Ourinternational engagement is visible and strong. Croatiahas been an active participant in United Nationspeacekeeping missions  and I praise our women andmen who have risked their lives for the common good.We have been providing substantial contributionsto international efforts to stabilize Afghanistan andimprove the living conditions of its people  highlightingthe need for the protection of human rights  in particularthe rights of women and children. Croatia is also activelyparticipating in EU meetings at a time when the Unionis intensively trying to find ways of overcoming thecrisis and assuming its rightful place in the world.Let me emphasize that Croatia greatly appreciatesthe role that the EU has been playing in the UnitedNations as a significant and positive force behind anumber of initiatives. At the same time  for Croatia the process of EU accession was primarily an exercisein institution-building and State transition. We built astronger State so we can play a more substantive role inworld affairs.The perspective of EU membership has provedto be the main motivator and catalyst for social andpolitical reforms. We want our neighbours in South-Eastern Europe to undertake the same demandingbut rewarding road. We do not intend to assume amentoring role in the region  but we stand ready to shareour experiences and contribute constructively to thereforms in neighbouring countries based on democracyand European values.A peaceful and prosperous South-Eastern Europeis in Croatia’s strategic interest. Our vision is not justa region devoid of war. We strive to achieve genuinepolitical  societal and economic development. We wantpeople  especially young women and men  to havebetter standards of living and better prospects  to livein a clean environment and in a well-organized Statewith fully functioning institutions  to speak less aboutwhat was and much more about what could be. That reminds me of a quotation by Croatian publichealth expert Dr. Andrija Štampar  a man who foundedthe World Health Organization decades ago  who oncesaid that  “All people  regardless of whether they arerich or poor  have the right to be healthy!” I agree. Onlyhealthy and self-confident people can shape a healthyand progressive society. It is our primary responsibility individual and collective  to build such a world andbequeath it to our children."
"74",3081,"HTI",67,2012,"﻿I come hereto the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly tobring  on behalf of the Haitian people  my contributionto the debate that today brings together representativesof all peoples of the world.The election of Mr. Jeremić to the Assemblypresidency is for me a clear message that the smallStates Members of the United Nations can play a majorrole and make their contribution to peace  even in theglobal context of a sluggish economy. On behalf of theHaitian delegation  I would like to congratulate himfor having raised and encouraged the theme for today’s debate  which  unfortunately  is a concern of manyMembers of the great family of the United Nations.Also permit me to pay a well-deserved tribute toSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the dynamism wisdom  good judgement  vision and courage he hasshown more than once in managing extremely sensitiveinternational situations. I also would like to especiallythank him for the particular attention he has bestowedon my country  Haiti.Since my accession to power  the Haiti I lovehas attempted  in intent and in deeds — with manyups and downs  no doubt with successes and somemistakes — to emerge from its difficulties. I have beenstrongly dedicated to that effort. I can imagine that  withthe impetus provided  results will be forthcoming in amatter of months or years. How could it be otherwise?Haiti today  the Haiti that I have the mission of serving has understood that as long as there are quarrels frustrations  poverty  underdevelopment and inequality the world in general and Haiti in particular will neverbe protected from problems and controversies. As longas things are bad within nations  they will be tempted toturn to their neighbours and seek quarrels. Throughoutlong centuries of world history examples have not beenlacking. That is why we say today that  while it is goodto seek peaceful solutions to international disputes  itwould perhaps be wiser to try to prevent them.As long as access to water and to major markets or just compensation for raw materials and soundeconomic competitiveness are not available to us  wewill continue to have conflicts. As long as we at theUnited Nations do not pool our efforts so that access tohealth and to jobs and respect for differences become areality  we will continue to face conflicts  and we willbe reduced to painfully seeking peaceful solutions.We champion gender equality and we promotedemocracy. We daily attempt to apply equal treatmentfor all under the law. Respect for the environmentis inscribed in our programme of Government. Inmy view  those are the parameters that preventuncontrolled migrations  climate change  uselesswars  religion-related massacres  ethnic conflicts andterrorism.In our common quest for harmony in a world withdifferent cultures and diverse religions  we must allowour national dreams to emerge. Those dreams can besummed up as offering the possibility to every man andevery woman  regardless of color  religion or political preference  to live in peace and to rear their children indignity.The Haiti of Toussaint Louverture  over twocenturies ago  already understood that. Those nationaldreams  however  will not see the light of day if thecommitments made to help the development ofcountries like ours are not implemented  if prejudiceand suspicions of all kinds regarding the have-nots stillprevail. In order to prevent those differences  we mustregard others in a different way  with eyes purified I would say  at the Pool of Siloam. Haiti continues tosuffer from being regarded in the old way.On the eve of Haiti’s presidency of the CaribbeanCommunity  I repeat that with good faith and goodwill things can change  because our destinies  whateverside we may be on  are intimately intertwined. In aworld where the global trend is towards the forming ofeconomic and social blocs  the great can remain greatonly if they know how to transform the multiplicityof children of the planet into a single great social andeconomic family  respectful of the cultural and religioustraditions of all  without exclusion.Therefore the necessary dialogue must prevailamong us  not the dialogue of the deaf in which we havebeen powerlessly enmeshed for decades. We must havereal exchanges and negotiations that alone can put anend to the interminable conflicts  which have broughtfamilies grief and disrupted the peace of the world.History has taught us that there is no justice orequality in international relations. History has alsotaught us that every nation looks after its own interests.The establishment of the United Nations kindled hopeamong peoples that things could be different. We cannotlet that flame die. Within any family in general andwithin the family of the United Nations in particular there cannot be great and small  giants and dwarfs  butequal beings with interests to defend and opinions toexpress on the basis of forward-looking relationships relationships marked by liberty  equality  fraternity andthe pursuit of happiness for all.But let us not be misled: the best foundation forpeace in the world  for prosperity and for defeatingpoverty will always be democracy. Under myleadership  Haiti has understood that and is makingactive use of democracy to strengthen previously weakor ineffectual local institutions. Haiti has understoodthat only veritable democracy can bring stability: it is the indispensable precondition for any developmentpolicy.I wish to sincerely reiterate from this rostrum theurgent need we all must face to stop fighting and towork instead to protect the assets we share on thisplanet — to work together to reduce and manage therisks and disasters besetting the world  ruining oureconomies and hindering development.To my colleagues  the leaders of the world  I wishto recall that our respective peoples have chosen us andentrusted to us the mandate of building a better worldwhere no one will be left alone  where our children willfinally be able to grow up in peace.The words of Victor Hugo come to mind pronounced at the Peace Congress in 1847: “The daywill come when there will be no battlefields other thanmarkets open to trade and minds open to ideas.”Those are my wishes for the assembly of nations.May the good Lord give us His blessings and enlightenus. May He bless the city of New York  which isreceiving us so warmly  and grant us the wisdom andcapacity to work towards a more beautiful and morejust world."
"75",3127,"HUN",67,2012,"﻿The rule of law is among thetopics before the sixty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly. This is an especially important issue especially for someone who has had the opportunity topersonally experience the lack of it. For many decades Hungary belonged to the Communist-Socialist bloc.By 1949 the Communist takeover of power had beencompleted  just four years after the end of the SecondWorld War. The multiparty system had been eliminated.The majority of leaders of political parties establishedafter the war were forced into exile or were imprisoned.I was born 10 years later. I spent my early adult years and thus the years of my political awakening as well in a dictatorship. In fact  my two older children wereborn under that political system. For our generation just as for that of our parents  our everyday experiencewas of being deprived of human rights and liberties.Independence? From what  when Soviet troops keptHungary under occupation? Free elections? How  whenpolitical parties were non-existent and  even at late as1988  it was a crime against the State to form politicalorganizations.Constitutional freedoms  such as the freedom ofspeech  the right of assembly and the right to practicereligion freely  existed only on paper or not even onthat. The end of the 1980s and the fall of the Berlin Walland of the Iron Curtain  brought democratic changes toHungary as well. It was in the spring of 1990  more than40 years later  that we could organize free electionsagain. Preparations for the peaceful transition  andthen the post-election years  can be deemed to be asuccessful period from the perspective of the rule oflaw.Hungary  however  did not have a new  consolidatedConstitution that was not unlike the 1949 Constitution easily revealed through the number in its title. It wasthat shortfall that the Hungarian National Assemblyrectified in April 2011  when it decided to adopt the newfundamental law of Hungary. What is now the youngestConstitution of Europe incorporates almost all elementsof the European Convention on Human Rights  alongwith the rule-of-law institutions safeguarding thechecks and balances established in 1990. As a newelement  constitutional constraints compliant with therule of law have been imposed to curb irresponsiblepublic spending and the reckless increase of Stateindebtedness.The new Constitution of Hungary providesguarantees for the fulfilment of international legalobligations and for compliance and adherence to thegenerally accepted rules of international law. It isimportant to point out that numerous new provisions which concern the new  so-called fourth generation ofbasic rights  have been included in the new fundamentallaw.Article P of the Constitution stipulates that:“All natural resources  especially agriculturalland  forests and drinking water supplies biodiversity — in particular native plant and animalspecies — and cultural assets shall form part ofthe nation’s common heritage  and the State andevery person shall be obliged to protect  sustain andpreserve them for future generations”.Whereas Article XXI sets forth that:“Hungary shall recognise and enforce the rightof every person to a healthy environment. A personwho causes any damage to the environment shall beobliged to restore it or to bear all costs of restorationas defined by law.“No pollutant waste shall be brought intoHungary for the purpose of dumping”.Environmental protection  the preservation ofnatural values  the protection of soil  air and waterquality — how much time have we spent talking aboutthem recently? Due to the limited time alloted  permitme to highlight only a single issue from the larger setof problems before us  namely  the issue of water andsanitation. It is even more important to mention it herebecause  as a result of our common decision  nex yearhas been designated as the International Year of WaterCooperation.We can truly appreciate the adequate quantityand quality of water if we experience what it meansto be deprived of it  whatever the reason — pollution overconsumption or environmental  changes. Duringrecent years  a great variety of studies have beenpublished about our irresponsible behaviour  aboutthe short-sighted  and may I say  foolish  attitude withwhich we are polluting our waters. Allow me to citejust a few findings from these documents. Ninety percent of all communal wastewater and 70 per cent ofindustrial wastewater in countries of the developingworld is discharged into rivers without any treatmentwhatsoever. The chemical revolution of the era following the Second World War also has had seriously adverseimplications on the environment. Industry nowadayshas been using about 12 000 different types of toxicchemicals  while a single drop of crude oil can render25 litres of drinking water non-potable. Manufacturinga single vehicle requires 148 000 1itres of industrialwater. The toilet culture of nearly 2 billion people isstill not adequate today.What are the consequences? Polluted and toxiclakes  lifeless streams of water reminiscent of riversonly by their names. Instead  they are stinkingindustrial canals. The consequences are that there isnot enough water around to meet the everyday needs ofhuman consumption. Today  more than 1 billion peopledo not have access to clean  potable water. Anotherconsequence  according to a 2009 UNICEF study  isthat serious diseases  spread by polluted water and thelack sanitation  have been killing young children at apace equivalent to that of a Boeing 747 airplane packedwith young children crashing every four hours.I could continue to list dramatic examples andserious consequences of the lack of sanitation  but letus ask ourselves the question: if everything were allright with wastewater management  would it mean thateverything was also all right with respect to our watermanagement  water treatment and protection of ourwater basins? Unfortunately  the answer is no.Water management today requires internationalcooperation. It is indispensable. Half of the Earth’spopulation lives in so-called shared  or joint  watercatchment areas. The same river provides the watersupplies for two  three or more countries. Cooperationbetween such countries is a daily obligation. Absenceof such cooperation could lead to supply  social  healthor even war-related tensions. Nearly 1.5 billion peoplelive in river basins  where water usage is larger than theminimum extent of water replenishment  which leads tothe exhaustion of water reserves.At least two thirds of European cities with apopulation of 100 000 or more people are using theirwater resources faster than they can be replenished. Itis true that the standards are set high in agriculture especially if the agricultural sector wishes to produceadequate supplies of food for a further 2.5 billionpeople by 2050. That is especially true if we considerthat currently it takes about 140 1itres of water toproduce one cupful of coffee or about 15 000 1itres for1 kilogram of beef.We have been aware of these figures for years. Butwhat is knowledge worth if we do not put it to use? Whydo we wait for nature to remind us again and again ofour grave irresponsibility? Hungary assesses the issueof water and sanitation to be one of the most importantquestions of the twenty-first century. During recentyears  we have been active participants in the friends ofwater working group  created under the auspices of theUnited Nations. I think we will have ample work waitingfor us during the coming years as well. We are readyand willing to share our knowledge and experience.We are also looking forward to welcoming everyoneinterested to the conference on water and sanitation tobe organized in Budapest next autumn."
"76",3174,"IDN",67,2012,"﻿May peace be upon us all.I am honoured to represent my country  Indonesia  atthis year’s General Assembly debate to discuss how wecan find better ways to peacefully resolve or manageconflicts around the world.This  of course  is what the United Nations is allabout: to end the scourge of war  and to create a peacefuland equitable world order based on internationalcooperation.In the decades since its founding  the United Nationshas developed a number of instruments to addressconflicts in all their manifestations. During thosedecades  many inter-State and intra-State conflicts havebeen resolved — those in Angola  Bosnia  Cambodia Timor-Leste  as well as many others.The question we must now ask is whether thoseinstruments are adequate to address the whole spectrumof conflicts that the world community now faces.That is clearly evident in the Syrian crisis. Theworld community is witnessing  with great pain the worsening violence and unfolding humanitariancatastrophe on the ground; at the same time  the UnitedNations is in a state of paralysis in responding to thesituation. There is no end in sight to the conflict  and itappears that we have not yet seen the worst of the crisis.Indonesia therefore reiterates its call for theimmediate cessation of violence in Syria  which hastaken a high toll in innocent civilian lives. The SecurityCouncil must now unite and act decisively  as mandatedby the United Nations Charter  to bring the situationunder control.Clearly  whatever the explanation  the presentinternational system cannot for now resolve the Syrianconflict. There is every likelihood that the communityof nations will see similar conflicts in future. It willbe in a different corner of the world  and in a differentform  with different actors. It will not help the causeof international peace if  once again  we end up beingdivided and unable to positively alter the course of theconflict. The world community must develop ways toaddress them more effectively  towards their peacefulend.We must adapt to twenty-first century securitychallenges. There is no question that the world we livein today is in much better condition than it was in thetwentieth century. Freedom has spread. The threat ofnuclear holocaust is receding significantly. There isno prospect of a world war  the kind that twice createdsuch destruction during the twentieth century. Theglobal economy has expanded remarkably. Nationsare becoming more interdependent. Internationalcooperation and partnerships are flourishing.However  it is only relative peace  not total peaceas yet. We have moved from the era of the cold war toan era of “warm peace”. In this warm peace  the worldremains stuck with an outdated international securityarchitecture that still reflects twentieth-centurycircumstances  in contrast with the global economicarchitecture  which has done much better in adjustingto the twenty-first century.In this warm peace  the relationships between themajor Powers are  for the first time  marked by relativestability and increased cooperation. But the questionremains unanswered as to how they will accommodatethe growing ranks of emerging Powers that arereshaping the world order.In this warm peace  old enmities and long-standingconflicts can still resurface in the new strategiclandscape  even carried on by new generations.In this warm peace  we are seeing new securitychallenges and opportunities arising from the seismicpower shifts that are occurring in some regions. Thesecurity implications of the political events in theMiddle East are still unfolding.In this warm peace  the world community still hasto contend with an array of unfinished business: theArab-Israeli conflict  nuclear disarmament  territorial disputes in the South China Sea  tensions in the Koreanpeninsula  and the like.In this warm peace  new progress can easily regress.Hard-won peace processes can stall or even crumble.Strategic miscalculations in disputed theatres may leadto rising tensions and armed clashes.And in this warm peace  pockets of hatred andbigotry  intolerance and extremism continue to litterour world.Perhaps we will have to live with this warmpeace for decades. But I believe that we can lower thetemperature of this warm peace. Where possible  wecan resolve conflicts one by one. We can strengthenthe building blocks of peace. We can promote a newglobalism that can potentially change the dynamics ofconflict resolution.In order to do that  we need to try new approachesand be more imaginative. The first thing we have todo is to evolve a new strategic mindset. Let us face it:remnants of the cold-war mentality still persist in partsof the geopolitical landscape  not least in our own UnitedNations  where rigid  dogmatic  zero-sum calculationssometimes still come into play. For long-term peace  apeace born of trust and mutual confidence  we must getrid of that mindset. In that light  we must continue towork towards a reformed Security Council  a Councilthat reflects the strategic realities of the twenty-firstcentury and provides security to all.We must also work to perfect the instruments ofpeace  which include robust regionalism. We in theAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) haveseen how such regionalism can be a force for peace andcooperation. As a result of a strong regionalism  all ofSouth-east Asia has thrived under ASEAN cooperation.South-east Asia  which was once the cockpit of borderwars and the proxy wars of extra-regional Powers  hascome together.After ASEAN was founded  in 1967  it devotedthe early decades of its life as a regional organizationto cultivating the habits of dialogue  consultation andcooperation  not only among its members but with itsdialogue partners. Thus  each ASEAN country adopteda new strategic mindset based on trust and a sense ofhaving a stake in the success and progress of all theothers. Today the ASEAN family is united and at peacewith itself and with the rest of the world.At the same time  we can also develop a universalculture of mutual tolerance and mutual appreciation ofone another’s religious convictions. In such a world the voice of the moderates — the voice of reason andcompassion — would be heard clearly over the din ofprejudice and bigotry. In a global regime of compassionand tolerance  no war is possible.As a nation that celebrates its diversity of cultureand religions  Indonesia calls for mutual respect andunderstanding among peoples of different faiths.Despite initiatives undertaken by States at the UnitedNations and in other forums  the defamation of religionspersists. We have seen yet another of its ugly faces inthe film “ Innocence of Muslims” that is now causingan international uproar.The Universal Declaration of Human Rightsunderlines that  in exercising freedom of expression everyone must observe morality and public order.Freedom of expression is therefore not absolute. Hence I call for an international instrument to effectivelyprevent incitement to hostility or violence based onreligion or belief. As the product of internationalconsensus  that instrument should serve as a pointof reference with which the world community mustcomply.For good measure  we also need to promotea continuing process of dialogue among faiths civilizations and cultures. Of course  that dialogueshould not remain a dialogue  but should translate intoactual cooperation so that peoples of different culturesand faiths can come together as a community andcare for one another. Those communities will becomebulwarks for peace and they will make it difficult if notimpossible for any kind of armed conflict to erupt.We must also master the art of preventive diplomacy.Most disputes are intractable; they simmer for whatseems to be an eternity  but by a historical reckoningthey are not really long  drawn-out affairs. Sooner orlater  there comes a conf luence of factors and eventsthat provides a window of opportunity for resolving adispute and removing conflict from the table of options.That is what we in ASEAN have done with thepotential conflicts in the South China Sea. The territorialand sovereignty disputes have been festering there forthe better part of a century. But we are managing themwith restraint  confidence-building and  at present through earnest negotiations toward a legally bindingcode of conduct in the South China Sea.Finally  the culture of peace  mutual tolerance andappreciation  and cooperation must be supported by theright kind of economics. People need to be fed  to besheltered and to be assured of a future where they haveopportunities for a living and a livelihood. That is theonly way for peace to be locked in for the long term;that is  when it brings dividends that give human beingsrobust confidence in the future.The price of inequality between and within nationsgives rise to tension born of grievances that can  unlesseffectively addressed  lead to radicalism and evenviolence  which threaten international and nationalpeace and security. The solution is to form a globalpartnership for poverty eradication and for achievingthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  and thento formulate a post-MDG development agenda we canfully carry out.Our experience in the resolution of the intra-stateconflict in the province of Aceh proves that  if we doenough for peace  if there is a conf luence of favourablecircumstances  and if we are prepared to seize themoment  then peace can be achieved. The peace that weachieve will not only give temporary respite  it will alsolast for generations.For many years  peace has been treated as if itwere a science. There are whole libraries about howit can be achieved and preserved. I have come to theconclusion  however  that if peace has a technology it isone born of experience. That experience can be sharedand can be useful in creating new experience. And ifthere is enough sharing of experiences — and that iswhat Indonesia is trying to achieve — and if there issufficient political will to apply what is learned fromothers to one’s unique circumstances  then peace can bewidely spread. Peace can be effectively waged. And wewould have a gentler  better world."
"77",3221,"IND",67,2012,"﻿It is indeed a great privilegefor me to be able to address the General Assembly.Let me begin by congratulating Mr. Vuk Jeremić onhis election to the office of President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session. I assure him ofour constructive support in his work over the comingyear.We are assembled in New York at a time when weface multiple global challenges that transcend nationalboundaries. Developing countries are still to recoverfrom the downturn in the global economy. Their questfor poverty eradication and sustainable developmentremains an uphill task. Food and energy security as wellas health and education for their populations remaindaunting challenges. The West Asia-North Africaregion is seeing unprecedented sociopolitical upheaval.The question of Palestine remains unresolved. Threatsemanating from terrorism  maritime piracy  drugtrafficking and the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction continue to multiply. Those challengesdemand that we work for solutions in a concerted andcoordinated manner. That is the only path to success.At the United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment (Rio+20)  the international communityrenewed its commitment to sustainable developmentand recognized poverty eradication as the greatestglobal challenge. To act on that  it unequivocallyreaffirmed the sanctity of the Rio principles. Indiaremains committed to addressing climate changethrough a comprehensive  equitable and balancedoutcome based on the principles of equity and commonbut differentiated responsibilities. In less than twoweeks  in Hyderabad  we will host the eleventh meetingof the Conference of the Parties to the Convention onBiological Diversity. We seek the support of parties tofashion an outcome that harmonizes strong biodiversityaction with our basic development objectives.The process to develop a set of sustainabledevelopment goals has begun. The MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) must be integrated in thenew framework so that the unmet development prioritiescontinue to be the main focus. In the interim  with stillthree years to go to the MDG target date of 2015  itis imperative to ensure that all efforts to achieve theMDGs are made. In the global discourse on the post-2015 development agenda  the focus ought to be on theword “development”. It ought to be firmly entrenchedin the understandings and principles of Rio+20 and beanchored in the intergovernmental process at the United Nations. Priority must be given to the challenges ofpoverty  unemployment  food and energy  water  health environmental sustainability  unsustainable lifestylesand  above all  economic growth.Ensuring gender equality and women’sempowerment is essential to the pursuit of buildinginclusive societies. It is also an imperative for buildingstrong and resilient economies. We are happy to supportthe efforts of the United Nations. We also need to payparticular attention to upgrading the skills of youngpeople and to ensuring employment opportunities forthem. Children and youth are our future. We need toinvest in them to reap the demographic dividend tosecure our future.India remains firmly committed to scaling upour development partnership with Africa  includingthrough the framework of the India-Africa ForumSummit. Similarly  we will continue to build on ourcommitments for enhanced cooperation with leastdeveloped countries  landlocked developing countriesand small island developing States within the frameworkof South-South cooperation.India is a multireligious  multi-ethnic andmultilingual society. Our civilizational ethos has beenunderpinned by peaceful coexistence and tolerance values that the founder of the nation  Mahatma Gandhi placed at the core of India’s national life. Thoseprinciples are enshrined in our Constitution  whichprovides the foundation for our secular  democratic andinclusive society.Mutual respect for deeply held religious sentimentsis the bedrock of tolerance and coexistence. Unfortunaterecent events have highlighted the need for enhanceddialogue among faiths and civilizations. Violencecannot lead to greater understanding. It is necessaryto uphold norms of peaceful international discourse.In particular  the safety and security of diplomaticpersonnel should be fully respected.Terrorism remains one of the most potent threatsto international peace and security. The internationalcommunity must adopt a zero-tolerance approach toterrorism and must focus on efforts to dismantle theinfrastructure of terrorism  including its invidiousnetwork of epicentres  training facilities and financing.It is time we demonstrated the necessary political will toagree on a comprehensive convention on internationalterrorism so as to strengthen the normative framework against the increasingly sophisticated and globalizedterrorist challenge.India continues to be gravely concerned by themenace of piracy and armed robbery at sea. Apart fromthe major economic and commercial consequences ofthat scourge  it has serious humanitarian implicationsfor the large number of seafarers held hostage bypirates. The need of the hour is once again concertedinternational action under United Nations auspices with special attention to addressing the welfare ofseafarers and their families.Peacekeeping and disarmament are among theunique pursuits of the United Nations  becausethey embody the promise and innate potential of theOrganization to make the world a better place. Indiahas a proud history of participation in United Nationspeacekeeping operations dating back to the 1950s having taken part in as many as 43 peacekeepingoperations. The challenge before the internationalcommunity today is to ensure that United Nationspeacekeeping is adequately resourced and enabled tomeet the realities of today  including in post-conflictand peacebuilding contexts. In that regard  we arehopeful that progress will be made on all outstandingissues between the Sudan and South Sudan.India is committed to achieving a nuclear-weapon-free world. The principles of the Rajiv Gandhiaction plan of 1988 for achieving nuclear disarmamentin a time-bound  universal  non-discriminatory phased and verifiable manner remain relevant  evenafter more than two decades. A renewed consensuson non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament mustbe forged. Meaningful dialogue among all Statespossessing nuclear weapons is needed in order to buildtrust and confidence and to reduce the salience ofnuclear weapons in international affairs and securitydoctrines.Measures must be taken to reduce nuclearrisks  including the grave risk of terrorists gainingaccess to weapons of mass destruction  and thusto strengthen nuclear security. The Conference onDisarmament — the international community’s solemultilateral disarmament negotiating forum — deservesour support in discharging its mandate of negotiatingtreaties on issues on the international disarmamentagenda.The crisis in Syria continues unabated and is a matterof serious concern for us. Any further militarization of the crisis can have catastrophic consequences forthe region. We urge all parties to commit themselvesto resolving the crisis without any further bloodshedthrough an inclusive  Syrian-led political processthat can meet the legitimate aspirations of the Syrianpeople. We support the efforts of the United Nationsand urge all sides to cooperate in good faith with theJoint Special Representative of the United Nations andthe League of Arab States  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi.Support for the Palestinian cause has been acornerstone of India’s foreign policy. We were privilegedto receive President Mahmoud Abbas in India earlier thismonth. We support Palestine’s aspirations for enhancedstatus at the United Nations. It is imperative that there bean early realization of a sovereign  independent  viableand united State of Palestine  with East Jerusalem as itscapital  living within secure and recognized borders side by side and at peace with Israel  as endorsed inthe Arab Peace Initiative  the Quartet road map and therelevant United Nations resolutions.India desires constructive and friendly relationswith all its neighbours. We have a vision of a peaceful stable and prosperous region with enhanced cooperationand connectivity linking us with Central Asia  theGulf and South-East Asia. Within South Asia  we havesought to enhance bilateral relations individually witheach of our neighbours and through the aegis of theSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.We have embarked on a resumed dialogue processwith Pakistan and advocate a step-by-step approach tonormalizing our bilateral relations.An unwarranted reference has been made fromthis rostrum to Jammu and Kashmir. Our principledposition on the issue has been consistent and is wellknown. The people of Jammu and Kashmir have chosentheir destiny and reaffirmed it repeatedly throughIndia’s well-established democratic processes. We wishto make it abundantly clear that Jammu and Kashmir isan integral part of India.India supports the Government and people ofAfghanistan in their endeavour to build a peaceful stable  democratic and prosperous country. We areready to partner with the Afghan people as they rebuildtheir country in accordance with their own prioritiesand national circumstances. The continuing existencebeyond Afghanistan’s borders of safe havens andsanctuaries for terrorists is the major impediment to therestoration of peace and security in Afghanistan. India is committed to creating an enabling environment inwhich the Afghan people can live in peace and securityand decide their future for themselves  without outsideinterference  coercion or intimidation.The United Nations and the norms of internationalrelations that it has fostered remain the mostefficacious means for converting today’s challengesinto opportunities. However  we need to ensure that thearchitecture of global governance reflects contemporaryrealities. Sticking to structures designed at the end ofthe Second World War only constrains multilateralismfrom delivering on its promises.The most important and decisive step towardsremedying that situation pertains to the SecurityCouncil  which must be expanded in both the permanentand non-permanent categories. A reformed Councilmust include countries that are capable of bearing  andwilling to bear  the additional burdens relating to themaintenance of international peace and security  as wellas willilng to sustain global campaigns against new andemerging global threats. Let me also stress that we mustaddress  sooner rather than later  the incongruity of thelack of permanent membership for Africa.Equally  India will promote and lend its weight toenhancing the voice and participation of developingcountries in decision-making in global economic andfinancial institutions. The quota reform process of theInternational Monetary Fund must be accelerated withaltered quotas that reflect contemporary economicweight.Speaking in the Assembly on 14 October 1968 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said “The United Nations is the trustee of theworld’s peace and represents the hopes of mankind.Its very existence gives a feeling of assurance thatthe justice of true causes can be brought fearlesslybefore the world. This Assembly and the agenciesof the United Nations should  in all that they do sustain those hopes and promote the causes ofpeace”.Those words remain true to this day.Let me conclude by assuring the President and themembers of the Assembly that India will continue toabide by the purposes and principles of the Charter ofthe United Nations and will strive to strengthen theUnited Nations."
"78",3267,"IRL",67,2012,"﻿The primary mission of theUnited Nations is to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which... has brought untold sorrowto mankind”. Those are the words of the Charter of theUnited Nations: the legacy of our predecessors. Ourhistory tells us that conflict grows in the spaces wherehuman rights are denied; that  where deprivation inequality and injustice erode human dignity andpotential  conflict is the consequence; that war followshunger  and hunger follows war. That is why the Charterexpresses in simple and clear terms our commitmentto fundamental human rights. It reaffirms our “faithin the dignity and worth of the human person  in theequal rights of men and women and of nations largeand small”.Words can at times become too familiar  so familiarthat their force and impact fade with time. We whogather here each year must remind ourselves what westand for  reflect honestly on what we have achieved andwhat we have not achieved  and rededicate ourselves tothe ideals set out in our Charter. We must make thoselofty words relevant again to the peoples for whom wespeak here.The struggle for human rights is being fought everyday in every region of the world. There are too manyforgotten places and forgotten causes. We must not turnaway from the dark corners where the media spotlightdoes not shine or from which the media spotlight haslong departed. We must speak here for the five-year-old child  without a family  struggling to survive in arefugee camp; for the hungry mother cradling a dyinginfant at a feeding station; for those who cannot speakpublicly in their own lands and who look to us herefor the vindication of their basic rights; for those whobelieve in the words of our Charter and expect us to acton them.What is happening in Syria is an affront tohumanity. Syrian children  Syrian women and Syrianmen  young and old  are being slaughtered by their ownGovernment. A national army — the army of a sovereignState and Member of this Organization — is shelling itsown people as they queue for bread  and is launchingairstrikes on its own cities. We find compelling evidenceof wholesale massacres in towns such as Houla  andwe see Syrian children trying to make sense of theirshattered lives in refugee camps in neighbouringcountries. The violence is indiscriminate  and on anappalling scale. And it is not confined to one side.The people of Syria deserve the full support ofthe international community for the efforts to bring about an end to their suffering and to achieve an earlypolitical transition. Ireland backs the Joint SpecialEnvoy of the United Nations and the League of ArabNations  Lakhdar Brahimi  in his difficult task. Thepriority must be to achieve an immediate ceasefire andto get a political process under way that will facilitatethe transition.What is needed  above all  is a strong SecurityCouncil resolution that will authorize targeted sanctions.It must include a comprehensive arms embargo againstall those who are responsible for violating the humanrights of the Syrian people. That is what the Syrianpeople want from us  and what they have a right toexpect.There must also be full accountability for humanrights abuses. To prevent further atrocities now and tosave lives now  we must make it clear now that atrocitieswill not go unpunished. That is why Ireland supportsthe call by the United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights and by Switzerland and others for theSecurity Council to refer the situation in Syria to theInternational Criminal Court. We are working to buildup strong cross-regional support for such a referral.If the events in the Arab world over the past twoyears have taught us anything  it is that leaders who denylegitimate demands for greater political and economicfreedom and who instead resort to waging war on theirown people will inevitably lose the right to rule. Thesystematic denial of human rights and suppression ofdemocratic liberties has fuelled a profound desire forchange. In Tunisia  Egypt  Libya  Syria  Bahrain andelsewhere  Ireland has supported the will of the people peacefully expressed  to bring about long-overduedemocratic reforms.As world attention focuses on Syria  peace andjustice remain elusive elsewhere in the Middle East.The need for a lasting resolution of the Arab-Israeliconflict is as urgent as ever. Yet a depressing stalematepersists  with no progress towards a comprehensivesettlement. Ireland has said on many occasions thatthe establishment of a Palestinian State  within bordersbased on those of 1967  is long overdue. We have madeclear our hope that Palestine will be formally admittedto the United Nations as a full Member. While that hoperemains to be fulfilled  we welcome the announcementby President Abbas of his plans to consult with themembership of the General Assembly on a resolutionthat  as an interim step towards the achievement of that goal  would accord Palestine non-member Stateobserver status. Ireland will be proud to support afair and balanced resolution to that end  and we lookforward to the forthcoming consultations.We know of course that such steps will not alterthe situation on the ground. Israel must stop expandingsettlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem which only impede the prospect of achieving Israel’sown stated desire for a Palestinian State. The peaceand security of the people of Israel  to which they areentitled  gain nothing from denying the basic rights ofthe people of Gaza  who are subjected to an unjust andcounterproductive blockade.There is no alternative to serious negotiationsbetween the two sides aimed at a comprehensivesettlement. I would like to see President Abbas andPrime Minister Netanyahu commit themselves toachieving a comprehensive peace agreement withina specified timescale. That will not be easy and willrequire painful compromises on both sides. But if bothleaders are willing to embark on that path they willhave the unstinting support of the entire internationalcommunity  including Ireland.Peace and security are inextricably linked todevelopment. And development is at the heart ofIreland’s foreign policy. We have maintained ourofficial development assistance above 0.5 per cent ofgross national product — an important achievementin the face of major economic difficulties — and weremain committed to reaching the United Nations targetof 0.7 per cent as soon as we possibly can.Ireland’s aid programme represents a genuineinvestment by the Irish people in the world we sharewith the people of developing countries. We focus inparticular on the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Wehave prioritized investments in education  in health  ingood governance  and in the lives and rights of girlsand women and of persons living with HIV and AIDS.We have seen remarkable economic progress made inAfrican countries as a result of such investments. Butgreat inequalities still persist.It is in all our interests as global citizens to staythe course in relation to the Millennium DevelopmentGoals and to continue to work together for a sustainableand just world in which States operate on the basis ofthe rights of all people to participate in and contributeto society and inclusive economies. Against that background  the reality of hungerpersists in our world. The scandal is that we have thetools to tackle that suffering and that terrible waste ofhuman potential. How can people realize their rightsand potential if they cannot meet their most basic needsfor existence?No country knows that better than Somalia. Once Somalia was at the centre of the world’s attention. Butthe media spotlight moved on  and the people of Somaliahave faced a long struggle to emerge from war  famineand instability. Today  more than two million Somalisstill need our help. On the last Sunday of July 2012 I visited Mogadishu. Amidst the grinding poverty andthe misery of insecurity  I saw genuine signs of hopeand opportunity. Schools  homes  shops and businessesare being rebuilt and reopened  and people are returningfrom exile. Increased international engagement hasbeen essential. Real progress is also being achievedin Somalia’s transition to democracy  with impressiveengagement by Somali traditional and political leaders.We must support them.I pledge today that Ireland will not turn away fromSomalia or from humanitarian emergencies elsewherein the Horn of Africa  the Sahel and across the globe.We will work with our partners to highlight forgottencrises and the needs of fragile States  as well as to forgea more coherent and effective international approachtowards humanitarian action and development policy.Ireland has made the fight against hunger andundernourishment the key priority of its developmentpolicy. We have delivered on our commitment to direct20 per cent of our aid budget to that priority. With ourpartners  we have worked closely with the Secretary-General to build and support the Scaling Up Nutritionmovement. But we must do more. Collectively  we mustact now to recognize the systemic linkages betweenrecurring food price crises  humanitarian emergencies chronic undernourishment and the effects of climatechange.There is nothing that connects us more acrossborders  across oceans and across generations thanour mutual dependence on the planet that we share.Climate change is not something happening in a far-offland or in a distant future. It is happening now and it ishappening fast. It is not for another generation to solve.It is for us to take responsibility  to strive to achieveclimate justice  and to act.A deep attachment to the safeguarding of humanrights has been at the heart of Ireland’s foreign policysince the foundation of our State. Ireland’s commitmentto the protection and promotion of human rights hasbeen shaped by our own history. As a small islandnation that has experienced the impact of colonialism civil war and conflict  we learned the hard way thathuman rights can never be taken for granted.From the earliest days of our United Nationsmembership  we pioneered the promotion of nucleardisarmament and non-proliferation. We also paid closeattention to decolonization and the struggle againstapartheid. Today  we make substantial contributionsto United Nations development agencies and funds andare active participants in United Nations peacekeepingoperations. Thousands of Irishmen and Irishwomenhave served in United Nations peacekeeping forces and our people are intensely proud of that contributionto the ideals of the United Nations.Ireland also plays an active role in the work beingdone in the United Nations framework to protect andpromote human rights. We are proud that our formerPresident  Mary Robinson  served with distinction asUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rightsfrom 1997 to 2002. When the Human Rights Councilwas first established in 2006  Ireland declared that itwould seek election to that body in 2012. That is thefirst occasion on which we have sought election to theCouncil.We are committed to a robust and effective HumanRights Council. We want to see a principled Councilthat provides real leadership in that critical area. Wealso value and support the full participation of smallStates in the work of the Council. The UniversalPeriodic Review process has opened up an importantspace for national dialogue on human rights. Irelandengaged constructively and self-critically in its ownreview. We are also firmly committed to a strengthenedUnited Nations treaty monitoring body system and haveactively contributed to efforts to reinforce that system.Threats to human rights worldwide are proliferatingsteadily  whether from widespread poverty and hunger repressive systems of governance  religious intolerance gender-based violence or other sources. If Ireland iselected to the Human Rights Council in November we will serve the cause of international human rightsprotection as an active and committed member of theCouncil. The United Nations was founded on the principlethat diplomatic engagement and dialogue betweennations are essential to peace and human development.Attacks on diplomatic missions  such as we sawrecently in Benghazi  are attacks on that principle.They are never acceptable and must be condemned bythe international community.Ireland is currently chairing the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). That hasenabled us to make a contribution to the search foragreement across the full range of the OSCE’s activities.We have drawn on our own experience in buildingpeace in Northern Ireland to contribute to the work ofthe OSCE  which seeks to find peaceful settlements toprotracted conflicts. I am hopeful that by the end of ourterm in office we will have been able to make progressin some key areas  including in the so-called humandimension of the OSCE and on some conflict issues.We have used our chairmanship to prioritizeInternet freedom  reflecting the increasing importanceof the Internet as a platform for the exercise of humanrights and fundamental freedoms. A major conferencein Dublin last June focused on how human rightsand fundamental freedoms do not change with newtechnologies  but extend seamlessly into the digitalage. We look forward to assuming the presidency of theEuropean Union Council of Ministers in the first halfof next year. We will bring to that role the same energyand commitment that we have devoted to dischargingour OSCE responsibilities.A distinguished Irish politician and lawyer of thelate eighteenth century  John Philpot Curran  onceremarked that “the price of liberty is eternal vigilance”.If we are to live up to the aspirations of the Charter ofthe United Nations  we must also assume the burden ofeternal vigilance. The daily challenges to human rightsare painfully obvious. Our response must be clear andunrelenting. In the words of the Vienna Declaration andProgramme of Action  the promotion and protectionof human rights is “the first responsibility” ofGovernments. We cannot and must not shy from thatresponsibility."
"79",3314,"IRN",67,2012,"﻿We have gatheredhere to ponder and work together in order to build abetter life for the entire human community and for ournations.Coming from Iran — the land of glory and beauty the land of knowledge  culture  wisdom and morality the cradle of philosophy and mysticism  the land ofcompassion and light  the land of scientists  scholars philosophers  masters of literature and writers  theland of Avicenna  Ferdowsi  Hafiz  Maulana  Attar Khayyám and Shahriar — I represent a great andproud nation that is one of the founders of humancivilization and an inheritor of respected universalvalues. I represent a conscious nation that is dedicatedto the cause of freedom  peace and compassion  anation that has experienced the agony and bitter timesof aggression and imposed wars and that profoundlyvalues the blessings of peace and stability.I am now here for the eighth time in the eighth yearof my service to the noble people in this Assembly ofsisters and brothers from across the world to show tothe world that my noble nation  like its brilliant past has a global vision and welcomes any effort intendedto provide and promote peace  stability and tranquillity which can be only realized through the harmony cooperation and joint management of the world.I am here to voice to the Assembly and to thewhole world the divine and humanitarian message ofthe learned men and women of my country  a messagethat Iran’s great orator and poet  Saadi  presented tohumanity in his eternal poetry:“Human beings are members of a whole In creation of one essence and soul If one member is afflicted with pain Other members uneasy will remain.”I have talked over the past seven years about thecurrent challenges  solutions and prospects of thefuture world. Today  I want to raise and discuss suchissues from a different perspective. Thousands of yearshave passed since the children of Adam — peace beupon him — started to settle down in various parts ofthe Earth. Peoples of different colours  inclinations languages  customs and traditions persistently pursuedtheir aspirations to build a noble society for a morebeautiful life  blessed with lasting peace  security andhappiness.Despite all of the efforts on the part of righteouspeople and justice-seekers and the sufferings and painsendured by masses of people in the quest to achievehappiness and victory  the history of humankind ismarked  except in rare cases  with unfulfilled dreamsand failures.Imagine  for a moment  that there had been noegoism  distrust  malicious behaviour or dictatorships with no one violating the rights of others. Imagine thathumanitarian values had been viewed as the criterionfor social dignity instead of aff luence and consumerismImagine if humankind had not experienced theDark Ages and if the centres of power had not hinderedthe flourishing of knowledge and constructive thoughts.Imagine if the Crusades and the ensuing periods ofslavery and colonialism had not happened  and if thesuccessors of the Dark Ages had followed a coursebased on humanitarian principles.Imagine if the First and Second World Wars inEurope  the wars in Korea  Viet Nam  Africa  LatinAmerica and in the Balkans not happened  and if instead of the occupation of Palestine and impositionof a fake Government  displacement and genocide ofmillions of people around the globe  the truth behindthose wars based on justice had been revealed. Imagineif Saddam Hussein had not invaded Iran and the big Powers had supported the rights of the Iranian peopleinstead of siding with Saddam.Imagine if the tragic incident of 11 September andthe military actions against Afghanistan and Iraq thatleft millions killed and homeless had not happened  andif  instead of killing and throwing the culprit into thesea without trial or without informing the world andpeople of America  an independent fact-finding teamhad been formed to make the general public aware ofthe truth behind the incident and to prepare the way forthe perpetrators to be brought to justice.Imagine if extremism or terrorism had not beenused to secure political goals  if arms had been turnedinto pens  and if military expenditures had been used topromote well-being and amity among nations. Imagineif the drums of ethnic  religious or racial conflicts notbeen beaten  and if differences had not been used forthe purpose of advancing political agendas.Imagine if the right to criticize the hegemonicpolicies and actions of world Zionism had beenrecognized so as to allow the world media to reportfreely and shed light on the realities  instead of makingdeceitful gestures of seeming to back freedom but in away that offends the sanctities and most sacred beliefsof human beings and divine messengers  who  as thepurest and most compassionate human beings  are thegift of the Almighty to humankind.Imagine if the Security Council had not been underthe domination of a limited number of Governments thus preventing the United Nations from carrying outits responsibilities in a just and equitable manner.Imagine if international economic institutions hadnot been under outside pressures and were allowedto perform their duties and functions by using theirexpertise based on fairness and justice.Imagine if world capitalists had not weakened orvictimized national economies in order to make up fortheir own mistakes. Imagine if integrity and honestyhad prevailed in international relations and if all nationsand Governments were treated equally and justly inglobal efforts to build and expand happiness for allhumankind. And imagine if tens of other unfavourablesituations had not occurred throughout history  howbeautiful and pleasant our lives and how lovely thehistory of humankind would have been.Let us take a look at the state of the world today.With regard to the economic situation  poverty is on the rise and the gap between the rich and the poor iswidening. The total foreign debt of 18 industrializedcountries exceeds $60 trillion  while the repaymentof half of that amount would be sufficient to eradicatepoverty in the world. Economies dependent onconsumerism and the exploitation of people only servethe interests of a limited number of countries.The creation of worthless paper assets throughinfluence and control over the world’s economiccentres constitutes the greatest abuse in historyand is considered a major contributor to the globaleconomic crisis. It has been reported that $32 trillionin paper assets were printed by one Government alone.Development planning  based on a capitalist economy which runs in a vicious circle  triggers unhealthy anddevastating competition and is a failed practice.With regard to the cultural situation  from thestandpoint of the politicians who control the centres ofworld power  concepts such as moral principles  purity honesty  integrity  compassion and self-sacrifice aretypically rejected as defunct and outdated notions andan impediment to the accomplishment of their goals.They openly talk about their disbelief in the relevanceof ethics to political and social affairs.Authentic and indigenous cultures  the productof centuries — old national efforts  the commondenominator of which reflects profound human feelingsand love towards beauty and is the force that breedsdiversity  cultural life and social dynamism  are underconstant attacks and risk extinction. A specific lifestyle devoid of individual or social identity  is being imposedon nations by the organized and systematic destructionand the humiliation of identities.The family  the most noble social institution anda centre emanating love and humankind  has beenseriously weakened and its constructive role is on thedecline. The sublime role and nature of women asheavenly beings  manifestations of the divine imageand beauty and the main pillars of every society  havebeen damaged and abused by the powerful and thewealthy. The human soul has become frustrated and theessence of humankind humiliated and suppressed.With regard to the political and security situation unilateralism  the application of double standardsand the imposition of wars  instability and foreignoccupation in order to ensure economic interests andexpand dominance over sensitive centres of the worldhave become the order of the day. The arms race and intimidation by nuclear weapons and weapons of massdestruction by the hegemonic Powers have becomeprevalent. Testing new generations of ultra-modernweaponry and the pledge to disclose those armamentsin due time is now being used as part of a new languageof threat against nations to coerce them into acceptinga new era of hegemony. The continued threat by theuncivilized Zionists to resort to military action againstour great nation is a clear example of this bitter reality.A state of mistrust has cast its shadow on internationalrelations  while there is no trusted or just authorityto help resolve world conflicts. No one feels secureor safe  even those who have stockpiled thousands ofatomic bombs and other arms in their arsenals.With regard to the environment  which is a commonresource and heritage of all humankind that ensuresman’s survival  it has been seriously damaged anddevastated as a result of the irresponsible and excessiveuse of resources  particularly by capitalists across theworld. That situation that has caused massive drought flood  and pollution  inf licting irreparable damage andseriously jeopardizing human life on Earth.Despite advances in scientific knowledge andtechnology  the aspirations of Adam’s children havenot yet been fulfilled. Does anybody believe that thecontinuation of the current order is capable of bringingabout happiness for human society? Today everyoneis discontented and disappointed with the currentinternational order. Human beings do not deserve thecontinuous sufferings brought about by the presentsituation. The God of wisdom and compassion  wholoves all human beings  has not ordained such a destinyfor humankind. He has ordered humans  as the supremecreatures  to make the best and most beautiful life onEarth along the lines of justice  love and dignity.We must therefore think of a solution. Who isresponsible for all the sufferings and failures? Somepeople try to justify it by saying that everything isnormal and a ref lection of divine will  thereby puttingthe blame on States for all prevalent vices and evils.They are of the opinion that it is States that succumb todiscrimination and tyranny. It is States that surrenderto dictatorship and greed.It is States that submit to the hegemony andarrogance of expansionist Powers. It is States that areinfluenced by the propaganda tactics of other Powers and most of the evils in our world are the result of their passivity and willingness to live under the sway of theworld Powers.Such are the arguments raised by those who tendto blame States for the unfavourable conditions thatprevail around the world  with the aim of justifyingthe attitudes and destructive behaviour of the rulingminority. Such supposedly genuine claims can in noway justify continuing with the current oppressiveinternational order  because in fact poverty is beingimposed on States  and the Powers’ are pursuing theirambitions and goals either by deceit or by resort toforce. To justify their inhuman actions  they promotethe theory of the survival of the fittest.Yet in principle  what most Governments and Statesand their peoples are seeking is fairness; they submithumbly to what is right and what they want is to fosterdignity  prosperity and constructive relations. Thevast majority of people have no interest in expandingtheir territories  nor do they seek enormous wealth.They have no disputes among themselves on mattersof principle and have never played a part in unleashingthe disastrous events of history. I do not believe thatMuslims  Christians  Jews  Hindus  Buddhists or othershave any problems among themselves  or are hostileto one another. They get along comfortably and livetogether in an atmosphere of peace and amity. They areall devoted to the cause of justice  purity and love.The general tendency of States has always beento work towards positive common aspirations to thequalities that reflect great beauty and nobility  divineand human. The current abysmal state of the worldand the bitter incidents of its history are due mainly toiniquitous management by the self-proclaimed centresof power  which have dedicated themselves to the Devil.The order that is rooted in the anti-human concepts ofslavery and colonialism  old and new  is responsiblefor poverty  corruption  ignorance  oppression anddiscrimination in every corner of the world.The current world order has certain characteristics.It is founded on materialism and thus is unmooredfrom moral values. It has been shaped by selfishness deception  hatred and animosity. It believes inlabelling human beings  humiliating other nations anddominating and trampling on the rights of others. Itseeks to expand its domination by spreading discordand conflict among ethnic groups and nations. It aimsto monopolize power  wealth  science and technology.The policies of the world’s main centres of power are based on the principles of domination and conquest.Such Powers seek only supremacy; they do not desirepeace and they definitely do not promote it in theservice of their nations.Are we to believe that those who spend hundredsof millions of dollars on election campaigns have theinterests of the peoples of the world at heart? Despitewhat the big political parties in the capitalist countriesclaim  the money that goes into election campaigns isusually nothing but an investment on the part of theruling parties. In such countries  people have to vote forparties that represent only a small percentage of voters.The will and views of the masses have little impact orinfluence on big decisions  especially those concerningmajor domestic and foreign policies in the United Statesand Europe. Their voices go unheard even when theyconstitute 99 per cent of their societies. Human andethical values are sacrificed in order to win votes  andany willingness to listen to the demands of the peoplehas become merely a tool to be used at election time.The current world order is discriminatory and based oninjustice.What should be done  and what is the way out of thecurrent situation? There is no doubt that the world is inneed of a new order and a fresh way of thinking. Weneed an order that recognizes man as God’s supremecreature  possessing both material and spiritualqualities and a pure and divine nature  filled with thedesire to seek justice and truth; that aims to restorehuman dignity and believes in universal happiness andthe possibility of perfection; that seeks peace  lastingsecurity and welfare for everyone  in all walks of life around the globe; that is founded on trust and kindnessand brings our thoughts  hearts and hands closertogether and in which rulers love their people; that isjust and fair  makes everybody equal before the law and has no double standards; that allows world leadersto see themselves as committed servants of their people not their superiors; and that sees authority as a sacredgift from a people to its rulers  not an opportunity toamass power and wealth.Can such an order exist without the contributionof all to the way the world is run? It is abundantlyevident that when all peoples and Governments startto think  commit themselves to the aforementionedprinciples  focus on internationally important issuesand participate in decision-making  it will be possiblefor their desires to be realized. In raising collectiveawareness  the possibility of governing the world jointly becomes more real and the chances of putting itinto practice increase.Together  therefore  we must trust in God Almightyand stand up to the rapacious minority with all ourstrength in order to isolate them  so that they can nolonger decide the destiny of other nations. We mustbelieve in the bounty of God’s blessing and mercyand seek it within the integration and unity of humansociety. Governments that are born of free national willmust believe in their own unlimited capabilities andknow that they can achieve victory if they fight fiercelyto combat an unjust world order and to defend humanrights.We must lay the ground for united world rule byinsisting on justice in all its aspects  strengtheningunity and friendship and expanding economic  social cultural and political interaction in independent andspecialized organizations. We must care about theinterests of all the people of the world and join handsto reform the current United Nations entities with jointefforts and cooperation. The United Nations belongs toits Member States  and therefore the existence of anydiscrimination among those Members is a great insultto all. Any discrimination or monopolization of powerin the Organization is unacceptable.We must make a more coordinated effort to create promote and firmly establish the language neededto enable us to design the bodies needed for a unitedworld rule that is imbued with justice  love  freedomand amity. Participation in global management is thebasis of lasting peace.The Non-Aligned Movement  the second largesttransregional group after the United Nations  held itssixteenth summit in Tehran with the motto of “Jointglobal management”  cognizant of the importanceof this issue and of the shortcomings of the currentmismanagement in the emergence of crises andproblems afflicting the world today. During the summit participating Heads of State and representatives ofmore than 120 countries underscored the necessity ofmore serious and effective participation of all nationsin global management.Fortunately  we are now at a historic juncture. Onthe one hand  Marxism is no longer around; it has beenpractically eliminated from management systems. Onthe other hand  capitalism is bogged down in a self-made quagmire. Indeed  it has reached a deadlock andappears to be unable to come up with any noteworthy solutions to the world’s various economic  political security and cultural problems. The Non-AlignedMovement is proud to again emphasize the rightfulnessof its historic decision to reject the power polarities andunbridled hegemony ruling the world. On behalf of themembers of Non-Aligned Movement  I would like toinvite all the countries in the world to play a more activerole in making it possible for everybody to contribute toglobal decision-making processes. The need to removestructural barriers and to encourage the process ofuniversal participation in global management has neverbeen greater.The United Nations lacks the efficiency to bringabout the required changes. If this inefficiency persists nations will lose hope in the ability of global structuresto defend their rights. If the United Nations is notrestructured  international interactions and the spirit ofcollective global cooperation will be tarnished  and thestanding of the United Nations will be damaged.The United Nations  which was established withthe purpose of expanding justice and reinstitutinguniversal human rights  has in practice been engulfedby discrimination  preparing a supportive ground fordomination by a few powerful countries. Consequently United Nations inefficiency has increased. Moreover the existence of the veto right and monopolization ofpower in the Security Council have made it nearlyimpossible to defend the rights of the nations.The issue of United Nations restructuring is vital;the need has been emphasized time and again by Staterepresentatives. That goal that yet to be accomplished.I would like to urge the States Members of the UnitedNations and the Secretary-General and his colleaguesto place the issue high on their agenda and to devisean appropriate mechanism to make it happen. TheNon-Aligned Movement stands ready to aid the UnitedNations in that essential endeavour.Creating peace and lasting security with a decentlife for all  although a great and historic mission  canbe accomplished. Almighty God has not left us alone inthat mission and has said that it will surely happen. Ifit does not  then that will contradict his wisdom. Godhas promised us a man of kindness  a man who lovespeople and absolute justice  a man who is a perfecthuman being  named the Imam Al-Mahdi — a manwho will come in the company of Jesus Christ and therighteous. By using the inherent potential of all theworthy men and women of all nations — I repeat  the inherent potential of all the worthy men and women ofall nations — he will lead humanity into achieving itsglorious and eternal ideals.The arrival of the ultimate saviour will mark a newbeginning  a rebirth and a resurrection. It will be thebeginning of peace  lasting security and genuine life.His arrival will be the end of oppression  immorality poverty and discrimination and the beginning ofjustice  love and empathy. He will come  and he willcut through ignorance  superstition and prejudice byopening the gates of science and knowledge. He willestablish a world brimming with prudence  and hewill prepare the ground for the collective  active andconstructive participation of all in global management.He will come to grant kindness  hope  freedom anddignity to all humankind as a gift. He will come so thathumankind will taste the pleasure of being human andbeing in the company of other humans.He will come so that hands will be joined  heartswill be filled with love  and thoughts will be purified andwill be at the service of the security  welfare  happiness well-being and peace of all. He will come to return allthe children of Adam  irrespective of their skin color to their innate origin after a long history of separationand division  linking them to eternal happiness and joy.The arrival of the ultimate saviour  Jesus Christ and therighteous  will bring about an eternally bright futurefor humankind  not by force or by waging wars butthrough thought-awakening and developing kindnessin everyone. Their arrival will breathe new life into thecold and frozen hearts and bodies of the world. He willbless humankind with a spring that puts an end to ourwinter of ignorance  poverty and war with the tidingsof a season of blossoming. He will end the winter ofignorance for humankind.Now we can sense the sweet scent and the soulfulbreeze of the spring  a spring that has just begun andthat does not belong to a specific race  ethnicity  nationor region  a spring that will soon reach all the territoriesin Asia  Europe  Africa and the Americas. He will bethe spring of all the justice seekers  freedom loversand the followers of heavenly prophets. He will be thespring of humankind and the greenery of all ages. Letus join hands and clear the way for his eventual arrival with empathy and cooperation  in harmony and unity.Let us march on this path to salvation for the thirstysouls of humankind to taste immortal joy and grace.  Long live this spring  long live this spring — againand again  long live this spring."
"80",3361,"IRQ",67,2012,"﻿I standhere today in order to convey to the General Assemblythe sincere regards and best wishes of the people ofIraq  who wish to share in forging closer bonds ofamity and cooperation between peoples and countries at a time when my country is undergoing a structuraltransformation at every level  a process that will enableit to reform itself  achieve its goals and consolidate itsgains.We are building a future through the consciousunderstanding of our history as the cradle of civilizationand where the earliest writing system and codifi cation oflaws were born. Iraq has been successful in establishinga democratic  pluralistic and federalist State on the basisof an enlightened Constitution  drafted by our people’srepresentatives and voted on by our people.Our Constitution lays out the aspirations of ourpeople to a free and decent life based on freedom democracy and the peaceful transfer of authority citizenship and human rights. Iraq has regained itssecurity  political and economic health in record timeand under extremely difficult conditions  where theforces of darkness had been betting that terrorism wouldderail the experiment. However  thanks to God and thepatriotic vigour and self-awareness of our nation  ourpeople were able to turn the page. Our efforts are basedon a cultural history of about 10 000 years and on agreat human legacy created by the heavenly messages and laudable human experiences that flourished in ourglorious land.Our renewed ambition to build a modern Statewhere the Iraqi people enjoy freedom  developmentand prosperity requires us to move towards theestablishment of good  friendly and equal relationswith all nations in the world  within the framework ofa cooperative international system governed by clearrules that prevent the problems and crises that couldundermine its prosperity and stability. The new Iraqhas chosen to embark on the path of cooperation andcoordination with the international community in thepolitical  economic and development spheres. Thoseefforts have been coupled with significant qualitativeleaps in our economic growth that will qualify Iraq toreturn to the realm of the world economy and to emergewithin the international economic system  based on arealistic vision that has achieved a number of positivedevelopments over recent years.According to various indicators  our grossdomestic product (GDP) has doubled  which has in turndoubled the per capita share of the GDP. According toprojections by the International Monetary Fund  Iraq’sGDP is expected to reach approximately $150 billionin 2014. The Iraqi Government has also succeeded inimplementing policies to curb inflation and to controlgovernmental spending  in addition to our success incollaborating with the international community toreduce the debt accumulated by the country over pastdecades.We have embraced a theory of balanced growth inour national development plans for the upcoming years in which the oil sector is to serve as the engine forother sectors. Iraq has oil reserves amounting to about143 billion barrels and potential reserves surpassingthe current estimated proven reserves  in addition tolarge reserves of natural gas amounting to 126.7 trillioncubic feet. We expect investments to contribute tosubstantial development in the oil industry in Iraqthrough licensing rounds  establishing refineriesand other oil- and gas-related sectors and industries.Estimates suggest that from 2017 to 2020 productionwill reach more than 10 million barrels of oil per day.The development plan will include all sectors andinfrastructure in order to provide secure and promisinginvestment opportunities. The Iraqi Government hasprepared legislation to promote confidence in the Iraqieconomy by providing legal protection for foreigninvestments in Iraq through the guarantees listed in the investment law itself and through Iraq’s accession tothe Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency in 2007and through bilateral treaties to guarantee and protectinvestments.We were able to establish solid foundations forpolitical conduct  which has matured rapidly as ourpeople have grown to accept those unlike themselvesand to live according to the principle of citizenship the rule of law  the independence of the judiciary andthe freedom of expression. We proudly announce that owing to our freedom of opinion and expression  wedo not have a single prisoner jailed for his beliefs oropinions. In our fight against terrorism  human rightsremain a cherished principle that we respect andpromote as a just cause. We do not have any justificationto tamper with such rights.It is true that confronting terrorism has cost Iraq a lotof blood  tears  sweat and financial resources  but thatconfrontation has rewarded our people with a permanentimmunity against violence. It has also created extremesensitivity vis-à-vis violence as a means to resolve ourstrife with others. Therefore  as much as we care aboutsparing our people the ravages of fighting  we hope thatother countries  especially neighbouring countries  willlearn from the Iraqi experience and spare their peoplesunnecessary turmoil. We call upon them to adopt theprinciple of negotiation to resolve conflicts and theuse of dialogue  logic  reason  laws and the peacefultransfer of power.That is the essence of Iraq’s position regardingthe revolutions of the Arab Spring  which we cannotdo anything about except to be entirely on the side ofthe people and their legitimate aspirations  their rightto self-determination and the right to choose their ownrulers. We share the concerns regarding the issues facingthe peoples and States Members of the Organization;those concerns represent a humanitarian  legal andmoral burden  because all of us share one world  whichis affected by conflicts and their aftermath.Based on that  the Syrian issue and the humanitariandiffi culties facing civilians in that country occupy agreat deal of our attention. We think that the escalatingviolence in Syria is a reason for distress and concern and it is incumbent upon the leaders gathered here towork in earnest to stop the bloodshed  which claims thelives of tens and perhaps hundreds of people every dayin Syria. We would like also to draw attention to thedanger of providing the fighting parties with weapons  which only leads to more violence  bloodshed and lossof life. The situation is endangering the social fabricof the Syrian people and may lead to fragmentationand disintegration of that people  whom we cherish andwhose unity and sovereignty we care about.We also realize that the facts on the ground suggestthat regional and international intervention couldadversely impact the Syrian issue and might causeunlimited chaos and devastation that would spare noone  including the interveners. We therefore sincerelycall for dialogue and a peaceful solution as the onlymeans to end a crisis that could engulf the whole regionand exacerbate the current situation.The events in Syria have demonstrated thatresolving the crisis through violence and force coulddouble the costs incurred by the Syrians and the region for such means only increase the suffering of civilians destroy infrastructure and multiply the number ofdisplaced persons and refugees. That is why we hopethat all the parties to the conflict understand that themilitary solution alone is a dangerous move and gamble.From this rostrum  we call upon kings  presidents andother heads of State here today at this humanitariangathering to support reconciliation and dialogue amongall Syrians and endorse the United Nations and ArabLeague initiative promoted by Mr. Lakhdar Brahimiafter the noble efforts of Mr. Kofi Annan reached at animpasse.In that regard  we do not hide our concern aboutthe consequences of the ongoing crisis  which couldonly worsen if sectarian and ethnic strife is triggered.That  in turn  could lead the region and its peoples intoa spiral of fighting with no end on the horizon. Sucha prospect makes it incumbent upon us on us to try inearnest to contain and peacefully resolve the crisis while preserving the interests of the Syrian people andpreventing further deterioration of the situation.Iraq’s initiative aimed at resolving the Syrian crisiscontinues to stand as a beacon of peace  as we searchfor an exit acceptable to all the forces of good. Ourinitiative is based on the following two points. First Iraq has a keen desire to see Syria remain intact as aState  and we support the hopes and aspirations of theSyrian people for a free and dignified life. Secondly Iraq is concerned at the possible repercussions of theviolence and destruction caused by Syria’s internalwar and sectarian strife  which we fear could have aspillover effect.Iraq’s unwavering and well-known position doesnot deviate from the Arab ranks on issues of crucialimportance to our Arab nation. We accordinglysupport the establishment of the State of Palestine inthe occupied Palestinian territories  with Jerusalem asits capital  and declare our support for the membershipof the State of Palestine in the United Nations. Wealso declare our unequivocal rejection of the policiesof oppression  Judaization and usurpation of landthat Israel pursues without regard for internationalcondemnation of its unjust practices  including the useof brutal force. We also reject Israel’s disregard for therepeated international calls to sign the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to place itsmilitary arsenal and facilities under the supervision ofthe International Atomic Energy Agency.We have tirelessly called for the establishmentin our region of a zone without nuclear weapons.Therefore  within the international framework  we arecontributing to efforts to implement a Middle East zonefree of all weapons of mass destruction  chief amongwhich are nuclear weapons. That is why we endorse thepreparations for the Helsinki conference to be held thisyear with a view to setting up a process that would setup such a zone. Any failure in that endeavour wouldlead to an arms race in a region that is in dire need ofpeace and stability.We condemn and reject the discriminatory policiespursued against religious and ethnic minorities inmany countries the world over. We especially condemnthe inhumane violations of the rights of Muslims inMyanmar  who face genocide. The world’s conscienceshould not remain untroubled by the gravity of theirplight. Such situations run counter to all the principles ofhuman rights law  religious teachings and internationalconventions.Our good and friendly relations with ourneighbours  the region and the entire world aregoverned by a balanced foreign policy based on mutualrespect  common interests and non-interference in theaffairs of others. We also uphold the principles of goodneighbourlinessand dialogue in our relations with theArab and Muslim worlds  as well as with the entireworld. Iraq hosted the League of Arab States Summitin March  which marked a return to our active  naturaland pioneering role in joint Arab decision-making andaction. That was followed by Iraq’s hosting of one ofthe rounds of international negotiations on the Iraniannuclear issue  which we undertook in the objective  balanced and responsible spirit that characterizes Iraq’sclear position with respect to that issue. It is a positionthat declares our firm support for international effortsto prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons  whileaffirming the right of peoples and countries to benefitfrom the peaceful use of nuclear energy.We call upon the international community represented by the United Nations and its Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  whom we highly respectand revere  to extend support to Iraq’s efforts to exitfrom the Chapter VII provisions imposed on us as aresult of the mistaken policies of the former regimefollowing Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait  especially as thereis no longer any justification for such internationalaction. Iraq is no longer a threat to anyone and hasfulfilled most of its obligations  as is confirmed bythe renewal of our brotherly relations with the Stateof Kuwait  seen specifically in the mutual visits ofhigh-level officials of our respective countries and theserious and constructive dialogue based on a sinceredesire and sustained efforts to resolve all outstandingissues between us.I would be remiss if I failed to speak of therepulsive abuse directed at the great ProphetMuhammad — peace be upon him — and the wave ofviolent protests that shook the Islamic world becauseof a ridiculous movie that attacked the image of ourProphet — peace be upon him — a movie that nearlycaused relations between East and West to unravel. Weneed to conduct a sincere and serious examination onhow to prevent the recurrence of such insults throughan international ban that criminalizes those who insultreligions  disrespect religious symbols or insult thegreat prophets and messengers. Such actions constitutea blatant aggression against everything great  holy andsacred. The recurrence of those obscene actions willsupply terrorists with prime material for recruitingangry youth for use in violent actions that threatenpeace and security  which could cause many casualties as recent events have shown.We therefore clearly need to contain such attacksand prohibit the production and dissemination of similarprovocative materials. As nobody in the Islamic worldis able to contain the consequences of such disregardfor Islamic values and their sanctity  we believe that theUnited Nations should play a central and constructiverole in this matter  with a view to preventing potentiallyfar-reaching and dangerous ramifications.In conclusion  we  the people and Government ofIraq  extend our hand to the other Member States with aview to increased collaboration aimed at achieving ourcommon goals. Those are noble goals  based on loftyprinciples and cherished human values  and honour allhuman beings as supremely deserving of leading a freeand safe life and enjoying fundamental freedoms. Wehope that when we meet again our world will be a saferplace  our peoples will enjoy better conditions and theinternational climate will have improved."
"81",3408,"ISL",67,2012,"﻿It is a pleasure tobe able to address the General Assembly here on thisbeautiful morning in New York  and I would first liketo take the opportunity to congratulate you  Sir  onyour election to the presidency of the Assembly at itssixty-seventh session. Be assured that the Icelandicdelegation will assist you in every way possible.Last year  I brought the Assembly the messagethat my Government would propose to our Parliamentthat Iceland recognize Palestine as a sovereign andindependent State. I am happy to be able to stand heretoday and say that we have fulfilled that promise. Whatis more  not a single member of the Icelandic Parliamentvoted against the recognition of Palestine. Today  wehave a fully fledged and strong formal diplomaticrelationship between our two countries of Palestine andIceland. The United Nations recently estimated that Gazawill no longer be livable by 2020 unless urgent actionis taken to improve water and power supplies  healthand basic education. The deplorable living conditionsdescribed in that report demonstrate only too well thatthe situation in Palestine is unacceptable to anyonewho has respect for human dignity. I have visited Gazamyself. I met with fishermen who are not allowed to gofishing in the waters out of Gaza. As an old fishermanmyself  that hurts my heart. l met children in Gazawhose lives are made impossible by poverty  violenceand a blockade that others have described as an open-door prison. I have seen for myself how the human rightsof the people of the West Bank are violated every dayby a man-made barrier that cuts through their roads their lands and their lives.When I was in Qalqilya  the words of a formerstatesman we all know rang in my head. Mr. Netanyahu tear down this wall! I also know that the Israeli peopleare just like the rest of us. They want to live in peace and they deserve it. The best way to ensure that is atwo-State solution  which would benefit not only thePalestinian people but the Israeli people as well.I had the pleasure of listening to Mr. Netanyahu’sspeech on Thursday (see A/67/PV.12)  and I have acomment to make on behalf of the Icelandic people:Do not bomb Iran. Not this year  not next year. Donot start another war in the Middle East. At the sametime  I say to President Ahmadinejad and the Iranianleadership: do not build a bomb. Let diplomacy work not rabble-rousing or fear-mongering. Let us work forpeace together.We have seen fundamental changes break forthwith the Arab Spring  as demonstrated by democraticelections. Democracy only matures and gets betterwith time  and the Arab Spring is just beginning. In ademocracy everyone has a place and a role. As friendsand supporters we urge everyone to ensure that theArab Spring will advance the rights of all people working towards societies characterized by democracyand social justice  where our sisters in the Arab worldare allowed to thrive in the same way as our brothers and where women and men enjoy equal rights.Sadly  there is no spring in Syria. Thousandsof innocent people  not least innocent children  arelosing their lives because of an oppressive regime. Theinternational community must make a stronger andbetter effort to seek a political and peaceful solution forthe sake of those children and the people of Syria. Wemust also ensure that those who commit atrocities  onboth sides  will at the end of the day account for theiractions in an international court of law.The Syrian problem is also a wake-up call for theUnited Nations with regard to the Security Council.Syria has demonstrated how archaic the Council is  andhow out of tune with the needs of the modern world.The truth is that the Security Council has become anobstacle to the international efforts to address and solvesituations such as that in Syria. We must reform it soas to make it a tool for  not a hindrance to  progress insituations such as that in Syria this year  or as we sawlast year concerning the Palestinian application.Let me also add on behalf of the Icelandic peoplethat we must always oppose terrorism and violence inany form. I think that we should all unite in condemningthe ghastly murder of the American Ambassador inLibya recently. Our embassies  our tools to work for thepeople for peace  must always be inviolable.Iceland is an open and embracing society  and ourforeign policy is based on human rights for everyone.From the point of view of human rights  it is notacceptable that anyone is persecuted or mistreatedbecause of her or his sexual orientation or genderidentity. The Universal Declaration of Human Rightsguarantees equal treatment and non-discrimination toall people  and we  the community of nations  mustensure that equal treatment in every sense of thatword extends as well to sexual orientation and genderidentity. Let us not forget that we all  every humanbeing  are sparks from the same sun.Small countries can be global pioneers. Icelanddemonstrated that by breaking the ice for the recognitionof the Baltic States  by introducing geothermal energyas an alternative in the world’s quest for clean power and by leading by example in the fight for genderequality.I am quite happy to relate that now  on this verymorning  Iceland is embarking on a pioneeringprogramme regarding clean renewable energy for upto 150 million Africans. Iceland has ensured fundsto work with the World Bank to assist 13 countries ofthe East African Rift Valley to identify  research andprepare their considerable geothermal resources forutilization. That will be the greatest and most historicproject Iceland ever has cooperated on with developingcountries. I can express the feeling today that Iceland isvery proud of it.put our expertise in geothermal energy to use in EastAfrica  we are also protecting the environment of ourown neighbourhood  the Arctic. The ice is melting ata pace far greater than we ever anticipated. We do notneed to be prophets to predict that in the Arctic vastareas will open  and sooner rather than later  for newtransport routes between continents and for productionof oil and gas. Of course  that may bring immensecommercial benefits to the people living in and aroundthe Arctic. But we are also acutely aware of the dangersto the fragile Arctic ecosystem and to the traditionallivelihood of Arctic peoples. I tell the Assembly todaythat we have to tread very carefully in the Arctic. It isin the interest of all nations to ensure that the ArcticCouncil becomes strong enough to provide  in thefuture  the forum for shaping important decisions oncommon interests of all the Arctic peoples.Times have been pretty tough in Iceland in recentyears. In the recession in Europe  we were the firstcountry down  but we were also the first country up.If there is any lesson to be drawn from the Icelandicrecovery  it is that austerity does not work on its own.Iceland certainly went through its share of austerity but we also raised taxes  especially on the wealthiestcitizens  and we used the revenue to stimulate growthand ensure that the welfare system was intact. Today Iceland has some of the lowest unemployment inEurope and robust economic growth. The Icelandicmodel works.Perhaps the best sign that Iceland is back inbusiness is the fact that while the global recessionhas  sadly  led to a decline in international support fordeveloping countries  Iceland is bucking that trend. Weare increasing ours substantially.Finally  the first letters of the themes that I havebroached here today — Palestine  energy  the Arctic climate change and the economy — form the word weshould all hold dearest towards each other  whateverour differences  that is  peace."
"82",3455,"ISR",67,2012,"﻿It is a pleasure to see theGeneral Assembly presided over by the Ambassador from Israel  and it is good to see all of the representativeshere.Three thousand years ago  King David reignedover the Jewish State in our eternal capital  Jerusalem.I say that to all those who proclaim that the JewishState has no roots in our region and that it will soondisappear. Throughout our history  the Jewish peoplehave overcome all the tyrants who have sought ourdestruction. It is their ideologies that have beendiscarded by history. The people of Israel live on. Wesay in Hebrew  the Jewish State will live forever.The Jewish people have lived in the land of Israelfor thousands of years. Even after most of our peoplewere exiled from it  Jews continued to live in the landof Israel throughout the ages. The masses of our peoplenever gave up the dream of returning to our ancienthomeland. Defying the laws of history  we did just that.We ingathered the exiles  restored our independenceand rebuilt our national life. The Jewish people havecome home. We will never be uprooted again.Yesterday was Yom Kippur  the holiest day ofthe Jewish year. Every year  for over three millennia we have come together on this day of ref lection andatonement. We take stock of our past. We pray for ourfuture. We remember the sorrows of our persecution;we remember the great travails of our dispersion; wemourn the extermination of a third of our people 6 million  in the Holocaust.But at the end of Yom Kippur  we celebrate. Wecelebrate the rebirth of Israel. We celebrate the heroismof our young men and women who have defended ourpeople with the indomitable courage of Joshua  Davidand the Maccabees of old. We celebrate the marvelof the flourishing modern Jewish State. In Israel wewalk the same paths as those trodden by our patriarchsAbraham  Isaac and Jacob. But we blaze new trails inscience  technology  medicine and agriculture. In Israelthe past and the future find common ground.Unfortunately  that is not the case in many othercountries. For today  a great battle is being wagedbetween the modern and the medieval. The forces ofmodernity seek a bright future in which the rights ofall are protected  in which an ever-expanding digitallibrary is available in the palm of every child  in whichevery life is sacred.The forces of medievalism seek a world in whichwomen and minorities are subjugated  in which knowledge is suppressed  in which not life but deathis glorified. Those forces clash around the globe  butnowhere more starkly than in the Middle East. Israelstands proudly with the forces of modernity. We protectthe rights of all our citizens  men and women  Jews andArabs  Muslims and Christians — all are equal beforethe law.Israel is also making the world a better place. Ourscientists win Nobel Prizes. Our know-how is in everycell phone and computer that every one of us uses. Weprevent hunger by irrigating arid lands in Africa andAsia. Recently  I was deeply moved when I visitedTechnion  one of our technological institutes in Haifa and I saw a man paralysed from the waist down climbup a f light of stairs  quite easily  with the aid of anIsraeli invention. And Israel’s exceptional creativity ismatched by our people’s remarkable compassion. Whendisaster strikes anywhere in the world — in Haiti Japan  India  Turkey  Indonesia and elsewhere — Israelidoctors are among the first on the scene  performinglifesaving surgeries.In the past year  I lost both my father and myfather-in-law. In the same hospital wards where theywere treated  Israeli doctors were treating PalestinianArabs. In fact  every year  thousands of Arabs fromthe Palestinian territories and Arabs from throughoutthe Middle East come to Israel to be treated in Israelihospitals by Israeli doctors. I know that that is notgoing to be spoken by speakers at this podium  but itis the truth. It is important that the world be aware ofthat truth. It is because Israel cherishes life that Israelcherishes peace and seeks peace. We seek to preserveour historic ties and our historic peace treaties withEgypt and Jordan. We seek to forge a durable peacewith the Palestinians.President Abbas just spoke here. I say to him andI say to the Assembly: we will not solve our conflictwith libellous speeches at the United Nations. That isnot the way to solve it. We will not solve our conflictwith unilateral declarations of statehood. We haveto sit together  negotiate together and reach a mutualcompromise  in which a demilitarized Palestinian Staterecognizes the one and only Jewish State.Israel wants to see a Middle East of progress andpeace. We want to see the three great religions thatsprang forth from our region — Judaism  Christianityand Islam — coexist in peace and in mutual respect. Yet the medieval forces of radical Islam  whichthe world just saw storming American Embassiesthroughout the Middle East  oppose that. They seeksupremacy over all Muslims. They are bent on worldconquest. They want to destroy Israel  Europe  America.They want to extinguish freedom. They want to end themodern world.Militant Islam has many branches  from the rulersof Iran with their Revolutionary Guards to Al-Qaidaterrorists to the radical cells lurking in every part of theglobe. But despite their differences  they are all rootedin the same bitter soil of intolerance. That intoleranceis directed first at their fellow Muslims and then atChristians  Jews  Buddhists  Hindus  secular people and anyone who does not submit to their unforgivingcreed. They want to drag humankind back to an age ofunquestioning dogma and unrelenting conflict.I am sure of one thing. Ultimately  they will fail.Ultimately  light will penetrate the darkness. Wehave seen that happen before. Some 500 years ago the printing press helped pry a cloistered Europeout of a dark age. Eventually  ignorance gave way toenlightenment. So too  a cloistered Middle East willeventually yield to the irresistible power of freedomand technology. When that happens  our region will beguided not by fanaticism and conspiracy but by reasonand curiosity.I think the relevant question is not whether thisfanaticism will be defeated. It is how many lives willbe lost before it is defeated. We have seen that happenbefore too. Some 70 years ago  the world saw anotherfanatic ideology bent on world conquest. It went downin flames  but not before it took millions of people withit. Those who opposed that fanaticism waited too longto act. In the end they triumphed  but at a horrific cost.My friends  we cannot let that happen again. Atstake is not merely the future of my own country. Atstake is the future of the world. Nothing could imperilour common future more than the arming of Iran withnuclear weapons. To understand what the world wouldbe like with a nuclear-armed Iran  just imagine theworld with a nuclear-armed Al-Qaida. It makes littledifference whether these lethal weapons are in thehands of the world’s most dangerous terrorist regime orthe world’s most dangerous terrorist organization. Theyare both fired by the same hatred; they are both drivenby the same lust for violence. Just look at what the Iranian regime has done upuntil now  without nuclear weapons. In 2009  theybrutally put down mass protests for democracy in theirown country. Today  their henchmen are participatingin the slaughter of tens of thousands of Syriancivilians  including thousands of children — directlyparticipating in those murders. They abetted the killingof American soldiers in Iraq and continue to do soin Afghanistan. Before that  Iranian proxies killedhundreds of American troops in Beirut and in SaudiArabia. They have turned Lebanon and Gaza into terrorstrongholds  embedding nearly 100 000 missiles androckets in civilian areas. Thousands of such rockets andmissiles have already been fired at Israeli communitiesby their terrorist proxies.In the past year  they have spread their internationalterror networks to two dozen countries across fivecontinents  from India and Thailand to Kenya andBulgaria. They have even plotted to blow up a restauranta few blocks from the White House in order to kill adiplomat. And of course  Iran’s rulers repeatedly denythe Holocaust and call for Israel’s destruction almoston a daily basis  as they did again this week from theUnited Nations.So I ask  given this record of Iranian aggressionwithout nuclear weapons  just imagine Iranianaggression with nuclear weapons. Imagine their long-range missiles tipped with nuclear warheads  theirterror networks armed with atomic bombs. Who herewould feel safe in the Middle East? Who would be safein Europe? Who would be safe in America? Who wouldbe safe anywhere?There are those who believe that a nuclear-armedIran can be deterred like the Soviet Union. That is avery dangerous assumption. Militant jihadists behavevery differently from secular Marxists. There wereno Soviet suicide bombers. Yet Iran produces hordesof them. Deterrence worked with the Soviets  becauseevery time the Soviets faced a choice between theirideology and their survival  they chose their survival.But deterrence may not work with the Iranians oncethey get nuclear weapons.A great scholar of the Middle East  ProfessorBernard Lewis  put it best. He said that for the ayatollahsof Iran mutually assured destruction is not a deterrent it is an inducement. Iran’s apocalyptic leaders believethat a medieval holy man will reappear in the wakeof a devastating holy war  thereby ensuring that their brand of radical Islam will rule the Earth. That is notjust what they believe; it is what is actually guidingtheir policies and their actions. Just listen to AyatollahRafsanjani who said  “the use of even one nuclear bombinside Israel will destroy everything  however it wouldonly harm the Islamic world.” Rafsanjani said: “It isnot irrational to contemplate such an eventuality”. “Notirrational” is what he said. And that is coming from oneof the so-called moderates of Iran.Shockingly  some people have begun to peddle theabsurd notion that a nuclear-armed Iran would actuallystabilize the Middle East. That is like saying a nuclear-armed Al-Qaida would usher in an era of universalpeace.I have been speaking about the need to prevent Iranfrom developing nuclear weapons for over 15 years.I spoke about it in my first term in office as PrimeMinister  and then I spoke about it when I left office.I spoke about it when it was fashionable  and I spokeabout it when it was not fashionable.I speak about it now because the hour is gettinglate  very late. I speak about it now because the Iraniannuclear calendar does not take time out for anyone orfor anything. I speak about it now because when itcomes to the survival of my country  it is not only myright to speak  it is my duty to speak. And I believe thatit is the duty of every responsible leader who wants topreserve world peace.For nearly a decade  the international communityhas tried to stop the Iranian nuclear programme withdiplomacy. That has not worked. Iran uses diplomaticnegotiations as a means to buy time to advance its nuclearprogramme. For over seven years  the internationalcommunity has tried sanctions with Iran. Under theleadership of President Obama  the internationalcommunity has passed some of the strongest sanctionsto date.I want to thank the Governments represented herethat have joined in that effort. It has had an effect. Oilexports have been curbed and the Iranian economyhas been hit hard. It has had an effect on the economy but we must face the truth. Sanctions have not stoppedIran’s nuclear programme either.According to the International Atomic EnergyAgency  during the last year alone  Iran doubled thenumber of centrifuges in its underground nuclearfacility in Qom. At this late hour  there is only one way to peacefully prevent Iran from getting atomic bombs.That is by placing a clear red line on Iran’s nuclearweapons programme.Red lines do not lead to war. Red lines prevent war.Look at NATO’s charter. It made clear that an attack onone member country would be considered an attack onall. NATO’s red line helped keep the peace in Europefor nearly half a century. President Kennedy set a redline during the Cuban missile crisis. That red linealso prevented war and helped preserve the peace fordecades.In fact  it is the failure to place red lines that hasoften invited aggression. If the Western Powers haddrawn clear red lines during the 1930s  I believe theywould have stopped Nazi aggression  and the SecondWorld War might have been avoided. In 1990  ifSaddam Hussein had been clearly told that his conquestof Kuwait would cross a red line  the first Gulf Warmight have been avoided.Clear red lines have also worked with Iran. Earlierthis year  Iran threatened to close the Straits of Hormuz.The United States drew a clear red line and Iran backedoff. Now  red lines could be drawn in different parts ofIran’s nuclear weapons programme  but to be credible a red line must be drawn first and foremost in one vitalpart of their programme: on Iran’s efforts to enrichuranium.Now let me explain why. Basically  any bombconsists of explosive material and a mechanism toignite it. The simplest example is gunpowder and afuse — that is  you light the fuse and you set off thegunpowder. In the case of Iran’s plans to build a nuclearweapon  the gunpowder is enriched uranium. Thefuse is a nuclear detonator. For Iran  amassing enoughenriched uranium is far more difficult than producingthe nuclear fuse. For a country like Iran  it takes manyyears to enrich uranium for a bomb. That requiresthousands of centrifuges spinning in tandem in verybig industrial plants. Those Iranian plants are visibleand they are still vulnerable.In contrast  Iran could produce the nucleardetonator  the fuse  in a lot less time — maybe under ayear  maybe only a few months. The detonator can bemade in a small workshop the size of a classroom. Itmay be very difficult to find and target that workshop especially in Iran. That is a country that is bigger thanFrance  Germany  Italy and Britain combined. Thesame is true for the small facility in which they could assemble a warhead or a nuclear device that could beplaced in a container ship. Chances are you will notfind that facility either.So in fact  the only way that you can crediblyprevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon  is toprevent Iran from amassing enough enriched uraniumfor a bomb. So how much enriched uranium do youneed for a bomb  and how close is Iran to getting it?Let me show you. I brought a diagram for you. Hereis the diagram. This is a bomb. This is a fuse.In the case of Iran’s nuclear plans to build a bomb this bomb has to be filled with enough enricheduranium  and Iran has to go through three stages. Inthe first stage they have to enrich enough low-enricheduranium; in the second stage they have to enrich enoughmedium-enriched uranium. And in the third  andfinal  stage they have to enrich enough high-enricheduranium for the first bomb.Where is Iran? Iran has completed the first stage. Ittook them many years  but they completed it  and theyare 70 per cent of the way there. Now they are wellinto the second stage. By next spring  at most by nextsummer  at current enrichment rates  they will havefinished the medium enrichment and moved on to thefinal stage. From there  it is only a few months  possiblya few weeks  before they get enough enriched uraniumfor the first bomb.What I told the Assembly just now is not basedon secret information. It is not based on militaryintelligence. It is based on public reports of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency. Anybody canread them. They are online.So if these are the facts — and they are — whereshould a red line be drawn? A red line should be drawnright here  before Iran completes the second stage ofnuclear enrichment necessary to make a bomb andbefore Iran gets to a point where it is a few months awayor a few weeks away from amassing enough enricheduranium to make a nuclear weapon.Each day  that point is getting closer. That is whyI speak today with such a sense of urgency  and that iswhy everyone should have a sense of urgency.There are some who claim that even if Irancompletes the enrichment process  even if it crossesthat red line that I just drew  our intelligence agencieswill know when and where Iran will make the fuse  assemble the bomb and prepare the warhead. No oneappreciates our intelligence agencies more than thePrime Minister of Israel. All these leading intelligenceagencies are superb  including ours. They have foiledmany attacks  they have saved many lives  but theyare not foolproof. For over two years  our intelligenceagencies did not know that Iran was building a hugenuclear enrichment plant under a mountain. Do wewant to risk the security of the world on the assumptionthat we would find a small workshop in a country halfthe size of Europe in time?The relevant question is not when Iran will getthe bomb. The relevant question is at what stage canwe no longer stop Iran from getting the bomb? Thered line must be drawn on Iran’s nuclear enrichmentprogramme because these enrichment facilities are theonly nuclear installations that we can definitely see andcredibly target.I believe that faced with a clear red line  Iran willback down. This will give more time for sanctions anddiplomacy to convince Iran to dismantle its nuclearweapons programme altogether.Two days ago  from this podium  President Obamareiterated that the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran cannotbe contained (see A/67/PV.6). I very much appreciatethe President’s position  as does everyone in my country.We share the goal of stopping Iran’s nuclear weaponsprogramme. This goal unites the people of Israel. Itunites Americans  Democrats and Republicans alike.and it is shared by important leaders throughout theworld. What I have said today will help ensure that thiscommon goal is achieved. Israel is in discussions withthe United States over this issue  and I am confidentthat we can chart a path forward together.The clash between modernity and medievalismneed not be a clash between progress and tradition. Thetraditions of the Jewish people go back thousands ofyears. They are the source of our collective values andthe foundations of our national strength. At the sametime  the Jewish people have always looked towards thefuture. Throughout history  we have been at the forefrontof efforts to expand liberty  promote equality andadvance human rights. We champion those principlesnot in spite of our traditions but because of them. Weheed the words of the Jewish prophets Isaiah  Amos andJeremiah to treat all with dignity and compassion  topursue justice and cherish life and to pray and strive forpeace. Those are the timeless values of my people  and they are the Jewish people’s greatest gift to humankind.Let us commit ourselves today to defending thosevalues so that we can defend our freedoms and protectour common civilization."
"83",3502,"ITA",67,2012,"﻿I wish to warmly congratulateyou  Mr. President  on your election to the presidencyof the General Assembly at this session. Rest assuredthat you have Italy’s full support as you assume yourcrucial responsibilities in the service of internationalpeace and cooperation.Every day and everywhere  people strive toovercome fear  achieve justice and persevere throughhardship and uncertainty to protect their familiesand livelihoods and to ensure a better future for theirchildren. Governments strive to achieve and preservepeace  justice and prosperity in a world gripped bypolitical tensions  civil wars and a severe economic andfinancial crisis. In 2011  financial markets showed serious newsigns of tension  due primarily to the deterioration ofpublic finances. What we have been experiencing isnot a recurrent cyclical imbalance. In the case of theEuropean Union (EU)  it is the deepest and worst crisisin its history.Other crises threatened the European project in thepast  but each time Europeans found a way to continuedown the path on which they embarked upon morethan 50 years ago. In his memoirs  Jean Monnet notedthat Europe would be built through crises. Indeed  itis by solving those crises that Europeans have realizedhow closely integrated their interests are and howinterdependent their economies. Today  the world haslearned how essential a viable Europe is to tacklingglobal economic and security challenges  and howimportant the euro area is to the recovery of the globaleconomy. Today it is clear that “more Europe” is in thegeneral interest  and not just that of Europeans.We cannot overlook the importance of the measuresbeing taken at the EU level to strengthen governance andfiscal integration  as was underlined by President VanRompuy. It is also essential that European Governmentsdeliver at the national level. Italy will continue to doits part to further strengthen fiscal sustainability andenhance potential growth.Historic changes are taking place in theMediterranean region. Italy has stood by the Arabpeoples in their quest for justice and democracy. In thepast months  we have engaged with the new leadersof those nations. I found in them a deep commitmentthat inspires hope. Both bilaterally and through theEuropean Union  we are lending concrete support totheir new Governments to assist their recovery  setmutually beneficial trade policies and foster inclusiveeconomic development  thereby promoting stabilitythroughout the region.There is also an element of self-interest in thatpursuit. Instability around the Mediterranean impactsour own security. Conflicts and social unrest on thesouthern shore spill over to our own shores. Terrorismfinds new avenues to reach Europe. Trafficking inhuman beings has destabilizing effects on the countriesof destination and often results tragedies at sea  whichwe can no longer accept. The situation in the Sahel is ofgrave concern and a top priority for Italy. It is a volatilemix of fragile institutions and rampant organizedcrime and terrorist groups. We cannot let the situationdeteriorate any further. Italy  for one  will make its contribution jointly with our partners and the States ofthe region.The ultimate goals of peace and cooperation willbe achieved only if all the countries concerned worktogether on the basis of mutual respect and a sharedsense of purpose. A culture of dialogue must prevailover confrontation. Extremism and intolerance must beisolated and rejected. Rights  dignity and opportunitiesmust be offered to every component and member of oursocieties  especially minorities and women.Italy is fully committed to implementing such avision. For us  protecting and promoting human rightsis a long-standing domestic commitment as well as afundamental pillar of our foreign policy. In that vein we shall continue to pursue the universal abolitionof the death penalty  the protection of minorities  theadvancement of the status of women and the free and safeexpression of religion or belief. We need to cooperatewisely in firmly rejecting the misrepresentation ofreligions or beliefs as an instrument of disruption anddestabilization.To achieve that goal  good laws are alwaysnecessary  but they are not always enough. Tolerancemust be promoted through educational programmesand consistent grass-roots work  engaging the effortsof both Governments and civil society. I stronglyencourage the membership of the Assembly and allrelevant international organizations to resolutelypursue such an approach.The Arab Spring has experienced difficulties  yet ithas also scored a number of remarkable achievements.Nothing is easy  yet nothing is impossible. But nothingcan be achieved without goodwill and good faith  whichwe will need if we want to put an end to the ongoingmassacres and the massive human rights violations inSyria. The regime in Damascus refuses to comply withthe resolutions of the Security Council  and it continuesto commit indiscriminate violence against civilians.Italy fully supports the mission of the new Joint SpecialRepresentative for Syria and strongly urges the SecurityCouncil to overcome the stalemate that is preventingeffective international action. History will not belenient in judging those who bear responsibilities.Nor can we underestimate the increasing danger ofnuclear proliferation. Italy supports the commitment ofthe International Atomic Energy Agency to obtainingclarification of the true nature of the Iranian nuclearprogramme. We urge Iran to fully comply with all the relevant Security Council resolutions. Italy advocatesmore effective arms control regimes  and looks forwardto concrete nuclear disarmament measures as proposedin President Obama’s Prague appeal.Respect for the rule of law is the basic condition forpromoting human rights and maintaining internationalpeace and security. In that context  Mr. President  Iwelcome your proposal of “Bringing about adjustmentor settlement of international disputes or situationsby peaceful means” as the overarching theme for thissession of the General Assembly.I am also pleased to announce that Italy is nowready to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of theInternational Court of Justice in accordance withArticle 36  paragraph 2  of the Court’s Statute. Thisis a defining moment for the International Court ofJustice and for international jurisdictions in general since they are the key institutions for interpretinginternational law and guaranteeing global compliancewith its provisions. More and more  effective actions toassure international order and security demand respectfor international law.The same holds true for actions to counter newthreats  such as piracy  which is particularly troublinggiven its impact on the world economy and on the livesof seafarers. International efforts to protect sea lanesand fight piracy can be effective only if all nationscooperate in good faith  according to the establishedrules of international customary law and United Nationsconventions  including those protecting the jurisdictionof the f lag State in international waters.The Organization can expect no less from eachMember State  and especially from those Members thataim to have a decisive influence on the rules of globalgovernance. Any erosion of the sending State’s exclusivejurisdiction over servicemen on official duty wouldjeopardize the status of our agents on internationalmissions. Consequently  it would also undermine thesustainability of United Nations peacekeeping missions.By the same token  we must not tolerate any breachof diplomatic missions  whose inviolability must berespected. We firmly condemn any proposition thatviolence is an acceptable response to speech.Transnational organized crime also requires acollective response grounded in the rule of law andthe principle of shared responsibility. With the UnitedNations Office on Drugs and Crime  Italy has activelycontributed to  and co-financed with Colombia  a digest to promote the implementation of the PalermoConvention by illustrating best practices. The digestis a practical tool for law enforcement officials andprosecutors. It will be officially presented next monthin Vienna  on the occasion of the sixth Conference ofthe Parties to the United Nations Convention againstTransnational Organized Crime.The United Nations is called upon to play a keyrole in conflict prevention  the settlement of disputesand providing assistance for crisis managementand nation-building  in cooperation with regionalorganizations. Despite the current financial juncture Italy continues to do its part in crisis management peacekeeping and stabilization missions. Ourexpertise and resources — both military andcivilian — will remain engaged in a number of criticaltheatres  especially Afghanistan and Lebanon. Thatcommitment constitutes a heavy burden  but one wedeem a worthy investment for the sake of the commoninterest.In that light  helping Somalia to recover its integrityand dignity will remain high on my Government’sagenda.The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)have played a crucial role in changing developmentcooperation policies and practices. But since theywere first agreed upon  the development landscape haschanged deeply. New challenges have emerged andother issues and processes have come to the fore. Thepost-2015 development agenda will therefore have totake those trends into account. It will have to includesuch important dimensions of development as reducinginequality  fostering credible democracy  promotinghuman rights  good governance  equitable growth migration  employment  decent jobs and tacklingclimate change.We are very pleased with your decision Mr. President  to constitute a high-level panel todiscuss this fundamental issue  and to appoint threeimportant leaders to conduct the international debate.We are confident that the process of defining the pillarsof the future development agenda will be as inclusive aspossible  while avoiding the top-down assumptions thatemerged in 1995.In our view  the post-2015 MDGs will have to beharmonized with the inputs that emerged from theUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Developmentin Rio de Janeiro (Rio+20). The three dimensions of sustainable development — the social  economic andenvironmental — will be part of the scenarios we facein the future. We will also have to work within theframework of the new Busan Global Partnership forEffective Development Cooperation.In the area of climate change  sound and balancedmanagement of land and marine resources  involvingstrengthened trans-boundary cooperation  deservescloser political attention and common application. Somechallenges are particularly pressing. Tackling climatechange through coordinated emissions-reductionpolicies is a prerequisite to substantially reducing  andpossibly stopping  the serious degradation of planetEarth’s fragile ecosystems  on which our lives depend.In line with our joint strategic objectives to overcomethe financial crisis  we attach great importance toinnovative sources of financing for development. Italyhas helped promote a number of significant initiatives in particular in the health field.Migrant remittances play a key role in thedevelopment of many countries. That process will befacilitated by achieving the commitments of the Groupof Eight (G-8) and the Group of 20 to reduce the averageglobal cost of transferring remittances.Food security is a priority for the ItalianGovernment’s development assistance policy. In 2009 under Italy’s presidency  the G-8 adopted the L’AquilaFood Security Initiative  a new and inclusive mechanismthat has been joined by more than 40 countries and hasfunded several food security projects amounting to anestimated $22 billion.We are still paying careful attention to policiesaimed at mitigating the effect of agricultural pricevolatility. The availability of high-quality  healthy andsustainable food for all humankind is the historicaland concrete challenge being taken up by Expo 2015 inMilan. The theme “Feeding the planet” is crucial to theglobal agenda — from the Millennium DevelopmentGoals to Rio+20 and its Zero Hunger initiative  as wellas the G-8 and G-20 processes — and is particularlyrelevant to the work of the United Nations system. AllStates Members of the United Nations have been invited and so far almost 100 countries and internationalorganizations have confirmed their participation.In conclusion  I wish to respond to the appealyou launched in your opening address. Yes  Italywill make an active contribution to the efforts aimedat revitalizing the General Assembly by enhancing its role and efficiency. Today more than ever  theworld needs the authority of the United Nations. Thereform of the Security Council is a key element ofthis agenda. We are very much counting on members’assistance in making it happen. An effective SecurityCouncil is crucial not only to meeting the challengesto peace  but also to creating a better internationalorder. An equitable reform of the Council is a matterof continuing legitimacy  rather than of increasing thenational power of select Member States. The principlesof accountability  consensus and regional empowermentmust continue to inspire our commitment."
"84",3548,"JAM",67,2012,"﻿Allow me tocongratulate the President on his assumption of thepresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventhsession. I assure him of the full support and cooperationof the Jamaican delegation. I would also like to place onrecord my delegation’s appreciation to His ExcellencyMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his invaluableguidance of the work of the Assembly during its sixty-sixth session. I also thank the Secretary-General Mr. Ban Ki-moon  and the staff of the Secretariat fortheir dedication and hard work in serving MemberStates.There is a tale of a young woman from a ruralvillage in Jamaica who was approached by a politicalcandidate seeking to represent her community. “Whatis it you want most from your representatives?” thecandidate asked. The young woman considered thequestion for a moment. Slowly and thoughtfully shereplied  “All I want is an opportunity. I want you toprovide me and my family with a living environment inwhich I can work  contribute and prosper. Most of all  Iwant you to provide for my family an environment thatis safe and secure”.For hundreds of years  our respective peoples havelooked to their leaders with great expectations. Theyelected Governments that they felt could provide themwith the greatest sense of well-being and security. Historically and to the present day  they looked toheads of State and Government to provide them their families  their communities and ultimately theirrespective nations with leadership and direction thatfoster that all-important sense of well-being and offeeling secure. Over time  across the world  there hasbeen an increasing sense of impatience and agitationborn of a sense of growing global insecurity.Accordingly  the United Nations agenda hasexpanded its focus to address the multifacetedchallenges of food security  climate change  globalpandemics and the global economic and financialcrisis. We have already witnessed citizens from severalnations spring into action with demands for change.Others chose to occupy various spaces in protest. In thelight of that reality  many of those here — indeed  manyof us as leaders — stand as buffers between apathy andanarchy.The theme for this year’s session of the Assembly “Bringing about adjustment or settlement ofinternational disputes or situations by peaceful means” is most appropriate and timely  given current events ina number of countries and regions that pose a threat tointernational peace and security. It reflects the call bythat young woman  who simply asked her representativeto provide for her and hers an environment that is safeand secure. Yet her request is not as simple as it appears.The insecurity  impatience and unease that haveemerged worldwide are explosive accelerants. Theyemerge from the heartbreaking scourge of poverty thatwas so aptly described by the Jamaican national hero Marcus Mosiah Garvey  who reminded us that povertyis“a hellish state to be in. It is no virtue. It is a crime.To be poor is to be hungry without possible hopeof food; to be sick without hope of medicine; to betired and sleepy without a place to lay one’s head;to be naked without the hope of clothing; to bedespised and comfortless”.We must seek to rid ourselves of the conditions thatlead to poverty. We must pursue social and economicpolicies that will ensure social equity and justice forour people and increase their well-being and sense ofsecurity. That can be achieved only if we  as MemberStates  work together in good faith to secure thesustainable future we agreed to at Rio de Janeiro. Letus create the future we want  and let us put our peoplefirst. The global economy continues to be beset byuncertainty. That is compounded by the lingeringnegative effects of the financial and economic crises.The global shocks have affected all our peoples.They threaten our communities  weaken our familiesand challenge individuals everywhere  regardless ofhemisphere or region or whether they live in so-calleddeveloped or developing countries or in the north  south east or west. Some have fewer options than others. Thatis a vicious circle of insecurity.We must not forget that a significant proportionof the world’s poorest citizens live in middle-incomecountries. That diverse group includes both largedeveloping economies and small island developingStates  such as those in the Caribbean. Many of us facecommon challenges. Several are highly indebted andextremely vulnerable to external shocks and naturaldisasters. We face significant obstacles in our efforts tospur economic recovery and growth. We are hamperedby the volatility of energy and food prices  decreasesin export commodity prices  and weak capital inf lows.Increasing food prices create untold hardships for manyof our people  particularly the most vulnerable in oursocieties. Small countries need greater support in orderto build resilience to economic and environmentalshocks.I come to the Assembly today from such a nation.Jamaica is a nation small in size but enormous inspirit — a nation with a people whose speed defiesthe laws of physics  whose musical messages haveinspired positive and revolutionary global change andwhose minds have given the world myriad solutions inareas that include science  law and medicine. Yet manynations like Jamaica have great possibility and potentialthat are not reflected in  or ref lective of  their currenteconomic indicators.Reforms in global economic governance including of the international financial institutions are required in order to take into account the needof small and vulnerable economies for special anddifferential treatment. Refocusing financial f lows inthe development agenda will also go a long way inhelping to bolster our natural resilience and resolve.We commend the United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development on the work it has done over the last48 years to advance the trade and development agendaand assist developing countries. There is still much tobe done  and we look forward to working with the fullrange of development partners.Women and children make up one particularlyvulnerable group of our world. What we call externalshocks cause real and serious dislocation in their dailylives. Too many mothers have to face tough choices tomeet their basic needs. Too many children are subjectedto violence and abuse. Children  especially girls  arebeing used as pawns for economic gain  includingthrough human trafficking and other exploitive actions.Human trafficking is a dastardly threat to the welfareof our women  girls and boys. Our ancestors fought forour freedom. It is disgraceful that at this juncture ofworld history we should see the emergence of a formof modern-day slavery that allows women  girls andboys to be traded as chattel. Many vulnerable youngwomen are deceived and lured away by attractiveoffers to get them and their families out of poverty.They then find themselves in a strange land  with nosupport  no identity and no hope of returning home;sold into modern-day slavery  their very bodies used asa currency of exchange.Jamaica is resolute in its commitment tostrengthening local and national programmes toeliminate violence against women and children. At thesame time  I call on the international community to takebold action to address this scourge. Issues that affectwomen and children must be central to decision-makingprocesses. We look forward to continued collaborationwith UN-Women and the international community tohelp break this cycle of exploitation and insecurity.The devastating impact of HIV/AIDS andnon-communicable diseases also propels the cycleof global insecurity. Jamaica is cognizant of theconsiderable investment that the United Nations and theinternational community have made in the fight againstHIV/AIDS. That support has allowed developingcountries  including Jamaica  to make a difference inthe lives of those affected. Nevertheless  inadequatehuman and financial resources constrain our ability toscale up testing and treatment  as well as to implementprogrammes for increasing awareness and reducing therisk of new infections.The developing world and lower-income populationsare hardest hit by the impact of non-communicablediseases (NCDs). The high social and developmentalcosts of NCDs demand concerted policy action at thenational and international levels. We must implementthe outcomes of the High-level Meeting on NCDs heldlast year. We are on the threshold of 2015  the target datefor the achievement of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. The results thus far have been uneven. Weneed to reinvigorate Millennium Development Goal8  the Global Partnership for Development. I wishto underscore the situation associated with ourmiddle-income country status. Country categorizationsshould not serve as obstacles to delivering support tothe world’s poorest and most vulnerable. We urge thatmiddle-income countries not be pushed to the margins ofthe development agenda  nor be put on the fringe of thedevelopment assistance provided by the internationalcommunity. A review of the factors used by the relevantmultilateral agencies in measuring a country’s wealthis urgently needed. We are supportive of the proposalsput forward by the Economic Commission for LatinAmerica and the Caribbean for an alternative butcomplementary approach to the criterion of per capitaincome in the allocation of financing for development.I now turn to global political developments. Thecycle of insecurity transcends borders. Recent eventshave called attention to the fragility of peace andsecurity in many parts of the globe  and underscore theimportance of respect for the rule of law  democracyand good governance. Jamaica reiterates its adherenceto the principles of the United Nations Charter multilateralism and the inviolability of diplomaticinstitutions in the conduct of relations among States.We will continue to add our voice to the ongoing workat the United Nations to secure human rights  justice social equity and the peaceful settlement of disputes.Transnational crime  narco-trafficking and theillicit trade in small arms and ammunition are majorcomponents of the cycle of insecurity. They continueto endanger lives  undermine the rule of law andfuel violent crime. We remain resolute in our call forencouraging partnerships in fighting this scourge  andwill continue to work with all delegations to achieve acomprehensive and robust arms trade treaty.The conflict in Syria poses a real threat tointernational peace and security. We are deeplyconcerned at the escalating internal violence and theresulting loss of life. It is our conviction that thisconflict can still be resolved through political anddiplomatic means.We continue to urge the leaders of Israel and thePalestinian Authority to resume negotiations as early aspossible  based on the two-State solution and relevant United Nations resolutions. Those resolutions addressIsrael’s right to exist within secure borders  as wellas the aspirations of the Palestinian people to self-determination and statehood.We must ensure that the United Nations remainsrelevant to its membership through a process ofreform of its organs  including the Security Council.Negotiations should proceed urgently towards asatisfactory conclusion.More than two years after the devastatingearthquake  Haiti’s plight remains deeply troubling.We are concerned that only a disappointing fractionof the pledges made have been disbursed  and yet thehumanitarian situation in Haiti is perilous. As a closefriend and neighbour of Haiti  with strong historical ties I encourage members of the international community tomake good on their commitments. The Haitian peopleneed our continued support.The long-standing trade and economic embargoagainst Cuba  another close neighbour and friend ofJamaica  has had severe negative effects on its growthand development. Jamaica reiterates its call for an endto the embargo against Cuba and the extraterritorialmeasures aimed at extending its reach to include thirdcountries.Jamaica continues to work with our partners toerect a memorial at the United Nations to honour thevictims of slavery and the trans-Atlantic slave trade.We are grateful for the generous contributions receivedto date to erect the permanent memorial  and reiteratethe call for continued financial support.Fifty years ago  upon gaining our independence Jamaica committed itself to the aims of the UnitedNations and fully accepted the responsibilities ofmembership. Our national pledge commits each andevery Jamaican to stand up for justice  brotherhoodand peace and to play our part in advancing the welfareof the whole human race. We will not resile from thatcommitment.Let us work together to end the cycle of globalinsecurity. Let us provide an opportunity for every man woman and child to fulfil their God-given potential. Ileave members with the words of Robert Nesta “Bob”Marley  who sang: “One love  one heart”. I hope that thepeoples of the world will one day live together in peace love  security  unity and prosperity."
"85",3594,"JOR",67,2012,"﻿It is an honour to join thiseminent gathering. Allow me to extend Jordan’s sincerecongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić. Iwould like to assure him of Jordan’s full cooperation.May I also express to the Secretary-General Jordan’sappreciation for his untiring efforts. I welcome his voiceand the voices of world leaders of many religions whostand with billions of Muslims worldwide in rejectingprovocations meant to divide those of different faiths.Islam teaches us to honour all human beings promote tolerance and show mercy. As a Hashemite anda descendant of the Prophet Muhammad — peace andblessings upon him — I condemn all acts that vilify thename of the Prophet or falsely use his name or the nameof Islam — or any other religion  for that matter — tojustify violence and evil acts such as we have recently witnessed. There are no sidelines on this issue. Allof us of every faith everywhere must be proactive inpromoting understanding and a much stronger globaldialogue.“To unite our strength” — these four words in theUnited Nations Charter are not just an old dream  theyare a modern urgency. The United Nations and theGeneral Assembly — empowered and strong — areneeded today as never before.In my region  we have important tasks ahead.We must provide new and better opportunities forour people  especially our youth  to avert the dangersof regional instability and conflict and to fulfil theuniversal desire — the basic human right — to live infreedom  dignity  justice and peace. The internationalcommunity has a crucial interest in supporting countriesthat are taking risks for peace and reform.In Jordan we have charted our course guided by ourheritage  by our mutual respect and by moderation. OurArab Spring journey is one of opportunity to acceleratehome-grown reforms and achieve national goals. Lastyear I stood before the Assembly and spoke about thereforms that were on the horizon (see A/66/PV.11).Since then  new and comprehensive constitutionalamendments  as well as new laws  have created amatrix of institutions and principles to support our pathof reform and democratization. And with the new year we will have our new Parliament  and our JordanianSummer will begin.I would like to address the tragic situation in Syria.Violence must end immediately  and a transitionmust begin now. There is no alternative to a politicalsolution that will end the bloodshed  restore securityand stability and preserve the territorial integrity ofSyria and the dignity and unity of its people.The United Nations has an important part to playin helping people commit to a political solution. Jordanwill do all in its power to support the newly appointedJoint Special Representative of the United Nationsand the League of Arab States for Syria  Mr. LakhdarBrahimi.The peoples of Jordan and Syria have long anddeep ties. Since the current crisis erupted  over 200 000Syrians have sought refuge in Jordan  putting heavypressure on our limited resources and our economy.Yet we  as Jordanians  have opened our arms  as wehave many times in the past for others in need. As we continue to shoulder that responsibility  internationalsupport is essential. We are very grateful for thegenerous response of Governments  internationalbodies and dedicated United Nations agencies. Thesomber reality is  however  that more will be needed  asthe camps grow more crowded with vulnerable familiesand the cold desert winter approaches. I call upon thecountries of the United Nations to work together toprevent a humanitarian disaster.While we deal with those challenges  we must neverlose our focus on the crisis at the heart of the region. Foralmost 65 years  the Palestinian people have been theexception to the United Nations promise. We pledge theshelter of international law and human rights  exceptnot yet; the dignity of living in freedom and security except not yet; the right to self-determination  exceptnot yet. It is time to say  “Enough!”As the Arab Spring demanded dignity for all  so itdemanded the end of exceptionalism. No single issuecauses greater anger than to tell an entire people thatwhen it comes to global justice they do not count.The Arab Summer cannot bear its full fruit until thePalestinian-Israeli conflict ends  and ends with a justpeace and a Palestinian State living side by side with asecure Israel at peace with the entire region.Earlier this year  in Amman  we succeeded ingetting both sides back to the table for exploratory talks.Then positive traction stopped again. Illegal settlementbuildingand unilateral actions have continued constituting direct threats to a negotiated peace. Weare extremely concerned by threats to Jerusalem andthe sanctity of its Muslim and Christian holy sites. TheAl-Aqsa Mosque compound of Al-Haram Al-Sharifin East Jerusalem is under Hashemite custodianship a special role recognized by the 1994 Jordan-IsraelTreaty of Peace and protected as occupied territory byinternational law. It is Islam’s third holiest site and itsimportance to 1.7 billion Muslims  one quarter of theworld’s population  is similar to the importance of theKa’ba itself.Let me be absolutely clear  any invasion or divisionof the site of Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa would be viewed notonly as a breach of Israel’s obligations but as a profoundreligious transgression. The international communitymust send a clear message that such a transgression or any attempt to erase the Arab  Muslim or Christianidentity of Jerusalem  will not be tolerated. What isneeded now is the full weight of our nations  united. Neither the parties nor the world can afford continuedhostility and insecurity. There may be a rare windowof opportunity later this year  after the United Stateselections  to achieve what both sides so urgently need namely  two States at peace  Palestine and Israel  bothsecure  both free to look forward on the basis of a just comprehensive and final settlement. That has alwaysbeen and will remain a foremost priority for Jordan.Let me say now  as I have said before  that theArab world seeks peace. We mean by that real peace:diplomatic relations  economic relations  trade andinvestment. We mean by that a new normality  inpeace  where people are safe in their homes  wherecommunities are able to build and where cooperationhelps the entire region prosper. All this has been onoffer for over 10 years  since 2002  under the ArabPeace Initiative  through which 57 Arab and Muslimcountries reached out collectively to Israel. It is time forIsrael to turn around  look to the future we must shareand make a just and lasting peace with the Palestinians.Almost 70 years ago  countries from every continentchose to come together in hopes of a world united inpeace and respectful of all humankind. After a bitter destructive global war  the United Nations was the rightstep  the brave step. Today  almost three generationslater  we have learned that it is not enough to make theright choices. We must also pursue effective action. Notonly as nations but as nations united  we must take theright steps  the brave steps  now."
"86",3641,"JPN",67,2012,"﻿First  I would liketo express my sincere appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Al-Nasser for his dedication during his one-yeartenure as President of the General Assembly  as wellas to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić onhis assumption of the presidency of the Assembly atits sixty-seventh session. I would also like to pay mydeep respect to His Excellency Secretary-General BanKi-moon for his leadership.One year ago  I started my speech on this rostrum byconveying our outpouring of appreciation to the world(see A/66/PV.19). It has been a year and a half since theGreat East Japan Earthquake in March 2011. The peoplein the affected areas are making strenuous efforts  withan unyielding spirit  to revive their hometowns. In orderto respond to generous support from all over the world we  the Japanese  vowed before the souls of the victimsto hand the lessons learned from the disaster down tosucceeding generations beyond our national borders.Japan will continue to share those lessons learnedwith the world in order to build societies resilient tonatural disasters and to make concrete contributions tonuclear safety. The Fukushima Ministerial Conferenceon Nuclear Safety  which is scheduled for the end of thisyear  and is co-sponsored by the International AtomicEnergy Agency and the third World Conference onDisaster Reduction  which Japan plans to host in threeyears  will also provide meaningful opportunities toshare those lessons.The warning from nature brought on by theunprecedented earthquake and massive tsunami posed amore fundamental question as to how we should sustainour civilization. From the moment of birth  humanbeings transform their own wisdom into the power tosurvive harsh natural environments. Despite advancedscience and technology in modern civilization  however the forces of nature have reminded us how weak humanbeings still are and that they have a fragile existence.Threats that may endanger human existence lienot only in nature  but in advanced civilization itself.There are a number of examples of those threats such as environmental degradation  terrorism and theproliferation of nuclear weapons. What is required forthe human species to be able to keep its presence onEarth and continue to enjoy peace and prosperity? Theanswer is clear: humans must become wiser.Humans have so far gained abundant knowledge.The revolution in information and communicationtechnology unfolding in front of us is further buildingup human knowledge on a geometric scale and at an exponential speed. Human wisdom seems to haveimproved dramatically. However  is that really true? Atthe forefront of a long human history  we are living ina period of complicated and violent change. Tensionsamong nations have risen in many parts of the world with more uncertain prospects for the future. The realtest for our survival in this unprecedented period is nothow much knowledge and information we have  but tolearn the true value of the numerous pearls of wisdomwe have accumulated.One of the first such pearls of wisdom humansgained was the power to give adequate thought to notonly the present  but also the future. It is also the powerto imagine  beyond our own benefits  the benefits tofuture generations and the power to act on their behalf.Agricultural society  which prompted human beings toadopt a new vista  was made possible through the long-term perspective towards the future that human beingsacquired when they waited for the harvest instead ofthinking solely about immediate concerns.Now is the time for us to exert our wisdom andbuild a sustainable future for the sake of succeedinggenerations. Many countries have built up massivefiscal deficits  therefore fiscal soundness is nowa common challenge. If people living now do notovercome deficits by cutting spending and striving toincrease revenues  future generations will be forced torepay the deficits.That structure amounts to nothing but currentgenerations exploiting future generations.Democracy has been historically proven to bethe best political system. However  we now facethe enormous challenge of learning whether or notdemocracy can maintain fairness between generationsacross the globe. Under the system of parliamentarydemocracy  today’s representatives serve people livingnow; there are no guarantees with respect to properlyrepresenting the interests of future generations. Thecurrent structure encourages politics that will burdensilent future generations by passing today’s problemsonto them.We are all responsible for the next generations.This generation must successfully meet the challengesbefore us  and today’s political leaders must takeresponsibility now for tomorrow.In order to protect sound democratic societies now is the time to exert the power to think about thebenefits for future generations. Over the past 20-odd years  Japan repeatedly procrastinated in policies andwas considered a symbol of a country that delayeddecisions. I pledged to change all that and staked mypolitical life on implementing a comprehensive reformof our social security and taxation systems.That reform is an ambitious package of policiesdeveloped to support Japan’s social security systemby maintaining a stable financial basis in the faceof a rapidly aging population and by paving the wayfor fiscal rehabilitation. It is a comprehensive reformprogramme that pursues both economic growth andfiscal reconstruction. Japan is taking a firm steptowards becoming a country that makes decisionswithout postponing difficult issues.Another pearl of wisdom that humans acquiredcame from the possibility of seeing the Earth we live on.I recently had the opportunity to communicate directlywith astronaut Akihiko Hoshide from my office whilehe was orbiting the Earth in the International SpaceStation. At the time of our phone linkup  a femaleelementary school student who was in the office withus posed a riddle to the astronaut: “The Earth has airand gravity  but space does not ” she said. “What doesspace have that the Earth does not?” “The view ofthe Earth from outside it”  the astronaut replied. Thatconversation expressed in simple terms what I want tosay today.Because we have attained the perspective of beingable to see the Earth from outside  humankind as awhole shares the sublime mission of protecting theglobal environment. We must always return to thatperspective  reaching beyond borders and advancingconcrete measures to protect the Earth’s environment which is the a basis of human survival.With the aim of protecting the global environment a significant outcome for sustainable developmentwas achieved at the United Nations Conference onSustainable Development (Rio+20) in June 2012. Japanannounced its green future initiatives  proposing thatwe explore sustainable growth in prosperity withoutthe supply-demand crunch of natural resources andenergy or damage to the global environment. Japanwill implement a low carbon and sound material-cyclesociety and take the lead in solving the common energychallenges facing the world. To that end  we need moreinnovation in energy efficiency and renewable energy.In the light of the accident at Tokyo Electric PowerCompany’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station on11 March 2011  and with the goal of achieving a society not dependent on nuclear power by the 2030s  theGovernment of Japan will mobilize all possible policyresources to show the world a model that supports agood balance between the shift towards green energyand economic growth. We will constantly review andre-examine our policies while carefully assessing theoutlook for the future  including the internationalenergy situation.Being ever more conscious of our one preciousEarth  we must direct our caring attention to thepreciousness of each life breathing on the planet. TheJapan-led resolution on human security (resolution66/290)  adopted on 10 September  can be a solid guideto visualizing development for the next generation fromthe perspective of all people  including women andyoung people. In the light of the common understandingof human security stipulated in that resolution  Japanis determined to contribute to worldwide efforts toachieve the Millennium Development Goals and towork towards the establishment of the next developmentframework.The ideal of human security needs particularemphasis with respect to the African continent  whichsteadily reveals greater development potential butstill suffers from many challenges  such as poverty natural disasters and conflicts. On the occasion ofthe fifth Tokyo International Conference on AfricanDevelopment  to be held in Yokohama next June Japan plans to discuss the measures the internationalcommunity and Africa should adopt and implement.We must completely and successfully meet thechallenges that place our precious lives in danger.Afghanistan is making significant effortstowards reconstruction after its prolonged experienceof war. South Sudan is also moving forward in itsnation-building efforts  and Myanmar has taken steadysteps towards democracy and reconciliation. Japan willdo its utmost to support and promote peacekeeping peacebuilding and human security in each of thoseregions.A third pearl of wisdom that humans obtainedwas the manner in which human beings settle disputesreasonably under rules. Human beings acquiredlanguage and nurtured wisdom  but  even in moderntimes  they have failed to resist the temptation to solveconflicts by force. Despite two world wars and the twocalamities of atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshimaand Nagasaki  disarmament  the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the prevention ofterrorism remain key contemporary issues. The nuclearand missile issues in the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea and Iran currently pose serious threatsto the entire world. It is essential that all countriescoordinate at the United Nations and the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency  including the implementationof Security Council resolutions urging both theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran totake concrete action. Japan  the only country that hasexperienced the horror of nuclear devastation in war will continue to carry out its mission of seeking a worldfree of nuclear weapons.The issue of the abductions by the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea represents a violation ofbasic human rights. That makes it a universal issue anda matter of grave concern to the entire internationalcommunity. Japan is committed to continuing its utmostefforts to achieve the return of all victims at the earliestpossible date  through strengthened coordination withother Member States. Japan intends to maintain itsefforts to comprehensively resolve outstanding issuesof concern  settle the unfortunate past and normalizerelations in accordance with the Japan-DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea Pyongyang Declaration.Japan continues to urge the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea to take positive steps.Humans have done more than just act on their lustfor the use of force. We have also developed the skillto solve conflicts calmly through reason  which wecall the rule of law. Every State has a responsibilityto safeguard peace  ensure the safety of its peopleand protect its territorial and maritime sovereignty.Japan will fulfil those responsibilities in accordancewith international law. Meanwhile  as globalizationproceeds  the challenges confronting the internationalcommunity are growing increasingly complex  andrelations between nations can easily become tense.At this critical juncture  we must establish the rule oflaw as a basis for global peace  stability and prosperity.Because the rule of law is essential to preventing andresolving conflicts in a peaceful manner  and becauseit plays a critical role in the maintenance of stable andpredictable societies  it must be further enhanced. Anyattempt to impose a country’s ideology or claim byunilateral use of force or by threat of the use of force isinconsistent with the fundamental spirit of the UnitedNations Charter and runs counter to human wisdom; itis thus absolutely unacceptable. It is important to try to further develop international law and ensure thatit gets implemented more effectively. I strongly callfor leaders to strengthen the rule of law so as to leavefuture generations with a more peaceful and stableinternational community.We are currently witnessing the settlement ofconflicts between nations on the basis of internationallaw. A typical example is the dispute settlement processof the World Trade Organization  a mechanism that hasmade it possible for States to solve trade disputes withthe common language of law  not by force  in a panel orappellate body.Japan has always valued the rule of law and hascontributed to strengthening it. Since joining theInternational Court of Justice  Japan has consistentlyrecognized the jurisdiction of the Court as compulsoryand has taken the lead in practicing the rule of law.Japan is leading the world in its contributionsof personnel and financing to international judicialinstitutions. In addition to having served at theInternational Court of Justice  Japanese judges havealso served at the International Tribunal for the Law ofthe Sea  the International Criminal Court (ICC) and theExtraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia.Furthermore  Japan has provided the largest financialsupport of any country for the latter three institutions.Japan requests each country to kindly offer financialsupport to the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courtsof Cambodia  which is facing a severe financial crisisat the moment.Supporting the United Nations in promoting the ruleof law continues to be a great challenge. Once again  Icall for nations to work in cooperation with the UnitedNations to recognize the compulsory jurisdiction ofthe International Court of Justice  as Japan did  andfor non-member countries of the ICC and the UnitedNations Convention on the Law of the Sea to join at anearly date.There are still a number of territorial and maritimedisputes in many parts of the world. It is the philosophyof the Charter of the United Nations and a principleshared by the international community as a wholethat disputes should be settled in a peaceful manneron the basis of international law. In all circumstances Japan is determined to comply with that principle andseek peaceful solutions based on international law.The world should pay greater attention to the role the international judicial institutions play in the peacefulsettlement of disputes.Although the Middle East and Africa are still ina tumultuous whirlwind  they are in fact moving inthe direction of establishing democracy. Japan willcontinue to support efforts at democratization andreform of every country. Moreover  we cannot overlookthe ongoing violence and suppression in Syria  or theserious violations of human rights with respect tothe rule of law. Japan strongly condemns the massiveattacks in Syria that have involved tens of thousandsof innocent citizens  journalists and aid workers including Ms. Mika Yamamoto  a Japanese journalist.Japan intends to put more pressure on the Governmentof Syria  together with the international community and to extend humanitarian assistance to the people ofSyria.Let me emphasize that the international communitymust secure the protection of civilians and the safety ofdiplomats and workers of international organizationsthrough the rule of law. Today  violence against thatprinciple cannot be tolerated for any reason.The concept of the rule of law is the foundation fora stable and reliable society  making the movement ofpeoples and goods more vibrant and serving as a basisof prosperity. I believe that the rule of law can provideimportant infrastructure for order and prosperity for anetwork of States centred in the Asia-Pacific region.Japan will vigorously contribute to rule-making effortsto expand trade and investment  build maritime order including the safety of navigation  and create stabilityfor prosperity.The rules needed by the international communityare not simply for solving individual problems. Orderlyrelations between nations or within internationalorganizations require the rule of law  more specifically enhanced global governance. Unless all nations fulfiltheir responsibilities in their respective capacities  wecannot overcome the various common challenges thatthe world is facing. I hope in particular that emergingcountries will fulfil their responsibilities commensuratewith their respective national powers.As part of such efforts  it is important that weengage in thorough discussions on how the UnitedNations should develop in the future. We stronglysupport management reform at the United Nations.Furthermore  in order for the Security Council to befully effective  it must be endowed with a legitimacy that reflects the realities of the world today. Japanis ready to take on greater responsibility in theinternational community. Now is the time to acceleratethe stalled process on Security Council reform and tostart genuine negotiations.So far I have mentioned three pearls of wisdomnecessary for human beings to live sustainable livesin the future  and I have tried to convey Japan’scontribution in each. It is my belief that human beingswill continue to adapt to a complex world and becomewiser. I believe they will give adequate considerationto future generations and solve disputes calmly throughreason based on rules generated from the perspective oflooking at the Earth from the outside.Let us take charge of our responsibilities fortomorrow together. The lofty task for us living now isto carry out politics while imagining the benefits forfuture generations and gather all our wisdom to set acourse towards the survival of human beings.I should like to conclude my remarks by pledgingto the entire General Assembly that Japan will stand atthe forefront of shaping the future of human history forpeaceful and aff luent societies."
"87",3666,"KAZ",67,2012,"﻿On behalf of theRepublic of Kazakhstan  I would like to congratulateyou  Mr. Jeremić  on your election to the presidencyof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session  aswell as to wish you every success. I also wish to express our appreciation to Ambassador Nassir AbdulazizAl-Nasser  President of the General Assembly at itssixty-sixth session  for his skillful steering of theAssembly’s proceedings.In recent years  the world has lived throughmajor political  social  economic and environmentalupheavals. The geopolitical turmoil in the MiddleEast  as well as natural and man-made disasters  serveas compelling evidence indicating that the issues ofsecurity  stability and sustainable development arebecoming increasingly relevant.We believe that world politics should be based onnew global principles. In the twenty-first century  thoseprinciples encompass constructive multipolarity andtransparency  trust and political tolerance  and the clearpre-eminence of evolutionary forms of developmentof the world. They should be enshrined in the coredocuments of the United Nations and in the entireinternational law system. In that context  we believethat it is fundamentally important to ensure strictadherence to the principle of non-interference in theinternal affairs of Member States.The threat of the proliferation of nuclear weaponsand technology  along with the spectre of theiracquisition and use by terrorist entities  has been oneof the most daunting challenges to humankind. It isour strongly held view that the possession of weaponsof mass destruction is not a guarantee of security orgreater independence. Kazakhstan’s own record showsthat countries reap huge benefits from the renunciationof nuclear weapons. By voluntarily giving up the world’sfourth-largest nuclear arsenal and shutting down thelargest test site in Semipalatinsk  on 29 August 1991 we have won more friends and have become a moreprosperous  stable and inf luential country.Kazakhstan fully supports the proposal bythe Secretary-General to adopt a nuclear weaponsconvention. Sharing its declared goals  His ExcellencyMr. Nursultan A. Nazarbayev  President of the Republicof Kazakhstan  suggested that  as an important stepin that direction  the United Nations should adopt auniversal declaration of a nuclear-weapon-free world.That would  undoubtedly  facilitate our advancementtowards a nuclear-weapon-free world and an earlyadoption of a nuclear weapons convention. Kazakhstanwelcomes the establishment of a constructive dialoguewith the five nuclear Powers with a view towards signinga protocol on negative security assurances to the State parties to the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone inCentral Asia.We also call for an early establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. In that regard  welook forward to the upcoming conference in Helsinkiand its positive outcomes.Kazakhstan is working on the practicalimplementation of a project to host an internationalbank of low-enriched uranium  under the auspices ofthe International Atomic Energy Agency  which wouldallow  if need be  to ensure an uninterrupted supply ofnuclear fuel. It should be made clear that the bank will inno way infringe upon the inalienable right of each Stateparty to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes including the development of nuclear technology.This year  we will complete the project to enhancephysical security of the former Semipalatinsk test site.We view this project  which is being implemented jointlywith the United States and Russia  as our significantcontribution to the global non-proliferation regime.Kazakhstan is actively involved in the fightagainst international terrorism and drug trafficking within the framework of the Collective SecurityTreaty Organization  the Shanghai CooperationOrganization and the Conference on Interaction andConfidence-building Measures in Asia (CICA). AsChair of the Collective Security Treaty Organization Kazakhstan consistently works to strengthen regionalcooperation in this area. Special attention has been paidto the expansion of practical cooperation between theUnited Nations and regional arrangements  including in particular  the Kazakhstan-based Central AsianRegional Information and Coordination Centre for thefight against the threat of drug trafficking  which isdesigned to enhance multilateral cooperation to counterthe f low of drugs from Afghanistan.Given the increasing attention by the internationalcommunity to the issue of international informationsecurity  we believe that the time has come to considerthe introduction of new concepts into international law such as electronic borders and electronic sovereignty as well as the establishment of a cyberpolice unit.As the current Chair of the Council of ForeignMinisters of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation Kazakhstan will continue to fully support the processthat aims to bring stability and peace back to the regionof the Middle East and North Africa.Before I turn to regional issues  let me express ourstrong condemnation of the Internet video and cartoonsthat provocatively offend the religious feelings ofMuslims. Such disgusting incitements must bestopped  because they lead to an escalation of violenceby fomenting hatred between the representatives ofreligions  and they undermine inter-civilizationaldialogue and confidence-building. The right to freedomof expression must be exercised with due responsibility.We were shocked by the tragic killing of UnitedStates diplomats in Benghazi. We condemn attackson diplomats and diplomatic missions and call uponGovernments to adhere to their international obligationsto protect diplomatic representatives in their countries.We should support all efforts to find a peacefulsolution to the conflict in Syria and assist in preventinga humanitarian disaster. We should also take measuresto prevent any spillover of the crisis to the rest of theregion. To that end  both the Syrian Government andthe opposition should resort to diplomacy  not arms and put an immediate end to the violence.The principles of sovereignty and non-interferencein internal affairs must be respected. It is the Syriansthemselves who should determine the future of theircountry. We call on all nations to unite around theSyrian transition process  which should be based ondialogue and compromise  and support the activities ofthe Joint Special Representative of the United Nationsand the League of Arab States for Syria  Mr. LakhdarBrahimi.Kazakhstan calls for the creation of conditionsto settle the Palestinian issue  including through thecontinuation of direct Palestinian-Israeli talks. Allobstacles to the negotiation process should be removed.Kazakhstan has been and continues to be a supporter ofthe legitimate rights of Palestine to establish a sovereignand independent State  within the 1967 borders  and itsentry into the United Nations as a full member.We have consistently advocated a peaceful exclusively diplomatic  resolution of the situationaround the Iranian nuclear programme and look forwardto the continuation of constructive dialogue betweenIran and all interested parties with a view to developingmutually acceptable solutions.The reconstruction of Afghanistan is an importantobjective of the international community that meets theaspirations of the Afghans themselves. We believe that  if our cooperation on Afghanistan is to be successful its economic dimension should be a priority. Efforts tostabilize the situation should be bolstered by reformsaimed at sustainable development and the improvementof socioeconomic indicators in the country  its level ofeducation and other human standards.Kazakhstan is also actively involved in multilateralcooperation to assist Afghanistan  as demonstratedby its readiness to host  in 2013 in Astana  the nextconference of the Istanbul process.Almaty  the southern megalopolis of Kazakhstan has the necessary facilities to accommodate the officesof international organizations. Sixteen organizationsof the United Nations family have already set up theiroffices in the city. Most of them enjoy a regional status.We promote further expansion of the presence of UnitedNations organizations  including its humanitarianagencies  and offer to establish a United Nationscentre in Almaty  in order to effectively coordinateinternational efforts and implement regional projectsof the United Nations  including those dealing withassistance to Afghanistan.This year  we mark the twentieth anniversary of theinitiative to convene the Conference on Interaction andConfidence-building Measures in Asia  announced byPresident Nursultan Nazarbayev at the forty-seventhsession of the General Assembly  on 5 October 1992 (seeA/47/PV.24). The anniversary session and the fourthmeeting of CICA Foreign Ministers  held in Astanaon 12 September  have become important milestonesin the evolution of that Asian forum. Currently  theConference brings together 24 countries that occupyover 90 per cent of the territory of Asia  where half ofthe world’s population now resides. As a platform fordialogue  CICA has an important role to play in effortsto ensure peace  security and stability in Asia.Kazakhstan urges that close attention be paid to theexpansion of the trade  investment and transit transportcapacity of least developed countries  landlockeddeveloping countries (LLDCs) and small islanddeveloping States. To advance the interests of thesegroups of countries  Kazakhstan  together with theUnited Nations  organized  from 12 to 14 September inAlmaty  the fourth meeting of LLDC Trade Ministersand the high-level global thematic meeting oninternational trade  trade facilitation and aid for trade.Today  the whole world is facing new challenges toglobal energy security. Central Asia has great potentialto become a global energy centre. The developmentof energy resources is a priority for the Republic ofKazakhstan. In our vision  the future of the region liesin the development of the oil and gas pipeline system todeliver our hydrocarbon resources to Europe and Asia.As a follow-up to the United Nations Conferenceon Sustainable Development and to draw the attentionof the international public to the issues of renewablesources of energy  Kazakhstan has decided to seekthe nomination of its capital  Astana  as the host ofthe international exhibition Expo 2017 on the subjectof “Energy for the Future”. We count on fellowMember States to support our bid. As one of the pilotcountries selected from among States Members of theUnited Nations  Kazakhstan will actively promote thedevelopment of draft sustainable development goals forthe period beyond 2015.Kazakhstan is not only in a position to ensure itsown food security; it is also willing to contribute toglobal food security.Intercultural dialogue is an important prerequisitefor peace and security. To promote such dialogue Kazakhstan put forward an initiative to proclaim anInternational Decade for the Rapprochement of Cultures2013-2022  which was adopted at the conclusion of thethirty-sixth session of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization GeneralConference  in November 2011.Kazakhstan attaches special importance to theprotection of human rights and has announced itsbid for membership in the Human Rights Councilfor the period 2012-2015. If elected  Kazakhstan willparticipate  with a full sense of responsibility  in theproceedings of that important human rights body  onthe basis of an open  impartial  non-politicized andmutually respectful dialogue between the MemberStates of the United Nations.Last March  the Republic of Kazakhstan celebratedthe twentieth anniversary of its membership in theUnited Nations. All these years  we have consistentlystood for an inclusive  transparent and effectiveOrganization. We strongly believe that it is only byuniting our efforts that we can make real progress inaddressing the global issues and challenges facinghumanity. We therefore call for joint efforts to seeksolutions to common problems for the benefit of futuregenerations and our common planet Earth."
"88",3713,"KEN",67,2012,"﻿It is an honour and a pleasurefor me to once again address the General Assembly.Kenya is at a time in its history that is full of hopefor a bright future. Over the past 10 years  our countryhas enjoyed a sustained blossoming of democracy.In the year 2010  Kenya adopted a new Constitution.With that constitution  we further secured the humanrights and civil liberties of our citizens and entrenchedconstitutional governance and justice.Equally important  over the past 10 years  we havescored significant victories against diseases includingHIV and AIDS  malaria  tuberculosis and otherchildhood and adult maladies. Hundreds of thousandsmore children have found their way into school andmany more adults have found new life skills throughtraining and capacity-building. We have also pulledhundreds of thousands of Kenyans out of poverty andput them on the pathway to economic independenceand self-reliance. In doing so  we have also expandedour economic base  opening up new and extensiveinfrastructure  energy and information technologyprojects.The achievements in our country have beenattained through respect for the rule of law  soundpolicies  improved governance and open and innovativedemocracy. However  as all Kenyans recognize we still have a lot more work to do. Poverty  diseaseand unemployment still remain big challenges forus. Nevertheless  I am confident that we will seizeopportunities to innovate and invest  and thus keep ourcountry on the road to even greater prosperity.In accordance with this year’s theme  “Bringingabout adjustment or settlement of international disputesor situations by peaceful means”  Kenya’s achievementsover the past 10 years have been built on the bedrockof the peaceful resolution of disputes and situations inour country. In addition  it is our belief that inclusivesolutions to disputes can bring about lasting peace. Weknow from our own history and that of our neighboursthat when conflicts and disagreements are not resolvedpeacefully what follows are the tragic consequences ofsuffering  bloodshed and the collapse of economic andsocial development.That is why we are convinced that Kenya’s ownwell-being and prosperity are hinged on sustainedpeace  security  stability and inclusive democracy inour region. My country therefore remains supportiveof efforts spearheaded by the African Union  theIntergovernmental Authority on Development  theInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Regionand the East African Community for the peaceful andinclusive settlement of disputes and situations. Suchregional efforts are central to the future of multilateralpeacebuilding. They must be the building blocks ofinternational efforts to maintain peace and security inour region and the world.Kenya therefore welcomes the Secretary-General’sinitiative to convene a series of high-level meetingsduring this week to discuss the political and securitysituations in Somalia  the Democratic Republic of theCongo  the Sudan and South Sudan. With regard toSomalia  Kenya joined the African Union Mission inSomalia (AMISOM)  and through the combined effortsof AMISOM and Transitional Federal Governmentforces  we have witnessed the progressive liberation oflarge areas of Somalia from Al-Shabaab occupation.That development enabled the Transitional Governmentto focus on the implementation of the Kampala Accordroad map  with a view to forming a unified Governmentanchored on the pillars of good governance and the ruleof law. We are encouraged by recent developments in Somalia  in particular the election of a new President Prime Minister and Parliament and the adoption of anew Constitution.There are millions of Somalis who are forced to liveoutside Somalia. More than 650 000 are in one refugeecamp in Kenya. Following the liberation of largesections of south-central Somalia from Al-Shabaab we look forward to working with the relevant UnitedNations agencies and the international communityin facilitating the return of Somali refugees to thoseareas. That will enable the effective participation of allSomalis in rebuilding Somalia.With regard to the Republic of the Sudan and theRepublic of South Sudan  Kenya is appreciative ofthe positive developments of 4 August related to thelong-standing dispute over oil resources. We hope thatthat important agreement marks a first step towardsreducing tensions between the two sister countries.Kenya also appreciates the efforts of the internationalcommunity  both directly and through the AfricanUnion  and encourages the two sides to work towardsreaching a compromise. I especially commend theAfrican Union High-level Implementation Panelfor its determination and leadership in steering thenegotiations. We are confident that both countries willagree to urgently address contentious issues on borderdisputes. Kenya will continue to support efforts to finda peaceful and lasting solution to disputes between thepeople of the Sudan and South Sudan. We encouragethe international community to redouble its efforts tofast-track support for social and economic developmentin South Sudan for the benefit of citizens of the newcountry.Kenyans are saddened by the great suffering andbloodshed endured by populations around the world especially in the Middle East  the Horn of Africa andCentral Africa. It is our belief that nations shouldembrace dialogue and the peaceful settlement ofdisputes instead of rushing to arms  for suffering andbloodshed will ensue. We call upon all warring partiesin the world to lay down their arms and pursue thepath of peace  dialogue and the inclusive resolution ofdisputes.We also remain concerned that no progress hasbeen achieved on the issue of Palestine. As I said lastyear here in the General Assembly  Kenya believes inthe two-State solution  in which the territorial integrityof Palestine within the 1967 borders is upheld and the peace and security of Israel are both assured andguaranteed. In that regard  it is our hope that Palestinewill soon be welcomed into the community of nationswith full membership in the United Nations.There can be no lasting peace without sustainableand inclusive development. Kenya therefore greatlyappreciates the achievements of the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development held earlierthis year in Brazil. Kenya is encouraged that  in linewith recommendations proposed during the Conference the General Assembly has placed high on its agenda forthis session some of the decisions we took in Rio deJaneiro. That is indeed an indication of our collectivepolitical will to ensure that the decisions contained inthe outcome document are implemented.Key among those is the decision to strengthen theinstitutional framework for sustainable development including the upgrading of the United NationsEnvironment Programme (UNEP). Kenya appreciatesthat historic decision to strengthen and upgrade UNEP which will enable it to fulfil its mandate effectively.Kenya reiterates its commitment to continue to hostand facilitate the work of a revamped UNEP  and welook forward to its eventual transformation into a full-fledged organization for the global environment.Finally  we are all aware that many of our moderndisputes and conflicts revolve around concerns aboutwater  available land and agriculture  forests  riversand lakes. Dealing with our environment and theeffects of climate change is therefore an important partof resolving disputes and conflicts around the world.Strengthening global institutions that deal with theenvironment  biodiversity and climate change musttherefore be a core part of our strategy to avoid conflictand disputes among the peoples of the world.It is important that  as the community of nations we invest in the peaceful settlement of internationaldisputes. However  we must invest first in the preventionof disputes and  secondly  in addressing the root causesof conflicts  such as poverty  inequality  disregardfor international law and disrespect for each other’ssociocultural and religious beliefs  among others. Onlyby addressing the root causes of conflict and disputescan we hope to find lasting peace in a just and equitableworld."
"89",3737,"KGZ",67,2012,"﻿First of all  let me congratulate His Excellency Mr. VukJeremić on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session  I wish himevery success in carrying out his important functions.It is also a great pleasure to express my gratitude toHis Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser forhis successful  fruitful leadership of the work of theAssembly’s previous session.It would be difficult to say that the overall situationin the world has improved. We have not yet fullyrecovered from one of the most serious global economiccrises in the past 65 years. Yes  the overall economicsituation is gradually normalizing. Proof of that is theimproving forecasts for world economic growth by keyinternational organizations for this year. However  weshould point out that risks remain and that the recoveryprocess is still very uncertain.It is unfortunate that the world has not becomeany safer. We are seeing a rise in confrontations andtension in various parts of the world. Global climatechange  population growth against the background ofa deteriorating environment  the scarcity of naturalresources and of access to drinking water  and manyother problems are in the aggregate stoking tensionsand the potential for conflict in areas of cooperation onthe international arena.Traditional ways of life are changing fast under theimpact of globalization processes. States are findingit increasingly hard to tackle modern challenges bythemselves because of the transborder nature of thosechallenges. Terrorism  separatism  extremism  drugs information wars — these are a kind of tumour forhumankind and cannot be eradicated at the local levelalone.Sadly  there are forces at work in the world thatwish to drag humankind to the brink of the precipice to kindle the flames of hostility wherever they go.One glaring example is the video Innocence ofMuslims  which symbolically appeared on the eve ofthe General Assembly session. Kyrgyzstan condemnsthe provocative nature of its content. It is unacceptableto insult anyone’s religious sensibilities  regardless oftheir faith. Humanism  tolerance and mutual respectmake the world better and safer. Therefore  we alsoreject the use of force against diplomats — envoys ofpeace and a symbol of cooperation — of any country.Humankind is developing and changing fast.Regional  and even local  events can impact on globalprocesses. In 2011  we observed with sympathy andsolidarity the events in the Middle East and North Africa.The situation in Syria that we have seen this year canonly be a cause of serious concern for the internationalcommunity. All attempts to resolve the military conflictand restore stability to that county have  sadly  failed.With regard to the thousands of civilian victims  theKyrgyz Republic strongly advocates a speedy end to theviolence in that country  the opening of a broad nationaldialogue between the political forces and a continuationof political and socioeconomic reform and participationof all Syrian citizens.The Afghan factor continues to be a source ofthreat to international security. There are concerns thata full  swift drawdown of coalition forces could openthe way for destructive forces and the emergence ofvarious extremist and terrorist groups in neighbouringcountries. Every stakeholder in the world can makea contribution to the issue of security by revivingAfghanistan’s economy and developing trade  economic cultural and humanitarian ties with the country  as wellas its communication infrastructure.Since 2001 Kyrgyzstan has played its part in thatprocess  rendering assistance to the counter-terroristcoalition in Afghanistan through the cargo TransitCenter at Manas International Airport. It is clear thatthe counter-terrorist coalition  with the withdrawalof the military contingent from Afghanistan  mustbring its mission to a logical conclusion to create thefoundation of a national administrative system forthat country so that all branches of power can be fullyfunctional throughout the territory of Afghanistan.We must do our utmost for the economicrehabilitation of Afghanistan by engaging it in the development of regional cooperation and implementingjoint socioeconomic projects between internationalorganizations and financial institutions. In that regard Kyrgyzstan is ready to expand trade and economicties to export electricity to Afghanistan as part of theCASA-1000 project  with the support of donor countriesand the international financial institutions.The peaceful development of Afghanistan isimpossible without eradicating the systemic  ubiquitouscultivation of opium in that country. For many yearsAfghanistan has been the biggest producer and exporterof drugs. The growing penetration of that deadly crop isharming the countries of Central Asia. Not only are theyon the northern transit route towards the countries ofEurope and Asia  they are also progressively becomingconsumers.Drugs are the enemy of civilized humankind. Wherethere are drugs  there are international organized crimegroups and transborder challenges. Easy money earnedat the cost of people’s lives has no productive basis. Itbrings destruction and the degradation of human value.Drugs also spawn corruption and erode State systemsfrom the inside. Criminal proceeds are used to bribelaw enforcement bodies and the judiciary. They fundcorrupt politicians who seek power. The internationalcommunity must provide technical  economic andother support to Afghanistan’s neighbours  includingthe Central Asian countries  to build an effectiveshield to neutralize and localize drug trafficking fromAfghanistan.We believe that the mission of the United Nations as the single universal multilateral Organization  is tobe on the front line in tackling all modern challengesand issues.We should recognize that the global preventionarchitecture  the international and regional securitysystem of today  does not reflect the requirements ofour time. It is unfortunate that despite the search foruniversal methods for mediation and peaceful conflictresolution  the international community still has notresolved those issues.The need to reform the United Nations architectureand adapt it to the realities of the modern internationalsituation has not abated. A top priority is the reformof principal organs of the United Nations  namely  theSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council.We should point out that the tasks of those structures in the light of the current international situation  require serious transformation and integration offundamentally new approaches.In terms of the reform of the United Nations  wepropose the expansion of the membership of the SecurityCouncil to make it more representative  transparent anddemocratic. The reform should be based on principlesof universality  efficiency and broad geographicrepresentation  particularly for those countries thathave not yet had the chance to take part in its work asnon-permanent members.At the same time  we need to strengthen thecoordinating role of the Economic and Social Councilas a global governance mechanism on issues ofsustainable development  food security  humanitarianassistance  environmental cooperation and achievementof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the2015 deadline.The current global situation dictates the needto consolidate the efforts of all countries to developtangible action based on objective  fair ref lection oftheir interests and needs. On that basis  the KyrgyzRepublic has submitted its candidature for the Economicand Social Council for the period 2013-2015. If electedby Member States to that organ with such enormouspotential  the Kyrgyz Republic intends to play its partin tackling problems on the global agenda.The problems of sustainable developmentand global climate change have presented seriouschallenges in recent years  and the attention ofthe international community must not slacken. Insupporting the global discussions on a green economymodel that took place at the Rio+20 Conference onSustainable Development  Kyrgyzstan chose its futurepath towards long-term sustainable green developmentand an environment-minded economy. We would liketo confirm our commitment to developing our economythrough complying with requirements to protect ourenvironment and with a safe approach to nationalresources  which are a national asset.At Rio+20  the importance of development issuesconcerning mountainous areas was acknowledged withregard to managing global natural resources  as wasthe need for support for the sustainable developmentof mountain regions in developing countries. It shouldbe noted that despite the assistance of the internationalfinancial institutions  developing mountain Statescontinue to suffer difficulties. High levels of povertyand isolation  increasing transport costs and large foreign debts comprise the main problems facingmountain countries. In that situation  it will be difficultto achieve the MDGs and attain the status set out in theUnited Nations documents on sustainable development.In that respect  I wish to call attention to theimportance of the launching of international discussionson the question of exchanging Kyrgyzstan’s foreigndebt for sustainable development projects. We call onthe United Nations and its entities to render support onthat matter.By the will of God  we gained independence 21years ago. Previous leaders were unable to cope withthe task of building a truly independent Kyrgyzstan.They could not build an effective  transparent Statesystem for governing that would work for the benefit ofthe people. Most of the important issues were tackledbehind closed doors  without informing society. Forthe sake of personal enrichment and gain  some Statedecisions were even taken to the detriment of nationalinterests.The former Kyrgyz leaders declared a course fordemocracy that in fact did not take place. The formerregimes established a clan-like system of governancethat f louted the principles of a free society and usurpedpower. They not only attempted to hand power downto their children  but brought the people to their kneesmerely for the sake of their personal enrichment. Thefreedom-loving people of Kyrgyzstan therefore carriedout two revolutions  in 2005 and 2010  in response tothe unjust  tyrannical and authoritarian power.The latest choice has proved a difficult one for ourpeople  despite our commitment to democratic values which is almost hard-wired in the Kyrgyz people  partof their very heritage. Over 100 glorious sons of ourcountry laid down their lives for democracy during theApril revolution of 2010. Their memory lives on. Also 1 500 people were injured.Over the past two years  our country has begun toimplement new  democratic governance. The Kyrgyzpeople have chosen a parliamentary  presidential formof governance. We believe that was a just decision.According to impartial observers  our country hasmade significant progress during the past year in termsof building a democratic State.We began under difficult conditions. In the yearsof independence in Kyrgyzstan  industry virtuallyground to a halt. No new jobs were created. Labour migration grew. One third of the working populationwas forced to find employment abroad. We were leftwith ineffective public administration institutions low per-capita income  a reduced budget  rampantcorruption and organized crime  as well as unhampereddrug-trafficking from Afghanistan to the north  eastand west.Currently  we are waging an uncompromisingstruggle against the corruption that is wearing away theState system from within. Civil servants who are foundto be involved in corruption are being prosecuted underthe law. In modern Kyrgyzstan  there will be no casteof those whom the law does not touch.The battle against corruption is already seeingtangible results. Senior State officials underinvestigation have been arrested  including membersof Parliament  ministers  their deputies and others.Leaders of organized crime groups are either in prisonor on the run outside of the country.We are determined to extradite for prosecutionthose people for whom international warrants havebeen issued. In the name of fairness  the former leadersof Kyrgyzstan  who have taken shelter in neighbouringcountries along with their inner circle  must besanctioned in strict compliance with Kyrgyz legislation.Kyrgyzstan stresses that they are being prosecuted notfor politically motivated acts  but for specific crimespunishable by law. They gave the orders to open fire onpeaceful civilians and to destroy innocent people. Theypillaged their own people and the country’s budget andtook enormous financial assets out of the country. Theyhave used criminal gains to buy villas  land and othercostly material goods. In such issues  punishment mustbe just and inevitable so as to deter future leaders fromrepeating such actions.Therefore  we still hope that the Byelorussianauthorities  partners of ours in the Collective SecurityTreaty Organization and the Eurasian Economic Unionand who have assumed responsibilities under the Minskand Kishinev Conventions  will show their commitmentto their international legal obligations and extraditethe relatives and the retinue of the former President ofKyrgyzstan  Kurmanbek Bakiyev  who have been hidingin their territory and even have Byelorussian passports.The United Nations needs to establish clear standardsand procedures to ensure justice at the internationallevel  and especially for the return of illegally gainedassets.Kyrgyzstan is steadfastly building a parliamentarydemocracy  a direct authority that represents thepeople  their wishes and their needs. At present  thereare processes in place that are gradually bringing oursociety to a healthy state. Today  Parliament is engaged inpolitical processes. Gradually  polemics and argumentsare transitioning from street democracy to a civilizedform for resolving any significant controversial issueswithin the walls of Parliament. Under the nationalConstitution  the Kyrgyz Parliament is the highestrepresentative body  carrying out the functions oflegislative authority and control. The Government isfully accountable to the Parliament.A major test  and at the same time an indicator  is thefact that since the adoption of the new Constitution in2011  we have seen the peaceful launch of all institutionsof authority in accordance with the letter of the law. Themembers of Parliament have been elected. At the end of2011 we saw  for the first time in Kyrgyzstan’s history a peaceful transfer of power from the President to thenewly elected Head of State  Almazbek Atambayev. Afunctioning coalition Government is in place.We are reforming the judicial system  which mustbe equitable and fully independent. Despite strongopposition from certain quarters who are not interestedin seeing the successful conclusion of that issue we have  in the space of two years  launched a new transparent mechanism for the selection of judges. Inmid-September  the Parliament approved the 25 judgesof the Supreme Court. The selection of judges to theConstitutional Court and local courts is also under way.The establishment of an independent judiciaryis extremely important for us. It will allow us toachieve a just public administration in which everycitizen will be equal before the law. We are workingeffectively with the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights and other agencies onthe legal system and on improving legislation to ensureeveryone’s equality before the law.With the participation of the Parliament  thecountry has undertaken planning and reforms in allspheres of the State system — in the justice system law enforcement  taxation  oversight and others. All ofthat requires stronger legislation. Kyrgyzstan is takingits first steps in the new format of a parliamentaryrepublic. Sustainable development depends on the levelof governance  on the rule of law and on human rights.We believe in the bright future of our country and thatvery soon all our countrymen will be able to say withpride that they are the citizens of a strong  prosperousKyrgyzstan.One can more clearly see the sanctity of ourfatherland and our true values of independence from afar.I would like to appeal to my countrymen from thehighest podium in the world. Twenty years ago  Godgranted us the independence that our ancestors haddreamed of for centuries  for which they had shedtheir blood and sacrificed their lives. The freedom thatwas sent down to our people as a blessing should bestrengthened without division  by tireless effort andlabour united in harmony. Regardless of provocationby two-faced forces  we need to continue to strengthenthe path on which we set forth. Let us build a strong united beloved Kyrgyzstan. To reach a bright future weneed to continue to move forward. Life is a strugglebetween light and dark  good and bad. We need unity.We need work and welfare  not animosity and discord.May the Creator bless our nation as it moves towardsbright goals.Unfortunately  our country is still weak andeconomically dependent. We are not free in the choiceof our foreign sources of energy  but that problem isgradually being tackled with the assistance of ourstrategic partners. Kyrgyzstan needs the help of theinternational community to tackle the problem ofour foreign debt  which is hampering the process ofeconomic growth of the State and the implementationof fundamental reforms.We fully share what Secretary-General BanKi-moon said here in his opening statement at theAssembly’s sixty-seventh session  namely  thatdeveloping States need support (see A/67/PV.1). Webelieve that developing democracies in particular needsupport from countries of the democratic club andfrom economically developed States. To consolidateparliamentary democracy  Kyrgyzstan vitally needsthe support of our principal partners for the complexreforms undertaken in restructuring or in writing offof Kyrgyzstan’s State debt. I wish to stress that wehave a clear vision of how to conduct reforms and howto achieve development of the State. However  in thelight of the high deficit  we need significant additionalresources  which we will certainly return once we have achieved development and prosperity in the country inthe coming years.We are open to mutually beneficial  trustingpartnerships and cooperation with all States. Kyrgyzstanhas great economic potential. We are an open country willing to engage in mutual dialogue. We have greatindustrial and metallurgical potential. In Kyrgyzstanyou can find most of the elements on Mendeleev’s tableof elements.Critically important for many energy projects we have a highly qualified labour force and cheapelectricity. In the modern world  energy is the driver ofprogress. Kyrgyzstan has huge hydroelectric potential which we have begun to exploit. Every year we developaround 14 billion kilowatts per hour of electricity  whichis not enough to satisfy the hydro-energy demand ofKyrgyzstan  which is around 142.5 billion kilowatts perhour.On 20 September  Kyrgyzstan and Russia concludedan agreement that is vital for the entire Central Asianregion on building and operationalizing the Kambar-Ata and the Naryn Cascade power plants. Participationin building one of the biggest hydroelectric projectsin Central Asia will include our neighbours in theregion and allow Kyrgyzstan not only to increasethe development of cost-effective  environmentallyclean electricity but also to preserve the water in thefoothills that is currently supplying our neighboursduring the growing season. The benefit of the effectiveimplementation of such projects is clear. It will enhanceour hydroelectric export potential and protect drinkingwater for our neighbours. We invite all investors to takepart in building those projects.To conclude  I would like to note that theinternational community is undergoing a difficultperiod. Political and social upheavals are creatingnumerous obstacles on the path to human development.We are seeing a new era for the world order  combinedwith new historical challenges and changes. At thiscritical stage the Organization must continue its loftymission to build peace and to achieve sustainabledevelopment throughout the world. Kyrgyzstan  in thespirit of solidarity and cooperation with the UnitedNations  is prepared to play its part in tackling themajor challenges of this day."
"90",3780,"KHM",67,2012,"﻿On behalf ofmy delegation  please allow me to extend our sincerecongratulations to you  Sir  on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventhsession. I have no doubt that under your able leadershipthis session will yield fruitful outcomes. I would alsolike to convey my admiration to Mr. Ban Ki-moon forhis untiring efforts to overcome the many multifacetedchallenges confronting our world today.Let me start with the obvious. The twenty-firstcentury we live in is facing one of its most difficultmoments. Never before has the pressure of globalinterdependency been so intense. As economies becomemore and more interdependent  not only are opportunitiesto create wealth multiplied  but so are opportunitiesto transmit destabilizing shocks from one country toanother. Imbalances and risks are omnipresent. In thecontext of declining economic prospects and mountingglobal challenges  collective actions are required toremedy the shortcomings of global governance inensuring systemic financial stability  a stable monetarysystem and the regulation of international financialmarkets  and in dealing with major systemic shocks. Themultilateral system  devised more than half a centuryago  is facing challenges to its capacity to deliver onits mandate as the international agenda has becomeincreasingly complex. Clearly  the current multilateralsystem needs to be radically reformed and made intoa well-coordinated and permeable body of institutionsthat can deliver innovative and feasible solutions to aglobalized international society.In order to respond to systemic risk in the financialsector  we have closely cooperated with China  Japanand the Republic of Korea within the Association ofSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to strengthen aregional financial safeguard mechanism  called theChiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization  which hasrecently increased its funding level from $120 billionto $240 billion. We strongly believe that that regionalfinancial arrangement will complement the globalfirewall for regional crisis resolution. ASEAN has alsoestablished a macroeconomic and finance surveillanceoffice in Singapore to achieve a more integrated  even-handed and effective surveillance mechanism. As we all struggle to overcome the effects of theglobal financial crisis  we should not lose sight of newemerging challenges and threats  such as obstaclesto sustainable development  the achievement of theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs)  climatechange  food security and so on. Many developingcountries still face many obstacles to achieving alltheir MDGs by the target date of 2015  owing to theirvulnerability to the global financial crisis  the challengesof the debt burden and the unmet commitments ofofficial development assistance. Having achieved stablegrowth successively for a number of years  Cambodiais confident that  despite its limited resources  it willachieve the Cambodian MDGs by 2015. We welcomethe adoption of resolution 66/288  entitled “Thefuture we want”  by the United Nations Conferenceon Sustainable Development (Rio+20)  held in Rio deJaneiro on June 2012  and strongly advocate that theMDGs should remain a fundamental milestone in thedevelopment agenda. We also call for renewed effortsto enable the developing countries to achieve theirMillennium Development Goals on time.Climate change is a critical problem for the wholeworld  requiring immediate and concerted actions. Therapid pace of climate change could have devastatingeffects  particularly on small States in the Asia-Pacificand the Caribbean regions  in the form of rising sealevels. Other developing countries  mostly dependent onagriculture  are threatened by similar negative effects such as extreme f loods and drought  which affect theirlivelihood. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon describedsuch phenomena as a real threat to international peaceand security.Regrettably  despite all the adversities inf licted onthe world’s most vulnerable people by climate change the international community remains divided onimplementing a rapid and critical global response. Wecall on developed countries to reduce greenhouse-gasemissions in accordance with the United Nationsprinciple of common but differentiated responsibility.It is disappointing that  for the most part  the promisesmade by developed nations in Copenhagen in 2009  inCancún in 2010 and in Durban in 2011 have not beenfulfilled in a timely manner.In the same vein  we are of the view thatnatural-disaster management and cooperationmechanisms should be further developed andstrengthened at both the regional and the globallevels  with a view to preventing natural disasters and addressing related issues that have become morepressing owing to climate change. ASEAN has madegreat progress in that area at the regional level; theestablishment of the ASEAN Coordinating Centre forHumanitarian Assistance on disaster management known as the AHA Centre  deserves mention in thatregard.Food security is another serious issue of the presenttime. At the speed the world’s population is growing the United Nations Environment Programme predictsthat by 2030 we will need to produce 50 per cent morefood  30 per cent more clean water and 40 per cent moreenergy. Consequently  the increased competition fornatural resources and between biofuel energy and foodfor human needs will only further exacerbate the foodsecurity situation. A major global reform is neededurgently to implement the Rio+20 recommendationson sustainable development  which emphasize both theneed for major investments to modernize agricultureand encourage small-scale agricultural projects aroundthe world and the vital importance of addressinginterlinkages between energy and agricultural prices.Rising oil and food prices are a common concern ofthe majority of countries in the world. High oil pricescontribute to soaring food prices. Rising oil and foodprices mean increased poverty levels at a time whenglobal growth is still weak and the number of theunemployed and underemployed is continuously risingin many countries. Our modern global food system ishighly oil-dependent  but petroleum is becoming lessand less affordable. Thus  there is no solution yet forthe world’s worsening food crisis within the currentenergy and agricultural system. What is needed is amajor rethinking of both food and energy prices and thecoordination of agricultural and energy policies. Wecan but appeal to the world oil-producing countries toconsider the negative effects of higher fuel prices andtheir impact on food and energy security.In our regional context  ASEAN has adopted acomprehensive strategy on food security with the signingof the Emergency Rice Reserve Agreement with China Japan and the Republic of Korea  which is a permanentscheme for meeting emergency requirements.The Group of 20 (G-20) has a crucial role to playin meeting those global challenges. Cambodia  as Chairof ASEAN  appreciated the opportunity to representASEAN at the G-20 Summit held in Los Cabos in June.Cambodia’s views reflected the need to  among otherthings  to sustain economic stability and structural reform for growth and employment; the urgency toimprove and strengthen the international financialarchitecture in an interconnected global economy;the imperative of completing the Doha Round and theprevention of the return of trade protectionism; andthe priority of further facilitating trade  an importantconducive factor for stimulate international economicgrowth  which all our countries need.Cambodia fully supports all the priorities agreedamong the G-20 countries in Los Cabos to promotetrade  job creation and economic growth  includingtheir determination to finalize negotiations on the DohaRound agenda as soon as possible. International tradeis one of the most important factors that will bringabout economic growth and job creation in both theimmediate and longer term.Since the establishment of the United Nations  in1945  the global situation has changed so dramaticallythat global diplomac urgently needs to be strengthened.It is therefore in everyone’s interest to push forcomprehensive reform of the United Nations so thatit reflects the diverse needs and representativeness ofthe world today. That reform should be comprehensiveand should cover not only the Security Council butalso other United Nations organs in order to preserveits relevance and legitimacy as an effective globalgovernance institution to cope with the reality of thepresent-day world  which is different from that of thepost-Second World War era.The General Assembly should be furtherempowered to enable it to play a leading role inaddressing today’s global problems as a democratic deliberative policymaking organ of the United Nations.Both the permanent and non-permanent membershipof the Security Council should be equitably expandedso that it represents both developed and the developingcountries.In the spirit of the United Nations peacekeepingmission for the advancement of world peace  securityand development  Cambodia has contributed 1 000 mento United Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa especially in South Sudan and Lebanon.Through its experience of close collaboration withthe United Nations and its own experience in endingwar  and thanks to its win-win policy and post-conflictmanagement  in particular with respect to economic and social development and national reconciliation Cambodia wishes to contribute more effectively  throughthe Security Council  to the cause of peace  security andthe peaceful settlement of conflicts in many parts of theworld. To that end  for the very first time since joiningthe United Nations  in 1955  Cambodia has presentedits candidature as a non-permanent member of theSecurity Council for the period 2013-2014  for whichvoting will be held next month. I also wish to note that since 1955  Cambodia has never occupied any seat inthe United Nations system and that its candidature hasbeen endorsed and supported by all ASEAN memberStates.Before I conclude  I would like to take thisopportunity to stress that Cambodia deeply regrets theacts of violence against the United States Consulate inBenghazi  which caused the death of four Americandiplomats  including the United States Ambassador even though we very well understand the legitimateanger at disrespect towards the Muslim religion."
"91",3794,"KIR",67,2012,"﻿I bring warm greetings from thepeople of Kiribati  on whose behalf I am privileged toaddress this body once again. I join with those whohave gone before me in congratulating Mr. Vuk Jeremićon assuming the presidency of the Assembly at itssixty-seventh session. We find ourselves in challengingtimes. The work ahead of us during this session reflectsthose challenges. I am confident  however  that  underhis able leadership  this Organization will continue its work to improve the quality of life for all membersof our global community  in particular those who aremost vulnerable.Let me also take this opportunity to acknowledgewith appreciation the commendable leadership of hispredecessor  Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  duringthe most recent session of the General Assembly.I also recognize the unwavering dedication of ourSecretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon. With his handon the tiller  he continues to steer our Organizationthrough the complex realities and challenges facingour world today towards our objectives. In particular  Iwould like to acknowledge with deep appreciation hispersonal commitment to the issue of climate changeand the plight of the most vulnerable. We in Kiribatiwelcomed the Secretary-General to our countrylast year  during the first visit ever by anyone in hisposition to our part of the world. We were grateful forthe opportunity to show him firsthand the challengesof living on the front lines of climate change.In the President’s opening statement yesterday(see A/67/PV.6)  he reminded us that the core functionof the Organization is the maintenance of peace andsecurity. It is important that we all reflect on what wehave done as individuals to achieve a more peaceful secure and better world. We must ask ourselves ifwhat we are doing is in the collective interest of all thepeoples of this world or of just a select few. We mustlook at our efforts as leaders of this global family andask ourselves if we are doing the right thing for ourchildren and their children. I firmly believe that  with all the informationavailable to us today  we should know exactly whatneeds to be done. We know what we have to do but for whatever reason  we lack the courage  the fortitudeand the vision to do it. We lack a sense of responsibilityfor each other. We are not willing to step out of ourcomfort zone and make the necessary sacrifices for thesecurity and future of all members of our internationalcommunity.It is never too late to do the right thing. Historyshows many examples where global action has resultedin global good. We have managed to secure a relativelymore peaceful world. We have been able to addresssome of the major injustices of the past. We have cometogether to face down those who seek to achieve theirobjectives through terrorist means. However  we mustremain vigilant  as new and emerging forms of securitythreats and injustices are cropping up to threaten ourglobal family.This will be the seventh time I have had the honourto address the Assembly in my nine years as Presidentof my country. Each time I have sought to convey thesame message. Each time I have spoken of the realand existential threat to my nation. Each time I havereminded the Assembly of the need for urgent actionto address climate change and sea level rise so as toensure the long-term survival of nations like Kiribati.I frequently find myself watching my grandchildrenand wondering what sort of a future we shall be leavingthem. For their sake  climate change is an issue that Iwill continue to talk about for as long as I have breath inmy body. This is a critical issue for the survival of ourpeople and for all of humanity. It remains the greatestmoral challenge of our time.Whether or not we are willing to acknowledge it climate change and sea-level rise are the result of theunsustainable use of our planet’s resources. Economicgrowth at all costs must not be our mantra  particularlywhen it is those who will benefit the least from thisgrowth who will pay the ultimate price. The Earth isnot ours to do with as we please. We are merely trusteesfor future generations  and we ignore this reality attheir peril.The Organization was founded on the fundamentalprinciple of sovereign equality. Security issuesaffecting each of us must be given due recognition.We are grateful that the General Assembly agrees thatclimate change is a matter warranting the attention of the Security Council. I applaud the commitment of ourSecretary-General to this particular security threat  buthe needs the support of all nations to take the necessaryaction to address it.We must step up our collective efforts to mitigateglobal greenhouse-gas emissions. We continue to urgemajor greenhouse-gas emitters to do their part. We alsourge development partners to provide the appropriatelevel of resources and technology to enable us to dealwith the current and future impacts of climate changeand sea-level rise.While we are taking adaptative measures to ensurethat Kiribati remains habitable for as long as possible we are also preparing for a future when our islandsmay no longer be able to sustain our population. Weare looking to improve the skills of our people to alevel where they will be able to compete for jobs inthe international labour market. We want our people tohave the option to migrate with dignity  should that bea necessary choice in the future  and all the science istelling us that that is a real possibility.We note some positive progress made at the recentclimate change talks in Bangkok  building on thedecisions made in Durban last year. However  actionhas been too slow in coming. We inch along  whenit is great strides that are needed. On those issueswhere we have consensus  we believe the internationalcommunity must move to implement agreed actionwithout delay  while we continue our discussions onthose matters that remain contentious. If we wait foragreement on everything  then it is going to be a verylong wait and a long process.It should not come as a surprise that we are off-track on many of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs). While other countries are focusingtheir resources on their efforts to meet the MDGs  we the most vulnerable countries  continue to spend adisproportionate level of our limited resources fightingthe onslaught of the rising seas and storm surges on ourhomes  livelihoods and public infrastructure. That is acostly exercise that we cannot afford. We continue torely on the goodwill of our partners and members of ourglobal community in that regard.We are a nation of water. We are a very-large-oceanState. We believe that  given the right support  wecan achieve sustainable development through theutilization of the available resources of our vastexclusive economic zone. We believe that  in so doing  we can reduce our reliance on development assistance.I also believe that we may even be able to do away withdevelopment assistance altogether  if we are providedwith the support we need now to develop our capacityto harvest and process our own resources.Fisheries remain a major economic resource for mycountry  providing between 40 and 50 per cent of ourrevenue. Our aspiration is to maximize returns fromthat resource  given the current rate of return of between5 and 8 per cent after landed value alone. We havestarted establishing our fish-processing plant througha public/private partnership. Seabed mining is anotherpotential source of revenue. However  we are mindfulof the need to take a precautionary approach towardsthat particular industry  given the potential damage itcould cause to our pristine marine environment.We acknowledge the fundamental role of ourenvironment as a pillar of sustainable development.Maintaining the health and biodiversity of our oceansand ecosystems will be critical. Our contribution tothose efforts is the Phoenix Islands Protected Area which was once the world’s largest marine protectedarea. We have set aside that area as a haven formarine biodiversity  and that is our gift to humanityin recognition of the value of protecting our commonheritage.Ocean conservation is beyond the resources ofany single country. Collaboration on cross-borderinitiatives is therefore essential to advancing ourefforts in that regard. At the recent Pacific IslandsForum meeting in the Cook Islands  the United Statesand Kiribati announced plans to collaborate in buildinglinks between our adjoining marine parks in thePhoenix Islands  under the umbrella of the PhoenixOcean Arc. That effort is our joint contribution to thePacific Oceanscape Framework. We want to take thisopportunity to invite the international community topartner with us in that endeavour.Our message to the international community is thatconservation of biodiversity and marine ecosystemsin the Pacific is not only important to the sustainabledevelopment of Pacific island people. It is also of vitalimportance to the rest of the global community. Theinternational community needs to support those efforts not as a hand-out but as an investment for this planet’sfuture generations.In June  we met in Rio de Janeiro to review ourprogress 20 years on from the 1992 Earth Summit. Twenty years ago  we agreed that the protection of ourglobal environment was critical for our future survivaland that the pursuit of development must be based onthe long-term sustainability of our natural resources.Unfortunately  our track record in delivering on ourundertakings has not been good. In fact  in manyrespects  our environment is worse off today than it was20 years ago. The fine balance keeping our planetaryecosystem together has been adversely affected byour pursuit of individual benefits at the expense of thecollective good. While some members of our globalfamily continue to benefit from the unsustainableexploitation of resources  others are having to pay theultimate price. We do not believe that there is justicein that.We renewed our commitment in June to achievingthe future we want. That future will require ourOrganization to evolve to reflect the realities of ourtime  a time in which new and emerging securitythreats and injustices  such as climate change  arechallenging the credibility of our international systemof governance; a time in which the future survivalof some nations is seriously in question; and a timewhen all those countries with the ability to do so mustcontribute to the prevention of such a calamity or beforever judged by history. If we are to provide a secure peaceful and prosperous future for our children  thenwe must go beyond business as usual and deliver now.In fact  we should have delivered yesterday.We accept the reality that  during these uncertaintimes  there is a need for the United Nations to remainas relevant and responsive as possible to the ever-changing needs and challenges of this world. In ourdiscussions earlier this morning  I was most encouragedto be assured by the Secretary-General’s commitmentto ensuring that our Organization will undergo reformsin order to become more efficient  more transparentand more accountable. We also welcome the Secretary-General’s proposal to strengthen partnerships with civilsociety and the private sector.In fact  I believe that such a partnership must beginat the community and national levels before extendingto the regional and international levels.The fundamental fabric that binds us together asa family and as humanity is unravelling at the seams.Maintaining security and ensuring the survival ofpeople in conflict areas  particularly in the MiddleEast and North Africa  remain a major challenge to ourOrganization. Let us pray for the sake of those on the front line of the major global challenges that a greaterunderstanding and stability will prevail.It is gratifying to note the continued easing oftension and the improvement of relations across theTaiwan Straits. We also welcome the inclusion ofcountries such as Taiwan in the international activitiesof the World Health Assembly. We hope that asimilar understanding will prevail in respect of otherinternational institutions and processes so that Taiwancan participate and contribute meaningfully for thegood of humanity.As we chart the path towards the future that wewant  we must address the fundamental threats to thevery existence of the members of this family of nations.As a family  we must guarantee the survival of themembers of our community. Climate change must beresolved before it is too late for those countries on thefront line and  indeed  the whole of humanity.We need compassionate  visionary and responsibleleadership at this time in order to direct our pathtowards a more secure and just future. We owe it toour children and their children’s children to act and actsoon. So let us pray that God will give us the commonsense to do the right thing for the future of humanity."
"92",3825,"KNA",67,2012,"﻿On behalf ofthe Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis  Iextend my sincere congratulations to Mr. Vuk Jeremićon his election to the presidency of General Assembly atits sixty-seventh session. His task  we know  will be farfrom easy in the light of the wide range of taxing issuesthat will be brought before him. As he embarks on histenure  it is our hope that under his astute leadership the myriad issues that define the work of the Assemblywill continue to find relevance for all of us.It is imperative  therefore  that the mobilization ofcommitments required to advance the agenda of thissixty-seventh session begin now. We are aware thatthe challenges associated with that task are demandingand will indeed require our focused attention  strong partnership and visionary leadership if we are to makesignificant strides in an era embattled by a plethoraof issues that threaten the realization of our variousdevelopment goals. We have no doubt that he willprovide the degree of attention they so urgently deserve.I must also at this point  on behalf of my delegation thank Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  President of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  for so ablypresiding over the work of the Assembly during the pastyear.Our focus this year is on continuing to steadfastlypromote an environment of peace and security  which arethe critical requirements for sustainable developmentfor our peoples. As the geographic distance that dividesus shrinks into insignificance and becomes increasinglyreduced by our interdependence and partnership  it isequally significant that we strive for the effective andlasting settlement of disputes.Libya and Syria  of course  are just two of themany cases that come to mind  with the myriad andmultifaceted questions that they raise  not onlyregarding the advisability of intervention  but alsowith reference to such issues as the timing of anyintervention  the form of any intervention and  ofcourse  the associated humanitarian and relief-relatedconsequences of any such intervention. The complexityof those challenges demands a sober redoubling of ourefforts and underscores the fact that social upheavaland human trauma anywhere must indeed concern usall.The Security Council must continue to ensure thatit executes its mandate to enable the institutionalizationof a culture of peace and security. Respect fordemocracy and the democratic principles espousedby the United Nations must inform the thrust of ourengagement as we reject intolerance for diversity andembrace peaceful coexistence for all people. I take thisopportunity to condemn the recent  senseless attack onthe United States consulate in Libya  which resulted inthe loss of innocent lives. It must be condemned fromthe highest level.Saint Kitts and Nevis is grateful to be a stable socially cohesive nation. On behalf of my Government I would also like to express our deep appreciation to theUnited States of America for its highly valued support in the form of the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative offered to both my country and our Caribbean regionin our fight against drugs and criminality. It also addresses the issue of the reform that is required toensure that our youth embrace renewed alternatives tolives of unproductivity and look towards a new hope forpeace and prosperity through respect for human life.That is of great importance to us. The continuing f lowof foreign-made small arms into our Caribbean region however  concerns us greatly. Originating beyond ourshores  those weapons have dire consequences in termsboth of human life and of the economic stability of ournations.We are aware that changing cultural valuesare influencing the use of weapons by some in ournations  and we understand the importance of focusedand effective policing and partnership on mattersof security. In that regard  we urge the internationalcommunity to make the production of a much-neededand long-overdue arms trade treaty an absolute priority.The interests of democratic nations everywhere cryout for the establishment of international standardsand controls governing the illicit f low of conventionalweapons  and I urge the establishment of a dedicatedsecretariat to assist States parties in that regard.I ask: How can small Caribbean nations be expectedto deal single-handed with the double misfortuneof being located between regions of massive drugproduction and regions of massive drug consumption?Small arms and light weapons always follow illegaldrugs  and we in the Caribbean are simply not equippedto deal with the externally created crime fallout. Onthat point  I wish to stress that before its closure  theBarbados branch of the United Nations Office on Drugsand Crime provided critical  hands-on collaborationin this high-priority area of fighting crime. Withits presence now having been withdrawn  the vitalsupport that we need simply is not there  leaving us toadjust as best we can at precisely the time when drug-and deportee-related crimes continue to be a majorhemispheric challenge.While we focus on the well-being of our people  myGovernment has strengthened its primary health carewith increased attention to reducing the prevalence ofnon-communicable diseases (NCDs) and has updatedan implementable plan of action that addresses thepriorities in keeping with the Political Declaration onNCDs (resolution 66/2  annex). As part of our nationalsensitization mechanism on health-related issues  we areinstitutionalizing a culture of wellness with emphasis onhealthy lifestyles. Similar responses have been initiatedat the regional level  as we encourage Member States to participate effectively in the multilateral institutions tovoice our positions on the issue of NCDs. That is whythe Caribbean Community has taken the lead on thismatter in recent years  with the High-level Meeting ofthe General Assembly on the Prevention and Control ofNon-communicable Diseases.Therefore  in the light of the clear nexus between ahealthy workforce and a nation’s economic potential  Iurge this body today to move forward to launch a UnitedNations campaign to curb the global toll of NCDs aswe move towards the realization of our MillenniumDevelopment Goals. At the time of last year’s High-level Meeting on NCDs  there was a commitment bothto ensuring that this grave issue remains high on thedevelopment agenda and to ensuring concrete action inthat regard. Hence  the type of global effort previouslyrecommended would constitute precisely the type ofconcrete action to which we committed ourselves oneyear ago.Any discussion of global health must address theissue of HIV/AIDS  and because our ultimate objectivemust be the complete eradication of that dreadeddisease — as opposed to the lifelong management andaccommodation of same by millions of people aroundthe globe — I appeal today for a wise  determinedand discerning onslaught against the scourge at thelocal  national  and international levels by us all. Hereand now  we must recommit ourselves to eradicatingthe stigmatization of and discrimination againstpeople living or associated with HIV/AIDS. Theabuses of human lives that perpetuate discriminationand stigmatization must come to an end. We in theCaribbean are committed to achieving exactly that.I wish now to address a matter that is profoundlytroubling to small island States like mine. Whateverthe debate being waged internationally regarding thequestion of climate change  and however dramaticthe rhetorical jousting within various circles on theissue  we in the Caribbean can attest to the radicalclimatic shifts that our region has undergone in recentdecades. Moreover  it is very troubling that the largestcontributors of greenhouse gases are still not takingresponsibility for the increasing temperatures  risingsea levels  coastal degradation  coral reef bleaching anddecimation  infrastructural damage and loss of livesthat their actions have wrought.Our peoples  our maritime integrity  our soils andour infrastructure are all interrelated contributors to our overall social and economic viability. And the absenceof corrective and restitutional action on the part of theindustrialized nations involved is neither constructivenor understandable in this highly interdependent world.The physical  mental and financial burdens that othercountries’ energy usage has inf licted on countrieslike mine has been enormous  plunging us deeper intodebt and severely frustrating our efforts to meet ourMillennium Development Goals.While a shift to renewable energy will not instantlysolve the myriad problems caused by a significantlyfossil fuel-based global economy  the embrace of greenenergy will indeed help to halt the intense downwardspiral into which our fossil fuel-based economies havethrust our planet. And so we strongly urge that greenenergy be made an absolute priority globally. I mustcommend the Secretary-General for his visionaryleadership and the Governments and financialinstitutions that have committed generously to ensuringthat high-impact clean energy is utilized globally.My Government wishes to place on record itsappreciation to the Government of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan and other development partners fortheir valuable assistance to my country in the area ofrenewable energy  which will positively impact ourenergy cost-reduction efforts as we move towardsrealizing a full green economy by 2015 in order to bringmuch-needed financial relief to our people.The recently held United Nations Conference onSustainable Development (Rio+20) set the stage for areconfiguration of the global programme on sustainabledevelopment  and signaled a new era in the sustainabledevelopment agenda of the international community.Two decades of debate and deliberation wereinstrumental in our being able to frame the dialogue and envision a path for the two decades ahead of us. Ifwe are to even approach the potential of Rio+20  it willbe essential that we first face up to  and then break the strictures of indifference and narrow self-interestthat have plagued us for far too long. It is thereforeincumbent upon us and future generations to view ourresponsibilities as parts of an ongoing continuum  witheach of our efforts benefitting from and building uponthe work that came before.Saint Kitts and Nevis therefore applaudsthe decision to convene the third United NationsConference on the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States in 2014. Small island developing States  by virtue of our size and geographicprofile  are clearly among the world’s most vulnerablenations — hence the recognition of our need for specialattention where sustainable development is concernedand the importance of everyone remembering theabsolutely essential nature of special and differentiatedresponsibilities where small island States are concerned.I therefore urge that clear targets be establishednow so that we can all prepare thoroughly and wellfor the 2014 Conference  at which urgently neededattention will be paid to the ways in which our ownvulnerabilities as small developing States might bestbe reduced. This body can be assured of our fullparticipation in the process and in the post-Rio+20sustainable development agenda.Permit me to point out  however  the extent towhich the best-laid plans of countries like mine arerepeatedly upended by decisions made in nations farbeyond our shores. I mentioned earlier the impact ofexternally generated carbon emissions on our economicprospects. I also discussed the severe national securitythreat posed to our region by foreign-made small armsand weapons that have been finding their way into ournations. Particularly trying as well  and very troublinglyand destabilizing for many countries throughout theregion — and indeed the world at large — has beenthe global economic crisis that made itself manifest in2008  the ramifications of which have been trying andtesting regional economic planners to the limits eversince. In no way of our making  that global economiccrisis has severely complicated the task of governancein advanced economies and more so in highly indebtedmiddle-income nations like mine. It has introducedboth new variables and additional unknowns to oureconomic planning models  and has  in a nutshell thrust upon us a backdrop of global volatility that noneof us could have anticipated  that none of us welcome and that has created immense difficulties for all of ourpeople.Indeed  Saint Kitts and Nevis was forced to pursuea new economic development programme involvingfiscal balance and debt restructuring  with built-insocial safety nets. The assistance of the InternationalMonetary Fund  the World Bank  the European Unionand our many local  regional and international creditors including the United Kingdom and the United States  asmembers of the Paris Club  have helped us to alleviate theseverity of the social impact of the economic adjustmentand to restore confidence among our investors in the economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis. But we continue toface significant challenges  especially in relation to theattainment of economic growth in the context of a verysluggish and uncertain global economy. The mammothchallenges and difficulties that our small multi-islandState faces underscore the need to pay greater attentionto the issue of special and differentiated responsibilitiesin a rather trying era. It also underscores the need forsmall  responsible nations like mine to have fair andcalm paths to redress in our relations with far largerand infinitely more powerful friends and allies.A few days ago in this very Assembly  the nationsof the world held the High-level Meeting on the Ruleof Law at the National and International Levels. Whilethere is often debate as to the exact meaning of therule of law  my delegation and the people we representare happy to align ourselves with the core principleon the rule of law  as distilled by the late Mr. ThomasBingham  Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. Inhis book The Rule of Law  he stated:“The core of the existing principle is  I suggest that all persons and authorities within the state whether public or private  should be bound byand entitled to the benefit of laws publicly made taking effect (generally) in the future and publiclyadministered in the courts.”Although not comprehensive  in my country’s viewthat represents a solid basis from which to identify theessential elements of a continually evolving conceptand an essential mechanism for conflict resolutionand for ensuring respect for the fundamental rightsand freedoms of our people. I support the call of theSecretary-General for a comprehensive approach tostrengthening the rule of law at the international anddomestic levels.I make the point because  over our almost 30 yearsof nationhood  Saint Kitts and Nevis has studiouslyexamined both trends here at the United Nations anddevelopments throughout the international communityas we have evaluated our place in the world. Throughoutthat time  we have been faithfully guided by our beliefin the rule of law. We believe that in the internationalarena  the rule of law was created to protect thevulnerable  like ours  and to remind us of obligationsto our fellow human beings. We further believe thatorderly and constructive coexistence requires not onlycitizens  but nations as well to be bound by the rule oflaw. Respect for international law has therefore  for our nation  always been our guiding force. My delegationcalls on all States members of this great body tosimilarly respect that most sacred pillar of internationalcoexistence.Throughout the 29 years of our existence as asovereign nation  the Republic of China on Taiwanhas been a highly valued partner and ally. Throughoutmy nation  evidence of our collaborative effortsabound in areas as diverse as agriculture  agritourism green energy  information technology  communitydevelopment and education  to name just a few.In my own nation or even my region  however Taiwan’s unfailing and valued contributions to thework of the United Nations Framework Conventionon Climate Change  the International Civil AviationOrganization  the World Health Assembly and otherforums have long demonstrated its outstandingcredentials as a valued and impactful member of theglobal community. It is only fitting and just that allremaining strictures pertaining to Taiwan’s standingamong the international community of nations beremoved. Saint Kitts and Nevis appeals to this body toensure that that will indeed be done.In closing  I wish to stress here how unfortunateit is that  yet again  the case has to be made for thelifting of the embargo on Cuba. The embargo is not as some may wish to suggest  a matter of merelybilateral import. Not only have we repeatedly heardCuba oppose the situation in this very body  but wealso know that the embargo’s continued denial ofcertain medical treatments to the Cuban people issimply unconscionable. Cuba and its people have madeconsiderable contributions to international medicineand higher education  and the Caribbean has beenamong its most sustained beneficiaries. It is thereforewith the utmost conviction and clearest possible resolvethat Saint Kitts and Nevis calls for the immediate endto the embargo.I recall that it was in July and August of this yearthat the international community participated in thegames of the thirtieth Olympiad. At a time of risinginternational tensions and intensifying antagonisms the time has probably come for us to introduce toother areas of international and intra-State realms ofinteraction the keen spirit of cooperation and mutualrespect that has enabled the Olympics to function soconstructively and so well for so many years. The international community is  by definition diverse. Throughout the community  however  thererun strong seams of commonality that can and mustbe better utilized in order to promote peace  theconstructive airing of differences and the avoidance ofviolent conflict. Most importantly  when all else fails we can and must settle the most vexing internationalcrises through the good offices of this institution  ourUnited Nations. That is the path that would serve all ourbest interests. I sincerely urge that we take it."
"93",3851,"KOR",67,2012,"﻿Allowme at the outset to express my sincere congratulationsto Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his assumption of the presidencyof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Ihave every confidence that under his able leadershipthis session will be crowned with great success.Humankind continues to advance  drawing on ourcollective wisdom to address challenges throughouthuman history. Although new global challenges tomankind such as climate change  poverty and disease underdevelopment  terrorism and proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction are now testing theinternational community  I have no doubt that we willovercome those challenges on our future path.The United Nations  the symbol of our collectivewisdom  should take greater responsibility in copingwith the challenges. I note with great satisfaction thatthe United Nations is becoming a more accountable andtrusted international Organization under the prominentleadership of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. In thatregard  I recognize and support the Secretary-General’sfive-year Action Agenda  which I believe will guideus in addressing current world challenges and onwardtowards the future we are aiming for.The United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment (Rio+20)  held in June in Rio de Janeiro represented a critical step forward towards ushering in the world we hope for. The outcome document  entitled“The future we want” (resolution 66/288  annex) marks a substantial advancement for sustainabledevelopment. The task before us now is to capitalize onour achievements thus far and exert even greater efforton follow-up actions such as developing sustainabledevelopment goals  strengthening the institutionalframework and mobilizing finance.As part of such endeavours  the Republic of Koreaestablished the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI).Sixteen countries signed the agreement to establish theGGGI on the margins of the Rio+20 meeting  and theInstitute will be launched as an international organizationstarting in October. The GGGI will engage in a range ofactivities for disseminating the green growth paradigm in which the economy and the environment form avirtuous cycle. Moreover  the Korean Government isprepared to step up its contribution to internationalefforts to achieve a sustainable future by hosting thesecretariat of the Green Climate Fund. The Republic ofKorea stands ready to render wholehearted support forthe successful launch and stable operation of the Fund.The Republic of Korea is keen on contributingto the balanced and harmonious development of theinternational community and is fully cooperatingin such efforts in the context of the United Nations.The Korean Government continues to increase itsofficial development assistance to help achieve theinternationally agreed development goals  includingthe Millennium Development Goals. The Republic ofKorea underscored the importance of inclusive growthand development partnership at the 2010 Seoul Summitof the Group of Twenty and the Fourth High-levelForum on Aid Effectiveness  held in Busan in 2011. InJune  the Global Partnership for Effective DevelopmentCooperation was launched for the implementation of theBusan commitments. The Busan Forum and the launchof the Global Partnership will mark a turning point forinternational development cooperation by broadeningour perspective from aid effectiveness to developmenteffectiveness.Our own experience has taught us that investmentin education is at the heart of effective development.In that vein  we are confident that the Education Firstinitiative of the Secretary-General will  indeed  providea solid foundation for achieving the internationaldevelopment goals. The Korean Government extendsits strong support for the initiative. The Republic of Korea is also taking an active partin the discussions on shaping the post-2015 developmentframework. We fully recognize the importance of acomprehensive approach that takes into account theeconomic  social and environmental dimensions ofsustainable development.The aspiration for human rights  fundamentalfreedoms and democratic values is the primary drivingforce for the advancement of humanity. Today  manycountries have been striving to advocate human rightsin tandem with democracy. The United Nations  as theepicentre of the international community’s efforts topromote and protect human rights  has provided timelyassistance to such countries.Recently  we witnessed the strong desire of peoplein the Middle East and North Africa to realize theiraspirations for democracy and respect for humanrights. The recent positive developments in Myanmarare also well worth noting in that regard. However while those changes are still unfolding  enormouschallenges and difficulties still lie ahead. In Syria  agreat number of civilians have been killed and grossviolations of human rights have been witnessed. Withhigh hopes towards the efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi the Joint Special Representative of the United Nationsand the League of Arab States for Syria  the KoreanGovernment will stand by the Syrian people throughthis time of suffering together with the internationalcommunity.The Korean Government expresses deep concernat the recent attacks against diplomats and diplomaticmissions in several places. Such violence cannot bejustified regardless of the motivation.Putting an end to sexual violence against womenin armed conflict is another issue that warrants seriousattention. Wartime sexual violence is a fundamentalinfringement of human rights and is  in fact  an affront tohuman dignity and integrity. History has left importantlessons that warn against such egregious acts.The Republic of Korea would like to urge theUnited Nations system and all Member States to dotheir utmost to put an end to such atrocities  not onlyby taking all measures to protect women and girls inarmed conflict  but also by providing effective remediesand reparations for victims and ending impunity bybringing the offenders to justice in accordance with therelevant resolutions of the United Nations. Both a sound historical consciousness and aheartfelt soul-searching into any past wrongdoings arerequired in order to establish solid peace and stabilitybetween nations. A country’s true valour is proven whenit confronts the dark side of its history and endeavoursto rectify past wrongdoings.It is the firm conviction of the Korean Governmentthat respect for territorial integrity and sovereigntyas enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations should be the guiding principle for stable internationalrelations.No country should abuse international legalprocedures or the concept of the rule of law in order toinfringe upon the territorial integrity and sovereigntyof other countries or distort historical justice.The Republic of Korea is actively contributingto the global efforts being undertaken in pursuit of aworld without nuclear weapons. The Seoul NuclearSecurity Summit held last March brought togetherleaders from across the world to galvanize the visionand the determination of the international communityto achieve a peaceful world without nuclear terrorism.During the Summit  the Korean Government played aleading role in forging a consensus to take importantpractical steps  such as the substantial reduction ofnuclear materials  the promotion of the universality ofinternational conventions and cooperation to combatillicit trafficking of nuclear materials. I am delightedthat the High-level Meeting on Countering NuclearTerrorism  which was convened this morning  hasprovided new momentum to further energize the effortsseen at the Seoul Summit for the prevention of nuclearand radiological terrorism.Furthermore  existing and emerging threatsin cyberspace  such as rampant transnationalcybercrime and potential cyber conflicts  presenta serious challenge. It is therefore imperative thatthe international community address those threats.By hosting the 2013 Conference on Cyberspace  theRepublic of Korea hopes to contribute in multiple waysto the ongoing global efforts to maximize the benefitsof digital networks. We further believe that the eventwill provide an unparalleled opportunity to pool ourefforts to cope with threats stemming from the misuseof information and communication technologies.The North Korean nuclear programme continuesto pose a threat  not only to the security of theKorean peninsula and North-East Asia  but indeed to the very basis of the international non-proliferationregime. As long as the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea continues to pursue its nuclear and missileprogrammes  achieving the goal of sustainable peaceon the Korean peninsula and in the region will remainfar off. Unfortunately  the international community’saspirations were shattered once again when theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea launched along-range missile in April 2012. In response to thatprovocative action  the Security Council reaffirmedthat the international community will not tolerate thecontinued pursuit by the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea of its nuclear and missile programmes byissuing a firm and resolute presidential statement in anunprecedentedly swift manner (S/PRST/2012/13).We urge with concern that the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea should take concrete measures aimedat denuclearization  which will also open an avenue toimproving the livelihood of its people. At the sametime  we sincerely hope that the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea will listen to the internationalcommunity’s call for the improvement of that country’shuman rights situation  as repeatedly affirmed in therelevant United Nations resolutions.As a country that has risen from the ashes of war we have learned the values of peace and security. Inthat context  we earnestly hope to have the opportunityto promote such values by serving as a non-permanentmember of the Security Council for the 2013-2014 term.The Republic of Korea is determined to fulfil that rolewith the greatest enthusiasm and devotion. We hopethat States Members of the United Nations understandand support our bid for membership in the Council.We are united by the ideals set out in the UnitedNations Charter. In pursuit of international peaceand security  the continued promotion of social andeconomic development and the promotion of humanrights  we should embrace a spirit of cooperation andtolerance  with the United Nations at the centre ofinternational efforts to that end. The Republic of Koreawill persist in fully playing its part in the invaluablework of the United Nations  taking on the variouschallenges that humanity will continue to confront."

In that context  the State of Kuwait emphasizesthe need for a thorough preparation of the 2012conference on the establishment of a Middle East zonefree of nuclear weapons and other weapons of massdestruction  as agreed in the Final Document of the2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Numerouschallenges face the Organization as it nears its seventhdecade. From its inception  the United Nations and allof its organs and agencies have worked to contain andresolve many crises and to meet political  humanitarianand economic challenges. However  in this era ofglobalization and the information revolution  poorcoordination  f laws in joint actions and the failure ofsome States to fulfil their obligations have preventedthe United Nations from reaching conclusive solutions.Therefore  in fulfilment of the aspirations of thepeoples we represent  it is important for us to work onreforming  developing and refining the United Nations as well as providing the firm political will to enhanceits performance and to face up to new challenges.There have been two decades of discussion andin-depth negotiation on the reform of the SecurityCouncil  focused mainly on the expansion of theCouncil’s membership  including how many membersare needed to achieve an equitable degree ofrepresentation  and on improving its working methods.The State of Kuwait reaffirms the need to reformthe Security Council to reflect the new internationalreality and to ensure that Arab and Islamic States arerepresented fairly  in conformity with their size  theircontributions and their role in advancing the purposesand principles of the Charter of the United Nations.I should like to quote from the statement deliveredby His Highness the Amir of the State of Kuwait at theSummit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperationheld in the Holy City of Mecca on 13 August:“The killing and destruction that we witness on adaily basis in sisterly Syria evokes grief and pain.Sadly  a child who has lost his parents and his home a mother mourning her nearest and dearest  citiesthat have turned into ghost towns owing to thehorrific destruction that has befallen them — thesehave become all too familiar sights. Such scenesredouble our responsibilities before the Almightyas well as before all our peoples. I call upon us tomove without delay to put an end to this bloodytragedy”.We would like to congratulate Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi Joint Special Representative of the United Nations andthe League of Arab States for Syria  on his appointment.Kuwait supports him in his undertaking and hisdetermination to continue the work of his predecessor Mr. Kofi Annan  which yielded the six-point plan thatwould have resulted in a peaceful resolution of the crisis had it been actively considered. We reaffirm Kuwait’scommitment to international efforts to reach a politicalsolution that fulfils the demands and aspirations ofthe Syrian people. We would also like to redouble ourefforts with the international community  to whichwe appeal for additional humanitarian assistance toalleviate the pain and suffering of the Syrian people both within and outside Syria.This November  the State of Kuwait will celebratethe fiftieth anniversary of the ratification of itsConstitution  which is regarded as the culminationof four centuries of political progress and growth.Inconsolidation the development of relations between rulerand ruled towards the effective practice of democracy  the Constitution is considered the beacon that guidesthe State of Kuwait  its Government and people towardsa dignified life by establishing rights and duties guaranteeing basic freedoms  outlining general policiesand regulating foreign relations without interference inthe internal affairs of other States. The Constitutionserves as an interpretation of Kuwait’s political vision based on its belief in  and pursuit of  peace  togetherwith its determination to develop and foster its relationswith neighbouring countries  in accordance with theprinciples of mutual respect and common interests.Relations between Kuwait and Iraq haveprogressed very positively  and the State of Kuwaitregards the painful wound of invasion as healed. Theparticipation of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-AhmadAl-Jaber Al-Sabah  Amir of the State of Kuwait in the Arab Summit held in Baghdad in March didmuch to bring about a qualitative leap forward in ourbilateral relations. Moreover  the visit to Kuwait byHis Excellency Mr. Nuri Kamel al-Maliki  PrimeMinister of Iraq  created an atmosphere of trust anddetermination that has helped to turn the page withrespect to commitments and relations between our twocountries. Subsequently  a second round of meetingsof the Joint Kuwait-Iraq Ministerial Committee wasconvened in Baghdad in April  reflecting the desire ofboth sides to turn away from the past.Important understandings reflecting the interestsof the our countries have been reached on someof the outstanding bilateral issues. There has beenagreement also on a work programme to accelerateIraq’s implementation of its remaining internationalobligations  in accordance with the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions  whereupon Iraq will have fulfilledits obligations under Chapter VII of the Charter of theUnited Nations and will be able to exercise its naturalrole regionally and internationally. That developmentwill help to improve the climate for achieving regionalsecurity and peace  which are prerequisites for theprosperity and progress of a region that has sufferedfrom wars and devastating conflicts for the past threedecades.On the regional level  the State of Kuwait renewsits call to the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran to takedeliberate and effective steps towards cooperatingwith international efforts aim at reaching a politicalsettlement with regard to its nuclear programme and at dispelling doubts surrounding its goals and purposes thereby averting further crises and conflicts  which unfortunately  have become associated with this vitalregion of the world. We hope that the Islamic Republicof Iran will be a positive and active party in the region exercising its role in accordance with the basic rulesand principles of mutual respect and common interests thereby creating a normal environment of cooperationthat will serve the peoples of the region  free frominterference in their internal affairs.Along the same lines  we also hope that the IslamicRepublic of Iran will cooperate and respond to theinitiatives intended to resolve the conflict over thethree occupied Emirati islands  in conformity with theprinciples and norms of international law.The continued Israeli occupation of Palestinianterritories testifies to the inability of the internationalcommunity to come up with solutions that will putan end to the plight of the Palestinian people. TheIsraeli Government  in gross violation of internationalconventions and norms  persists in its intransigence andillegal policies through its expansion of settlements inthe occupied Palestinian territory  as well as through itsblockade of the Gaza Strip. Those actions do not helpthe cause of the just and lasting peace we desire in theMiddle East. We therefore demand that the internationalcommunity  represented by the Security Council  putpressure on Israel and compel it to implement theresolutions of international legitimacy  the principle ofland for peace  the Quartet’s road map and the ArabPeace Initiative  so as to guarantee the establishment ofthe Palestinian State  with East Jerusalem as its capital and the total Israeli withdrawal from all Arab territoriesoccupied since 4 June 1967.Some States face special and chronic challenges thathave led to their marginalization on the internationalscene for many long years. They are at risk of becomingfailed States if the international community does notredouble its efforts to help them get back on theirfeet and start them on a path that will enable them tofunction normally and to become effective participantsin today’s world.In that regard  the State of Kuwait welcomes thedecisions and steps taken by President AbdrabuhMansour Hadi Mansour and the Yemeni Governmentto implement the Gulf Cooperation Council’s initiativeand its implementation mechanism  and to supportfinalization of the Initiative’s remaining items. Wealso reaffirm our confidence that Yemen  under an elected President and a Government of national unity is capable of achieving the development and progress invarious areas that the fraternal Yemeni people aspire to.We also reaffirm our continued backing and support forthe Yemeni Republic’s efforts to ensure political andeconomic stability.We would also like to congratulate thefraternal Republic of Somalia on the great historicaccomplishment represented by its ratification of aprovisional constitution and the election of Mr. HassanSheikh Mohamud as President. We hope that thesepositive developments will help lift Somalia from astate of conflict and national chaos to one governedby constitutional institutions  thus launching anew political future that will see the ambitions andaspirations of the fraternal Somali people fulfilled.We commend the positive reaction of the UnitedNations and the international community to the bloodyevents that the Muslim minority in Myanmar has beensubjected to  and hope that those efforts will help tostop the violence  preserve people’s legitimate rightsand enable peace to prevail.The President returned to the Chair.The peoples and Governments of Islamic countrieshave expressed their strong condemnation and outrageover the film denigrating the Prophet Muhammad God’s blessing and peace be upon him  and the Islamicfaith and its benevolent values. That irresponsible andimpudent act has ignited extreme rage among Muslimpeoples and communities all over the world  includingacts of violence  destruction  and killings in somecountries. While the State of Kuwait has denouncedthe film in the strongest possible terms  as well as thesubsequent killing and destruction  which are very farfrom the spirit and essence of Islam  in this context Iwould like to recall what His Highness Sheikh SabahAl-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah  Amir of the State ofKuwait  proposed at the General Assembly’s high-level meeting on the culture of peace  held on 12 and13 November 2008:“The best outcome to our well-intendedgathering in this Hall would be a joint internationalcommitment to respect all religions and to avoiddamaging  interfering with or ridiculing theirsymbols  while endeavouring to deter such acts andthose who advocate them.” (A/63/PV.46  p. 10) We urge the Assembly to give serious considerationat this session to the Amir’s proposal and adopt aresolution to implement it for the benefit of the wholeof humankind and to promote social peace and securityamong nations.Our world faces numerous environmental  economic social and security issues. Those issues are intertwinedand complex and the source of many challenges toStates and peoples  particularly in developing and least-developed countries. The consequences of the globalfinancial crisis  the rise in basic commodity prices  theclear negative impact of climate change  the growingfrequency of natural disasters and the intensificationof terrorism have put the focus on the ugly face ofpoverty and hunger  as well as the spread of epidemicsand communicable and dangerous diseases. Despite thenotable accomplishments of many States in their effortsto reach the Millennium Development Goals  we havenot yet achieved all the objectives we set ourselves asa whole. It is essential  therefore  that we pursue ourjoint efforts to limit the effects of the challenges weface and contain them in order to ensure our ultimatefull attainment of these noble goals.While the State of Kuwait is itself considered adeveloping country  since gaining independence in1961 it has embarked on a steady course in which weattach great importance to helping developing and least-developed countries. We do this through numerousmechanisms and initiatives  including the KuwaitFund for Arab Economic Development  which givesdevelopment aid to Arab  Asian and African countries as well as countries in Central and Latin America based on our belief in the importance of internationalcooperation and helping nations and peoples in need.Based on our desire to increase joint regional andinternational activities and enhance their effectiveness and in recognition of the fact that various forums heldaround the world have become major channels forexamining regional and economic cooperation andmaximizing the benefits derived from sharing States’successful experiences  in October last year Kuwaithosted the most recent meeting of the Asia CooperationDialogue (ACD)  held annually for the past 10 yearsat the level of Foreign Minister of the participatingcountries. Kuwait also called for the convening of thefirst Summit of the ACD countries  to be held in Kuwaiton 15 and 16 October. We hope that this meeting willgive leaders of Asian States the opportunity to discussevery topic of importance in the areas of economic  environmental and humanitarian affairs. In March2013 Kuwait will also host the Arab-African Summit which we hope will deepen Arab-African cooperationand open new horizons to serve stability  developmentand cooperation among the peoples of these two groupsof countries.In conclusion  I affirm the State of Kuwait’sallegiance to the multilateral international system andto the principles and purposes of the United NationsCharter. We also believe in the necessity for all Statesto abide by the obligations and responsibilities theyhave committed to in international agreements andconferences  thus contributing to finding just and fairsolutions to global threats and challenges.The State of Kuwait believes that dialogue and thepromotion of a culture of tolerance  moderation andrejection of violence and extremism are ideal meansfor advancing the values of equality and justice  inorder to reach our higher goal — the maintenance ofinternational peace and security."
"95",3943,"LAO",67,2012,"﻿At the outset  I would like to express my sincereappreciation to Mr. Vuk Jeremić upon his electionto serve as President of the General Assembly at itssixty-seventh session. It is my firm belief that  withhis extensive experience and constructive initiatives he will guide the Assembly towards achieving itsobjectives while serving the common interests of all itsmembers.May I also take this opportunity to extend myprofound congratulations to Mr. Nassir AbdulazizAl-Nasser  President of the General Assembly at itssixty-sixth session  on the successful discharge of hisduties.Likewise  I would like to commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for tirelessly leading UnitedNations efforts to meet its obligations and achieve itsobjectives  as well as working to improve the overallworking methods of the United Nations.Over the past two years  the internationalcommunity has encountered complex challenges inall areas. Regional political complexity and unrest especially in the Middle East  seem unlikely to beresolved any time soon. The use of violence in any form as seen in attacks on diplomatic compounds in Syria is unacceptable to us. In addition  the global economicand financial crisis affecting all parts of the world hasreached an alarming point  causing great concern forall nations  and even for the European Union — a majoreconomic force.Such crises have challenged the capacityand credibility of the existing global governancemechanisms designed by the international communityto address global challenges. This is a clear indicationthat our joint efforts and actions have not yet producedtangible outcomes.Negotiations on climate change have shown noprogress  although the Kyoto Protocol is expiring thisyear. Efforts to formulate an international instrumentto govern arms trade and prevent illegal trading which started some years ago  have also failed. Therehas also been little commitment on the part of thedeveloped countries to help the most vulnerable groups of countries: the least developed countries (LDCs) the landlocked developing countries (LLDCs)  and thesmall island developing States.In the light of the current situation  it is morecrucial than ever to strengthen the United Nations the only universal Organization  in order to increaseits effectiveness in addressing important global issues.To that end  all Member States should strive to extendtheir full support and cooperation to revitalize theUnited Nations  finding a harmonious balance betweennational and international interests in order to addressthe enormous global challenges in a timely and effectivemanner.In the current context  regional organizations haveplayed an increasingly important role in addressingthe global issues. In that connection  more and morecountries in the world now attach greater importance tothe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)and the ever-expanding ASEAN-initiated cooperationframeworks. ASEAN is entering a crucial stage inimplementing its leaders’ commitment to establishingan ASEAN community comprised of three pillars — apolitical-security community  an economic communityand a social-cultural community — by 2015. I firmlybelieve that  by utilizing its own resources combinedwith external support  especially from its dialoguepartners  ASEAN will be able to realize its ultimategoal of becoming a community that is politically stable economically integrated and socially and culturallyharmonious  thus contributing to the cause of peace andprosperity in the region and the world at large.As a member of the international community  theLao People’s Democratic Republic has done its utmostto fulfil its international obligations by pursuing apolicy of cooperation with other countries based on theprinciples of equality  mutual benefit  and respect forthe principles of national independence  sovereigntyand non-interference in each other’s internal affairs thus building an international environment conduciveto national development.Over the past year  despite numerous challenges the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has continued toenjoy political stability and social order. There has beengood progress in developing the national economy. Thathas laid a solid foundation for attaining the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015 and createdconditions conducive to the country’s graduation fromleast developed country status by 2020.Despite those achievements  the Lao People’sDemocratic Republic continues to face numerouschallenges and constraints. In addition to problemsresulting from the global and regional economic crises natural calamities and the remnants of war  suchas unexploded ordnance  continue to harm people’slives and pose major obstacles to national social andeconomic development  including the attainment ofthe MDGs. In that regard  we call upon all countries tobecome party to the Convention on Cluster Munitionswith a view to fully banning the use of such weapons.The Lao People’s Democratic Republic feelshonoured to be entrusted with hosting the 9th Asia-Europe Summit Meeting  which will be held on5 and 6 November in Vientiane  the capital of the LaoPeople’s Democratic Republic. That will provide agreat opportunity for the leaders of Asia and Europeto discuss and exchange their views on global issues ofmutual interest.The international community wishes to see therestoration of peace and stability in the Middle East.The conflict between Israel and Palestine will notbe resolved without the full implementation of therelevant Security Council resolutions supporting theestablishment of two States  Israel and Palestine  livingside by side in peace. The Lao People’s DemocraticRepublic reaffirms its support for the membership ofPalestine to the United Nations.The economic  financial and trade embargoimposed on the Republic of Cuba has long causedconsiderable hardship to the standard of living of theCuban people. That embargo must be unconditionallyand immediately lifted.Owing to their geographical locations  thelandlocked developing countries are among the mostvulnerable Members of the United Nations. The specialchallenges and major development obstacles they faceare the result of their great distance from world marketsand high transit transport costs  which impede theirnational sustainable development efforts. Each year  thelandlocked countries bear a heavy financial burden in theeffort to improve their transit transport infrastructurenetwork in order to ensure that their export products which constitute a crucial part of their national income have better access to world markets. Those problemsare compounded when their national economies areaffected by financial or social crises  natural disastersand climate change  inter alia. In addition  50 per cent of the LLDCs are also LDCs. I therefore urge theinternational community to devote greater attention andprovide assistance to that vulnerable group of countriesthrough full implementation of the Almaty Programmeof Action  as well as to play an active part in the 10-yearreview of the implementation of the Almaty Programmeof Action  to be held in 2014.The Lao People’s Democratic Republic reiteratesonce again its firm commitment and determinationto continue working closely with the internationalcommunity to build a peaceful world under a just andmore democratic new order  based on cooperation withall countries in tackling the various global challengesfacing us. I am convinced that only through firmdetermination will we be able to achieve the immediateand long-term development objectives and ensure thatthe world is secure  peaceful and prosperous."
"96",3986,"LBN",67,2012,"﻿At theoutset  allow me to congratulate Mr. Jeremić on hiselection as President of the General Assembly at itssixty-seventh session. I am confident that the Assembly’swork will be crowned with success  thanks to his richdiplomatic experience and expertise. I assure him ofLebanon’s full support in his efforts. I would also like tothank His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser President of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session for his tireless efforts and remarkable achievements. Ialso extend my gratitude to the Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his keen concernover critical global issues  especially those related tothe Middle East  in particular my country  Lebanon which was mentioned in his annual report (A/67/1).Lebanon  a founding State Member of the UnitedNations  reiterates its commitment to the nobleprinciples and human values that make up the foundingpillars of the Organization. Those standards enable itto act globally for justice  freedom  prosperity andpeace and to shoulder its responsibility to address theworld’s ongoing challenges. Those challenges test theinternational Organization’s credibility  efficiency status  and role in ensuring social freedom  politicalstability and economic independence for all peoples ofthe world  free from hegemony  polarization  fear anddouble standards.In the light of the major developments and changesthat have occurred since the Second World War  ithas become necessary to strengthen the role of theGeneral Assembly as a universal organ. That shouldpreclude the Security Council privileges  which arecurrently restricted to a limited number of countriesthat control crucial decisions  in particular thoserelated to war and peace. In that regard  in order toensure greater justice and democracy  the structure privileges and expansion of the Security Councilshould be reconsidered. The new global political economic and social realities should be taken intoaccount by extending the membership so as to enablesmaller countries to have greater representation. Thatwould fulfil the United Nations principles of equalityand justice among peoples.Our meeting today takes place at a time of majorglobal developments and changes  in particular forArab nations. Political reform had therefore becomeinevitable in order to achieve democracy and to lay thefoundations for freedom and respect for human rights.However  those legitimate demands can be attainedsolely through a peaceful transition and dialogue  notviolence and foreign intervention  which will leadonly to more chaos  injustice and division  increasingthe number of refugees and exacerbating relatedhumanitarian consequences. Therefore  with regardto the Syrian crisis  Lebanon reaffirms its policy ofdisassociation at the political and the security levels inorder to maintain its stability and balance of powers andin order to avoid unnecessary repercussions and risks.Lebanon has not refrained from providinghumanitarian support to the displaced Syrians inLebanon  in an effort to alleviate their suffering.However  Lebanon alone cannot deal with theincreasing number of displaced Syrians and theirhumanitarian needs. We have provided assistance  butthe number of displaced persons has risen and exceededour capacities. We can no longer absorb them on ourown. More assistance by relevant international bodiesis needed to help us in that regard.The security repercussions of the Syrian crisisthreaten civic peace and stability at the local leveland in the Middle East. The international communitymust make greater efforts to reach a political solutionbetween the parties in Syria  in order to put an end tothe violence that is claiming hundreds of innocent livesevery day.As we support the freedom and legitimate rightsof all people  we need to raise a crucial issue  namely the right of the fraternal Palestinian people to returnto their homeland and to establish an independentPalestinian State  with Jerusalem as its capital. Therecognition of the Palestinian State and its acceptanceas a full Member of this international Organization andits affiliated agencies should pave the way for a justpolitical solution to the Palestinian question and correctthe ongoing historical injustice that has been inf lictedon the Palestinian people since 1948.Lebanon is committed to maintaining stabilityand security in southern Lebanon  and we reaffirmour commitment to Security Council resolution 1701(2006). However  the continuous Israeli violations ofLebanese sovereignty by air  land and sea — in excessof 9 000 violations since 2006 — are limiting thefreedom of action of the United Nations Interim Forcein Lebanon (UNIFIL) and threatening the securityof its members  once again violating internationalresolutions  specifically resolution 1701 (2006).We appeal to the international community topressure Israel to respect international resolutionsand international law  to immediately withdraw fromoccupied North Ghajar  the Shaba’a farmlands and theKfar Shouba hills  and to bring to an end the continuousthreats to Lebanon’s security. Lebanon valuesUNIFIL’s role and its sacrifices  as well as its ongoingcooperation and coordination with the Lebanese army and we express our gratitude to all participating andsupporting countries.Lebanon calls for the full implementation ofresolution 66/192  of 22 December 2011  regarding theoil slick on its shores during the Israeli 2006 war onLebanon  and demands compensation  in application ofparagraph 4 of that resolution.We reiterate our commitment to defend ourexclusive economic area and our maritime borders asset by international law and in accordance with theUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which affirms our right to exploit our wealth andnatural resources.Lebanon  a vital crossroads of religions  beliefs cultures and civilizations  is a country committedto divine and human values. We are fully aware thatdiversity and difference are an integral part of life inour region and throughout the world. We reiterate ourcommitment to freedom of expression  tolerance anddialogue. In the words of Pope John Paul II  Lebanonis not merely a country  it is a message. We considerprejudice towards all religions and prophets a clearaggression against the dignity  values and feelings ofall believers  for it can only instigate conflict  violenceand reactions that we condemn and could never accept.No one could accept them.We therefore emphasize the importance andnecessity of dialogue between civilizations andcultures. Building trust and fostering rules of conductbinding on all are essential to end once and for all thedesecration of religious symbols  as well as to ensurerespect for people’s feelings and their freedom of belief.Such efforts can put an end to the extreme reactionsand condemnable practices that we have unfortunatelywitnessed recently in certain countries. Respect for religion does not restrict freedom of expression; rather it is a rational practice of such freedom.In that spirit  Lebanon has launched a nationaldialogue among the different Lebanese constituenciesbased on established national principles that wereagreed on and developed under the Baabda Declaration(A/66/849  annex)  which was welcomed by the SecurityCouncil. Dialogue is considered the best means forensuring stability in Lebanon.Lebanon is committed to peace and strives for itsachievement  especially in the Middle East  a region wewould like to be an oasis of peace  free of weapons ofmass destruction. In that regard  we should rememberthat Israel is the only country in the region to possessnuclear weapons and that it continues to refuse toratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons  a position that constitutes an ongoing threatto peace and security in the region and the world atlarge.We would like to emphasize once more the needfor a peaceful and diplomatic resolution of the Iraniannuclear issue  while stressing countries’ right to usenuclear power for peaceful purposes and avoidingdouble standards and selectivity  a problem that isfaced by many regions in the world and by our regionin particular. We also welcome ongoing internationalefforts to combat terrorism  the scourge of our time.The peace we strive for is founded on what isright  not a fait accompli peace. The justice we strivefor  especially in our region  is far removed from theselectivity and double standards that are  unfortunately the case globally  especially in the Middle East. Ourregion is still suffering from the consequences of theestablishment of the State of Israel  in 1948  and fromits ongoing occupation of Arab territories in completedisregard for international law and United Nationsresolutions.Peace  freedom and justice are the pillars forattaining both security and stability. They will pavethe way to the eradication of oppression  extremism hegemony and terrorism in our world. Stability cannotexist without a Palestinian spring  and a Palestinianspring can occur only through the full implementationof the Palestinians’ right to self-determination on theirland.The Arab world is witnessing one of the mostcritical periods of its modern history. We have reached a crossroads where societies must make choices thatwill translate their ambitions into reality. We thereforerequest the international community to draw up aserious economic  cultural and development roadmap to assist those countries in that newly reachedbreakthrough. Our young Arab societies are in need ofenlightenment and development that can be achievedonly by providing education and employment to put anend to ignorance and improve our living standards. Thatwill also certainly contribute to fighting extremism.We therefore suggest that countries step forwardwith their technical expertise while others offerfinancial assistance to draft a plan that could beimplemented through the framework of a new institutionto assist young men and women working in publicadministration to promote good governance  efficiencyand productivity in governmental agencies. Fromthat perspective  I propose to establish an institutionin Beirut that will soon be able to offer an integratedprogramme on good governance.As the Middle East is witnessing the most tumultousperiod of its history  we call on the internationalcommunity to perceive Lebanon as the beacon ofhope and message of freedom and pluralism that it is.Lebanon is not merely a small nation in need of shelterin a stormy region  and we are not asking for protectionto ensure our own survival. We are  rather  calling onthe Assembly to see us in the light of the role that wehave repeatedly played. Despite all the difficulties weare facing  our country  which is small geographicallybut large in its global presence  has proved itself to bethe epitome of a democratic  tolerant and pluralisticcountry among its neighbours.It is therefore the duty of the internationalcommunity to protect Lebanon  now and in the future from the turbulence of the region and to help us so thatwe may thrive  flourish and shine our rays all overthe Middle East. Only then will the United Nationsprovide our unstable region with a genuine source ofinspiration  a viable  vibrant nation  an example andmodel of civil and religious liberties  social diversityand political freedom.I call on all those here not to perceive Lebanon as aresponsibility but as an opportunity  an opportunity toprovide the safest and fastest path to all that the MiddleEast can be — democratic  peaceful and prosperous.Let us work to protect Lebanon from harm so we can maintain peace in the Middle East and the world as awhole."
"97",4032,"LBR",67,2012,"﻿I congratulate Mr. VukJeremić and the people of Serbia on his election tothe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I would like to assure him of Liberia’sfull cooperation and support as he carries out theresponsibilities entrusted to him in steering the affairsof this session. I would also like to pay tribute to hispredecessor  Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of theState of Qatar  for his capable stewardship of the affairsof the sixty-sixth session and the many bold initiatives undertaken in the interests of world peace during histenure.My highest commendation goes to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  who continues to demonstratesound leadership in the face of new and complicatedchallenges. He has begun his second term with renewedvigour and a clear articulation of the priorities thatrepresent the major concerns of the internationalcommunity.The selection of the theme for this session  whichcalls for the settlement of disputes by peaceful means could not have been more appropriate. When wereview the state of the world  we see an internationallandscape checkered with armed conflict  economiccrises and environmental degradation. For those whohave been through the painful experience of conflict including my own country  Liberia  this year’s themebecomes very pertinent. The cost of conflict in livesand infrastructural destruction makes us doublyappreciative of the value of preventive action inaverting conflict. The need for conflict preventiontakes on added urgency  because most conflicts areinternal  engendered by marginalization  inequity andinjustice. It becomes imperative  therefore  to identifyand remove those triggers of conflict before they causeexplosions.Our Government’s efforts to achieve the twinobjectives of conflict prevention and peace consolidationare being reinforced through our engagement with thepeacekeeping and peacebuilding architecture of theUnited Nations. In an environment of peace  we haveprioritized actions aimed at re-establishing the ruleof law by building the capacity of our institutionsand processes to deliver justice and security. We haveformulated a road map for national reconciliation toensure that peace is sustainable.Our development partners  including the UnitedNations and its specialized agencies  have remainedfaithful to our national agenda. They have supportedour priority programmes for women’s empowerment increased agricultural productivity and food security roads and infrastructure  and job creation. All the UnitedNations agencies must be supplied with the capacity toprovide support to Government programmes in thoseareas. That is particularly critical for the new genderentity  UN-Women  which is the youngest among themand whose viability must be assured. We have madestrong strides in gender equality  but much more mustbe done for girls’ education and women’s empowerment.Tremendous progress has also been made in health-caredelivery.We are particularly pleased by the recent UNICEFreport  which shows a sharp reduction in the level ofchild mortality. However  there are still many challengesto overcome before we can ensure universal access tohealth care.Many developing countries  such as Liberia  havestructured their economies around the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs). While some countrieshave made considerable progress in reaching some ofthe Goals  many others will be unable to achieve themby 2015. There is an emerging consensus that effortsmust be accelerated in order to achieve maximumprogress in reaching the MDGs over the next threeyears.I am honoured and humbled to have been selectedby the Secretary-General as one of the co-Chairs ofthe High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda. We are mindful of thedifficulty of our task  which requires us to propose aframework that builds on but goes beyond the MDGsin the establishment of goals that are ambitious butachievable. We know that the results of our work mustreflect the broad political consensus of the public andprivate sectors and civil society. We know that thedefined goals should enable all people in all countriesto be freed from the shackles of poverty throughsustainable development.Liberia remains fully committed to the ideals andpurposes of the United Nations. We believe that theOrganization should continue to occupy the centre ofglobal governance by leading efforts to meet our collectivechallenges to peace  security and development. To meetthat objective  the intergovernmental negotiations onSecurity Council reform need to come to an early andlogical conclusion. My Government is encouragedthat an increasing number of Member States supportthe enlargement of the Council in both the permanentand the non-permanent categories. That would ensurea fairer and more equitable participation  ref lective ofthe world demography. In that regard  Liberia supportsthe African common position  based on the EzulwiniConsensus adopted by the African Union.In the same vein  we must ensure that the GeneralAssembly is revitalized in order for it to fully assumeall the responsibilities entrusted to it under the Charter.It remains  after all  the most representative body of theUnited Nations.The high-level United Nations Conference on theArms Trade Treaty  which ended recently here in NewYork  sought to develop the highest possible internationalstandards for the trade in conventional weapons.However  strong national positions on that sensitiveglobal issue prevented an agreement on a binding armstrade treaty. Yet  nations of goodwill and countries likeLiberia that have experienced devastation from theillicit trade in and diversion of conventional weaponsmust continue our strong advocacy  taking into accountthe full range of differences and disagreements. Wewould therefore encourage bilateral consensus-buildingahead of a new round of negotiations. At the same time we are convinced that the final draft text of the armstrade treaty  though imperfect and incomplete  containsessential elements  upon which future negotiations cansucceed.We express our deep condolences on the death ofthe United States Ambassador and staff and the Libyannationals in the attack on the United States consulatein Benghazi. All nations should be concerned aboutthe spreading of violence in reaction to a film thatdemonstrates unacceptable insensitivity to the Islamicfaith. Even in such circumstances  we must all bemindful that democracy requires freedom — freedomof ideas  freedom of association  freedom of religionand  more important  freedom of expression. Thatoften results in statements and actions that may offend.Tolerance  not violence  is the appropriate response toprevent further violence. Liberia is a clear example where  were it not for our own tolerance of our new-found freedom of expression  our country would beback in chaos.While the majority of the countries in oursubregion are consolidating economic and socialgains  underpinned by democratic processes  someare  regrettably  still dogged by serious challengesthat risk undermining the peace and progress of theentire region. We in Liberia  like many other countriesin the region and the world at large  were particularlyappalled by the unconstitutional unravelling of thedemocratic Governments in Mali and Guinea-Bissau inthe early part of this year. We unequivocally condemnsuch attempts to seize power through unconstitutionalmeans.Accordingly  Liberia endorses the decisions ofthe Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS)  which sought the full restoration ofconstitutional order in both countries in the shortesttime. Liberia enjoins the world community  particularlythe Security Council  to buttress the efforts of ECOWASin restoring peace in our region  most especially inMali.As the current Chair of the four-nation Mano RiverUnion  comprising Liberia  Sierra Leone  Guinea andCôte d’Ivoire  Liberia has committed itself to neverallowing an inch of its territory to be used in orderto destabilize its neighbours. In that context  wecategorically condemn all attempts to undermine thepeace and democratic gains in Côte d’Ivoire and areworking closely with the Ivorian authorities and theUnited Nations peacekeeping bodies in both Liberiaand Côte d’Ivoire to protect and consolidate the peace inour two countries. We call on all countries in our regionto work in concert so that those intent on destabilizingsome parts of our region are treated as enemies in allparts of it.We are all part of a rapidly changing world in whichthe forces of globalization cannot be reversed. Ourfarming systems must adjust to the unusual weatherconditions. The places where we live and work willneed  in some cases  to be relocated from traditionalsafe areas. Our societies must also find responses to thedistractions resulting from the demonstration effect.Developing countries  such as my own  must makeglobalization work if we are to achieve our growthtargets and lift our people out of poverty. That meansgreater commitment and effort on our part to create anenvironment that ensures economic growth based onmutual benefits and responsibilities.Since its founding  Liberia has been a complexnation  and the divisions that led to decades of war stillrun deep.Our experience clearly shows that success has itspitfalls. Displaced citizens returning from refugeecamps in the subregion and deportees from around theworld swell the ranks of the desperate unemployed thereby intensifying our vulnerability. Communitieslong deprived of basic services demand instant attentionto their individual needs  thereby straining our capacity.Civil servants lacking a decent wage for two decadesrightfully clamour for raises  thereby undermining thebudgetary process.As Liberia moves towards its tenth year ofsustained peace  we can say with conviction that ourcountry has turned the corner. Liberia is no longer aplace of conflict  war and deprivation. We are no longerthe country our citizens f led  our international partnerspitied and our neighbours feared. Our stabilizationefforts over the past six years have resulted in averageannual growth of over 6 per cent  major foreigninvestment  expanded fiscal space and unprecedenteddebt cancellation. More important  we have earned ourrightful place on an irreversible path to sustained peace growth and development. Our Vision 2030  resultingfrom a robust nationwide consultation  is a long-term programme for transformation that prioritizesyouth development  infrastructure  reconciliation andcapacity development.Yet  our Government is keenly aware of thechallenges to be faced over the next three years.United Nations peacekeeping forces are graduallybeing withdrawn from Liberia. In our discussionswith various United Nations teams that have come toLiberia — the technical assessment mission in Marchand the Security Council delegation in May — wehave emphasized the need for a responsible transition through a gradual process occurring over a periodof three to five years. We also seek the alignment oftransitional activities with our budget cycle  reflectingGovernment priorities.We wish to express our appreciation to the UnitedNations  which has been a very committed and effectivepartner. We owe the Organization much gratitude forpreserving an enabling environment for peacebuildingand State-building.In conclusion  I wish to note that today  for the firsttime in two generations  Liberia has a second successivedemocratic Government elected by the will of thepeople. Despite the distractions  local and external  ourpeople are determined to take their destiny into theirown hands  and determined that our ambitious goal ofmaking Liberia a middle-income country by the year2030 will be achieved."
"98",4077,"LBY",67,2012,"﻿At the outset  I ampleased to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his electionas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I would like to commend Mr. NassirAbdulaziz Al-Nasser for his leadership as Presidentat the sixty-sixth session. I also wish to express ourprofound gratitude and appreciation to His ExcellencySecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his valuable effortsto achieve the purposes and principles of the Charter ofthe United Nations.Three years ago  a despot who ruled my country for42 years with tyranny and oppression stood at this veryrostrum and tore up a copy of the Charter  saying that hedid not recognize the authority of the document. Today I am standing on the very same rostrum to assure theAssembly of my delegation’s support and respect forthe Charter.Today  I stand before the Assembly and the wholeworld to apologize for all the harm and the crimescommitted by that despot against so many innocentpeople  as well as to apologize for the extortion andterrorism he inf licted on so many States. I want toassure the Organization that the Libyan people aredetermined to build a State that respects its neighbours its international obligations and human rights  and thatbelieves that genuine peace in the world will not berealized unless the conscience of every individual isbrimming with peace. Libya will be a land of peace andsecurity and a strong force for peace.I am speaking today before this internationalgathering to convey the greetings of the Libyanpeople  whose revolt on 17 February 2011 turned intoa comprehensive  explosive revolution that shook thevery foundations of the regime of the despot MuammarAl-Qadhafi  who declared that he would burn anddestroy Libya and make it swim in a sea of blood. Hekilled thousands of civilians  recruited mercenariesfrom everywhere  assaulted peoples’ honour  ordered hismilitias and mercenaries to rape minors  and destroyedcities. However  our people did not kneel; they did notback down. Thousands of martyrs were lost among thewounded and missing. The price of freedom was paid inblood  lives  amputated limbs and lost youth.In this forum  on behalf of the Libyan people  Isalute the United Nations system  which stood with ourpeople  with the will of freedom against blood lust andannihilation  and adopted Security Council resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011) to protect the innocentpeople in Libya from crimes against humanity andviolations of human rights.I stand before the Assembly today representingthe Libyan people  who are building the institutionsof democracy after the fall of dictatorship. The wholeworld has witnessed the first free  transparent electionsin Libya  when the General National Congress waselected and I was honoured to be elected as its President.The world  through the United Nations  has given uscomplete  genuine support for that achievement.In our revolution of freedom and in the challengeof establishing democracy  the conscience of the worldwas with us  both in deeds and in thoughts. Support wasoffered from everybody and from everywhere.Among those offering help was Ambassador ChrisStevens  a voice of reason and conscience  a man oflove and a messenger of friendship  who came to Libyaafter the outbreak of the revolution for freedom. Hetouched people’s emotions in Benghazi and travelledfrom Tripoli to the western mountains and back andall across Libya. Chris Stevens spoke with everyonein Arabic; he always smiled and showed the utmostconcern. This humane diplomat has found his place inthe consciousness and emotions of the Libyan people.It was a day of sadness throughout Libya when he wasassassinated  along with three of his aides. We wouldlike to express our deepest condolences to the friendlyAmerican people for the grave loss. It was a loss forLibya as it was a loss for the United States of America.We assure the Government and the people of theUnited States that this tragedy will only increase oursolidarity to entrench the hopes and objectives inwhich Ambassador Chris Stevens believed. We willdefeat the schemes of the backward terrorists  whodo not represent Libya or Islam. Islam is a religion oftolerance  peace and love. As President Obama saidfrom this rostrum two days ago  “our future will bedetermined by people like Chris Stevens  and not byhis killers” (A/67/PV.6  p.11).In that context  I would like to express mycondolences to the Libyan people  particularly thepeople of Misrata  on the death of Imran Juma Shaban who joined the long list of martyrs some five days ago.I would like to express our profound appreciationfor the understanding shown by the United StatesAdministration following that incident  and to assure it that my country is determined to pursue the perpetratorsand bring them to justice. We will spare no effort tostrengthen the necessary protection for the diplomaticand consular missions and all guests and ensure thesafety of their staff and facilities. That tragic incidentdoes not at all represent the feelings of the Libyanpeople  who are known for their moderation  hospitalityand gratitude. Perhaps the massive demonstrationscondemning that abominable crime that took place inBenghazi and other Libyan cities best represent thegenuine feelings of the Libyan people and their totalrejection of all forms of violence and extremism.Libya will never become an incubator for radicalextremist groups and will remain a peaceful Muslimcountry where moderation prevails. The new Libyawill be based on democracy  openness  transparency combating corruption and empowering women andyouth. The new Libya will be by  and for  one and all.Meanwhile  it would be remiss of me not tocondemn the campaigns against Islam and to defamethe Prophet Muhammad. Such campaigns foment hatredand aim to provoke tensions among civilizations. Theygo beyond the concept of freedom of expression andopinion and require that the General Assembly adopta legal document to criminalize the defamation of allreligious symbols and figures. We Muslims have anabsolute belief in the unity of humankind and solidarityamong all human beings. We express our support forthe dialogue among religions and for cooperation tolerance and eternal humanitarianumanitarian valuesand ideals. My country therefore supports all effortscarried out within the framework of the dialogue amongcivilizations  cultures and religions under the UnitedNations and relevant international organizations.Since the revolution of 17 of February 2011  Libyahas witnessed many changes due to the uprising of itspeople against social injustice and political tyranny. Ithas not only achieved a change of the tyrant regime buthas progressed towards a genuine democratic regimebased on respect for and promotion of human rights political pluralism and peaceful transfer of power  aswell as on commitment to the principles and provisionsof international law and the Charter of the UnitedNations.The Assembly may have followed the sequentialpolitical developments that Libya experienced duringthe past few months along the path to democratization.Those include the rebuilding of State institutions; the election of the General National Congress  whichwill  through a constituent committee  draft Libya’spermanent constitution; and the formation of thefirst interim Government following elections thatwere commended by international observers as fair democratic and transparent.We shall work to rebuild  reorganize and reformState institutions  primarily the police  the national armyand the judiciary. Various programmes and plans arebeing implemented towards disarming  demobilizingand reintegrating the former revolutionaries withinthe ministries of defense and interior and other Stateinstitutions.For the first time since independence  politicalparties have emerged on the political stage  as havefreedom of the press and expression  unconditionalfreedom to demonstrate  freedom of assembly andfreedom to establish civil institutions  trade unions andintellectual  political and social organizations withoutrestrictions. That has led to free dialogue and the activeparticipation of all segments of the people throughoutthe country.For four decades  the former regime f lagrantlyviolated human rights through torture  detentionwithout trial  extrajudicial killing  forced disappearanceand ill-treatment of citizens and violations of theirdignity. The outbreak of the 17 February revolutionin the form of peaceful protest was confronted by thesecurity brigades of the former regime with bullets andbrutal repression  in f lagrant violation of internationalhumanitarian law and human rights law.The Human Rights Council decided to suspendLibya’s membership in the Council and formed aninternational fact-finding committee that voicedthe condemnation of the international communityof such violations. The Council certified violationsof human rights by the regime’s forces and by somerevolutionaries  which has required the new Libyanauthorities to give the human rights file particularattention and to take many specific measures.Some may wonder whether the Arab Spring wasworthy of support. To them I say  would it have beenbetter for the corrupt  dictatorial regimes to continuefor decades more with their practices of tyranny oppression  injustice  arbitrary treatment  corruption exploitation  and violations of the most basic humanrights? Should they have been allowed to continuepillaging the wealth of their peoples  pushing some of the oppressed towards extremism or a certain agendaincompatible with peace and security  an agenda thatpromoted violence and terror to achieve its objectives?Democracy did not prevail in France a year  or evena decade  after the French Revolution. That pattern hasbeen repeated in other States that have gained theirfreedom. A period of liberation was followed by stagesof instability and a sometimes long and bloody civilwar before those States were able to achieve stabilityand security and to build their democratic institutions.At the current stage of building the new Libya  weare facing extremely serious challenges that threatennational and regional security. Some are a result ofillegal activities by the sons of Al-Qadhafi and certainelements of the former regime who are being soughtto face justice but have unfortunately found refuge inneighbouring countries and some other countries fromwhere they carry out criminal activities that threatensecurity and stability in Libya.But we in Libya also face other securitythreats — trafficking in drugs and psychotropicsubstances  illegal immigration and smuggling andtrafficking of weapons. As the Assembly knows  thenature and scope of such threats to national and bordersecurity require a bilateral and multilateral response thatpromotes and strengthens national efforts. Therefore last March my country hosted the Regional MinisterialConference on Border Security in the North Africanand Sahelian Region  which resulted in the adoptionof the Tripoli plan of action. The plan establishescommon mechanisms and structures for cooperationand exchange of information  consultations  experienceand communications on border security.Among our national priorities is Libya’s rightto restitution of moneys that were pillaged from theState treasury and secreted outside the country. Thosefunds have been used to finance criminal activitiesand operations in order to destabilize the country andthreaten its national security. That has had an impactupon neighbouring countries as well. We therefore callon all our friends and on States to allow us to recoverLibyan moneys  investments and property located inother countries  particularly in some countries in Africa Latin America and Asia  where those funds have beensubject to coercive measures by some Governments.In that context  we call upon all States of theworld to cooperate in combating corruption andmoney laundering. We call upon financial institutions  particularly those located in Western countries andsome island States  to shoulder their responsibilitiesand not accept suspicious funds  particularly fromThird World dictators who are bleeding the wealth oftheir peoples and hiding those funds under fictitiouscompany names.In March 2010  Global Financial Integrity issueda report estimating that the gross offshore depositswere $10 trillion. We look forward to the signing andratification of an anti-corruption convention by 130States. We believe that that would promote cooperationamong States to combat corruption and bring about therestitution of stolen funds.I would now like to pay tribute to the greatcontribution made by the United Nations SupportMission in Libya  previously headed by Mr. Ian Martin despite the many challenges and difficulties that werenatural and to be expected in the transitional phase.We also welcome the appointment of Mr. Tarek Mitrias the new head of the Mission. We wish him everysuccess and look forward to further cooperation. Weare committed to providing all the necessary assistanceto him and the Mission.The new Libya undertakes to respect all of itscommitments contained in the international instrumentsand covenants on disarmament and the maintenanceof international peace and security. We are fullyprepared to cooperate transparently and sincerely withthe international community to support efforts  bothregional and international  to implement the provisionsof international conventions and protocols and tocreate an international environment that would fosterprogress towards definitively eliminating weapons ofmass destruction. We are also determined to reviewall other international instruments to which we are notyet party and take the appropriate decisions thereon assoon as the permanent constitution is adopted and aGovernment and parliament are elected.We condemn Israel’s measures designed to Judaizeoccupied lands and its violations of human rights andinternational humanitarian law. The internationalcommunity must assume its responsibilities by takingstrong  urgent measures to put an end to Israeliaggression and ensure the full protection of Palestinians.It must come up with a radical solution to the questionof Palestine through a just and lasting settlement thatincludes Israel’s withdrawal from all occupied landsand the return of all Palestinian refugees to their homes  as well as the establishment of the independent Stateof Palestine with Al-Quds as its capital  in accordancewith the relevant international resolutions.The suffering of the brotherly Syrian peopleis unimaginable. The regime in power is violentlyrepressing its citizens  shedding their blood andattacking their dignity  and has thus lost its legitimacy.In order to put an end to such a tragedy  Libya urgesthe Security Council to act promptly  in accordancewith the principle of the responsibility to protect to take immediate action to end all forms of murder violence and destruction  find a way out of the crisisthrough a peaceful transition of power  and fulfil thelegitimate demands of the Syrian people. This can beachieved only through consensus among members ofthe Security Council and support for the efforts of theJoint Special Representative of the United Nations andthe League of Arab States  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi.Libya condemns the social and political injustice harassment and killings being inf licted on the Muslimminority in Myanmar on the basis of ethnicity andreligion. That is a f lagrant violation of human rightsand constitutes crimes against humanity. We call onall relevant human rights institutions to immediatelyintervene and put an end to the tragedy. We underlinethe necessity of forming an international committee ofinquiry to identify those responsible for such violenceand killings  bring the perpetrators to justice andensure that victims are duly compensated and refugeesreturned safely to their homes.States Members of the United Nations haveconvened every year at the General Assembly ever sincethe Organization was established in order to reflecton the purposes and principles set out in its Charter.We have achieved much  but many challenges remain such as reforming the United Nations  eliminatingweapons of mass destruction  reducing poverty ignorance and disease and wars and armed conflicts fighting terrorism and organized crime  protectingthe environment  achieving sustainable development respecting human rights  in particular the rights ofwomen  and ensuring the rule of law and combatingracism  hatred and fanaticism.Libya wishes to stress its affi nity with Africa and theimportance of shifting its policies towards  and relationswith  Africa and the world — which were once basedon personal whims and acts of extortion — to policiesand relations firmly grounded in the best interests of all peoples. The new Libya dissociates itself from therepugnant past and extends its hands in freedom andfriendship to build new relationships based on mutualrespect and fruitful cooperation.In conclusion  let me wish the General Assemblyat its sixty-seventh session full success in solving theissues on its agenda. I express the hope that a spirit ofsolidarity and cooperation will prevail so that we maycreate a better world  one blessed with security andstability."
"99",4110,"LCA",67,2012,"﻿I would first like tocongratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at this year’ssession. I also wish to place on record Saint Lucia’sthanks to Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for hiscontribution as President of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session.I would like to underscore the words of thePresident  of which we should be continually reminded concerning the fact that peace is not merely the absenceof war. Indeed  poverty and prejudice are the flint and tinder for violent feud and furore. And so we embraceyour suggested theme  for while in the Caribbean wegenerally know peace  we are aware of the real struggleof humankind to achieve peace in the face of disaster injustice  inequity and conflict.Beyond this Hall lies a beautiful world. Andwhatever the f laws and failures of mankind  we stillare blessed to be given a world from which we can seeklife and livelihoods. It is difficult to imagine at timesthat even in the face of turmoil  decimation and actsof brutality and calamity  humankind has progressedover the millennia. That is what must give us hope andconfidence for the future: that we have been throughthis before and have come through colossal tragedies unexplainable disasters  world wars and famine  andstill we are here. Our civilization continues to thrive.However  we can only succeed if we recognize andcelebrate our shared humanity. This  therefore  mustbe a world that continuously affirms all human lives a world that recognizes our collective endowment  thatcelebrates our ingenuity and our enterprise. A world  asis said in southern Africa  that is imbued with ubuntu.Each year for the past seven decades  we have sathere as equals  everyone with a voice  everyone with asay. Our size  whether defined by geography  populationor both  has no relevance  albeit only temporarily forthe purposes of this discourse and dialogue. And evenwhile some have sat here longer  we can all embrace acommonality that is not transient or mutable. But evenso  we can at times forget that behind every country’srepresentative are real people with real lives  who seekcherished moments despite their sea of despair.And let there be no doubt that  even when ourleaders come here to speak  we will have  in all ourown countries  differences of opinion  of philosophy of faith. Yet despite all this  the beauty of democracyis that we can embrace a common pursuit: the pursuitof happiness  prosperity and enjoyment of life. Ourphilosophies should therefore never destroy thatpursuit; they should affirm it. Our faiths should nevertear this apart  they should form and fashion souls ofcompassion  understanding and tolerance.For our ancestors  from Africa to Asia  from theArctic to the Amazon  all knew conflict and what it costin their lives. We know what it costs humankind rightnow. And we should all know that history has repeatedlyshown us that warfare is not the best way to solve ourproblems. So then do we ignore the bombs and guns if they are not heard on our streets  in our cities and parksand playgrounds? Should the girl in Aleppo or Benghazinot be able to share the same opportunities and dreamsand hopes as a boy in Arlington or Birmingham?No one expects a naive world  with utopian leaders.Nor do we suggest that our world will not have conflict for disagreement is inevitable in all aspects of life.However  I ask that we have the courage to be boldabout the world we want. I ask that we act when weknow we can. I ask that those leaders who hold the seatsof higher authority always remember the minorities those who are easily forgotten  easily marginalized easily wiped out. There should never be a season forinjustice  never a season for corruption  never a seasonfor poverty  never a season for brutality and never aseason for torment.Saint Lucia therefore welcomes a peacefulresolution to the conflict in the Syrian Republic andan immediate end to what is clearly carnage  a humantragedy. We continue to support the efforts of theSpecial Envoy and the Secretary-General in this body’sefforts to induce the parties to focus on coming to thetable for negotiations  with a view to finding a pathtowards a resolution of the conflict that is acceptableto the majority of the people of Syria and takes intoaccount the necessity of ensuring the welfare andinterest of minorities in that State.We are  of course  also very concerned aboutthe resort to violence in the Middle East  aimed atconfronting either religious or ideological contentions.We condemn all attempts at disparagement of religiousprophets  deities  symbols or practices  and we appealfor tolerance and understanding. In the same vein  wedeplore the brutal murder in Libya of the Ambassadorof the United States  and we share that country’s painand anguish. Religious intolerance is combustible anddangerous and ensnares even those nations far from thetheatres of conflict.Saint Lucia is very conscious of the activeattempts in the Middle East to develop new systemsof governance  as recent systems appear  in somecountries  to have outlived their usefulness for themajority of their citizens. Apart from our commitmentto global and regional peace  we must also recognizethat turbulence in the Middle East has the undoubtedeffect of distorting the price of the dominant globalcommodity  oil  and that those distortions harm theinterests and development processes of large and smallcountries alike. The world desperately needs a peacefulMiddle East. We express our hope for the continuedevolution of peaceful and consensus approaches toissues of governance in that area.Saint Lucia believes that all efforts to promotepeace and prosperity for everyone  while of courseprotecting the health of our planet  should be embraced.The Government of Saint Lucia is well aware of thedetermination of the Chinese people to unify theircountry  as signalled to the world when China took itsrightful place in the United Nations. In that context Saint Lucia welcomes the emerging dialogue andcooperation between the People’s Republic of Chinaand the Republic of China on Taiwan. Such cross-straitdialogue and cooperation will surely facilitate globalharmony. We look forward to a continued evolution ofthe ongoing peaceful rapprochement among the Chinesepeople as they search to unify their civilization.Saint Lucia also wishes to support the calls forAfrica to gain its rightful permanent representation onthe Security Council  as supported by the Presidentsof Mali and South Africa. As we recognize the perilsof conflict and warfare in Africa so too should werecognize the ability of Africa to bring peace to itself.The voice of one billion people and that of an entirecontinent should no longer go unheard.Saint Lucia welcomes the resolution of thelongstanding dispute in the Sudan  the achievement ofself-determination for the new State of South Sudanand its introduction into the community of nations. Itis pleasing that that process has occurred in a contextin which the States of the African continent havenow themselves been creating new spaces in a bid totake advantage of the development of the continent’sresources in a changing economic environment.We cannot have global collaboration andcooperation  and start anew unless extreme disparitiesare reduced or eliminated. So it is necessary todetermine the causes and respond purposefully intackling the inequities that exist in the world. Whileone of the obvious building blocks for development isthat of good governance — political structures that areethical and not fuelled by greed and abuse — and whilewe can strengthen the rule of law  ensure property rightsand hold fair elections  those measures by themselvesdo not and cannot secure democracy. While democracyhas no place for dictators or demigods  it is still rathermeaningless to a person with no food on the table. The dispossessed will have no passion and no will. Thedepressed will not vote  nor will the downtrodden.We cannot continue to ignore the age-old injusticesof slavery  of forcing people into labour and ofdecimating their culture and identity. Many of us heretoday are the descendants of the survivors of slavery. Asa part of that recognition  we support the Governmentof Jamaica in calls for the recognition of the impactsof the transatlantic slave trade and the need for a frankdialogue on the status of people of African descent.Furthermore  like Africa  we all need the opportunityto trade equally and fairly. We all know that the deathof the Doha talks was due to the unwillingness of somenations to relent on large-scale subsidies on farmingand agriculture.One of the injustices that is a relic of an era offear and dispute long gone is the embargo imposedupon the people of Cuba  purely for purposes ofpolitical retribution and punishment. I must take thisopportunity to reiterate the conclusion of the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM) as a whole  most recentlyin December 2011  that it is time to end the embargoimposed on the Republic of Cuba by the United States.Saint Lucia is part of the Group of Latin Americanand Caribbean States and wishes to pursue the fullestmeasure of economic integration in the hemisphere as an instrument of our own economic growth and inorder to maximize economic and social cooperation inthe area. Blockades and embargoes  in that context  areanachronistic and outmoded. In an era of globalizationand economic liberalization they cannot be tolerated orjustified.Another relic of colonialism is that of our CaribbeanCommunity member  Haiti. The suffering of the peopleof Haiti can only be matched by their perseverance. It isa country that was tormented into paying compensationsto its former colonial master. That was an extraordinaryand crude example of trade loss. Today the world’s firstblack independent country is the Western hemisphere’spoorest nation. It is still very much deserving of thesupport of the United Nations in overcoming its recentpains and indigence brought on by the earthquake of12 January 2010. It should not be forgotten. Haiti is amember of the CARICOM family of nations  and so wepay due respect and regard to those countries in ourhemisphere that came to the support and assistance ofHaiti in its hour of need.We in the Caribbean continue to experience thechallenge of our skilled population seeking to settle inregions to the north  where they are generally greetedwith open arms. Meanwhile  we also have to contendwith the reverse f low of guns which  owing to thenarcotics trade  is finding its way into our jurisdictions.We cannot have internal peace in our islands if ouryoung people are too easily being given guns. Weraised the matter as one of great concern to our securityat the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena  Colombia in April this year.It is now clear that the current policies to combatthe consumption and trafficking of illicit drugs acrossand within borders have failed  creating yet anotherhuman tragedy of immense consequence. Lives arebeing lost either to guns or to the consumption of drugs.We remain resolute in wanting the whole matter of thedrug trade to be reviewed. Collectively  we must craftnew solutions to this problem. We also wish to placeon record our continued concern about the practice ofdeporting seasoned criminals back to our small States without any regard for the capacity of our internalsecurity arrangements.In all this there is a sobering reality for the leaderof any small State like Saint Lucia. Even as I have thedistinction of standing here today  I know that many ofthe decisions that affect our world and my country arestill made in the capitals of other countries  sometimesunilaterally and sometimes multilaterally by groups of5 or 8 or 20 or 30. It is said that 80 per cent of theworld’s trade and economic activity is accounted for by20 countries. I can assure everyone that Saint Lucia indeed all of the Caribbean Basin  lies beyond the limitsof that geopolitical circle. With few or no resources diplomatic or otherwise  Saint Lucia can only speakwith its moral courage  authority and convictions.Small islands are special places with specialpeculiarities that make us both unique and vulnerable.Still  we know that  if there is a willingness to supporttheir growth and development  then small islandscan be success stories. Consider for instance that our15-member Caribbean Community has a combinedpopulation of 17 million and an economy of about$89 billion. The United States territory of Puerto Rico itself part of the greater Caribbean  has a gross domesticproduct of about $100 billion. Those numbers clearlysuggest that  given support in trade and investment though we may be small  our economies could grow.They could find sustainability.The Caribbean Community has continuously madethe point that many small States are deceptively classedas middle-income merely on the basis of per capitaincome. A country the size of Saint Lucia  with thevulnerabilities that we face  should not be subjected tosuch a measuring tool for determining whether a Statecan stand on its own.For instance  Saint Lucia experienced a category 2hurricane in 2010 that caused damage totalling nearly30 per cent of our gross domestic product. As in thecase of other small States like ours  we were thenforced to become even more indebted as we borrowedto replace infrastructure  such as arterial roads andbridges  without which our country’s economy wouldhave faced further contraction. On top of that  we werefurther impacted by unilateral domestic measureswhich  showing insensitivity to such matters as ourdependence on tourism  some major developed Statesimplemented  making us an even less desirable touristdestination.Other islands that are highly dependent oninternational financial services are now suffering asa result of the attempts by some States to sully theirreputations. Though we live in a beautiful part ofthe world  the reduction of foreign direct investmentf lows due to the global economic crisis  and the recentannouncement by the World Trade Organization that ithas cut its forecast for global trade growth from 3.7 percent to 2.5 per cent  can cause the outlook to look grim.This means that development cannot be just aboutassistance and that small States require there to besome fairness and balance in the world economic space.From the point of view of the developing countries  thecollapse of the Doha Round was a disappointing portentof the difficult times to come in the discussions betweendeveloped and developing countries. This trend wastypified in our hemisphere by the lack of progress in theinitiative for a free trade area of the Americas. At thesame time  however  there were increasing indicationsof the emergence of countries in Asia  Africa and theFar East as competitors in global economic competition.We look to a future in which the United Nationsand other global institutions become more targeted anddifferentiated in their interventions and policies. Welook to a world in which the Millennium DevelopmentGoals are realized and in which the internationalcommunity crafts a new post-2015 strategy to tackle the major impediments to growth as well as to promotethe major creators of wealth and prosperity.A major issue is  of course  climate change. Asexpressed in the Mauritius Strategy for the FurtherImplementation of the Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates and in the Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States held inBarbados in 1994  small States are committed to seeingaction taken on climate change and tangible support forthe requisite adaptations and interventions needed at alllevels.Within the Caribbean Community  the LiliendaalDeclaration issued by Heads of Government in 2009encapsulated our concerns as small island States subjectto major dislocation as a consequence of the threat ofclimate change. It notes that“[the region’s] efforts to promote sustainabledevelopment and to achieve the internationallyagreed development goals  including theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs)  areunder severe threat from the devastating effects ofclimate change and sea-level rise.”In particular  it notes the “increasingly frequent andintense extreme weather events” that have resultedin severe damage to the region’s resources andsocio-economic base  and it emphasizes that“dangerous climate change is already occurring inall Small Islands and Low-lying Coastal DevelopingStates (SIDS) regions  including the Caribbean  andthat many SIDS will cease to exist without urgent ambitious and decisive action by the internationalcommunity”.Saint Lucia is therefore in full support of theconclusions of the United Nations Conference onSustainable Development in Brazil on the challenges andpotential solutions to the climate crisis and interrelatedfactors  which continue to inhibit the achievement of asustainable world capable of facilitating the activities ofall countries  large and small. We are comforted by thewords of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that we willsecure a legally binding agreement to tackle climatechange by 2015. With climate change  we cannot affordany unfinished business  for there is but one world. Wealso hope that there will be a strong commitment totechnology transfer and building local human capacityto deal with climate change and attendant disasters.  Saint Lucia looks forward to the President’s tenurein directing the work of the sixty-seventh session ofthe General Assembly as one in which the upsurge ofconflicts now characterizing our globe will be subjectedto meaningful deliberations among our Member States.Our concern as small countries is that persistentconflicts in respect of issues and problems currentlyplaguing various regions of the globe can serve todistract our United Nations from devoting both attentionand resources to persisting with solutions to the seriousproblems of economic transition and adjustment nowcharacterizing international economic relations inparticular. In the cacophony of regional conflicts thatinevitably draw the attention and involvement of themajor Powers  the problem of the survival of smallcountries in the environment of larger States hasbecome more and more intractable.We in Saint Lucia  as members of the CaribbeanCommunity  look forward to an enhanced cooperationwith the countries of a continent in which a largeproportion of our population finds its ancestry. Webelieve that it is possible to pursue this process throughthe United Nations development institutions in oursphere and on the African continent  and we proposethat this be done.As is now well known  the traditional economicrelations under the auspices of the Commonwealthsystem and the African  Pacific and Caribbeaninstitutional relationships in the context of our tradewith Europe are diminishing. We look forward to newavenues of relationships  a task in which the UnitedNations can be of great assistance to us.I wish to extend to the President the best wishesand support of my country and delegation for successin his task over the coming year."
"100",4137,"LIE",67,2012,"﻿We are conveningin this Assembly at a time when we are witnessing aworrisome phenomenon  namely  senseless violencespreading through an entire region as a result of asenseless offence to religious feelings. More than anyother organization  the United Nations stands for theideals of tolerance  understanding and mutual respect.A strong message should therefore emerge from thisdebate. The hateful slander of people on the basis oftheir culture or religion is unacceptable. It is an abuseof the right to freedom of expression. However  wemust emphasize just as clearly that violence cannot bejustified by insults  however understandable the outragemay be. Such ongoing events also tell us that we mustreach many more people in our effort to promote thevalues of the United Nations around the globe.When we last met  a year ago  we heard many callsfrom this rostrum to bring an end to the crisis in Syria.Since then  the violence has turned into a civil warthat puts the United Nations to shame. We have seenopen division in the Security Council and little interestby the parties to the conflict in a United Nations-ledmediation. Instead  the situation on the ground hasfurther escalated. The entire region is now threatenedwith instability. The blatant disregard for the lives andrights of civilians  of women and children in particular is simply shocking.It is a crisis with profound and lasting effects forthe three main pillars of the United Nations: peace andsecurity  development  and human rights. It is thereforealso an existential challenge for this Organization. TheUnited Nations is only as effective as its political organsallow it to be. The crisis must therefore make us thinkin general terms about the lessons we should learn.The situation in Syria is clearly of burning concernto the membership as a whole as a human security crisisand a threat to international peace and security. At thesame time  the Security Council is unable to carry outits tasks under the Charter because of disagreementamong its permanent members. It is therefore essentialthat the General Assembly step in and play a moreactive role  as it has done on some occasions. That isall the more important as we are confronted by thefailure to fulfil the responsibility to protect a civilianpopulation — a principle adopted in this Hall at thehighest political level.The stalemate in the Council demonstrates that wemust look at the way in which the veto power is and can be used. In that respect  there must be accountabilityvis-à-vis the membership of the Organization as awhole. After all  the Council carries out its work onbehalf of us all. We call upon the permanent membersto acknowledge that the United Nations Charter doesnot grant them the right to the veto without any stringsattached. We ask them to acknowledge that the Councilmust at all times act in accordance with the purposesand principles of the United Nations. We thereforerequest that they pledge not to use the veto to blockCouncil action aimed at preventing or ending genocide crimes against humanity or war crimes.Clearly  the main priority is to end the suffering ofthe Syrian people and to bring about a political solutionthat guarantees human security and stability for theregion. However  we also have an obligation to ensurethat there is no impunity for the worst crimes underinternational law and that those who have the greatestresponsibility do not get away with murder.The evidence before us is alarming. The independentinternational commission of inquiry on the Syrian ArabRepublic  established by the Human Rights Council came to clear conclusions. The primary responsibilityto ensure accountability falls  of course  on the Syrianjudiciary. But we can be under no illusions as to whetherit will deliver justice to the victims and due processto all accused. We therefore join Switzerland in thecall to the Council to refer the situation in Syria to theInternational Criminal Court (ICC) (see A/67/PV.7).But we also ask the Council to fully support such areferral in order to ensure cooperation and not to put upany obstacles to the appropriate financing of the Court’swork. Without those two prerequisites  referrals are amixed blessing and problematic for the ICC.This year  we also commemorate the tenthanniversary of the International Criminal Court. Weare looking at the history of an astonishing success.Who would have thought that the Court’s membershipwould near two thirds of the membership of the UnitedNations in such a short time? Who would have predictedthat the Security Council would make referrals to theICC on two occasions — once even by unanimous vote?And who would have expected the Court to emergefrom political controversy as a stronger institution?Those are remarkable achievements that we can beproud of. Nevertheless  the next decade is also fraughtwith challenges. We have been strongly united insetting up the Court and getting it under way. Now that it is fully operational  we must more than ever supportit politically. I therefore launched a ministerial-levelinitiative to support the ICC earlier this week. I wasvery encouraged by the strong response to my call forcoordinated action when needed.In adopting the Rome Statute  we have not just setup an international tribunal located in The Hague. Wehave also created a global system to fight impunity which assigns a strong role to States. It also offersthe Security Council an important role  if it choosesto play it. Political support is particularly requiredwhere investigations are based on referrals fromthe Security Council. The obligation for the State inquestion to cooperate is based entirely on the SecurityCouncil’s authority  not on the Rome Statute. TheCouncil must therefore play a key role in ensuring thatsuch cooperation is forthcoming. We as States are alsoresponsible for ensuring that indicted individuals arearrested and transferred to the Court. Clearly  we mustdo better in that regard.We are also being given a historic opportunity bothfor the Court and for the United Nations: for the firsttime since the end of the Second World War  we canenable an international tribunal to prosecute the crimeof aggression.The prohibition of the illegal use of force is at thecore of the Charter of the United Nations  and aggressionhas been considered a crime under international law fordecades. But the consensual adoption of the Kampalaamendments to the Rome Statute allows us to put thatprinciple into practice. Leaders that consider resortingto the illegal use of force will be put on notice  once30 States parties have ratified the amendments andonce we have activated them in 2017. I am proud of thefact that Liechtenstein  following its presidency of theReview Conference  was the first State to ratify theamendments  on 8 May this year. We chose the dateas a tribute to the commemoration of the end of theSecond World War in Europe. We have also launchedan initiative to support the ratification process that isunder way.I would therefore encourage all current and futureparties to the Rome Statute to ratify the Kampalaamendments as soon as possible. Together we can takethis big step forward in the history of international law.Criminalizing the illegal use of force betweenStates would be a very significant step forward in thepromotion of the rule of law at the international level. The rule of law is rightfully moving to the centre ofour attention. We have illustrated this fact by holdinga high-level meeting on this topic earlier this week.The rule of law permeates many of the activities wepursue here at the United Nations. Indeed  there canbe no lasting security  no sustainable developmentand no effective protection of human rights withoutthe rule of law. We therefore look forward to a strongrule-of-law dimension in the sustainable developmentgoals resulting from the United Nations Conference onSustainable Development.The Conference resulted in a number of importantagreements. It also illustrated the value of inclusive andtransparent multilateralism  especially when comparedwith other  more exclusive decision-making processes.This serves as a reminder of the need to reconcileseemingly competing interests in internationaldecision-making: transparency and inclusiveness onthe one side  and efficiency and effectiveness on theother.Multilateral decision-making is efficient when thereis sufficient political will. It is effective when it has thelegitimacy necessary to ensure full implementation.We must revert to considering the universality andopenness of the General Assembly as key assets  notas a weakness. The Assembly must reaffirm its uniqueand central role in global governance  including in theeconomic dimension. I welcome the strong commitmentof President Jeremić  expressed at the beginning of thissession  to work for genuine multilateralism and  to thatend  to reach a new level of engagement. I assure him ofour full support in this endeavour.There must be accountability for decisions of globalimpact before the Assembly or before other relevantand universally accessible bodies. To achieve that aim we will build on the progress made in recent years inthe framework of the Global Governance Group. TheGroup has become a trusted bridge-builder in thesematters. We hope that this issue will become one of thehighlights of Mr. Jeremić’s presidency.Let me conclude with some remarks about an issuethat is particularly dear to my heart. I am convinced thatthe inclusion of the whole population  men and womenalike  is essential to the stability and peaceful andprosperous development of nations. Since becomingForeign Minister  I have tried to make use of the relevantinternational platforms to promote the advancement  women. I also hope to bring Liechtenstein’s expertiseand passion for women’s issues to the Commission onthe Status of Women during the term 2015-2019.I am grateful to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moonfor his leadership in this area. UN-Women  headed socharismatically by Michelle Bachelet  has given a much-needed additional boost to our efforts. If we continueon our path  then the United Nations can be the decisivedriving force for gender equality worldwide. Until then we can and must do much more  in particular in the areaof women  peace and security. Stronger protection ofwomen  both legal and otherwise  in situations wherethey are particularly prone to becoming victims is a keycomponent. The United Nations  with its very strongfield presence all over the world  can make a uniquecontribution to that end. But most importantly  theUnited Nations must lead by example when it comesto gender equality and the advancement of women.We must make the best use of their talents  skills andexperiences as peacemakers  as agents for sustainabledevelopment and as advocates for human rights and therule of law. As is well known  the future is female.Only when women are fully included will we  theUnited Nations  be successful in pursuing our goals."
"101",4184,"LKA",67,2012,"﻿On behalf of the Governmentof the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka  Icongratulate Vuk Jeremić on his election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. His proven skills and charming personality leave noroom for doubt that under his able leadership we willachieve our goals for this session. Sri Lanka is alsopleased to endorse the theme proposed by him for thisyear’s high-level debate.For 67 years  the United Nations has provided thepremier forum for the resolution of international disputesand the negotiation of landmark global goals. In theconduct of international relations  Sri Lanka  a foundingmember of the Non-Aligned Movement  firmly upholdsthe tenets of peaceful coexistence  mutual respectfor each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity non-interference in the internal affairs of other States equality and mutual benefit. Sri Lanka believes that in the settlement of international disputes  action mustbe based on the fundamental principle of the sovereignequality of States  a principle firmly enshrined in theCharter of the United Nations. The noticeable recenttendency to selectively and arbitrarily intervene in theinternal affairs of States f lies in the face of this principleand dilutes the confidence so carefully nurtured in theUnited Nations system.The global financial crisis has posed a majorchallenge to the entire international community. Inthis context  it is of the greatest importance to ensurethat any strategies employed to achieve recovery do notimpose unjustifiable burdens on developing countries as they strive to achieve better living conditions fortheir people. A recovery that does not simultaneouslyuplift developing countries will be  by its very nature unsustainable. It is paradoxical that the very countriesin which the financial crisis originated now seek toprovide policy prescriptions for others.It has been noted that many countries of the Southhave weathered the financial storm successfully. SriLanka’s economy  which has been carefully managedduring this period  is one of the Asian economiesthat has recorded impressive gains by any standard.A growth rate of 8.2 per cent was achieved in 2011.Following the end of the conflict in 2009  the areasformerly controlled by terrorists  namely the northernprovince  recorded a 27 per cent growth in grossdomestic product in 2011. The exponential boom inagriculture and fisheries in particular has contributedsubstantially to this result.We are now at a significant juncture in humanhistory  as climate change looms as the greatestchallenge to the very existence of humanity. Manydeveloping countries  including my own  are still struggling to regain lost opportunities and improve thelivelihood of their people while staring global warmingin the face. Our carbon footprint remains negligible.It is imperative that the developed world deliver on itssolemn undertakings to assist developing countries  aswe seek the common goal of arresting climate change which is caused by human activities.The United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment (Rio+20)  held in June 2012  demonstratedconvincingly the efficacy of United Nations processes.The potential of the green economy  however  will beless attractive if we do not clearly understand its long-term consequences at the national level for sustainableeconomic strategies. The transition to a green economymust not generate negative externalities that retardeconomic growth and perpetuate societal inequityand poverty. Assistance to developing countries underNorth-South development cooperation mechanismsmust take into account global initiatives to mitigatethe adverse consequences of too rigid an application ofgreen economic principles. The efforts of developingcountries themselves in this regard must be recognizedand further facilitated.As Member States  we must respect the principlespatiently negotiated by the international community.These are  in particular  the equality of rights the equal sovereignty of all States and the right todevelopment  as underlined in the Rio+20 outcomedocument (resolution 66/288  annex). The interests ofthe developing world must be entrenched and protected.Hence  no constraining conditions should be applied todevelopment models or approaches adopted by MemberStates that could prevent the achievement of sustainabledevelopment together with the eradication of poverty.The middle-income countries are the main drivingforce for strengthening our global economy. Sri Lanka’sbalanced socioeconomic policy strategies propelledus to middle-income status a few years ago. As wehave repeatedly emphasized  countries’ attainmentof middle-income status does not by itself provide asolution to the issue of poverty and other developmentchallenges.I wish to mention in particular that Sri Lankaemploys a unique development strategy that empowerscitizens  with special attention to social developmentneeds. It has continued to achieve transformationalchange in the lives of its people by effectivelymobilizing available resources and deliveringsustainable and citizen-centred programmes. Sri Lanka has emphasized synergistic interactions between healthcare and education  public infrastructure development including improved water and sanitation  transportand communications  especially under an integratedregional development approach  which we consider tobe important. We also enjoy a 98 per cent literacy rate with the score for girls being even higher. The successof this strategy is reflected in Sri Lanka’s high rankingon the human development index  of which we arelegitimately proud.Sri Lanka has achieved many of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and is well on track torealize all of them by 2015  including the eradicationof poverty. Eradicating poverty and improving thequality of life of our people has been the cornerstoneof social development policies in Sri Lanka overmany decades. Sri Lanka’s key policy document “Mahinda Chintana —Vision for the Future”  has setspecific targets to combat poverty within the MDGframework. A range of projects has been designedfor the eradication of poverty by 2016. Through theGama Naguma and Divi Naguma programmes  whichdeal with village awakening and the enhancement oflivelihoods and incomes  we have been addressingrural poverty eradication and ensuring food security.These programmes continue to promote the conceptof self-employment  directing financial and technicalassistance to youth and women in rural areas  includingthose who suffered from the terrorist conflict.The contribution of women in Sri Lanka’ssuccessful realization of most of the MDGs is of greatsignificance. Women who are literate also encouragetheir children to focus on education and aspire to highergoals. It is through the participation of women that SriLanka has been recognized for its achievements in theWorld Health Organization breastfeeding promotionand immunization programmes. I note with great pridethat Sri Lanka produced the first elected woman PrimeMinister in the world in 1960.We have made genuine efforts to ensure that thefruits of economic development are equally distributedand are accessible  especially to the most vulnerablesegments of society. We have ensured that socialmobility is not confined to the privileged in the townsand cities of the island  but penetrates deep into therural hinterland.Three years ago  our Government ended theterrorist challenge largely through its own efforts. Sri Lanka is firmly committed to redressing the grievancesof all parties affected by the internal conflict. Afterthe release of the report of the Lessons Learnt andReconciliation Commission  a local mechanism set inplace by the President of Sri Lanka  an action plan togive expeditious effect to its recommendations wasadopted. A comprehensive national action plan forhuman rights with specific timelines has been approvedby the Cabinet of Ministers. The Government has alsoproposed a transparent and democratic process under aparliamentary select committee to address post-conflictreconciliation issues. That initiative has  regrettably been delayed by the failure of some opposition partiesto nominate their representatives.Sri Lanka exemplifies the challenges faced bya society emerging from the shadow of a sustainedconflict that spanned three decades; the country is nowentering an era of peace and tranquillity. The gradualdiminution of the challenges and the brevity of theperiod that has elapsed since the end of the conflictleave no room for doubt as to the degree of successachieved by the Government of Sri Lanka with respectto a wide range of issues relating to development andreconciliation. It has only been about three years sincethe conflict ended.Prioritization was a central feature of theGovernment’s plan of action. The progress on theground during the last three years with regard tothe resettlement of internally displaced persons; thereintegration into society of thousands of ex-combatantsafter exposure to programmes of livelihood skillstraining  which equipped them to earn their living withdignity and independence; the rapid completion of themine-clearance process; and the unprecedented focuson infrastructure development leading to very visibleinvigoration of the economy of the island as a whole and the Northern province in particular  are quiteapparent.The experience of Sri Lanka demonstrates that with the dynamic leadership of high quality and theunwavering commitment that President MahindaRajapaksa has provided  along with an effectivepolitical and military strategy and strong rapport withall sections of the public  it is possible to prevail againstthe most ruthless forces of terror. No one has a greatercommitment to reconciliation in an all-inclusive spiritthan our Government. Unhelpful external pressuresthat support narrow partisan interests could easilyderail initiatives that have produced very substantial results and peace on the ground  as we begin a new andexciting chapter in our country’s history.In the international community’s quest to bringsome semblance of equity to economic developmentacross the continents  we must maintain increased focuson the continent of Africa  especially through South-South cooperation. Sri Lanka is vigorously expandingits engagement with the region  especially in mattersrelating to trade  investment  tourism and technicalassistance.All of our current endeavours should have a strongerfocus on children and youth  who are the custodians ofour future.We have continuously supported resolution 66/6 andthe need to end the unjust economic  commercial andfinancial embargo against Cuba. Unilateral sanctionsof that nature  which harm ordinary people  have noplace in modern international intercourse.Terrorism remains a scourge in the contemporaryworld  threatens our societies and impedes thesocioeconomic progress of our people. As a countrythat has emerged from ruthless and brutal terrorism  SriLanka continues resolutely to support all multilateralefforts to enhance peace and security and eliminateall forms of terrorism  without discrimination. In ourcollective quest to eradicate terrorism  the selectiveapplication of principles and double standards must bescrupulously avoided. Terrorism from whatever sourcemust be unequivocally condemned and countered.It has been established that terrorism has developedclose links with transnational organized crime in theform of cybercrime and identity theft  environment-related crime  maritime piracy  the smuggling ofmigrants and trafficking in persons and drugs.Maritime piracy has emerged as a major threat tointernational sea lanes and has added an additionaleconomic burden to global trade. Sri Lanka  which hasbeen a trading nation for centuries  eagerly supportsmultinational efforts to counter that threat. But it mustbe remembered that piracy originates on land and thatany solution to piracy must also address its causes anddevelopments on land.The illicit transportation of migrants to greenerpastures overseas by criminal networks requiresour collective attention. Sri Lanka also continues tocooperate closely in that regard with our bilateraland multilateral partners. As a member of the Bali Process  we are committed to cooperation in capacity-building  the exchange of best practices and lawenforcement cooperation. At the same time  we believein the necessity to share information in good faith acknowledging that action on the part of a variety ofMember States  with their various national interests  isessential to counter the sophisticated human smugglingrings.One long-standing issue that weighs on theconscience of the international community and whichneeds our sustained collective attention is the restorationof the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. SriLanka fully supports the implementation of all relevantUnited Nations resolutions on Palestine  which willpave the way for the achievement of Statehood forthe Palestinian people and bring lasting peace to theregion. Sri Lanka fully supports Palestine in its effortsto achieve full membership in the United Nations.Sri Lanka unreservedly condemns the defamationof all religions and religious leaders. While the rightto free speech is fundamental to our value system  thatright should not be abused in order to hurt the feelingsof the faithful  whether they be Buddhists  Muslims Christians  Hindus  Jews or followers of other faiths.All available mechanisms must be employed to preventthe defamation of all religions and the exploitation ofreligious symbols for commercial purposes.In conclusion  Sri Lanka is currently in theprocess of making arrangements to host the WorldYouth Conference in 2014. The primary objectivewill be the strengthening of youth inclusion innational decision-making processes in relation to thedevelopment and implementation of the post-2015development agenda. I cordially extend an openinvitation to all fellow Member States to join handswith us to make that global event a success."
"102",4226,"LSO",67,2012,"﻿Allow me to congratulatethe President on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I wouldlike to assure him of my delegation’s full support andcooperation during his tenure of office. His impeccablecredentials and experience will ensure a successfulsession. I also wish to commend his predecessor for hissterling leadership during the previous session.The establishment of the United Nations by 51countries following the Second World War ushered inhope for collective security  shared prosperity and justicein international relations. Six decades have passed andthe membership of the Organization has swelled morethan threefold. But obstacles still remain in the pathtowards creating a world that was envisioned by ourforebears. We know the solutions that can effectivelyaddress the multifaceted challenges that confront ourworld. But it is increasingly difficult to arrive at thosesolutions within the multilateral system. On the international stage  unilateral actions thatdefy civility and international law are growing morefrequent  and increasingly go unpunished. Despite thelessons of history  there are countries that still believethey can solve the political problems of our time throughwar and coercion. It does not matter to them that historyhas shown that the goal of domination through the useof force is not only elusive and dangerous but alsounsustainable.Humankind derives no comfort from the potentialconflict between the Islamic Republic of Iran and theWestern Powers over Iran’s nuclear programme. Thatlooming crisis can be avoided not through the threatsbeing made against Iran  but through negotiations basedon respect for sovereign equality and the recognition ofthe rights and legitimate fears of all parties involved.Our generation is already facing too many problems.Surely we cannot afford another avoidable war.We are saddened by the increasing tension in the EastChina Sea between two of the most respectable membersof the international community  the People’s Republicof China and Japan. No one should take advantage ofthe situation to fan the flames of discord between thosetwo great nations and ancient civilizations. Instead  wemust encourage them to resolve their differences withmaturity and through peaceful dialogue.In the Middle East  it is about time that individualinterests gave way to compassion and reason  so thatthe people of Palestine can enjoy their inalienableright to self-determination in our lifetimes. Two Statesexisting side by side in peace and security have longbeen recognized by the international community as theonly plausible route to enduring peace and stability inthe region. The State of Israel must be prevailed uponto support that solution. It must stop building illegalsettlements on Palestinian lands  which have thepotential to render the prospects of a two-State solutionirrelevant.Our call for lifting the economic embargo againstthe Republic of Cuba has gone unheeded for the past20 years. Our thoughts are with the ordinary people ofCuba who for decades have been denied the fruits ofglobalization and prosperity through no fault of theirown. This unfortunate situation has continued for toolong and must be resolved. We call on all stakeholdersinvolved to search for a just and peaceful solution  justas we continue to call on the Kingdom of Moroccoto cooperate with the international community and facilitate the independence and self-determination ofthe people of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic.Peace within and among nations is a fundamentalcondition for development. The dream of a prosperousworld will continue to be an illusion if tensions persistand our world is perpetually at war with itself. Thatis why we welcome as timely and relevant the choiceof theme for this session  “Bringing about adjustmentor settlement of international disputes or situations bypeaceful means”.Today  many nations are rising up againstdictatorial regimes in defence of their basic humanrights and freedoms. The popular democratic uprisingin the Arab world has underscored the frustration of thepeople with longstanding political repression and lackof accountability. In some Arab countries this quest forfreedom  human rights and democracy has been metwith atrocious force and brutality. The Governmentof Syria must accept the popular legitimacy andsupremacy of the people’s aspirations before it is toolate. Further militarization of the situation in Syria willmake the conflict too costly in terms of human life. Atthe same time  we call on all countries to refrain frominterfering in the internal affairs of Syria in a mannerthat undermines the prospects of peace in that country.True revolutions need no external sponsors. The effortsof the international community must focus on helpingthe Syrian people find a negotiated  peaceful and lastingsettlement of the ongoing conflict in their country.Africa  too  is trying hard to rid itself of wars andconflicts. While we thought we had dealt with the scourgeof the coups d’état  it has recently reared its ugly headin a few African countries. We call on the internationalcommunity to join hands with the African Union andstand firm in refusing to recognize any Governmentthat comes to power through unconstitutional means.It is indeed a mockery of the United Nations  as anOrganization that cherishes democratic values andprinciples  to accord legitimacy to unconstitutionalregimes by allowing them to participate in its activitieson an equal footing with bona fide Members. InAfrica  we have adopted a policy of zero tolerance tounconstitutional changes of Government  and haveremained steadfast in our resolve to refuse to recognizeGovernments that have no democratic legitimacy. Weurge the international community to support that policyand to make it universal. Africa has not been without successes in pursuingthe settlement of disputes by peaceful means. The UnitedNations  the African Union and other stakeholders haveworked together with the Somali authorities to pavethe way for peace in Somalia. The positive results ofthat joint effort are beginning to be visible. Remarkablestrides towards democracy and State-building havebeen registered. The election of the President less thantwo weeks ago is a cause for celebration. Today  thepeople of Somalia have reason to hope that they canput the unfortunate era of instability behind them. It isimportant to recognize  however  that the road aheadfor the Government and the people of Somalia is stilllong and steep. The continued and unfaltering supportof the international community is indespensable toensuring that Somalia does not relapse into conflict andbecome a failed State.The development and possession of nuclear andother weapons of mass destruction remains a seriousconcern for the peace and security of humankind.Some States possess those weapons in large quantitiesand have not remained faithful to their commitmentsunder the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons. Those States often threaten to humiliatenon-nuclear-weapon States. That is why other countriesaspire to acquire nuclear weapons. We must renewour collective commitment to a nuclear-weapon-freeworld — a world that is safe for future generations sustained by the shared values of universal peace andprosperity.In the same way  for as long as international tradein small arms  light weapons and other conventionalweapons remains unregulated  peace will continue toelude us. The failure of the international community less than three months ago  to conclude a robust  legallybinding arms trade treaty has left an indelible mark onour generation. We need to step up efforts during thissixty-seventh session and live up to our responsibilities.Conventional weapons  including small arms and lightweapons  are the real weapons of mass destruction inAfrica; they fuel conflict and account for the death ofscores of our people every day.Across the globe  military and political repressionhave combined with religious intolerance to sustain thespectre of terrorism that continues to besiege our world.While the international community must address thoseroot causes  there can be no acceptable justification forterrorism  because it is both brutal and indiscriminate and it is innocent people  including women and children  who bear the brunt of it. Lesotho condemnsterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It doesnot matter if it is sponsored by States or individuals or whether its evil schemes are carried out by crudemeans or the most sophisticated weaponry. The recentmurder of American diplomats in Libya demonstratesthe brutality and senselessness of terrorism. It deservesour strongest condemnation. We extend our sincerecondolences to the people and Government of theUnited States of America.A few days ago  we had an opportunity to reaffirmour resolve to uphold the rule of law both at the nationaland international levels. Respect for the rule of law isa precondition for guaranteeing fundamental freedomsand respect for human rights. Similarly  strengtheningthe rule of law at the international level is critical foreffectively addressing our current global challenges.International law is the very foundation of peacefulcoexistence between nations.The role played by the International Court ofJustice as an instrument for the peaceful resolutionof conflicts and the bedrock of the international legalorder is sacrosanct. Lesotho reaffirms its support forthe principal judicial organ of the United Nations andfor other established international courts and tribunals.But those bodies must not be politicized  so that theycan retain their integrity and fairness.It is almost four years since the multiple globalcrises befell us  yet the prospects for economic recoveryremain gloomy. Evidence of climate change is all aroundus. Extreme weather conditions  f loods  drought  soildegradation and the rise of sea levels threaten the veryexistence of humankind. In my country  drought andf loods have heightened food insecurity  and famine islooming. In August  my Government had to declareLesotho in a situation of food crisis and called on itsdevelopment partners to assist. That followed a severedrought that afflicted Lesotho in the last plantingseason. I am humbled to repeat that call for helpbefore this body. Our response to the crisis will focuson the priorities of subsidizing agricultural input andpromoting drought-resistant crops  as well as scaling upconservation farming and providing nutrition servicesto mothers of infants and young children.We went to Rio de Janeiro in June with adetermination to adopt ambitious and measurable stepsto address sustainable development. Regrettably  theRio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development did not meet everyone’s expectations. Alack of a concrete commitment by developed countriesto provide developing countries with financing andtechnology is a source of concern. Nevertheless  thereis still hope that a sustainable future is within reach.We must continue to work for the future we want anddeserve.As we march forward  we must ensure that theformulation of the sustainable development goals andtheir interphase with the post-2015 development agendais done carefully and in an inclusive manner. We mustavoid parallel tracks for the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs) and the sustainable development goals which should be viewed as being complementary to and not a substitute for  the MDGs.The United Nations  which has remained the samefor the past 67 years  cannot be effective in efficientlyaddressing the challenges of our time. The need forthe early reform of the United Nations  in particularthe Security Council  was universally agreed by theinternational community at the World Summit in 2005.Yet  seven years later  negotiations on the reform of theCouncil are still without progress. As the status quo is maintained  the Council remains largely inept in thedischarge of its mandate. Let us resolve to make theAssembly’s sixty-seventh session one of action and lessrhetoric.Allow me to conclude by pointing out that aresponsive  effective and efficient multilateral systemis the only answer to the problems of the twenty-firstcentury. It must be a United Nations that draws on thefull diversity of its membership. With the necessarycommitment and political will  that goal can indeed beattained."
"103",4252,"LTU",67,2012,"﻿In the past few years  thenumber of conflicts in the world has again been on theincrease. That causes the deaths and injuries of  anda loss of shelter for  thousands of people. It leads toa delay in the development of our countries and thestagnation of regional and global economies.Our common goal is to find ways to reduce tension disagreement and conflict worldwide. The mostimportant challenge in that respect is understandingthe root causes of conflicts and concentrating effortson prevention  not only on doing away with theconsequences.I want to draw the attention of Member Statesto one specific area that is very narrow but veryimportant — energy. Since ancient times  thecompetition for natural resources has been the reason for very many conflicts. Energy resources are not equallydistributed  so there is inequality in accessibility toenergy. The existing dependency on energy remains areason for abuse  not cooperation. A lack of clear andglobally accepted rules and norms in the energy sectorcontributes to continuing tensions.Recurring gas and oil supply crises every yearremind us that  in a global environment  friction anddisagreements over energy still lead to conflicts andtensions of all sorts. Being a small country  without itsown resources  especially sources of energy  Lithuaniais well aware of the negative consequences of energydependency in an environment that has no universalagreement on or compliance with clear rules of thegame. What can we do?First  we need to increase global energysustainability. I would like to congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his Sustainable Energy forAll initiative  which is really relevant and timely. Theimprovement of energy efficiency  the diversificationof the energy supply and global accessibility to energyare certainly the goals for which we should strive.Secondly  we need to make existing inequalities inaccess to energy a source of cooperation  not tension.The use of energy dependency as an instrument forpolitical or economic blackmail must be eliminated not only to ensure equality but also to increase globalcompetiveness and effectiveness. With the ongoingpractices of price-fixing and abuse of monopolisticpositions  which both distort competition  there can beno development  security or effectiveness.Thirdly  our answer to energy-related conflictprevention should be international agreements thatmake clear that the use of energy to gain political goals isunacceptable. Responsibility for violations should alsobe clear and unavoidable. We must grant internationalinstitutions greater discretion to launch investigationsand to impose sanctions on activities that hinder thefree f low of energy resources  impede diversificationor set unfair prices for customers.I have one final point. There is no energy-related issue as dangerous as unsafe nuclear energydevelopment. It is obvious that each country can decideon its own energy mix. However  each national decisionto develop nuclear energy can have a devastating andtransboundary impact  and should be extremely wellgrounded and researched. There can be no sustainability development or peaceful cooperation without nuclear safety. Mistakes in nuclear energy are too costly to beallowed.In that respect  we welcome the actions taken bythe International Atomic Energy Agency to improvethe existing system of international nuclear safetyregulations. Lithuania supports the position that nuclearsafety standards should be strengthened and  if needed legal international imperatives should be adopted. The2012 Seoul Nuclear Security Summit clearly indicatedthat nuclear security and nuclear safety measuresshould be drawn up  implemented and managed in acoherent manner  as they both have a common aim toprotect the people and their environment. Keeping thecommitment that it assumed at the Summit  my countryhas contributed to international efforts to increaseglobal awareness of existing energy insecurities andways to prevent them by establishing the NuclearSecurity Centre of Excellence in Lithuania.In order to tackle the causes of conflicts  not justthe consequences  we have to be honest players. Wemust honestly define the problems; speak openly abouttheir reasons; be clear and precise in naming the rulesof the game; and  last but not least  find in ourselvesthe political will to play according to the rules globally especially once agreed upon."
"104",4296,"LUX",67,2012,"﻿On behalf of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg let me congratulate President Jeremić on his electionas President of the General Assembly. He can count onthe full support of my country as he assumes this majorresponsibility.The General Assembly is the central body of theUnited Nations architecture. Here all Member Statesare represented  and each has a vote  irrespectiveof its size  its population or its economic power. TheAssembly truly is the concert of nations embodyingthe principle of the sovereign equality of all MemberStates. To President Jeremić  the conductor of theconcert of States here assembled  we wish inspiration passion and wisdom.Luxembourg is proud to have been part  since thevery beginning  of the peace project that is the UnitedNations.Our then Minister for Foreign Affairs  Mr. JosephBeck  in presenting the Charter of the United NationsCharter — signed a few weeks earlier in San Francisco —to the Luxembourg Parliament on 9 August 1945  spokethe following visionary words:“It is in the work of the United Nations that ourcountry found the hope of rebirth in its darkesthour; it is within the United Nations that it hastaken up its place as an independent State  as a freecountry; it is among these peaceful countries  justunited by the Organization of San Francisco in thewonderful hope of a lasting peace  that it will findthe guarantees of a future which are necessary forits renewal”.History has vindicated him. Determined  with theother peoples of the United Nations  to save succeedinggenerations from the scourge of war  Luxembourgfound in the United Nations and in multilateralismin general the ideal framework to flourish as anindependent  sovereign State  free to choose foritself. Luxembourg has been able to prosper thanksto the peace it has enjoyed since 1945. In return  wehave resolutely committed ourselves  within theUnited Nations  to contribute to building peace andto promoting sustainable development for the greatestnumber possible.President Jeremić has rightly chosen the peacefulsettlement of disputes as the theme of the generaldebate at the current session. It is one of the overarchingobjectives of our Organization  aimed at enabling it tomaintain international peace and security. To settledisputes peacefully  the Charter has attributed a majorrole not only to the Security Council  but also to theGeneral Assembly and to the International Court ofJustice.The Syrian crisis  which has lasted already 18months  continues to get worse. It has now claimed morethan 20 000 victims. Repercussions on neighbouringcountries continue to intensify. The crisis is a call onour collective conscience and puts our commitment tothe test. Some are tempted to accuse the United Nationsof inaction. However  the fault lies elsewhere. Thoseresponsible for the terrifying violence  the war crimes the egregious human rights violations and crimesagainst humanity committed in Syria will one dayhave to answer for them. Such is Luxembourg’s firmconviction.The failure to this day of attempts to resolve theSyrian crisis through peaceful means must not leadus to neglect the quest for political solutions to othercrises.Luxembourg has consistently advocated a peacefulsettlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Thatconflict has been going on for far too long. It isessential that the parties resume direct negotiations andnegotiate a sustainable peace among themselves  withthe support of the Quartet. The path will no doubt bearduous  but the objective is worth it for the Israelis  thePalestinians and the region as a whole. We would like tosee an independent  democratic  contiguous and viableState of Palestine  living side by side with the State ofIsrael in peace and security.Luxembourg has for many years now supported thebuilding of the Palestinian State at both the politicaland the economic levels. We also support Palestine’saspirations to assume its place among the nations of theworld. We provide financial support to the PalestinianAuthority in order to assist it in making its publicadministration and basic social services work  and weare also a reliable partner of the United Nations Reliefand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the NearEast. Under an agreement signed in February 2012  Luxembourg will provide assistance in the amount of€15 million to Palestine refugees throughout the period2012-2015.Allow me to give a few other examples to illustratehow Luxembourg is contributing to the peacefulsettlement of international disputes. First  as wasrecalled during the High-level Meeting on the Rule ofLaw  Luxembourg was one of the very first States torecognize the jurisdiction of the International Courtof Justice as compulsory. The Court elucidates anddevelops international law and thereby strengthenspeaceful relations between States. Next  Luxembourgsupports preventive diplomacy and mediation activitiesas well as the good offices undertaken by the UnitedNations. Our support in that area also benefits regionalorganizations  such as the African Union. Finally Luxembourg also supports civil society  as it didin 2010  when it backed the mediation efforts by theCommunity of Sant’Egidio between political and civilsociety actors in Guinea and the Niger.Luxembourg  a multicultural and multilingual Stateby virtue of its history  its geographical location and thecomposition of its population  has often played the roleof mediator between its large European neighbours andwithin the European Union.Building on a balanced foreign policy  freefrom the legacy of a colonial past and defined byan unwavering commitment to multilateralism Luxembourg is at the service of the United Nationswhen it comes to playing the role of honest broker andassuming the responsibilities that come with that role.In 2009  moreover  Luxembourg had the honour ofchairing the Economic and Social Council at a crucialjuncture marked by the devastating effects of the globaleconomic and financial crisis of 2008.My country has also been a linchpin of thePeacebuilding Commission since its inception in 2005.Since February 2011  the Permanent Representative ofLuxembourg to the United Nations  Ambassador SylvieLucas  has chaired the Guinea configuration of thePeacebuilding Commission. Luxembourg is honouredto be able to marshal the efforts of the internationalcommunity in support of the authorities in Conakry who have asked to be assisted in three priority areas:national reconciliation  security sector reform  andyouth and women’s employment. Our commitmentstems from our conviction that we need to adopt aglobal approach towards peacebuilding and towards the maintenance of international peace and security — anapproach that recognizes the intrinsic link betweensecurity and development.Indeed  to ensure lasting peace  one must tackle theroot causes of conflicts. Luxembourg is concentratingon two of these: social inequalities resulting frompersistent poverty  and the increasing scarcity of naturalresources as a result of climate change.The fight against poverty is one of our statedpriorities. Since 2000  Luxembourg has reached the goalset by the United Nations of dedicating at least 0.7 percent of its gross national income to official developmentassistance. In 2009 and 2010  that assistance exceededthe threshold of 1 per cent of our gross national income.The Government of Luxembourg is determined tomaintain that effort despite budgetary constraints. Ourassistance is benefiting the least developed countriesin particular. Here again  we exceed the goal set by theUnited Nations by dedicating more than 0.2 per centof our gross national income to those countries  themajority of which are in Africa.Beyond simple statistics  those figures reflect ourspirit of solidarity towards developing countries. Thatspirit drives not only our political decision-makersand our development cooperation experts but also thenumerous citizens who are acting through civil societyorganizations. My family is proud to participate in thatmovement of solidarity. My wife  the Grand Duchess invests herself fully in the social sector as a UNICEFEminent Advocate for Children  notably in Burundi.She has been passionate about microfinance for manyyears and has completed numerous projects in that area.As the report of the Secretary-General (A/67/1)highlights  we have achieved  worldwide  some essentialtargets of the Millennium Development Goals aheadof time. However  the effects of global warming arecatastrophic and are threatening to undo the progressthat has been accomplished. In the least developedcountries  the situation is particularly worrisome. It istherefore essential that we act resolutely in that area.Progress has been made at the Conferences of theParties to the United Nations Framework Conventionon Climate Change in Cancún and then in Durban. Wenow need further commitments to be made in terms ofreducing carbon emissions. Another major challengelies in the mobilization of adequate financial andtechnological resources to enable the most vulnerablecountries  in particular  the least developed countries  the landlocked developing countries and the small islanddeveloping States  to adapt to the effects of climatechange. Luxembourg is acting to meet that challenge.We have thus decided to join an important programmeof support for renewable energy that would meet thespecific needs of Pacific small island developing States.I personally attended the United Nations Conferenceon Sustainable Development in Brazil in June in orderto show how high a priority the sustainable developmentof our planet is for my country. None of us has themeans to make it on our own. Our interdependencepushes us to act together. It is a matter of survival. Andit is within the United Nations that we must organizeour collective survival.I would be remiss if I failed to mention anotherpriority for Luxembourg in terms of conflictprevention  namely  disarmament and non-proliferation.Luxembourg promotes the constant search for securityat the lowest level of armaments. It is a party to allrelevant global and regional treaties and conventionsand  despite the setback that the internationalcommunity suffered this year  we remain committedto working towards an arms trade treaty  which wouldhelp Member States to effectively combat the scourgeof uncontrolled arms circulation.When conflicts break out despite attempts toprevent them  Luxembourg does not shy away fromcommitting itself. My country participates quiteregularly and actively in peacekeeping operations. Atthe present time  Luxembourg troops are contributingto efforts under the United Nations mandate in Kosovo Lebanon and Afghanistan. Through its contributionsto European Union missions  Luxembourg has alsoassumed responsibilities in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  in the fight against piracy off the coast ofSomalia and in the Sahel region  where the internationalcommunity must redouble its efforts to prevent terroristgroups linked to transnational organized crime fromtaking root.All the areas of action I have touched upon hereshow how indispensable the United Nations is. Ifwe are convinced of the relevance of a multilateralapproach founded on the United Nations  we mustgive the Organization the means to be a true centreof multilateral action. For that  we need to continueto press ahead with United Nations reform  includingSecurity Council reform. We are all aware of the needto make the Security Council more inclusive and more representative of today’s realities and to make it moreeffective and transparent by continuing to improve itsworking methods.Africa should finally take its rightful place on theCouncil  in particular among the permanent members.It is also important to ensure adequate representationfor small States  which represent the vast majority ofthe Member States of the Organization.Luxembourg’s action in the United Nationssince 1945 can be summarized by three key words:commitment  solidarity  responsibility. Yet  althoughLuxembourg has consistently proved its solidarity andcommitment and has taken on responsibilities at theUnited Nations  it has not ever had the honour of servingon the Security Council. Building on its commitment topeacekeeping operations and peacebuilding activities Luxembourg declared its candidature 11 years agofor a non-permanent seat on the Security Council forthe period 2013-2014. Luxembourg stands ready toshare primary responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  which the StatesMembers of the United Nations have conferred on theSecurity Council under the Charter.Commitment to effective multilateralism does notdepend on size. During his official visit to Luxembourgon 17 April 2012  when he addressed our Parliamentand thus our country  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moonmade the following eloquent pronouncement:“You have shown that it is not the size of a nation’sterritory that makes the difference. It is the size of anation’s heart. It is the breadth of a nation’s vision.It is the depth of a nation’s promise to the widerworld.”That recognition honours us. It has further strengthenedLuxembourg’s resolve to prove itself up to the task andto serve the United Nations."
"105",4322,"LVA",67,2012,"﻿I commend the Secretary-General for his immense efforts in leading the United Nations and its Secretariat to fulfil its mission andimplement the tasks with which the Organization ischarged. The theme of this session is very timely. TheUnited Nations plays a leading role in the settlement ofdisputes by peaceful means. It possesses the legal andinstitutional framework to do so.States Members of the United Nations havecommitted themselves to the principles contained in theCharter. The peaceful settlement of disputes thereforeprimarily depends on the determination of the nationaland international leaders. Only if they are determinedcan the United Nations and other internationalorganizations and institutions arrive at decisions andtake action.Let me speak about some concrete challengesthat require strong will and decisive action by theinternational community. The conflict in Syria threatenssecurity and stability in the whole region and beyond.Latvia urges all members of the Security Council tofind the political will to unite and resolve that crisis.The lives of innocent people must be protected.The risk of the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction is one of the most serious global threats.The international community should be united in itscommitment to prevent it. Latvia is seriously concernedabout the potential use of Syria’s stockpiles of chemicalweapons.We deplore the lack of progress in dialogue withIran on the nature of its nuclear programme. We believethat its full cooperation to clarify all outstandingquestions is needed.We call for strengthening the efforts to reach thegoals of the the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons and its action plan. In that regard we applaud the steps taken by the United States andRussia towards global disarmament and transparency.We hope that they will trigger further efforts to reducethe reliance on nuclear weapons.Latvia also welcomes the consensus outcome ofthe second Review Conference on Small Arms andLight Weapons. We should redouble our efforts to findsolutions on the Arms Trade Treaty as soon as possible.Latvia welcomes the increasingly active roleplayed by regional organizations such as the AfricanUnion and the League of Arab States in the peacefulsettlement of conflicts. European regional organizations have also beenactively working towards the resolution of protractedconflicts in the wider Europe. We see a positivetrend towards a political settlement in Transnistria Republic of Moldova. However  only with progress onthe withdrawal of foreign troops will any settlementbe sustainable. A multinational peacekeeping missionwith an international mandate could be a rational wayforward.The consequences of the conflict in Georgia in2008 will have a long-lasting effect on the securitysituation in the region. The European Union MonitoringMission in Georgia is presently the only internationalplayer that monitors the implementation of the sixpointagreement. Gaining actual access to the occupiedterritories would contribute to lasting progress. Inaddition  the restoration of a meaningful presence ofthe United Nations in Georgia is needed.We remain concerned about the increasing numberof incidents at the contact line in Nagorno-Karabakh.The conflicting sides should abstain from hostile publicrhetoric and should concentrate on confidence-buildingmeasures. The conduct of major military exercises inthat volatile region should be avoided.Afghanistan has been at the centre of the world’sattention for much more than a decade. We believethat the international community is fully committed toassisting the Afghan Government in strengthening itspublic administration and the National Security Forces.Latvia will continue its involvement in the EuropeanUnion (EU) and NATO missions in Afghanistan. Wealso intend to participate in the missions after 2014. Inaddition  Latvia will provide a financial contribution tothe international fund in support of the Afghan NationalSecurity Forces.The future of Afghanistan is closely linked toeconomic development and regional cooperation.We encourage the full engagement of the CentralAsian countries in discussions on the region’s future.Afghanistan has the potential to become a regional hubfor transportation and transit. Using our experience asan entry point to the Northern Distribution Network Latvia is already engaged in training Afghan expertsin the areas of transportation and anti-drug trafficking.The global economic and financial crisis hasfocused leaders’ attention on immediate measures toovercome it  often diverting their attention from long-term global challenges. The world economy remainsfragile  even if some positive trends can be observed.Latvia welcomes all efforts to stabilize the situation inthe eurozone and supports recent steps in that regard.We are working hard to be part of the solution and tobecome a net contributor to global economic stability.Latvia’s own gross national product grew morethan 5.5 per cent in 2011. That positive trend is set tocontinue in 2012. Over the past decade  we have achievedsignificant progress with respect to both income andstructural convergence. The quality of governance andeconomic structures in Latvia is comparable to thatof the member countries of the Office of EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD). Looking tothe OECD’s expected enlargement  Latvia is ready tooffer its experience with transition and with the kind ofdecisive reforms that are leading us to recovery fromthe recent crisis.Overall  Latvia has emerged from the downturnstronger and more competitive  with a balancedeconomy and a positive business environment thatpositions us well for the next growth cycle. Above all the sustainability of economic health must go handin hand with the process of incorporation into theeurozone. Latvia believes that the challenges can beovercome and aims to introduce the euro in 2014.International peace and security are closely linkedwith two other pillars of the United Nations  namely development and human rights. Latvia welcomes theestablishment of the high-level panel on the post-2015development agenda. We are pleased that the EU’sCommissioner for Development  Mr. Andris Piebalgsof Latvia  will contribute to the panel’s work.The current framework of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals has revitalized global action ondevelopment and improved its effectiveness. Latvia’s EUpresidency in 2015 will evaluate the progress achievedand contribute actively to the agreement on post-2015framework  which should remain people-centred focused  time-bound and simple.In recent years we have witnessed a growing numberof people in many countries demanding freedom andjustice. The international community must supporttheir aspirations. We must help build stable democraticinstitutions and establish the rule of law. We believethat respect for human rights  good governance andinclusive economic development will help to preventfuture conflicts.Latvia participates in capacity-building in severalconflict and post-conflict countries. We actively supportnations in transition in their efforts to strengthen therule of law. We welcome the fact that those issues arenow part of the Secretary-General’s five-year ActionAgenda and we are committed to their implementation.Latvia believes that economic and socialdevelopment will benefit from the introduction of theprinciples of open Government. Civil society in Latviaactively participates in the decision-making process atall stages and levels.Latvia fully supports the work of a strong andeffective Human Rights Council. We have put forwardour candidacy for the elections to the Council in 2014.In order to keep pace with the modern world  theUnited Nations needs to change. The time has cometo start real negotiations on reforming the SecurityCouncil. We support the enlargement of the Council inboth the permanent and the non-permanent membershipcategories. Any enlargement of the Council shouldinclude at least one new non-permanent seat for theEastern European Group.The world is going through a period of turbulence as shown by recent violent events in the Middle East.We strongly condemn the attacks on diplomaticmissions in several countries as unacceptable. Latviafully supports the freedom of association and the rightto demonstrate peacefully. We deplore any attempts touse religion to fuel extremism and violence. Toleranceand respect for our differences are the key to preventingconflicts and violence  both in our communities andinternationally.Finally  Latvia looks forward to a fruitful sixtyseventhsession of the General Assembly. Let us addressthe challenges with true political will."
"106",4369,"MAR",67,2012,"﻿His Majesty King Mohammed VI asked me toconvey his appreciation and respect  and I am pleasedto read my speech at the sixty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly.First  I would like to warmly congratulate Mr. VukJeremić  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session  on his election. That election is a markof esteem for the friendly country of Serbia as much asit is a recognition of the vast diplomatic experience hebrings to the presidency.I also would like to commend Mr. Jeremić’spredecessor  Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  Presidentof the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  onhis efforts and achievements during the past year.Similarly  I would like to commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his untiring action and hiskeen desire to tackle crises. I applaud his initiativesaimed at enabling the United Nations to rise to thegrowing challenges facing our world.Sweeping changes are affecting today’sinternational arena. They include  in particular  aprotracted global economic crisis that has variousimplications and consequences. There are also a growingnumber of hotbeds of tension  political disputes andarmed conflicts  as well as complex global challengesthat exceed the capabilities of individual States  suchas achieving sustainable development  protecting theenvironment  ensuring respect for human rights andfighting against the growing scourge of internationalterrorism and all forms of organized crime.Given the current changes in the world  we  theStates Members of the United Nations  ought to providethe Organization with the means it needs to tackle thosechallenges. To that end  we must expand the scope ofthe Organization’s actions and revitalize its approach while preserving its principles and purposes  so as tomake it an active player in ensuring effective politicalgovernance and an instrument for equitable economicgovernance.The Kingdom of Morocco fully backs the decisionto give special importance to resolving disputes bypeaceful means. My country applauds the GeneralAssembly’s decision to make the strengtheing of theforemost principle in the Charter of the United Nationsthe key objective of the current session.Achieving international peace and security remainsthe core historic mission entrusted to the United Nations.The tens of thousands of United Nations peacekeepersserving throughout the world to protect civilians andworking to bring about the right conditions for politicaldialogue between the concerned parties clearly attest tothe vital role played by our Organization in that regard.The Kingdom of Morocco takes pride in being oneof the first States to have contributed to peacekeepingoperations under the United Nations banner. So far my country has sent more than 50 000 members ofthe Royal Armed Forces to places around the world toserve in promoting the lofty objectives of the UnitedNations. Morocco will remain committed to managingcrises and will support efforts to promote preventivediplomacy.The experience gained by the United Nations inconflict-affected countries points to the importanceof securing smooth  systematic transition from peacerestoration to peace consolidation. That requires  aboveall  a prompt response to the pressing needs raised bycurrent developments and threats. Otherwise  the threatof a return to violence and partition will continue tohang over the countries and regions concerned.During the past year  the African continent has seena serious deterioration in the situation on the continent particularly in the Sahel and the Sahara regions  owingto criminal  terrorist and separatist activities  whichnow threaten the stability of the countries concerned.Our sister nation  the Republic of Mali  isconfronted with a situation that threatens the countryand its national unity and territorial integrity. Despitethe sincere efforts exerted by countries in the region including Morocco and the Economic Community ofWest African States  the contribution of the UnitedNations is also needed in order to achieve nationalconsensus  overcome the political crisis and confrontseparatist activities in the north. Only an independent focused effort on the part of the United Nations canhelp achieve those objectives. I should like  in thatrespect  to reiterate to our brothers in Mali Morocco’scommitment to continue to provide them with aid and  active support for the success of the political processand the preservation of their country’s national unityand territorial integrity.At the same time  the Kingdom of Morocco laudsthe notable progress made in several parts of Africa especially in the sister nations of Côte d’Ivoire andthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  towards thepromotion of national reconciliation and a return topolitical normalcy. Moreover  Morocco reiteratesits firm commitment to pursuing cooperation andsolidarity programmes with various African sisternations  using efficient  dy!аmic approaches to South-South cooperation for the benefit of African citizens.The changes witnessed in the Arab region reflectthe will of the peoples involved to build democraticsocieties where human rights are respected and wherecitizens enjoy equal opportunities and a dignified life.The peoples in the sister nations of Tunisia  Libya  Egyptand Yemen have ushered in a new era and have madegreat headway towards a democratic transition  despitea complex and tumultuous political environment  afact that makes it incumbent upon the internationalcommunity to provide support and assistance to thosecountries to deal with the constraints and difficultiesthat they face.It is  on the other hand  most regrettable that theSyrian people are each day paying a daily price inblood for their freedom. They yearn for the kind ofdemocratic change that would enable each componentof the Syrian population to contribute to achieving thedesired change. Morocco  as the only Arab countrysitting on the Security Council  has significantlycontributed to mobilizing international support for theLeague of Arab States’ initiatives and resolutions. Wecall for concerted efforts and decisive action to compelthe Syrian regime to put an end to the violence. Wealso call for a political transition process that wouldallow for the full spectrum of opinions to be heard the aspirations of the Syrian people to be fulfilled  andSyria’s national unity and territorial integrity  as wellas for stability in the entire region  to be ensured.At the same time  it is necessary to raise the financialresources required to meet the needs of refugeesin neighbouring countries and those of internallydisplaced persons  as well as to ease the suffering ofour Syrian brothers and put an end to their tragedy. Inthat regard  Morocco continues to show its solidarity by providing medical services on a daily basis to Syrianrefugees in the sisterly Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.The rapid developments in the Arab region mustnot distract us from the fundamental  longstandingchallenge of resolving the Palestinian issue. Inthat regard  the Kingdom of Morocco calls for themobilization of international support to back the stepstaken by the Palestinian National Authority to securenon-member State status. At the same time  my countryis of the view that negotiations are the best way for thePalestinian people to regain their legitimate nationalrights and to set up an independent  fully viable andgeographically contiguous Palestinian State  living sideby side with Israel  in peace and security. I therefore lookforward to seeing the international community changeits approach to resolving that crisis by reconsideringits intervention mechanisms and work methods in orderto ensure that direct negotiations are resumed verysoon and in the best possible circumstances  under theauspices and with the commitment of the inf luentialPowers.That cannot be achieved if the fait accomplipolicy is allowed to continue. In that regard and in mycapacity as Chair of the Al-Quds Committee  I havestrongly condemned the Israeli plan for the Judaizationof occupied East Jerusalem  as well as the Israeli plansto wipe out the city’s spiritual and cultural identityand change its demographic and urban features. Letme reaffirm  in that regard  that there can be no peacewithout East Jerusalem as the capital of an independentPalestinian state.Steadfast in its belief in the importance andeffectiveness of joint regional action  the Kingdomof Morocco has undertaken initiatives and bilateralcontacts to inject fresh momentum into the ArabMaghreb Union. Indeed  my country believes that sucha strategic  inclusive regional bloc is urgently needed;not only does it meet the legitimate aspirations of ourpeoples  but it is also necessitated by the security anddevelopment challenges facing the five Maghreb States.In a bid to overcome obstacles that might hinder therealization of that Maghreb ambition  the Kingdom ofMorocco has contributed in a sincere  dedicated mannerto negotiations aimed at finding a realistic  mutuallyacceptable political solution to the artificial regionaldispute over the Moroccan Sahara — a solution thatwould guarantee the Kingdom’s national unity andterritorial integrity  allow for reunification to take place  and respect the characteristics of the region’spopulations.Morocco remains committed and willing tonegotiate on the basis of the principles established andrepeatedly reaffirmed by the Security Council  as wellas the autonomy initiative  which the internationalcommunity has deemed serious  realistic and credible.Morocco will also continue to cooperate constructivelywith the United Nations Mission for the Referendum inWestern Sahara  on the basis of the mandate entrustedto it by the Security Council — a mandate that will notchange in any way; neither in form nor substance.I cannot conclude without referring to the need forcollective  effective and concerted action against allforms of extremism  hatred  xenophobia  provocationand rejection of those different from us and theundermining of their beliefs  for whatever reason andin whichever form. Given the increase in appallingacts of that kind  often with tragic consequences  Ibelieve national efforts to tackle them must be part ofa concerted international strategy that should take intoaccount existing constructive initiatives  build on themobilization of all United Nations bodies  be based onclear commitments  and encourage law-making and thedissemination of national and regional best practices inthat area.It is up to us as Member States to provide thenecessary means and to reiterate our political will tosupport the Organization and reform its structures andintervention mechanisms. The aim is to enhance itseffectiveness in terms of achieving peace and securityand promoting cooperation  while enabling it to fulfilits indispensable mission of furthering tolerance andcoexistence  for the benefit of all mankind."
"107",4393,"MCO",67,2012,"﻿TheSecretary-General has shared with us the priorities thathe plans to implement during the sixty-seventh sessionof the General Assembly. His warning concerningthe multiplicity of new threats and his clear-sightedrecognition of their interconnections should inspire andguide our work.The maintenance of international peace andsecurity — need it be said again — are the veryessence of the mission of our Organization. Whatdo we see before us? Crises and threats to peace andsecurity are multiplying and are often even mutuallyreinforcing  along with the endangerment of humanrights. What global vision do we share of the challengesthat confront our planet  its States and its peoples? Bybearing in mind that it is our mission and urgent needto uphold our vision  which calls on us to support thefive priorities of the programme of action that havebeen drawn up for the next five years and submittedto us by the Secretary-General. Since he has invitedus to so  we wish to underline the need to prioritizethe strengthening of the United Nations system as wellas the development of partnerships in all areas of itsactivity.The President rightly sought to focus the generaldebate of this session on the subject of the peacefulsettlement of international situations and disputes. Thishistoric debate  launched at the beginning of the weekby the General Assembly  has shown that respect for therule of law  at both the national and the internationallevels  is indispensable for the establishment ofresponsible societies that are able to promote  cooperation and ensure the well-being of their citizens.Recent history leads us to take a serious look at thecurrent difficulties confronting the world. While lastyear we welcomed the magnificent spark of democracythat was kindled in the Arab world  it is intolerable nowthat minority factions and extremists are threateningthe hopes and dampening the expectations of peoplewho aspire to live in liberty.The Government of the Principality of Monacoechoes those who have condemned the acts of violenceperpetrated both by the authorities and by oppositiongroups in the Syrian Arab Republic  where thesituation only continues to deteriorate. I would alsolike to convey my full support for the efforts made bythe International Committee of the Red Cross and itsresolve in seeking to ensure that humanitarian needsare met. Clearly  that is involves ensuring that each andevery one respect the rule of international humanitarianlaw as the minimum requirement for meeting the basic elementary moral standards of our peoples  standardsthat do not  unfortunately  seem to be shared by all.We are equally concerned by the recent events inthe Sahel region  including in Mali  which are growingworse. The Principality of Monaco  which is involved invarious humanitarian efforts in the region  supports allsuch actions by the international community  given theurgency and gravity of the situation. We will supporta strategy established by the United Nations that canaddress the issues of security  governance  development human rights and humanitarian aspects. The values thatwe are committed to uphold in adopting the Charter ofthe United Nations are based on our common humanityand on the recognition of our differences  which are atthe very core of our humanity.Allow me  in that regard  to pay tribute to all thosewho have been committed to serving those values onthe ground  often paying with their lives. They seek touphold the aims and principles that bring us togetherhere in this forum. Our authorities have resolutelycondemned all attacks perpetrated against diplomaticand consular missions and personnel. We must allensure the obligation of guaranteeing their protectionin all circumstances.At a time when the world is facing worryingdevelopments  the theme that the President has selectedfor this session of the General Assembly merits theunanimous support of all in our community. Aware ofthe challenges  I would like to take the opportunity tocommend Mr. Vuk Jeremić  President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session  on his electionand to assure the Assembly of my delegation’s fullsupport.More than ever before  we need to resort to thepeaceful settlement of our disputes and seek to preventrather than react to events. In the 1950s  Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld urged us to be mindful ofthe need to respond at an early stage to crises in orderto avoid the outbreak of disputes between parties or theconf lagration of a dispute into an open conflict  or inthe event that a conflict does break out  to ensure thatit can be contained.We have been caught unaware and so many ongoingproblems in the year 2012 have gone unsolved. We havebeen largely successful in ensuring that internationallaw prevails over the right to wage war. However  theinvolvement of our Organization in conflict preventionstill falls quite short  as avowals and statements of intenton their own are insufficient. It is therefore our commonduty to strengthen understanding  tolerance and mutualrespect. As was recalled by the Secretary-General hereon 13 September  as well as by his predecessor  one ofthe strongest factors for conflict prevention  and thusfor the inculcation of an authentic culture of peace  iseducation. That kind of prevention is aimed at enrollingthe young generations to whom we owe a future.The challenges are manifold. Among them  I wouldsingle out the economic and financial crisis  which hasaffected the overwhelming majority of our States since2008. We can overcome the crisis  creating employmentwhile protecting our environmental heritage. Butin order to do so  we need an ambitious long-termvision  and that is why  in spite of the budget cuts the crisis has compelled us to realize that we cannotafford to lose sight of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals — elimination of poverty and hunger; education;child and maternal health; and combatting pandemics including HIV/AIDS and malaria  which sap humankindof its strength — which must remain uppermost on ouragenda.The upcoming deadline must encourage us to dostill more to intensify our efforts in order to ensure theirachievement. In 2015  we will adopt a new programmeof action  based on the results achieved and on the newchallenges to be met.In his address to the United Nations Conference onSustainable Development  His Serene Highness Prince Albert II of the Principality of Monaco welcomed thefact that we are progressing towards a shared definitionof sustainable development goals. Those goals willframe our actions at the international  national and locallevels  and in turn  that will make the implementation ofour commitments more effective and more transparent.One of those objectives should emphasizethe sustainable development of oceans and on theimportance of the blue economy.That objective should concern all sectors thatdepend on ocean resources and maritime areas. Itis urgent that that objective be comprehensive andsustainable so that those sectors can continue to benefitfrom economic  social and environmental services.Accordingly  our delegation will support all initiativesseeking to improve the coordination and effectivenessof the United Nations work in the oceans. Indeed  webelieve that that is the right path to follow in order toultimately ensure the sustainable use and managementof the oceans and thereby their conservation.The fate of future generations lies in our hands.For that reason  we are obliged to ensure that the DohaClimate Change Conference is a success. It is thereforecrucial that we reach agreement on the establishmentof a second period of commitments under the KyotoProtocol. We therefore commit ourselves to workingpositively and effectively in the negotiations on reachinga new global post-2020 climate agreement  taking intoaccount the needs of the most vulnerable.His Serene Highness Prince Albert II welcomesthe celebration next year of the twentieth anniversaryof Monaco’s joining the United Nations as a MemberState. In that connection  Monaco wishes to expressits resolve to contribute to the further strengthening ofour Organization to the extent that a small State cando so. Members may rest assured that the Principalitywelcomes the Assembly’s two-fold intention offurther involving itself in the field of developmentand establishing an advisory framework that seeks toenhance the cooperation between the General Assemblyand international financial institutions.On the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of theForum of Small States  of which Monaco is a member and also in its capacity as a member of the GlobalGovernance Group  the Principality intends to play itsfull role in the work of those bodies. The magnitude ofthe challenges and crises that we all face have shownthat the size of a State is not the deciding factor whenit comes to resolving such problems. Rather  it is solelyour ability to work together and cooperate that enablesus to respond to everyday needs and that will lead us onthe path towards international peace and security."
"108",4418,"MDA",67,2012,"﻿At theoutset  I would like to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremićon his election as President of the General Assembly atits sixty-seventh session and to wish him every successin that highly honourable and important role. I amconvinced that his rich experience will contribute to theachievement of significant results in our work together.I convey my appreciation as well to his predecessor Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  for the exemplarymanner in which he led the sixty-sixth session. I alsowish to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his ongoing efforts to revitalize the globalrole of the United Nations and to bring reforms to theOrganization.It is a great honour for me to speak from thisrostrum for the first time on behalf of the people ofthe Republic of Moldova. Twenty-one years ago  mycountry broke away from the Soviet empire  and todayit is undergoing a process of democratic transformation with membership in the European Union as its ultimategoal. After a period of several years marked by politicalturmoil  my country now enjoys political stability which allows it to develop and modernize. We havefirmly defined European integration as our objectiveand have revived the economic and social reforms. Ourpriorities are the establishment of the rule of law andcomprehensive judicial reform  with an emphasis onfighting corruption  modernization of the economy andreintegration of the country.The support and assistance provided by ourEuropean partners from Brussels and United NationsMember States are extremely important for us andassure us that we are on the right path. Two decadesago  on the very day the Republic of Moldova joined the United Nations  the peace in my country was shaken.The armed conflict in the Transnistrian region of theRepublic of Moldova lasted for five months and causedthe loss of many lives. It was a tragic period that  whilenow past  continues to pose a serious challenge inthe present. Since the end of the hostilities  Moldovahas firmly embarked on the road towards a peacefulsettlement of that conflict. Twenty years of negotiationshave strengthened our belief that that is the only viablepath to follow in order to reach a political settlement.It is obvious that the perpetuation of the conflictdoes not offer any real benefit to the majority of thepeople on either bank of the Nistru river. It underminesour national security and territorial integrity  hamperseconomic development and divides our society.Moreover  the conflict keeps the population of theTransnistrian region in isolation  incites human rightsviolations and generates economic stagnation onthe left bank of the Nistru. The current political andeconomic trends show that preserving the status quo isnot a viable scenario anymore. All of our internationalpartners share the view that there is no alternative toa reunified Moldova. Our message in that regard isfirm – 20 years are enough to overcome the mistrust ofthe past and it is time to start building a shared future.The key elements in the approach of the Moldovanauthorities to resolving the conflict are also clear.Our ultimate goal is to reintegrate the Republic ofMoldova within its internationally recognized bordersas a functional State with a clear European perspective.The Transnistrian region should be granted a specialstatus within Moldova  which will provide the regionwith a comfortable level of self-governance. Definingthe special status is the core task of the politicalnegotiations in the “5+2” format. That negotiationprocess should lead to a reasonable compromise basedon the principles of the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of the Republic of Moldova.In parallel  we will continue to implementconfidence-building measures aimed at bringingcommunities from both banks of the Nistru Rivercloser to each other. By promoting business links ensuring freedom of movement  protecting humanrights  improving security and combating criminality we will prepare a better ground for a political solution.Transformation of the existing military peacekeepingmechanism into an international civilian mission aimedat building confidence rather than separating the sideshas also become an imperative. Our international partners provide an essentialcontribution to bringing that conflict to an end. Growingassistance from the European Union is an encouragingexample in that regard. The negotiation process nowneeds a strong stimulus  and we believe that ourinternational partners can demonstrate the necessarypolitical will to that end. We call on the 5+2 formatnegotiators  namely  the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe  the Russian Federation Ukraine  the European Union and the United States ofAmerica  to pool their efforts and work together towardsthe final resolution of the Transnistrian conflict andreintegration of the Republic of Moldova.It is also important to reiterate that Russian forcesare still present on the territory of the Republic ofMoldova  without the consent of the host country and inbreach of the Moldovan Constitution and internationalcommitments  and they should be finally withdrawn.The universal character of the United Nations andits unique role in managing international relationsare widely recognized. There is no alternative tothis Organization. Yet  globalization and the globalfinancial crisis have demonstrated the need to reformthe Organization in order to ensure the progressiveand sustainable strengthening of the United Nations. Iam referring in particular to Security Council reform to which a compromise solution should be found. Webelieve that any proposal for its reform should take intoaccount the legitimate aspirations of all regional groups including granting an additional non-permanent seat tothe Eastern European States.In its capacity as a member of the Human RightsCouncil  the Committee on Conferences  the Policy andProgramme Coordination Committee  the Committeeon Information  the Commission for Population andDevelopment and other United Nations elective bodies the Republic of Moldova will continue to supportefforts towards the comprehensive reform of theUnited Nations system and its main bodies and organs including the revitalization of the General Assemblyand the reform of the Security Council aimed atenhancing the efficiency  transparency  accountabilityand representativeness of the system.The relationship between the United Nations andregional organizations is of paramount importance forthe maintenance of international peace and security. Inmany instances  all those organizations have uniqueand complementary capacities that  when properlycoordinated  can contribute decisively to the prevention and management of conflicts  including protractedones. From that point of view  during this session wewill strongly support the consideration by the GeneralAssembly of the issue of cooperation between theUnited Nations and regional organizations  particularlythe Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope  the Council of Europe  the Black Sea EconomicCooperation Organization and other organizations.In the same context  considering the distinctobjective devoted to democracy and economicdevelopment  the increased potential and role in economicdevelopment and regional integration  as well as thestrong determination of the countries of the Georgia Ukraine  Azerbaijan  Moldova (GUAM) Organizationfor Democracy and Economic Development to activelycontribute to international security  stability and peace the delegations of its member States have decided toadvance for consideration of the General Assemblyduring its current session a draft resolution oncooperation between the United Nations and GUAM.At this stage  the process of development andintegration of our States is still burdened by someoutstanding problems  including unresolved conflictsin the territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan Georgia and the Republic of Moldova. We reaffirm ourunswerving commitment to finding peaceful solutionsto those conflicts on the basis of respect for thesovereignty and territorial integrity of our countries.Promoting the rule of law at the national andinternational levels is at the heart of the United Nationsmission and is fundamental to achieving durable peace supporting openness in Government  the effectiveprotection of human rights and sustained economicgrowth and development. We emphasize the importanceof the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly onthe Rule of Law at the National and International Levels(A/67/PV.3)  held on 24 September  and will continueto support efforts in that direction during the sixtyseventhsession. In our view  strengthening the rule oflaw will help to maintain peace  promote developmentand enhance cooperation  and is therefore conducive tothe achievement of the goal of building a harmoniousworld.The non-proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  disarmament and the efficient control ofarmaments remain vital topics on the internationalcooperation agenda  which need the commonunderstanding  political will and engaged efforts of allStates and international organizations. The Republic of Moldova fully supports the international communityin exerting continuous control of and applying thenecessary preventive measures against unlawfulattempts to develop weapons of mass destruction andtheir means of delivery  which pose a real threat tointernational security and are often used to challengethe existing world order.The Republic of Moldova established significantobjectives and is undertaking tangible steps inaccomplishing its priorities in the field of arms control.In cooperation with our partners  the Government ofthe Republic of Moldova is in the process of adjustingto the best international standards  adopting dual-usegoods export control legislation  improving small armsand light weapons management for civilians and themilitary  ensuring proper border management  andactively cooperating at the regional and internationallevels.Military conflicts in different regions of the planetand the global economic crises have brought humanrights issues once again to our attention. The principlesof international law and human rights standards canbe promoted only by joint efforts and decisions. Actsof aggression  including attacks against the personneland integrity of diplomatic facilities  represent aviolation of international norms and deserve our firmcondemnation. The relevant bodies of the UnitedNations  including the Human Rights Council  havesufficient instruments to take action on behalf of Statesin order to prevent human rights violations  conductcountry evaluations and provide tailored solutions.As a member of the Human Rights Council for theterm of 2010 to 2013 and  as Vice-Chair of the ThirdCommittee at its previous session  the Republic ofMoldova continuously pledges to keep an open mindin furthering the cause of promoting and protectinghuman rights worldwide.The world economic crisis is an incentivefor putting into practice the idea of sustainabledevelopment  which could simultaneously providesolutions for maintaining the pace of economic growthand prevent climate change. We support the renewalof the global commitment made at the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development  held in Rio deJaneiro  Brazil  and the agreement on establishing thesustainable development goals (see resolution 66/288 annex). We believe that promoting a green economymodel will help enterprises to reconfigure in order tostreamline natural  human and economic investments. Finally  I would like to reiterate that the Republicof Moldova is a strong supporter of the United Nationsrole in global governance and the management ofinternational crises. We believe in the potential andcapacities of the United Nations to find adequateresponses and take concrete actions aimed at resolvingthe ever-increasing global challenges. The Republic ofMoldova is definitely contributing to that activity."
"109",4461,"MDG",67,2012,"﻿AsPresident of the Transition of Madagascar  it is a greathonour for me to participate in the general debate ofthe United Nations for the second time. The theme of the sixty-seventh session is akin to a call for unity for shared contemplation and for generally revisitingexistential questions and human values in the face ofsituations around the world where peace is extremelyprecarious.The last few years have indeed been marked bydifferences of opinion  political disputes and conflictsof interest. The world today faces new challenges tostability and the maintenance of peace. Various effortsand initiatives have been undertaken to deal withconflicts that are not homogeneous and disputes thatdo not always play out along the same lines. People’sinterests differ and their approaches are not all equal.Today the list of the forms that global conflictstake leads us to an obvious reality: geostrategicvariations conform to no one rule  and they are inperpetual f lux. The wise words of Secretary-GeneralBan Ki-moon in his statement at the opening of thesixteenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement seemparticularly revealing in that context. Did he not stressthat among the challenges that must be met  there areall too many political disputes between member Statesof the Non-Aligned Movement itself? Did he not urgethe protagonists in the Syrian crisis to immediatelyinstitute a ceasefire and a halt to the violence? And yetwe can only deplore the fact that his call produced noresult. Scores of innocent people are still dying everyday  and over recent months they now number in thethousands. We firmly condemn this loss of human life.The Earth continues to run with the blood of innocents spilled violently not only in Syria but in other parts ofthe world as well.Given this state of affairs  despite the complexityof the challenges those conflicts present  the Secretary-General has not stood idle. We can only commend hisdetermination to strive tirelessly to seek a negotiatedsettlement. States and other bodies must join forcesto maintain peace  stability and security in the world.We cannot be passive witnesses to current or futuredisasters. The Republic of Madagascar sets particularstore by the relevance and importance of the principlesset forth in the United Nations Charter  as a sourceof inspiration as well as a pillar of support for theinterdependence of nations and peoples. That being thecase  human rights  the law of States  the rule of lawand the other international regulatory tools place beforeleaders their responsibilities.The League of Nations defined the rule of law as aprinciple of governance based on the submission of all individuals and institutions  including the State  to theadopted and published laws  without distinction as tosocial or economic status; on the equality of everyonebefore an independent  impartial justice system; and onthe harmonization of national laws with internationalhuman rights standards. No one should be above thelaw  and the culture of impunity must be banished.Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria)  Vice-President  took theChair.National conflicts today transcend borders and arebecoming international problems. More than ever  therole of diplomacy and international negotiations facedifficulties. The consequences of disputes play out in anumber of ways  including with problems of impunity instability in the Arab and Muslim world  the case ofSomali piracy  illegal immigrations  persons displacedby war  problems regarding the Rom issue  religiousconfrontations  management of land and sea borders and food insecurity. It is undeniable that much remainsto be done to save human lives  because still civilianpopulations remain the primary victims of conflictsand disputes throughout the world.The world is in upheaval  and many countries are ina situation of transition. Their peoples demand changeand hope for sustainable development. Those countriesneed to be supported and encouraged  not sanctioned.In that context  allow me to highlight the case of myown country  Madagascar.Madagascar is a country emerging from crisis thanks to the involvement of the bodies of the SouthernAfrican Development Community and the support ofthe African Union  the Indian Ocean Commission andthe International Organization of la Francophonie. Aroad map was signed and adopted by the Malagasypolitical parties in September 2011. Thus  severalsignificant steps have been taken. The Malagasy partieshave honoured their commitments. All the transitionalinstitutions have been set up  including a national unityGovernment and the transitional Parliament. The roadmap  which we can call a political agreement  hasallowed us to launch the electoral process.Madagascar needs to take its destiny into its ownhands  to write its own history  and to end the cycle ofpolitical instability through the holding of credible andtransparent elections  guaranteed by the establishmentof the Independent National Electoral Commissionof the Transition. Above all  recently  in concert withUnited Nations experts  the electoral timetable for Madagascar was officially announced  including theholding of presidential elections scheduled for 8 May2013. Thus I launch a solemn appeal to all internationalpartners  all Member States and friends of Madagascarto support us and encourage us in that approach  whichis the only and most democratic path forward.Profoundly committed to the values of solidarity tolerance and peace  Madagascar is now searching forswift development and a better future. During the threeand a half years of transition and despite all attemptsat destabilization  we have worked tirelessly every dayto honour our commitments and ensure the protectionof our countrymen  all the while addressing socialproblems. In spite of challenging times  and despite thesuspension of international aid and subsidies  whichonce accounted for 60 per cent of the State budget  wehave been able to keep the administration functioningnormally and have honoured all our commitments anddebts.Madagascar is indeed one of the least developedcountries. Nevertheless  it is one of the least indebtedcountries in the world since its debt amounts to only5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP)  comparedto other countries whose debt rate can reach up to238 per cent of GDP. Therefore  it is possible to developour country and create our wealth through our ownresources. That is the challenge that we are meeting.Now it is high time to embark on in-depth reformto create an effective system that meets the highestexpectations of our respective populations — notforgetting  obviously  the need to double or even tripleour commitments to fighting poverty and promotingsustainable development. Here today  I launch an appealfor international solidarity to channel the transitiontowards the building of a more promising future — butwithout stif ling us.The Malagasy people need their full and entireindependence  but above all they must be able tohold transparent and therefore democratic elections.I know that everyone here is sincerely willing to lendus support. So allow me to give the Assembly thesolution. The best way to help us is to trust us  honourthe commitments made and let us shoulder our ownresponsibilities. In the name of universal values andprinciples  anyone meeting the conditions of eligibilitydictated by law is fully entitled to exercise that liberty.That is a fundamental principle  and all States mustrespect it. The Malagasy people alone — not othercountries or external pressure — have the sovereign right to decide who should guide their destiny. TheMalagasy people alone will choose the man or womanwho will lead Madagascar.If confidence is shown in the Malagasy people  theywill be grateful. The concepts of non-interference andrespect for the sovereignty of each country establishmutual trust  which is a basic rule for all internationalnegotiations. They are among the peaceful meansneeded to build lasting peace. Efforts must be madeto put an end to the inequalities in how countries inpolitical crisis are treated. The realities on the groundand popular aspirations must be acknowledged in orderto avoid making the wrong decision.Despite our disagreements and our differences onhow to achieve a peaceful settlement of our conflicts we the States Members of the United Nations areunanimous in our firm desire for peace. The UnitedNations system cannot just be the police of the world;it also needs to be a source of hope and of values. Oursocieties need to exist and find their way throughtheir own values  because it is social and economicills  injustice  the lack of protection for vulnerablepopulations and intolerance for minorities that oftencause States to collapse.As far as its modest means allow  the Republic ofMadagascar is determined to contribute to achievingour shared goals. The peace accord is fragile and needsto develop. To quote Martin Luther King  Jr.  “Allprogress is precarious  and the solution of one problembrings us face to face with another problem”. It is ourduty and responsibility to provide a better future for thegenerations to come. Global stability requires tolerance assistance  the creation and equitable sharing of wealth and poverty reduction through sustainable developmentand reconciliation. The principles of adjustment orsettlement of international disputes by peaceful meansrequires a return to our values  gender balance andequality  and  above all  democratic alternation. Godbless our nation!"
"110",4501,"MDV",67,2012,"﻿At the outset  I express mydelegation’s warmest congratulations to the President onassuming office to preside over the General Assemblyat its sixty-seventh session. I would like to record ourdeepest appreciation to his predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  for his untiring effortsin steering the deliberations of the sixty-sixth session toa successful conclusion.I also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his extraordinaryreport (A/67/1) presented to the Assembly on Tuesday.Despite the many unprecedented challenges facing theUnited Nations today  we remain confident that theSecretary-General’s leadership and the resolve of theOrganization and of humankind will not waver.I represent a small yet proud island nation that haslong advocated for an effective international frameworkfor the security of small States  that has vigorouslycampaigned for international actions to combat climatechange and that has contributed to breaking theinternational silence on the human rights implicationsof climate change.I come from a nation that has successfully movedfrom an authoritarian system to a multiparty democraticsystem of governance — a historic transition achievedpurely by peaceful means. That is why Maldivians showtheir solidarity with people everywhere in the worldwho struggle to replace despotism with democracy.That is why we support the ongoing democratizationprocess in the Middle East and North Africa  and thatis why we applaud Tunisia and Egypt for holding theirfirst post-transition elections in a free and fair manner.While the democratization processes in othercountries in the region are on an upward trajectory  wesee violence and human rights violations in Syria. Weurge the Syrian security forces and anti-Governmentarmed groups to immediately cease all hostilities andviolence. We welcome the latest findings of the UnitedNations commission of inquiry on the human rightssituation in Syria.We strongly believe that tolerance and mutualrespect should prevail among different religions andcultures to ensure that the world we live in remainspeaceful and harmonious for the future of our children.The Maldives strongly condemns the recent anti-Islamicvideo demeaning our Prophet Muhammad — peace beupon him. Freedom of expression should not be used asan excuse to insult religions  incite hatred or provokecommunal violence. While the video has provokeddemonstrations around the world  the Maldives doesnot believe that violence is the way to respond to suchlow-level blasphemous acts.The Maldives has also condemned the attack onthe United States Consulate in Benghazi  which tookthe life of the United States Ambassador to Libya. Onbehalf of the Maldivian people  I express my deepestcondolences to the United States Government and thefamilies of the bereaved.My delegation and I express the wishes of theMaldivian people to see the day that the Palestinianpeople join the United Nations as a full Member. TheMaldives strongly calls on all Member States to supportthe true aspirations of the Palestinian people and theirright to self-determination in a Palestinian State.In June we  the leaders of the world  agreedto signal our solid political commitment towardsestablishing sustainable development goals. We believethat those goals would further strengthen the social economic and environmental well-being of nations.The 2015 development agenda should recognize theparticular characteristics and needs of small States. Itshould support the creation of a stronger internationalarchitecture to achieve a sustainable future for all.Climate change remains the most important andcomplex developmental challenge that small States face.We face the threat of rising sea levels. We experienceocean acidification  changes in average temperatureand variable precipitation. Coastal erosion is a seriousproblem in the Maldives  affecting more than 113islands. An additional 120 islands need emergencywater during the dry season. The Government nowspends more than 27 per cent of our national budget onbuilding our resilience to combat the effects of climatechange.The Maldives reiterates its call for a bindingagreement to reduce global carbon emissions. The worldcannot afford to wait any longer for such an agreement;nor can we. The absence of a global accord is no excusefor doing nothing. The Maldives is one of the smallestisland economies in the world. Our contribution toglobal emissions is 0.003 per cent  yet we are the mostvulnerable to the effects of climate change. For thatreason  we are also taking difficult and bold measuresto combat climate change. We were among the firstcountries in the world to eradicate chlorof luorocarbonswell ahead of time. We intend to become the first toeradicate hydrochlorof luorocarbons (HCFCs) by 2020.And we intend to become the first to ban the importof HCFC-based equipment. A number of our islandsare also scaling up renewable energy  not only to avoidspending 20 per cent of our gross domestic producton importing fossil fuel  but also to reduce harmfulemissions.Hence  we are converting to solar or hybrid sources.A total of 20 islands in the Maldives will switch torenewable energy sources for power by next year. Thosemeasures are part of a national initiative to transformthe country’s economy into a low-carbon one. If wecan take those measures  why cannot the larger States endowed with more resources  take stronger measures?That requires political commitment and difficultchoices. I therefore call upon carbon-emitting countriesto develop and utilize clean and renewable energy toreduce their carbon footprint.Climate change is just one of many challengesfaced by the Maldives. The country’s transition todemocracy  which has reached a critical point  isanother pressing challenge that we are determined toovercome. Four years ago  the Maldives held its firstcompetitive  multiparty presidential elections. Thatwas a watershed moment in the country’s long marchtowards democratic governance. Four years afterthat historic election  in October 2008  people in theMaldives ask if their lives are any better. The answer regrettably  is  not yet. Multiparty democracy in theMaldives has so far been deeply divisive. It is alsopolarizing  tearing apart families and the fabric of asmall  homogenous society. Political leaders electedto office by popular vote chose to act with impunity.Centuries-old values of respect and tolerance have beenreplaced by intolerance and hatred in the islands wherealmost everyone literally knows everybody else. Thatis not because there is any inherent deficiency in thedemocratic form of governance; rather  it is becausethe road to liberal democracy is always rocky and longand must be navigated by a political leadership with anunshakeable commitment to the principles and valuesof democracy.The past eight months have been particularlychallenging for the consolidation of democracy in mycountry. The elected President of the country resignedin February  and later claimed that he was forced to doso. The Government opened a commission of inquiry toinvestigate the allegations. Some of our friends rushedto conclusions  and that did not make it any easier forus. Some big States and some not so big States tooksides in a domestic political crisis and contributed tomaking a bad situation worse. While the Governmentwas striving to strengthen the country’s institutionalcapacity to manage the new democracy  someinternational actors continued to publicly criticize thecountry’s young institutions.We look for new ideas and are receptive to goodones  irrespective of where they come from. Thatis why we engage in international cooperation. Weexpect the result of international cooperation to help not hinder  a country’s march towards a better  moredemocratic society. It is supposed to build a country’sinstitutions and to gain public confidence. Internationalcooperation should not be used to undermine nationalcapacities. It should not be used as an excuse for largercountries to interfere in the domestic politics of smallStates.Small States are vulnerable in many ways. Wealone are not able to stop larger and stronger countriesfrom dictating terms. Our vulnerability is particularlyacute when there is discord and system breakdowns inour countries. This is the time when the larger Statesshould help the smaller States in the internationalsystem.The history of a nation is never a single event ora single person. The life of our nation is composed ofthe lives of all of us who live there. We are the buildingblocks in the evolution of our countries. The knowledge education  experience and commitment we bring toour nation are what shapes our history. They make ourhistory unique. Respect for us and our small nationrequires that our external partners not underestimateour capacity to contribute to the shaping of our owndestiny. Nations must be allowed to resolve theirproblems on their own. The international communityshould not take punitive actions against any sovereignState unless there is verifiable and blatant abuse ofhuman rights.Yet I believe that international cooperation canand should promote positive change in emergingdemocracies. I believe that international organizationssuch as the United Nations can play a pivotal role instrengthening democratic institutions in such nations.I believe that some of the advanced democraciescan also help small States with technical expertise inconsolidating democracy.To do that  it is important to recognize the uniquechallenges and characteristics of small States. It isimportant to protect the social fabric of the tightly knitsocieties in our countries. It is important to reviewcurrent approaches and modalities for extendinginternational cooperation in the promotion of democracy.It is important that international cooperation not beseen to be promoting a particular ideology. It shouldnot be seen to be taking sides in domestic politics.International cooperation should be seen to promote andencourage a home-grown democracy that is consistentwith universally accepted values and principles.Regular  free and fair elections are a fundamentalcomponent in any democracy. Yet holding elections isnot  by itself  a sufficient condition for consolidatingdemocracy. It requires patience. It requires making hardchoices and compromises. And it requires cultivatingand nurturing democratic values. My Government isimplementing a comprehensive plan to nurture suchvalues in the Maldives. We are committed to creating anenvironment that guarantees individual freedom  wherehuman rights are fully protected  where democraticvalues flourish and where human innovation thrives.We are committed to creating a democratic and freesociety that is able to shape its own destiny."
"111",4548,"MEX",67,2012,"﻿By virtue of its historical conviction  Mexico hasalways been a strategic ally of the United Nations. Asone of the founding Members of the United Nations  wefully share its fundamental precepts.This is the last session of the General Assembly Iwill attend as President of Mexico. Over the past sixyears  my country has taken part in many differentforums to pave the way for United Nations initiatives.We have endeavoured to make it the main body fordialogue  peace and security  and for the rule of law including  in particular  the effective exercise ofinternational law.Today the world faces challenges that threaten thevery existence and viability of humankind. The firstof those is the current economic emergency and theurgent need to promote global trade and growth withstrong job creation. That problem has plunged entirepopulations in crisis and prevented developing nationsfrom overcoming setbacks with respect to poverty ignorance and marginalization.When Mexico became President of the Group of20 (G-20) in 2012  our mission was clear: to reconcilethe apparently competing interests of developing anddeveloped nations. It is no secret that at the previousmeeting of the G-20  in Cannes  we were unable tomake as much progress as we would have liked towardsadopting measures to advance the global economy.For that reason  the Mexican Government made it apriority to build a broader consensus. We brought asmany countries as possible into the process  alongwith representatives of the widest possible range ofsectors  including unions  entrepreneurs  civil society organizations and youth  and we took their proposals tothe plenary meeting of the G-20.We held many preparatory ministerial meetingsover many months and managed to bring apparentlydivergent positions closer together. That work wascritical in ensuring that the G-20 Summit in LosCabos last June achieved significant progress. Whileit is true that months ahead of time there were doubtsabout the viability of the euro as the sole currency formany European countries  the meeting in Los Cabossolidified the Group’s commitment not only to thatcurrency as a monetary unit but also to financial  fiscaland political unity in the eurozone. The commitmentsof the international financial institutions were spelledout in greater detail and broadened  in particular thoseof the European institutions  but also those of theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF).Among the most significant achievements agreedat the Los Cabos G-20 Summit  I should like to mentionthe long-term action plan that proposes to tackle thecurrent economic situation as well as to move forwardtowards the full and lasting economic recovery that weall yearn for. It is also very important that we agreedto provide the greatest contribution to the resources ofthe IMF in the history of the organization. More than$450 trillion was committed  and is available to helpdeveloping or developed countries facing a criticalfinancial situation as a result of the current economiccrisis.It is true that financial problems in some Europeancountries persist. Those are problems that will take along time to recover from. But  from our point of view there is now more promise for a solution than there wasbefore the G-20 meeting. The commitment on the partof the G-20 countries has been a valuable element  somuch so that today the global economy is beginning toshow more optimistic signs of medium-term recoverythan we saw a little more than a year ago. That is why Ibelieve that we are starting to see a turning point whenit comes to economic prospects. We must all contributeto ensuring that the recovery in fact takes place throughthe implementation of the commitments undertaken.That should not keep us from undertaking furtherefforts. On the contrary  we must step up our effortsin order to overcome  once and for all  the global crisisand promote development in our societies.I would like to underscore that the Los CabosSummit did not look only at the international crisis  and certainly not only at Europe. We also dealt withvarious pressing and important topics. We wanted toensure that countries would recover growth through asustainable approach. We included several other itemsof extreme importance on the agenda  including greengrowth — to which I will refer later — food securityfor our peoples and financial inclusion for the poorest.In that regard  approximately 3 billion adults in theworld do not have access to financial services. That isa clear obstacle to justice  but also to the efficiency andgrowth of our economies. That is why we in Mexicohave expanded people’s access to financial services.Today  banks offer simplified requirements for openingaccounts. We are establishing a completely new bankthat functions through the use of cell phones  which80 per cent of the population own. We are offering through bank intermediaries  financial services in themost remote places.Not only has my Government been introducingprogrammes to promote justice and fight poverty but the majority of the support that we give to thepoorest sectors of the population today is donethrough a financial inclusion effort. Our OpportunitiesProgramme is an innovative financial transactionprogramme for 6.5 million families  or over a quarterof the total population of Mexico  including the poorestfamilies. They receive monthly economic support topurchase food and cover basic needs as long as motherstake their children to schools and to the doctor  as thatis one of the best ways of structurally breaking thecycle of poverty. That support is delivered throughdebit cards linked to an individual bank account  whichthose 6.5 million poor families have perhaps never hadaccess to before.Food security was another other topic that weexplored at the G-20 Summit. The increase in foodprices around the world largely explains why  besides thepolitical reasons that might exist in any nation  peoplein North Africa and many other parts of the world have from 2010 to the present time  taken to the streets. If thepoorest families devote half of their income to buyingfood and the price of that food increases by 10 or 20 percent  we are talking about a net global impoverishmentthat is higher than those percentages. We are sayingthat one of the most tragic problems in the fight againstpoverty is preventing such enormous rises in globalfood prices.Concretely  we achieved agreements to promotegreater investment in technology and greater publicand private investment in agriculture  so that  with thesame resources and the same land and water  we canproduce more and better food globally. Mexico tookan active part in the green revolution at the beginningof the 1970s. Now we need another green revolution toproduce food. Mexico wants to be an active participantin that transformation of technology  public policy andfinancial cooperation that could provide food to thepoorest people in the world. At the G-20 Summit  weshowed that it is possible to find a solution to urgentand topical problems  as well as to long-term problems.The second challenge of the four I would liketo mention today has to do with the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs)  which the UnitedNations so wisely established. It is very clear that theyencapsulate the yearnings of all of our peoples for aharmonious  humane and sustainable development.My country  despite the unexpected rise in global foodprices and the worst global economic crisis in livingmemory  has made real progress in reaching the Goals.I would like to stress that Mexico is close to achievingthe MDGs. Three years from the deadline  we haveachieved one of the greatest aspirations of any nation whether developed or developing  namely  universalhealth coverage. What does that mean? It means thattoday in Mexico we have doctors  medicine  treatmentand hospitals for every Mexican man or woman whorequires it. That will allow us to comply with thecommitments taken on in the area of reducing motherand child mortality. We are also energetically tacklingsuch problems as HIV/AIDS. In Mexico  we providefree medical care and free antiretroviral drugs to allHIV/AIDS patients  thereby contributing to overcomingthat serious global challenge.Furthermore  not only have we achieved universalhealth coverage  but we have also provided universalcoverage when it comes to primary education. Today every boy and girl of school age — between 5 and13 years of age — has a place in a free public school.We have also closed the gap between men and womenso that they participate equally in basic education atalmost every level.We have achieved important progress. We havebuilt over 1 200 new hospitals and clinics in six yearsand established 140 universities. Those are new freepublic universities  where every year we train 113 000engineers who are  besides enhancing their earning power  also revolutionizing the competitiveness ofMexican industry.We have also achieved progress beyond the agreedgoals in terms of access to drinking water  informationtechnologies and decent housing. Almost 650 000mortgage credits for as many houses are provided everyyear in our country  especially to workers who earn lessthan $20 a day. All of those achievements put us ontrack to comply with one of the MDGs within the timeframe established.Globally  Mexico is aware of the fact that progressis uneven  but that should not be a reason to abandonour efforts. We must reinforce the progress we havemade and ensure that it continues.That is why Mexico would suggest that we movetowards a second generation of MDGs that would beuniversal  measurable and adapted to distinct nationalrealities in areas such as gender equity  environmentalprotection  green growth  education  food  access towater and international democratic governance. Thatshould be a central part of the 2015 development agenda.The third challenge is that of climate change. Itsimpact could be irreversible  both for societies and interms of national resources. I know that  in all of thecountries represented here  there is currently eitheran unprecedented drought or unprecedented f looding.Here in Manhattan  less than two years ago  there was ahurricane on Fifth Avenue for the first time in history.There were also tornadoes in Maine and Massachusetts.Climate change is affecting all nations. This is achallenge that threatens to overwhelm humankind. Ifwe do not tackle it today  the cost for each country todeal with its consequences will be significantly greater.Mexico is seeking to engage all of its capacities inprompting a sense of responsibility when it comes tothe fight against global warming. That is why we haveset up a special unilateral programme to fight it. Weare committed to reducing our yearly carbon dioxideemissions by 50 million tons for this year. We made thatcommitment in 2008  and we are meeting it: by the endof the year we will have reached our goal.We are also the first country to deliver a nationalmessage in the context of the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change. We have delivered fourmessages to date  and today I will deliver Mexico’sfifth such message in that regard. I will report on howwe have complied with our commitments  as well as illustrate how we have managed to uncouple Mexico’seconomic growth from its greenhouse-gas emissions.In the past two decades  our emissions have increasedat a rate that is 40 per cent lower than our economicgrowth rate.We are doing this because to challenge a falsenotion that we have heard expressed here at the UnitedNations and in every economic forum around the world.The idea seems to be that we either grow or we tackleclimate change  we either put an end to poverty or weput an end to global warming. It would seem that wecannot do both at the same time  but I am here to saythat we can. I would even say that we should. We haveto overcome the false dichotomy that exists betweenprotecting the environment and promoting economicgrowth  and between fighting poverty and fightingclimate change.In Mexico  we are doing both at the same time.Through ProÁrbol  for instance  which is a programmethat pays for environmental services  and is perhaps thelargest in the world to do so  we are paying poor andindigenous communities who live in forests and junglesfor the water that they give us and for the oxygen thatwe breathe. We are paying them not to cut down trees to restore their water basins so that those environmentalservices will remain for us. With this programme as we take care of our forests  we are also providingincome to the poorest communities  who have never hadincome before. In the six years of the programme  wehave planted 1.3 billion trees in our country. I recall aUnited Nations programme five years ago that aimed atplanting 1 billion trees around the world. We took partin that programme enthusiastically. We have planted1.3 billion trees in six years and designated 3.5 millionhectares as protected natural areas.A promising result of that effort is that  accordingto the Food and Agriculture Organization  Mexico hasreduced its net deforestation rate from 350 000 hectaresannually in the 1990s to 150 000 between 2005 and2010. I am sure that we will have reduced it furtherbetween 2010 and 2012. Our hope is that not only willwe achieve a rate of zero this decade  but that we willreverse deforestation around the world.With respect to that challenge  working withthe United Nations  we were pleased to organize thesixteenth Conference of the Parties to the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change(COP 16) in Cancún  Mexico. Against all predictions  COP 16 was a rather successful meeting. We reacheda first ever agreement on implementing an emissionsreduction scheme for deforestation and degradation called REDD-plus  which will enable developingcountries to contribute to reducing emissions whilepreserving and augmenting forests and jungles.The greatest riches that poor countries have are theirnatural capital  and developing countries do not pollutewith industries that they do not have. The greatest richesare forests and jungles  and carbon emissions comefrom deforestation. If developing countries are giventhe support they need to preserve forests and jungles we will be contributing to reducing carbon emissionsand helping to raise the income of those communities.We agreed on that in Cancún at COP 16.That success also points to a possibility that wasfirst raised in the context of the fight against globalwarming. We have managed to overcome the differencesbetween developed and developing countries. We havemanaged to set aside the perverse game of blamingeach other by saying either that the rich are to blamebecause they are the ones polluting  or that the poor areto blame because they are the ones emitting greenhousegases. In this we are all responsible  and we all have tofind the solution. We are all responsible for the planetthat we share  which does not recognize our borderswhen it comes to the environment.That is why the principle of common butdifferentiated responsibility enabled us to reachreasonable agreements in Cancún. We set up the GreenFund to fight climate change  as proposed by Mexico.We established by consensus the clearly set thresholdof an increase of no more than 2 degrees in the planet’stemperature in the long term  a commitment to reduceemissions  an institutional framework for the adaptationto climate change and mechanisms for the financingand transfer of technology. Those achievements revivedmultilateralism on the issue of climate change and werefolowed by the successful Climate Change Conferenceheld in Durban in 2011.The fourth challenge — and I would like theAssembly’s special attention as I address this problem which is responsible for more violent deaths around theworld than any other — is a problem that is costingthousands of young people their lives  in particular inour beloved region of Latin America and the Caribbean.I am talking about transnational organized crime  whichis cutting short the lives of thousands of young people and constitutes one of the most serious global threatsof our time. Criminal organizations form operationalnetworks covering major illicit f lows not only of drugsbut also of arms  money and  unacceptably  of people.They use violence to control their markets  supply andclients and to seize the income of the honest citizens ofthe places they dominate. In that way  they seek to controlterritories and co-opt Governments. They challengethe strength of States themselves and take advantageof institutional weakness or bare-faced corruption toestablish power and impunity. They become entrenchedin communities and control everything they can. Theyclaim money from honest people for their work. Theycollect quotas from businesses and working people andcontrol other criminal activities such as extortion  theftand kidnapping.Organized crime is one of the leading causes ofdeath today. It is a leading engine of violence  whichthe United Nations has an obligation to fight. It is oneof the greatest threats facing democracy in the twenty-first century.Mexico has suffered the consequences of thisscourge  which  lamentably  has resulted from of yearsof inaction in the face of the unbridled expansion ofsuch criminal activity. That is why protecting thefamilies and people of Mexico from criminality hasbeen  for my Government  not only a constitutionallegal imperative but an absolute ethical and politicalone as well. We have fought robustly  decisively andcourageously against that unacceptable threat to ourpeoples. We have done that based on our belief that ourprincipal duty as a Government is to protect families.At the same time  we have promoted a trulyhistoric transformation of the institutions charged withenforcing the law by developing new and improvedpolice and judicial capacities in the fight for security. Werequire new and better capabilities that can cope withthe task of defending freedom and legality. However we regret that our efforts are not being matched inall the countries where they are needed. I would liketo explicitly express my regret before the Assemblythat the diplomatic conference that took place here inJuly failed to reach an agreement on the adoption ofan arms trade treaty. Such a treaty would have laid thegroundwork for controlling the irresponsible sale ofpowerful weapons to transnational organized criminalgroups.Over the past six years  my Government hasdecommissioned more than 150 000 weapons that hadbeen in the hands of criminals. That is why Mexicoadvocated for a treaty that would limit or ban  or atleast regulate  the transfer of conventional weapons because we know there is a risk — we know that thathappens — that those weapons do not end up in thehands of good citizens who want to defend themselves;they end up in the hands of criminals. That is whysuch a business exists  namely  to commit horrible andunprecedented violations of international law againstpeoples.The trafficking of arms is only one aspect of thatvery complex problem. Today  we have to acknowledgean undeniable truth: the illegal drug consumptionin many developed countries is killing thousands ofyoung people in producing and transiting countries. Itfuels violence that our peoples do not deserve. Drug-consuming countries have not made progress — or atleast not significantly — in reducing drug consumption.There is much work to be done in that regard  both interms of reducing demand and in preventing addiction.We need to step up our efforts to deal with this publichealth problem through preventive policies  fightingaddiction and media and information campaigns thatwould make young people around the world understandthat drug addiction is the slavery of the twenty-firstcentury. It is a heavy chain choking our young peopleto death.In addition  we must also bear in mind the originsof the greatest power of criminal organizations. Wheredoes it come from? It comes from the billions of dollarsof economic resources financing them  which in turnf low from the drug-consuming countries. If we do notstop that avalanche of funds from consumers  organizedcrime will continue to undermine peace and challengewhole societies and Governments.That is why here  in this pre-eminent global forum I would like to say with the utmost clarity that the timehas come for consuming countries to ask themselves honestly and sincerely  whether they have the will andthe ability to reduce drug consumption significantlyand substantially. Otherwise  if they cannot reduce thatconsumption  they must urgently take decisive steps atleast to reduce the extraordinry f lows of money thatend up in the hands of criminal organizations.I know that to date the approach taken has beenwell intentioned  seeking to keep drugs out of the hands of young people by pursuing the battle against drugtrafficking via legal means. But there is a fundamentalproblem with that approach: it fuels the black market.The enormous earnings that have been made possiblethrough that market owing to the prohibition have inturn further fuelled greater ambitions among criminalsand further increased the massive f low of resourcestowards their organizations. That has allowed them tocreate powerful networks and given them an almostunlimited ability to corrupt. They are able to buy entireGovernments and entire police forces  leaving societiesunarmed and families defenceless  especially in thepoorest countries.While it is clear that powerful countries havepowerful judicial authorities and police forces  whatabout the poorest countries in our continents? I amtalking about our countries in Latin America and theCaribbean. But what will happen in Africa or Asia  orin the very many nations that do not have the economicpower to tackle such criminals?Let us grasp once and for all that the ever-growingdemand for drugs gives the criminals an economicpower that in some cases translates to political powersufficient to bend the will of the authorities to their own.I want to stress that all that money builds in them suchoverweening confidence that they abandon all scruplesand commit the worst atrocities and acts of cruelty thathumankind has ever seen. Drug users’ money causesthe deaths of many thousands of young people in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean as a consequence of drugtrade violence. The countries that suffer most acutelythe devastating effects of the situation are countries likeours that lie between the production zones in the Andesand the largest consumption market  the United States:Colombia  Venezuela  Guatemala  El Salvador andHonduras  and  in the Caribbean  Haiti  the DominicanRepublic  Jamaica and all other countries in that path.I would like to report that in December of last yearthe heads of State and Government of Central Americaand of Mexico  Colombia and Chile met for what wecalled the Tuxtla cooperation mechanism and issued avery important statement  the Mérida Declaration. Itproclaims the urgent need to make a tangible reductionin demand for illegal drugs in consumer nations. Wealso said that if that is impossible the authorities ofthose countries have the moral obligation to exploreevery possible means to eliminate the astronomicalfinancial gains of criminals  including regulatory ormarket options.Some months later we convened representatives ofall the countries of the hemisphere for the sixth Summitof the Americas in Cartagena  Colombia  where severalLatin American leaders reiterated our concern  andcountries from Canada to Chile reached an agreementto give a mandate to the Organization of AmericanStates to make a scientific analysis of all possibleoptions to battle the scourge more effectively. We alsoagreed unanimously to establish a hemisphere-wideplan against transnational organized crime to fosterreal-time cooperation among all the hemisphere’s lawenforcement agencies.Today I formally propose that the United Nationscommit to making an in-depth assessment of the scaleand limits of the current prohibitionist approach todrugs. That does not mean giving up the fight or cedingone inch to criminal organizations. We will never dothat. But what it does mean is that countries must takeresponsibility  both the common responsibilities we allshare and differentiated responsibilities  in accordancewith each nation’s capacities..In any case  irrespective of the regulatoryframework  all nations  especially emerging oneslike Mexico  must implement a coherent policy  witha three-pronged approach. The first obligation is tofight crime  not to run away from it and not to allowcriminals to establish territories as if they were a State.The second is to strengthen laws and law enforcementagencies and institutions. In particular  we must purgeand strengthen police forces  public prosecutors Government ministers and judicial authorities. Thethird and most important is to restore the social fabric.We must increase opportunities for young people in theareas of education  health  employment and leisure. Wemust do it through universities  music groups  soccerteams and clinics to prevent and treat drug addiction.We must establish active and massive preventionand treatment policies for young people  includingteenagers.We are already doing that in Mexico. Thethree-pronged approach is crucial for any democraticState  regardless of its political philosophy. Every Statemust fight crime  improve law enforcement institutionsand create opportunities.Today I call upon all States Members of the UnitedNations to assume that responsibility  which so far hasnot measured up to the magnitude of the problem oforganized crime  which  I repeat  is the main cause of violent death in the world. That is something theUnited Nations must look at. If the developed countriesthat consume ton upon ton of drugs on a daily basiscannot or do not want to reduce drug consumption  thenat least they should stem the f low of money they aresending to criminals and stop the exorbitant f low ofmoney whereby users finance the deaths of thousandsof young people. If they cannot do so  I emphasizethat this is the time to explore different alternatives toreduce consumption.Now is the time for the United Nations not only totake part in such an analysis but to lead in earnest a far-reaching international discussion  in order to take stockof the scale and limits of the current prohibitionistapproach and to assess the brutal  unacceptableviolence generated by the production  distribution trafficking in and use of drugs. It is painful to say this but the drug trade has made Latin America and theCaribbean the most violent region in the world. Thatassessment must be done with lucidity  academic rigourand global responsibility. Taking a world perspective we must explore alternatives  specifically regulatoryor market alternatives  to see what are and what arenot real options that would allow all nations  workingtogether  to put an end to the scourge that claims tens ofthousands of lives in our region.As the United Nations considers and finds solutionsto global problems that threaten the integrity  healthand lives of millions around the world  as it deals withfamine  starvation in the Horn of Africa  epidemics suchas the H1N1 virus in Mexico  and as it tackles climatechange  so it must also take action to stop the wave ofdeath and suffering with which the drug trade blightsthe lives of our people. I respectfully urge and exhortthe United Nations not only to take part in but to lead adiscussion  devoid of prejudgments  that addresses thescale of the twenty-first century challenge  encouragingall of us to seek new and effective approaches to solvingthis dire problem.My tenure will end in a few months. I am proudthat Mexico can now count on an economy that issolid  increasingly competitive and able to generate700 000 new formal jobs annually. I can say withsatisfaction that today Mexico is a stronger  morefair and more prosperous country  as our indices ofhuman development for education  health  housing andemployment show.I would also like to say that beyond tackling the fourchallenges I referred to earlier  as a world communitywe should strengthen the United Nations from the insideso that it is equipped to meet global challenges. Theinitial task in that area is realistic  democratic reformof the Security Council to make it more representativeand maintain its capacity for action by improving itsworking methods and the accountability of its members.Mexico also welcomes the fact that the Presidentproposed “Bringing about adjustment or settlement ofinternational disputes or situations by peaceful means”as the main theme for this session. It is a crucial subjectfor civilized coexistence and cooperation. As a country Mexico is committed to cooperation and the settlementof disputes. We are very concerned  as we know theAssembly is also  about the weakness and  at times the inertia of the Organization in the face of f lagrantviolations of international law. The grave situation inSyria  for example  is a danger to world peace and anindignity for all of us.We condemn unreservedly the Damascus regime’srepression and the violence it has inf licted on thecivilian population  which has lead to a refugee crisis inneighbouring countries. The paralysis of the SecurityCouncil in the face of such crises must drive us to renewour political will to change the Organization. Just as wehave transformed and embellished the United Nationsbuilding and removed the asbestos residue that welived with for so many years  so it is important that werenovate the Organization in order to bring it in linewith the demands of the twenty-first century.We also condemn the premeditated terrorist attackon the United States Consulate in Benghazi and theassassination of the United States Ambassador andseveral members of his staff in Libya.I reiterate that Mexico will fully comply withthe Millennium Development Goals established bythis great Organization. That is evident in our humandevelopment indices for education  health  housing employment and social security. In the area of security we have steadfastly fought criminal groups  updatedour laws and thoroughly restructured our institutions.At the same time  we have continued to consolidate ademocratic culture and respect for human rights. InMexico today we have enacted reform whereby anyhuman right recognized in any international treatysigned by Mexico also becomes internal law forMexican courts.I am proud to leave a Mexico that has close relationsof friendship and cooperation with every nation; aMexico that is an active participant in building a worldof peace  justice  security and development. We wantfreedom for men and women; justice and respect forhuman rights in our societies; an environment that werespect and that will allow our beloved planet Earth tolive forever; and democracy  without which there is nofreedom or development. And  of course  we seek anddesire peace on Earth  goodwill to men  and peace to allthose in this Hall."
"112",4573,"MHL",67,2012,"﻿I bring the Assembly the warmgreeting of “Yokwe” from the Marshall Islands.The Republic of the Marshall Islands was born firstin the hearts and minds of the Marshallese people  butwe also forged our nationhood under the auspices of theUnited Nations f lag. The United Nations is truly oursecond home. Our unique story  from United NationsTrust Territory to Member State  deserves ref lectionby the international community  two decades after wewere welcomed as a United Nations Member.The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) willbe reviewed in three years’ time. The Marshall Islandsis now firmly committed to making stronger progress especially with regard to achieving full access toadequate education and decent employment and toensuring a sustainable environment. The MDGs arenot distant figures or statistics. The MDGs are in thefaces of our Marshallese children; the MDGs are in ourclassrooms and hospitals. One of the most immediateand necessary steps is to better integrate our bilateraland regional development pathways with the MDGs  toensure that all efforts move in the same direction andtowards the same common goals.As the Asia-Pacific region rises in the globalspotlight  so also must the Marshall Islands. Ournational future is still within our grasp  and our futureneed not be so difficult if we and our partners undertakethe hard actions needed to change it.Today  the Marshall Islands commits to being a keysuccess story in the Pacific. We will move with specificactions to make firm and measurable progress towardsthe MDGs and towards economic independence restingon an expanded private sector  especially in regard toour primary drivers of fisheries and tourism. We simplyhave no other alternative but to rewrite our future.We look to the future with targets in mind instead ofgeneralities. I have asked my Government for specific quantifiable development goals. I have also asked myGovernment to list the necessary actions  to be taken byourselves and by our partners  needed to achieve them.Today I am encouraging bilateral partners  especiallyour closest partners  as well as the Secretary-General and the Pacific Islands Forum and its regional agencies to respond. Next year I hope to present the Assemblywith a report not about our plight but about our progress.It is easy  and indeed rightful  to place blame onthe international community  especially concerningclimate change and fisheries  spheres where the openpolitical assurances of our partners too often fall victimto their own self-interest once the negotiating doorsclose. Yet the ultimate burden for achieving greaternational success must be on the Marshall IslandsGovernment and the Marshallese people. Howeverunfair multilateral outcomes may be to the smallestnations  we must and will do whatever is in our nationalpower to assure a viable future. Nothing will stand inour way.The Marshall Islands is far from alone. Manynations in the Pacific islands region share similarchallenges. Our collective Pacific progress must be akey pillar of the 2014 global conference on small islanddeveloping States  to be held in the Pacific. The nextsummit of the Pacific Islands Forum will be held nextyear in the Marshall Islands  and this meeting willreveal firm and dramatic progress not only towardsbasic social and environment goals  but also how a veryreal expansion of public-private partnership will bejump-started in the Pacific.Since 1954  Marshallese leaders have visited theUnited Nations to address the ongoing impact of the 67nuclear tests conducted on our lands during our statusas a United Nations Trust Territory. That is our firstforeign policy issue  and it is more than a historicallegacy. It is a contemporary reality for our localcommunities. The United Nations authorized many ofthose tests through two resolutions  in 1954 and 1956 which also made assurances of our basic human rightsand our full and safe return to our land  while today toomany Marshallese remain nuclear nomads  still unableto safely resettle. While I acknowledge the importantefforts taken to date  the half-life of radioactive materialremains for generations  and much more needs to bedone.But today  for the first time since the trusteeshipresolution of 1956  the United Nations has finally spoken.Earlier this month  Mr. Calin Georgescu  SpecialRapporteur on human rights and toxic wastes  presentedhis report regarding the nuclear testing programmein the Marshall Islands (A/HRC/21/48/Add.1) tothe Human Rights Council in Geneva. The Special Rapporteur has presented significant findings thatindicate that the pain  mistrust  progress and failuresof the Marshallese people over decades have a humanrights dimension and that the international communitymust respond with more than silence. The Marshallesepeople have paid too heavy a price for the only instancein which the United Nations explicitly authorized theuse of nuclear weapons.I urge all relevant actors — the United States andthe wider international community and its agencies — tojoin with the Marshall Islands and the Pacific IslandsForum members in welcoming the Special Rapporteur’sspecific recommendations as a way forward to ensureprogress on regaining the very human rights thatshould never have been lost. The Special Rapporteur’sreport must not be allowed to only collect dust on theshelf; it should instead be a foundation for new efforts particularly with key international agencies. We haveno more time for well-worn accusations. The MarshallIslands must not fail to advance the human rights of itsown citizens. Where old solutions have not worked  wemust not fail to find new ones.We are not only a small island State  but truly alarge-ocean nation. Our sustainable fisheries representa primary pathway to the very economic strengthand social development I have just called for today.Yet our aspirations are too often undermined by thenarrow commercial self-interests of those nations at theWestern and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission thatmight otherwise seek to embrace us as close politicalpartners. For us  our collective Pacific development isnot an isolated issue bound in technical jargon. It is thevery hope and economic survival of our entire nation and indeed the whole Pacific region. We realize only apenny of true benefit for every dollar of fishing activity and despite scientific warnings  pressure on key fishstocks has only increased  not diminished. Decades ofglobal lip service at the United Nations to sustainabledevelopment seems to be lost on some of our fishingpartners.The parties to the Nauru Agreement have becomea watershed political movement  recently achievingcertification of a sustainable fishery by the MarineStewardship Council  which is perhaps the largest suchfishery in the world. In the Pacific  we are alreadydeep into advancing the very sustainable developmentmeasures agreed to at the United Nations Conference onSustainable Development (Rio+20)  and we are growingour own Pacific-driven commercial brand. It remains to be seen if key distant-water fishing nations willcontinue to join us in forging a landmark sustainablefishery or if they will choose to be left on the sidelines.The Republic of the Marshall Islands is amongthe low-lying nations in the world  and sea-level-riseprojections of more than a metre pose complex risks toour future statehood  risks that we are only beginningto unpack and address. Last year’s watershed agreementon the Durban Platform  prepared at the 2011 UnitedNations Climate Change Conference  has moved theUnited Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange (UNFCCC) into a new chapter of a single legally binding protocol applying to all nations by 2020.It has also redoubled urgent efforts needed to close theglobal mitigation gap. The time for endless North-South division is now over  and the all-too-predictablefinger-pointing must end.But the world can no longer wait for negotiators.We must do more than pat ourselves on the back ifwe are serious about reducing the risks to our future.More action is needed by all nations and all actors inall possible settings and negotiation forums. As theMarshall Islands  we have a national energy plan andUNFCCC target to cut our own emissions  boost ourefficiency and pursue new technology  such as oceanthermal energy conversion  which can make us acarbon-negative nation. I ask the rest of the world  willit also meet us in increasing that ambition? Will it comesoon enough?Climate adaptation poses perhaps the most complexchallenges for a low-lying nation  but we must overcomethem nonetheless. We cannot rely only on an uncertainarchitecture of global climate finance to address thevery critical adaptation efforts that will be necessaryfor our continued survival. In the large scale — up to$100 billion a year — of the future Green Climate Fundand other efforts  our relatively modest needs can easilybe overlooked. Our increasingly urgent needs on theground can no longer be met with paper studies anddisconnected pilot projects. Yet the Marshall Islands isat present heavily reliant on international assistance. Wehave little other means to provide for adaptation. Thegrowing belief  however wrong  that we must financesome of our own adaptation efforts is perhaps the mostcompelling reason to rapidly expand our private sector.We must also create financial security through the debtfor adaptation swap being pursued by the MarshallIslands and other small island nations. The United Nations cannot fail the needs of the mostvulnerable nations and must better harness the effortsof all necessary actors. The Marshall Islands urgesother nations to facilitate the meaningful participationof Taiwan within the United Nations system and theinternational community. Taiwan should be able toparticipate as an observer in the UNFCCC and theInternational Civil Aviation Organization  as it doesin the World Health Assembly  and its potential formeeting the MDGs should be recognized.The international community must not fail to act not only to address long-term threats  but also to easethe most immediate security concerns. Recent tensionin the broader Pacific Rim is an important matter forthe Pacific Islands region  which can grow only whenthere is security and stability. I urge that those issues including that of the East China Sea  be peacefullyaddressed through an inclusive dialogue involving allkey actors.The smallest nations in the world  many of whichare in the Pacific  are beginning to play important andunique roles on the international stage. But nationssuch as the Marshall Islands also depend greatly onfirm multilateral action. Accordingly  they must be ableto rely on the United Nations and its Members for morethan symbolism. It is decisive and bold leadership thatare so urgently needed in this international hour."
"113",4597,"MKD",67,2012,"﻿It is an honour and aprivilege to address this forum today and to share theviews of the Republic of Macedonia regarding a numberof issues of concern for all of us.Allow me first to extend our congratulations toMr. Vuk Jeremić on his election to the prestigiousposition of President of the General Assembly atits sixty-seventh session. I believe Mr. Jeremić willrespond to all the challenges and tasks that await him and I wish to express our full readiness to cooperate.Allow me also to express my thanks and to complimentthe former President of the Assembly  Mr. NassirAbdulaziz Al-Nasser  for his successful presidencyduring the sixth-sixth session.I would like to take this opportunity to welcomethe work and efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. BanKi-moon  which undoubtedly have contributed tostrengthening the role and reputation of the worldOrganization. It was a real honour for me and for thecitizens of Macedonian to be his host. The Republic ofMacedonia highly values and supports the Secretary-General’s endeavours  and he can count on ourcontinued full support.Now  more than ever in the history of humankind the nations of the world are confronted with the samechallenges  are victims of the same threats and share theyearning for a better future. Effective multilateralismis of essential importance for the development ofcollective action to respond to common challenges. TheUnited Nations is an organization whose legitimacyto tackle global challenges through global actions isuniversally accepted and undeniable. The supportprovided by Member States is of crucial importance.I wish to assure the Assembly that the Republic ofMacedonia will continue to contribute actively to thereinforcement and improvement of the efficiency of thesystem.This diverse world is in need of a commondenominator  a link that unites all individuals  peoplesand countries regardless of differences in culture language and religion. That link is the Charter of theUnited Nations  with its principles and fundamental values. The Republic of Macedonia is firmly dedicatedto respect for the Charter  which serves as the basisof its foreign policy. Ever since our declaration ofindependence and after becoming a Member of theUnited Nations  the peaceful resolution of internationaldisputes has been one of our leading principles andguidelines for our behaviour as a responsible memberof the international community. Therefore  I wish towelcome the General Assembly recommendation to putthe issue forward as a topic of debate this year.An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.When speaking about international disputes  it isinevitable to refer to prevention activities as one of themechanisms for their resolution.Today preventive diplomacy has proven its relevanceonce again. In the early days of our independence the Republic of Macedonia was host to the UnitedNations Preventive Deployment Force  a one-of-a-kindmechanism for the United Nations at the time. It was apositive experience for Macedonia  the United Nationsand the Member States involved. We are witness to thefact that the evolution of international relations and theincreased complexity of challenges in our globalizedworld confirm the need to develop mechanisms and touse good offices.At this point  I would like to commend theSecretary-General for advocating more thoroughanalysis of this issue in his report on strengthening therole of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes conflict prevention and resolution (A/66/811)  whichproduced good  operative solutions for upgrading thecapacity of the United Nations in this area. I believewe can and must explore new ways and possibilities forstrengthening the role of the Secretary-General in theresolution of international disputes.In a time of global economic crisis  the focus ofthe United Nations on preventing conflicts and furtherdeveloping preventive diplomacy is understandable. TheRepublic of Macedonia believes it makes sense to focuson the effective and efficient use of resources — whichare shrinking — which is why we have been attentivelyfollowing all activities relating to the report of theSecretary-General on civilian capacity in the aftermathof conflict (A/66/311) and to the implementation ofthe recommendations of the Senior Advisory Groupfound therein. It is very important that the internationalcommunity make progress in preventing new conflictsand relapses into conflict in vulnerable countries. The Republic of Macedonia stands ready to offer itsexperience in the area of democratic institution-building based on the Macedonian inclusive  democratic modelof integration without assimilation. In that context  Iwish to refer to the recent High-level Meeting on theRule of Law at the National and International Levels.The Republic of Macedonia attaches great importanceto this issue  which is undoubtedly the basis of alldemocratic societies  and the report of the Secretary-General on the rule of law (A/66/749) has providedfood for thought and further action. The Republic ofMacedonia believes that inclusiveness is an importantprinciple that needs to be implemented when it comesto the rule of law. The rule of law is multifaceted andshould cover all stakeholders  especially civil society.The rule of law is incomplete and is impossibleto achieve without respect for human rights. As theSecretary-General said in his statement at the openingof the general debate at this session  “We shall haveneither peace nor development without respect forhuman rights and the rule of law” (see A/67/PV.6). Asa country building a model of inclusive democracy  theRepublic of Macedonia attaches particular importanceto the development  promotion and protection ofhuman rights. It is the right and duty of every countryto safeguard and promote the rights of its citizens.Human rights should reinforce and reaffirm nationalsovereignty. This  then  will be the best guarantee that as a principle  the responsibility to protect will remainthe desired first and primary pillar. The Republic ofMacedonia will continue its efforts to preserve andpromote human rights — to promote democracy andthe rule of law  gender equality and the improvementof the role of women  and to protect vulnerable andmarginalized groups.We also strongly support Member States’ activeparticipation in the universal periodic review as amechanism for promoting the effectiveness of theHuman Rights Council. In that context  I would like toremind the Assembly that the Republic of Macedoniahas presented its candidature for membership in theHuman Rights Council for the period 2014-2016. Weare convinced that our experience in this area  alongwith our particular achievements and ambition topromote this area of global governance  will enable usto make a full contribution to further strengthening andaffirming human rights in subsequent years.Once again this year all priorities are focused on thethree most important pillars of our world Organization: peace and security  sustainable development andhuman rights. All are mutually related. There canbe no sustainable development without peace andsecurity  and there can be no sustainable peace withoutdevelopment and poverty reduction. The MillenniumDevelopment Goals continue to be the parameters bywhich we evaluate our success.The Republic of Macedonia’s aspiration tobecome a member of the European Union has createdthe necessary spur for political  economic and socialreforms. Promoting equitable and comprehensivedevelopment founded on human rights has provided asolid base for the national development agenda. TheGovernment of the Republic of Macedonia thereforeestablished a programme focused on emphasizingeconomic development  improving our citizens’standard of living  creating jobs  fighting corruption increasing education opportunities and promotingdemocracy and inter-ethnic relations.Balanced and sustainable development is a majorinvestment in the future  and in the interest of thegeneral well-being  everyone must participate. Theoutcome document of Rio+20 — the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development (resolution66/288  annex) — should be taken as an additionalimpetus to use alternative possibilities for achievingsustainable development. The Republic of Macedonia in coordination with the policies of its Europeanpartners  will advocate expanding those alternatives.Sustainable development is closely linked todisaster risk reduction and adaptation to climatechange. Recognizing that interdependence  theRepublic of Macedonia supports a holistic approach tothe implementation of these goals in national  regionaland global strategies  policies and plans.We have demonstrated our dedication to the regionof South-eastern Europe and to regional cooperationthrough our chairmanship of the South-East EuropeanCooperation Process. The region is not immune toglobal challenges and threats  and such threats can beremoved only by meeting the obligations and numerouscommitments we have all undertaken. I am convincedthat intensive regional cooperation in this area will helpus build a region more resistant to natural disasters. Wewish focus our chairmanship on the process of meetingthe real and everyday needs of our citizens — those ofpeace  security and development — that are the resultof global challenges that recognize neither political and ethnic barriers nor religious groups. Amongthe priorities of Macedonia’s chairmanship will becooperation in economic and agricultural matters culture and tourism  science and education  cross-border concerns and the protection of the environment.Our principles are based on solving citizens’ problemsregardless of ethnic  religious or any other affiliation.I see no way of doing this other than through closeregional cooperation.Let us build good-neighbourly relations on thebasis of solidarity. In return  we expect our neighboursto show solidarity in actions for a safer region. Wecan and we must be ready for future challenges so asto provide a safer future for future generations. Ouryoung people will hold us to this. They expect ourgeneration to behave responsibly. They live in a time ofnew technologies  and they already know what is goingon at the global level. I believe firmly that we shouldfocus all our energy on young people  to create youthfor the future and a future for our youth  formed in aspirit of dialogue  tolerance and respect for diversity.That is why  in parallel with the South-East EuropeanCooperation Process summit  we will also host theeleventh Forum of the Dialogue among Civilizations  incooperation with UNESCO and the Council of Europe with the focus on youth.As President of the Republic of Macedonia  permitme to say that we are greatly looking forward tocelebrating the tenth anniversary of the first regionalgathering of the dialogue among civilizations  whichwe are preparing together with UNESCO. It was here at this rostrum  that my predecessor  President BorisTrajkovski  with the strong backing of the UnitedNations and UNESCO  shared his dreams about thatinitiative  which was then realized in Ohrid in 2003 when the wounds from the bloody conflict in theformer Yugoslavia were still fresh. The words of theOhrid message speak of the undoubtedly enormouspotential of the Republic of Macedonia: to be afunctional multi-ethnic  multilingual and multireligiousfoundation of the European Balkans and of the Balkansin Europe.Next year we will host the third World Conferenceon Dialogue among Religions and Civilizations.The Republic of Macedonia has always believed thatdialogue is irreplaceable and put its belief into practice.We condemn all forms of violence. No one should be avictim of violence — not individuals  peoples  Statesor their official representatives. Just as the limits of decency must be observed in public spaces  so violencecan never be a fitting response.The rule of law and human rights are fundamentalprinciples and they cannot be subject to compromise. Ifully agree with the position of the Secretary-General stated during his visit to Macedonia in July  that weshould never make compromises when it comes touniversally acknowledged principles. It is the dutyof the United Nations and of each and every one ofus not to subject the rule of law and human rights tocompromise. Therefore  I have asked the Secretary-General to bring renewed attention to the 2008 reportof the Independent Expert on minority issues  Ms. GayMcDougall  entitled “Promotion and protection of allhuman rights  civil  political  economic  social andcultural rights  including the right to development”(A/HRC/7/23).Allow me as well to recall the recommendationin that report that the Government of our southernneighbour should abstain from disputing whether thereis a Macedonian minority  and instead focus on theprotection of the right to self-identification  freedomof expression and freedom of association of thatcommunity. In the recommendation  our neighbour isurged to respect the judgment of the European Court ofHuman Rights  according to which the country shouldbe allowed to use the word Macedonian to denote itsname and to freely express its ethnic identity. Thereport concludes that the right to protection must berespected  as elaborated in the 1992 Declaration onMinorities and in the basic international conventionson human rights.I expressed my expectation that the Secretary-General would make use of his authority and engage inorder to overcome the impasse on the talks regardingour country’s name that are taking place under hisauspices. Respect for the judgment of the InternationalCourt of Justice will mean respect for international lawand the rule of law in practice. I believe in this process.I believe that this process can lead to a solution  but wecannot wait another 19 years for that to happen.Today  in the twenty-first century  it seems quiteabsurd to be called “a former nation” or “a formercolony”. In the name of the dignity of my people  Ihereby take this opportunity to publicly thank all 134Members of the United Nations that have recognizedthe constitutional name of my country  which is theRepublic of Macedonia. And here is my appeal toeveryone here: address us from the point of view of thefuture.I fully subscribe to what was said by the UnitedStates President  Mr. Barack Obama  just a few daysago  in this very Hall. We believe that freedom and self-determination are not unique to one culture. Those arenot simply American values or Western values  they areuniversal values.It has happened in the history of the UnitedNations that a country was given additional criteriato become a Member  but the 1948 advisory opinionof the International Court of Justice stated clearly thatthis was not correct and was contrary to the Charterof the United Nations. Except in our case  no one hasbeen deprived of the right of self-identification thusfar. Macedonia should get what it rightfully deserves;something that all Member States represented herealready have and enjoy. Without the right of self-identification  Macedonia is prevented from beingequal to all other Member States.In that regard we are discussing internationallaw. We are talking about the rule of law. Here is thejudgment of the International Court of Justice adopted10 months ago in favour of the Republic of Macedonia.We are asking for this judgment  adopted by a bodyof the United Nations  to be respected. We ask forthis because we have been prevented from using ourconstitutional name even at this very rostrum. TheInternational Court of Justice  in paragraph 95 of thejudgment  states clearly that Macedonia has the rightto refer to itself as the Republic of Macedonia in itsrelations with the other party and within internationalorganizations.In a spirit of good-neighbourly relations  and becauseof our strong determination to overcome and settleunresolved issues  I take this opportunity to appeal toour neighbour to work together with us in that direction.From this rostrum in the heart of the United Nations  Iurge them to respect the judgment of the InternationalCourt of Justice and their own internationally assumedobligations. We are neighbours  but we wish to be morethan just neighbours. We wish to be partners  allies andfriends  and to be able to build together the present andfuture of our people  our countries and our region. Wewish to work together with them and build a safe andfree world for our children.The protracted nature of the reform of the SecurityCouncil and the revitalization of the General Assembly  as well as the comprehensive process of reinforcingthe coherence and efficiency of the system  should notdiscourage us. On the contrary  they should serve as animpetus for further mobilization.Only the United Nations can provide integratedsolutions for interdependent issues such as development peace and security  human rights and humanitarianaction.In conclusion  I invite all Member States to recallthe words of Jean Monnet  the father of modernEurope. He described the use of the veto in modernEuropean history as the expression of lack of power fordialogue and the impossibility of overcoming nationalegoism. Let us build a prosperous world for our futuregenerations.We hope that our neighbour will make its wayout of crisis as soon as possible. We have proposed aseries of practical measures on how to upgrade oureconomic and good neighbourly cooperation  whichshould include a bilateral agreement on the avoidanceof double taxation. Macedonian taxes are favourable forour neighbour’s businessmen and  as always  the doorsof the Republic of Macedonia are wide open to them.The Republic of Macedonia firmly believes that theUnited Nations remains the centre of multilateralismand global governance. The Organization inspiresuniversal dialogue  which in most cases results in jointsolutions for handling global problems in order to reacha shared vision of the future of the international system."
"114",4641,"MLI",67,2012,"﻿At the outset I would like to pay well-deserved tribute to ChrisStevens and his colleagues  who died in Benghazi forthe same ideals as those of our common Organization the United Nations.Next  I wish to convey the warm congratulationsof the Malian delegation on the outstanding electionof the new President of the General Assembly. Thatchoice confirms the recognition  were such needed  ofhis qualities as a skilled diplomat. It is also a tributeto his country  Serbia  which maintains friendly andcooperative relations with my country. The Presidentof the General Assembly can be assured of the Maliandelegation’s complete readiness to work with him forthe full success of his mandate.In the same spirit  I express my great appreciationto his distinguished predecessor  Ambassador NassirAbdulaziz Al-Nasser  for the excellent manner in whichhe led the work of the previous session. I also take thisopportunity to pay warm tribute to Secretary-GeneralBan Ki-moon for his ongoing commitment to the idealsof the Organization. The settlement of international disputes bypeaceful means  which the President proposed as thecentral theme of the general debate  is timely  as itis a part of Chapter VI of the Charter of the UnitedNations  whose relevant provisions aim to limit hotbedsof tension through negotiation  mediation  conciliation arbitration  judicial settlement  resort to regionalarrangements or agreements  or through other peacefulmeans. The subject is quite current  in the light ofthe many crises and conflicts that seriously threateninternational peace and security.The settlement of disputes by peaceful means isparticularly important for my country  Mali  as it is acountry that is firmly attached to the ideals of peaceand stability. Despite that  today it is undergoing oneof the most difficult periods in its history. Its northernpart has been occupied by armed groups consistingof fundamentalist terrorists  drug traffickers andcriminals of every other sort. The most fundamentalhuman rights are being violated continuously by ahorde of heartless and lawless vandals.The Government of Mali has just requested theInternational Criminal Court to consider those odiousacts  which are no more and no less than war crimesand crimes against humanity. Whipping  amputation summary execution  rape  stoning and looting anddestruction of cultural and historical monuments andsites are the daily lot of the afflicted and helpless peopleof northern Mali.That sad situation led the interim President ofthe Republic of Mali to request  on 1 September  theEconomic Community of West African States forassistance in recovering the occupied territories andfighting terrorism. Similar requests have been made tothe Security Council through the Secretary-General as well as to the French Republic  the United States ofAmerica  the African Union and the European Union.However  I would like to firmly emphasize that alasting solution to the situation in the Sahel requiresstronger and more dynamic cooperation among theStates of the Sahel-Saharan region. In that vein  theGovernment of Mali remains in favour of the conveningof a meeting of heads of State and Government of theSahel region  with the support of the United Nationsand other partners  in order to support and strengthencapacities and the arrangement for coordinatingexisting regional mechanisms. In the specific case of our common area  theneighbouring countries of Algeria  Mali  Mauritaniaand the Niger have set up mechanisms  such as thejoint operational military staff committee based inTamanrasset  Algeria  and others involving joint patrolsand the right of pursuit. But we must recognize that thosemechanisms need to be fully operational. In that regard I would like to call for the support of the internationalcommunity for their effective implementation.My delegation would like to strongly emphasizethat the aggression and occupation in the northern partof Mali is a major collateral consequence of the Libyancrisis  as indicated in the report of the joint UnitedNations/African Union mission to assess the impact ofthe Libyan crisis in the Sahel region (see S/2012/42).The Security Council considered that report inJanuary (see S/PV.6709).The presence today of terrorist groups of variousnationalities on our soil and in the Sahel region is asituation that should mobilize the entire internationalcommunity to take joint  rapid and effective action because that threat knows no bounds. Here I shouldlike to reiterate the determination of the Government ofMali to continue the work that it has begun jointly withother core countries in the framework of the combatagainst terrorism  transnational organized crime andirredentist  subversive forces in the Sahelo-Saharanregion.In parallel with that approach  I should like toreaffirm the commitment undertaken by the interimPresident and the Government of Mali to negotiatewith our compatriots who are not terrorists. I havesaid it before and I will say it again from this UnitedNations rostrum: we in Mali are not afraid or ashamedof negotiating  but we will not negotiate with terrorists.We are not prepared to negotiate issues that call intoquestion the integrity of our territory and the secularnature of the country.The situation in northern Mali due to the occupationhas resulted in a deterioration in humanitarianconditions  which were already precarious owing tothe f low of internally displaced persons and of peopleseeking refuge in neighbouring countries. Because ofthe crisis  more than 350 000 people have had to f leenorthern Mali  including 84 000 internally displacedpersons and more than 268 000 others who are refugeesin neighbouring countries. The crisis has also hamperedaccess to education for more than 560 000 school-age children  300 000 of whom were in school before thecrisis began.There has also been damage to educational facilitiesand equipment. In addition  85 per cent of all teachersand 10 000 pupils have been displaced to the south  and50 000 school-age children are now in neighbouringcountries. Furthermore  schools have been occupied byflood-affected people in the south.As the Assembly is aware  Mali is facing tremendoushumanitarian needs in terms of housing  food  health education and nutrition for refugees  displaced personsand wage earners. During his stay in the region  theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees statedon 31 July 2012 that the crisis in Mali was “one of themost neglected humanitarian situations in the world”.He said that from an appeal for $153 million  his Officehad received only about $49 million to deal with thathumanitarian crisis.The Under-Secretary-General for HumanitarianAffairs  Ms. Valerie Amos noted during her visit toMali in August that $213 million was needed to dealwith the humanitarian crisis that is currently affectingmy country. That shows that the humanitarian situationis continuing to deteriorate  thus increasing the cost ofintervention.Here I would like to reiterate the gratitude of thepeople and the Government of Mali to all brotherlycountries and all partners of goodwill for theirhospitality in hosting our compatriots and for theirgenerous contributions. I therefore call for a greatermobilization by all of Mali’s partners and friends aswell as the coordination of aid for Mali nationals whoare displaced or refugees.Our Government of National Unity was establishedon 20 August 2012  with the fundamental mission ofquickly liberating the northern regions of the countryand of holding democratic  transparent  just andcredible elections. With a view to recovering territorialintegrity  we are calling for the adoption by the SecurityCouncil of a resolution authorizing  under Chapter VIIof the Charter of the United Nations  intervention byan international military force so as to help the Malianarmy to retake and ensure the security of our nationalterritory.The Government of Mali would like to see theimmediate arrival of such a force to support the defenceand security forces of Mali in carrying out their noble mission of recovering and maintaining our territorialintegrity and of protecting persons and property. Thepeople of Mali continue to hope that the members ofthe Security Council will give due consideration to thatrequest.I should therefore like to take this opportunity toreiterate the gratitude of the people and the Governmentof Mali to the Economic Community of West AfricanStates  the African Union and to the United Nations fortheir ongoing efforts to put a lasting end to the crisis inMali  which also threatens the stability of the subregionand of Africa  and even beyond.Our meetings are taking place at a time whendeveloping countries are facing many major challenges in particular the consequences of the economic andfinancial crisis  the burden of external debt and a declinein development assistance. There is therefore a need toundertake a more in-depth dialogue on new strategiesaimed at mobilizing additional stable and predictableresources so as to ensure financing for developmentprogrammes and the achievement of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  in particular in the areas of health education  food security and the environment.Climate change is one of the major challenges facingthe world. The very survival of our planet is threatenedby natural disasters caused by that phenomenon  whichis seriously affecting living conditions in countries ofthe Sahel such as mine through  inter alia  the inexorableadvance of the desert; the silting of rivers  in particularthe river Niger; ecosystem deterioration; f loods; andproblematic precipitation patterns.I should like to highlight the need to find appropriateresponses to this serious situation so as to avert tragicrepercussions for sustainable development in the mostvulnerable countries.The United Nations has a pivotal role to play in thebuilding of a new world order that is based on justice solidarity and sustainable development. In order totackle current and future challenges  it is importantthat the current mode of functioning of the UnitedNations be reviewed so as to take into account the newconfiguration of the world  which is fundamentallydifferent from that which prevailed at the time of itsfounding. Such a review should  inter alia  make itpossible to correct the historical imbalance that resultsin the continued exclusion of Africa from the limitedcircle of the countries that are permanent members ofthe Security Council.To conclude  I hope that all present will agreewith me that the situation in Mali is a manifestation ofsecurity problems in the Sahel and that it should be dealtwith comprehensively through the appropriate UnitedNations mechanisms. It is therefore urgent to act  firstof all to put an end to the suffering of the people of Mali and secondly to prevent the development of a similar orworse situation for other peoples in the Sahel  or eventhe rest of the world.It is also urgent to act because criminal and terroristactivities in northern Mali and the security risks thatthey pose for the entire subregion are in the long term aserious threat to the rest of the world.Finally  it is urgent to act so as to resume cooperationwith our bilateral and multilateral partners so as toconsolidate a republic based on secular and democraticvalues.Today my people are seriously affected. ButMalians have not lost hope  because they are convincedof the support of other nations  whose leaders andrespresentatives are here. Malians in both the north andthe south legitimately await their active solidarity toemerge from the crisis. My people are convinced thattheir appeal for international solidarity will be heardand followed up with appropriate measures. Maliansknow that nations have the means. They look forward todecisive and diligent action. At stake is the stability andsecurity of our subregion  of Africa and of the world."
"115",4684,"MLT",67,2012,"﻿I extend my warmestcongratulations to Mr. Jeremić on his election to presideover the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.The demanding agenda of this Assembly makes thatno easy task  but I assure him of Malta’s support andfriendship.Over a year ago  the protagonists of the Arab Springproclaimed that their time had come. They shed theirblood for freedom  calling for an end to the status quoof oppression and injustice. Unfortunately  extremistspersist in their efforts to derail that call. United States Ambassador Christopher Stevens was  sadly  one oftheir victims. One cannot stress strongly enough theimportance of protecting the inviolability of diplomaticpremises and personnel  and reiterate our collectivecondemnation of the deplorable acts perpetratedrecently in various capitals of our neighbourhood.Many doubted the success of the Arab Spring;many feared its call for change. Yet change did come.We are now witnessing the first seeds of democracyblossoming in places where that would previously havebeen unthinkable. And more change is yet to come.People around the world are calling for it. Theirs is acall that pits us against conventional thinking  pushingus out of our comfort zone and into the unfamiliar — acall for humankind to go beyond the borders of humandifference and indifference. We have the choice to heedthat call or to ignore it  but make no mistake — we dohave a choice.Malta knows all too well what the call for changeis about. It experiences it first hand as it receives thosef leeing war  hunger and persecution  arriving on itsshores after a perilous journey in search of a betterlife. Malta recognizes that we need to give those peoplesafe refuge  and we do so with a sense of solidarity anda strong belief that every human life is worth saving.We are committed to giving assistance  and we remainsteadfast in our belief that Malta will continue itshistorical role of welcoming those who are bereft ofhuman rights and dignity.It is in that spirit that Malta calls upon theinternational community to give those people genuinealternatives  and to no longer accept that it is a problemin someone else’s backyard. We want to ensure thatthe attainment of the Millennium Development Goalsdoes not become a simple check-marking exercise  butinstead underscores a truly global effort that will liftmillions out of situations of deprivation  disease anddiscrimination. Those goals must be sustained longafter the media has gone and the speeches are over  andwe urge the Assembly to spare no effort in seeing thatit is done.The choice of freedom has seen Malta’s neighbourto the south hold its first free and fully democraticelections in 60 years. We salute Libya on its recentsuccesses. For many  the act of voting was a success initself. The Libyan people voted for their policy-makers.They did not vote for ideology  but for visionaries whowill breathe life into their aspirations. It is a time of celebration for our neighbours  and Malta joins othersin recognizing their achievements  as well as theachievements of the other countries of the Arab Spring.Yet as we bear witness to the wave of democraticreform drifting across the southern Mediterraneanshores  we must also recall that others are still strugglingfor freedom. The situation in Syria cannot but troubleus. Oppression and violence are never the solution.They only stif le the inevitable for a short while  forthe human spirit can never be defeated. And it is ourduty  as the international community  to respond. It isnot a question of resolutions and syntax. It is our moralobligation to ensure that the people of Syria are notabandoned to a tragic fate.The time to sit on the fence and live with prejudicesand division is over. Malta firmly believes that nowcan be the right time for a new era — not just for thesouthern littoral shores of the Mediterranean Sea  butfor the whole basin. The Mediterranean region hasknown too many wars  too many divisions and far toomany prejudices. As the heart of the Mediterranean Malta understands well the nuances of the basin  andit is this understanding that pushes us to reaffirm ourcommitment to the promotion of prosperity and peaceacross the whole Mediterranean region and beyond.Malta’s initiative to convene a European Union-Leagueof Arab States ministerial meeting in Malta in 2008was specifically aimed at attaining that. We salute thedecision for the “Malta II” meeting to take place inCairo next November.Our efforts did not stop there. In a few days’ time Malta will host the 5+5 Heads of State and GovernmentMeeting of the Western Mediterranean Forum. Thatgrouping should offer an excellent opportunity todiscuss such issues. The summit meeting coincideswith the dramatic changes taking place in the politicallandscape in North Africa. The expectation forthe implementation of concrete action in the Euro-Mediterranean region  transcending ineffectivedeclarations  statements and conclusions  is important.I hope that the Malta Summit will meet the aspirationsof the peoples of the northern and southern basin of theMediterranean. We cannot fail in that regard. We oweit to our peoples.However  if we want to truly embrace the changesthat are taking place around us  we must take themfurther. The call to rise above stalemate and stagnationis nowhere more evident than in the Middle East peace process  where the fear of change is holding allthose involved back. The parties concerned must facesome uncomfortable truths in order to overcome thestumbling blocks. Bickering over who does what whenis not the way forward. Forging common ground doesnot equate with giving in.Malta believes that the international communitymust redouble its efforts in that process and that therecan be no rest until the world welcomes a truly stableand secure Middle East. We owe it to the Palestiniansand the Israelis. We owe it to the wider Mediterraneanregion  which has now been deadlocked for far toolong in the grips of that struggle. There really is noother option than that  for the alternative is furtherentrenchment of the positions held and more extremismand instability. Malta reaffirms its commitment to theefforts of the United Nations and the European Union in particular towards the attainment of the goal of twoviable States living side by side in harmony. However that solution is possible only if it is feasible on theground. That means no unilateral action  which wouldmake it an unattainable reality.A year from now  we should no longer be talkingof a Middle East peace process but of a Middle Eastin peace  and that is that. The sceptics among us willnote that that is what was said last year and  of course even the year before. For over 60 years  we have beenmaking that call but we must not let the opportunityslip away once again. The Arab Spring shows us thatwe need to answer the call of history now. It can bedifferent this time.The events happening around us highlight not onlyour sense of duty to promote and protect human rightsworldwide but also our sense of responsibility  for theactions that we take or fail to take today will have abearing on future generations. Malta drew the attentionto that belief with its call for a universal declaration onhuman responsibilities  made in this very Hall duringthe sixty-fourth session of the Assembly in 2009.We know that we are not alone in the endeavour.We share with other Member States a commitment tosolidarity  cohesive ideas and a harmonious discoursein favour of the sustainability of the planet and thestewardship of its peoples. That conviction encouragesus to push forward with our efforts for we are certainthat history will be on our side.In conclusion  our destiny is what we perceiveour future to be. We are convinced that the United Nations stands for the betterment of humanity. Weremain committed to living up to the expectations andaspirations to which we adhere under its Charter. Mostof all  we need to embrace change. The future beginswith the choices that we make today."
"116",4730,"MMR",67,2012,"﻿First and foremost  Iwould like to congratulate Mr. Jeremić on his well-deserved election as President of the General Assemblyat its sixty-seventh session. His country  Serbia  andMyanmar have traditionally enjoyed a close friendshipand cooperation. Under his able leadership  the GeneralAssembly will hold deliberations on measures toaddress the challenges faced by the world today. I amconfident that his great wisdom  rich experience andgreat diplomatic skills will guide our discussions toproduce the desired outcomes.I would also like to take this opportunity to extendour sincere thanks and appreciation to his predecessor His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  for hisoutstanding leadership at the sixty-sixth session.Myanmar consistently pursues an independent andactive foreign policy  a basic tenet of which is to activelycontribute to the maintenance of international peaceand security. In so doing  we encourage efforts to settledifferences among nations by peaceful and amicablemeans. Our position is consistent with the essence ofthe theme of the current session  namely  “Bringingabout adjustment or settlement of international disputesor situations by peaceful means”.There are different views and assessments regardingthe outcome of the United Nations Conference onSustainable Development  held in Brazil in June. Anumber of important decisions were taken on variousissues  such as the renewal of commitments  thelinkage of sustainable development to the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  renewable energy and theestablishment of arrangements for better coordinationon sustainable development. Member States must turn those decisions into actions in order to leave the legacyof a safe and sustainable environment to our futuregenerations.Since becoming a Member State  Myanmar hasalways adhered to the founding principles of the UnitedNations. Our participation in the General Assemblyhere in New York amply demonstrates our commitmentto active participation in  and support of  the work ofthe Organization.Today’s world is full of new challenges andopportunities. Urbanization and industrializationare taking place in developing countries on anunprecedented scale. Rapid progress in informationtechnology gives the impression that our world isgetting smaller. Meanwhile  the natural environmentand the climate are facing new threats and challenges.In short  the world is changing as never before. It isalso timely and appropriate to devote attention duringthe current session to issues such as the post-2015development agenda and the rule of law.Myanmar is moving forward on the democraticpath  but that has not been an easy task. I would thereforelike to take this opportunity to share our experiencesin that regard. In the ongoing reform process  we facechallenges as well as opportunities. Within a short time the people of Myanmar have brought about remarkablechanges. I feel greatly privileged and honoured todutifully serve the people as their President at thiscrucial time in the history of our nation. I truly considermy people as my own parents and elders.Since I took office some 18 months ago  theparliament  the judiciary  the armed forces  the ethnicgroups  the political parties  civil society and the peopleat large have been taking tangible and irreversible stepsin the democratic transition and reform process. Leavingbehind a system of authoritarian Government  in whichthe administrative  legislative and judicial powers werecentralized  we have now established a democraticGovernment and a strong and viable parliament thatfollows a practice of checks and balances.Despite the challenges  we can now see encouragingprogress and significant developments in the country.Those include the granting of amnesties to prisoners; thedignified return of exiled political forces; the successfulconvening of the 2012 by-elections in a free  fair andtransparent manner; the abolition of media censorship;freedom of access to the Internet; the establishment of worker and employer organizations; and increasedparticipation by the people in the political process.At the current stage of the political process  wecan see the emergence of democratic traits  such asthe increasing participation of various political forcesand their mutual tolerance  magnanimity  the expandedscope of political participation  representation andaccountability. Our Government and other stakeholdershave fostered a new political culture of tolerance anddialogue.The former main opposition leader  Nobel laureateDaw Aung San Suu Kyi  now participates in parliament not only in her capacity as a member but also asChairperson of the parliamentary Rule of Law andStability Committee. She is also in New York this week.As a Myanmar citizen  I would like to congratulate heron the honour that she has received in this country inrecognition of her efforts for democracy.Our country’s political progress is strengtheningits political legitimacy. That  in turn  facilitates theestablishment of basic political stability  thereby pavingthe way for the economic and social transformationnecessary for better living standards for the people.The legislative body has also developed well andfunctions more effectively at every sitting. Parliamenthas now adopted landmark laws through democraticpractices. We are promulgating laws and by-laws taking into account the fact that economic developmentmust not widen the gap between the rich and the poor.The rights of citizens must be protected. The naturalenvironment must be preserved. Our workers shouldenjoy rights in line with international standards. We givecarefull consideration to investments in the extractivesectors  such as energy  to ensure transparency andimpartiality.We believe that the cessation of all armed conflictsis a prerequisite to building genuine democracy. Assuch  we place high priority on achieving lasting peacein the country. In accordance with our motto “From warto peace”  we are striving to put an end to the long-standing problems in regions inhabited by our ethnicgroups. To date  we have reached ceasefire agreementswith 10 armed groups. We will continue the peacetalks  while further strengthening confidence-buildingmeasures. Peace negotiations at the national level willthen continue towards a final peace agreement  whichwould completely end the armed hostilities. In order to redress the situation in northernMyanmar  leaders of the Union Peace-making WorkCommittee and the Kachin armed group are holdinginformal consultations and are working to furtherstrengthen confidence-building measures. We considerany loss of life and property on either side in the armedconflict as a loss for the country.While the Government is resolutely pursuingpolitical  social and economic reforms  someunfortunate and unexpected issues have arisen. A casein point is the recent communal violence in RakhineState. In that connection  I would like to mention inthe first place that the people inhabiting our country regardless of race  religion and gender  have the right tolive in peace and security.As the Assembly is aware  an independentnational-level investigation commission has beenestablished to look into the issue. To ensure impartiality the commission is composed of representatives from allstrata of society  including widely respected personalitiesfrom the Buddhist  Muslim  Christian and Hindu faiths.Upon completion of its task  the commission will submitits findings and recommendations to me.Demonstrating our determination to resolve theissue in a transparent manner  we have facilitated fieldvisits to Rakhine State by representatives from theOrganization of Islamic Cooperation  the Associationof Southeast Asian Nations  United Nations agencies the United States and resident foreign diplomatsin Myanmar. Access is being facilitated to thoseorganizations that are willing to provide reliefassistance to both communities without discrimination.The issue at hand cannot be resolved overnight. Itwill be resolved by taking short-term and long-termmeasures through a multifaceted approach  takinginto account political  economic and social aspects. Isincerely believe that as an independent and sovereignState  Myanmar has done the right thing to secure ourborders and to safeguard our sovereignty. We will doour utmost to resolve the issue in line with internationalnorms.I am well aware of the fact that Myanmar’sdemocratic transformation process will be a complexand delicate one that requires patience. To completethe process  we certainly need the understanding andsupport of the United Nations and its States Members the international community as a whole and  last butnot least  the people of Myanmar. At the same time  it is equally important that Myanmar should be viewed froma different and new perspective. It is also necessary forus to be able to work in a more favourable environmentthan ever before.Myanmar is now ushering in a new era. As amember in the family of nations  Myanmar willparticipate more actively in the activities of the UnitedNations in various fields. Standing as a responsible andrespectable nation on the world stage  we will take onthe challenges of the twenty-first century in a bold andresolute manner.I would also like to take this opportunity tocongratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his reappointmentas General-Secretary and on his achievements thus far.Before I conclude  allow me to brief ly mentionan important figure  namely  U Thant  a brilliantson of Myanmar who served as the third Secretary-General. Even in those days  U Thant had a vision ofone world. He envisioned a global society guided bythe spirit of one world — a world safe for diversity anda place of peaceful coexistence where global citizenscould practice the virtues of tolerance  cooperation understanding and compassion. We believe that if wemake his vision a reality  we will soon achieve a worldthat is more peaceful and prosperous. U Thant’s tirelessendeavours for peace and his achievements during histenure as the Secretary-General will never be forgotten.The people of Myanmar will always take pride in andremember him as a great son of Myanmar."
"117",4741,"MNE",67,2012,"﻿It is a great honourto deliver these remarks on behalf of Montenegro. At theoutset  allow me to address two friends and colleagues.I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election topreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-seventhsession. You will enjoy  as always  the full cooperationand support of Montenegro in this important task. Iwould also like to pay tribute to Mr. Nassir AbdulazizAl-Nasser for his contribution to the work of theGeneral Assembly  especially in promoting mediationas a means of settling disputes by peaceful means.I extend special appreciation to Secretary-GeneralBan Ki-moon for his efforts to promote multilateralismand joint action in ensuring a peaceful  secure andprosperous world. I would especially like to reiterateour satisfaction with his recent successful visit toMontenegro  which confirmed the strong partnershipbetween the United Nations and my country.Montenegro has always been strongly committedto multilateral cooperation and respect for the purposesand principles enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations. We have demonstrated this in our region bypromoting good-neighbourly relations and regionalcooperation  as well as worldwide through supportfor and participation in global efforts to build andmaintain peace.The High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law thatpreceded the general debate once again stressed theimportance of democratic governance and respectfor human rights. These are preconditions for theprosperity of all our citizens and of society as a whole.Failure in this regard is our common concern. Wetherefore stress the individual responsibility of allcountries to strengthen the rule of law and promotehuman rights  as well as the role of the United Nationsin providing adequate and efficient support to theseefforts. Respect for the rule of law at the internationallevel  national ownership of rule of law activities  andthe incorporation and effective implementation ofinternational norms within our domestic legal systemsare our key objectives.Strengthening international partnership inmaintaining and building peace and security iscrucial. As a Mediterranean country  we share theconcerns of the international community for the recentdevelopments in the southern Mediterranean and theMiddle East.The scale and consequences of the violence inSyria serve as a stern reminder of the importance ofpreventive measures in preserving international peaceand security; hence the need to enhance United Nationspreventive capacities and the role of dialogue andmediation in peaceful conflict resolution. Montenegrostrongly advocates an approach that emphasizes the early prevention and elimination of threats before theyevolve into sources of conflict.The responsibility to protect and itsoperationalization remain a key task. In the eraof accountability  perpetrators of crimes againsthumanity should not go unpunished. Countries needto demonstrate strong commitment to the rule of law respect for human rights and freedoms  democracy andnon-use of force in settling disputes.Montenegro stands ready to increase its participationin peacekeeping operations  in accordance with itscapacities and in line with international efforts. Wesupport in particular United Nations initiatives aimedat improving civilian protection and the developmentof civilian capacities for maintaining stability byadvancing the mandates of peacekeeping missions.In that context  we fully support the implementationof Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) andstrengthening the role of women in conflict and post-conflict situations.My country is firmly dedicated to the comprehensiveimplementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  as well as the United Nationssanctions regime. With regard to the Global Strategyreview  we fully endorse the proposal of the Secretary-General to appoint a United Nations counter-terrorismcoordinator in order to improve strategic coordination coherence and substantive implementation of theStrategy.We strongly support global efforts for disarmamentand non-proliferation  while stressing that thefight against transnational threats  such as humantrafficking  cybercrime and the illicit drug trade require a comprehensive approach.As a multicultural country  Montenegro buildsits society on principles of understanding  toleranceand mutual respect. Diversity does not divide butenriches our society  thanks to tradition and trust builtthroughout the long Montenegrin history. As we haverecently witnessed  differences can be abused andeasily turn into senseless acts of violence against theinnocent  which is unacceptable. My country thereforeremains committed to promoting intercultural dialogue tolerance and respect at all levels.In the six years following the restoration of itsindependence  Montenegro has achieved significantprogress  both in internal development and ininternational relations. We have very good relationswith all our neighbours  while the region as a wholestands before a unique challenge to demonstrate that itis capable of reinforcing overall cooperation.Montenegro actively participates in all regionalprocesses and initiatives aimed at intensifying mutualand constructive cooperation and strengtheningsecurity and stability in South-East Europe. Afterits turbulent past  the region is brought together bythe common strategic goal of European integration.Although there remain issues that need internationalassistance and support  we have achieved a newlevel of trust  development and maturity that haveresulted in the individual progress of each country inEuropean and Euro-Atlantic integration. The openingof European Union accession negotiations in June thisyear and our continuous progress on our Euro-Atlanticpath represent strong recognition of the results we haveachieved. We are fully focused on and committed tocontinuing the implementation of reforms and reachingthe highest international standards  in particular in theareas of the rule of law  human rights and freedoms  anddemocratic governance. Strengthening institutional andhuman capacities will reinforce our political stabilityand economic prosperity  as is essential in this time ofever-evolving crises that affect us all.Progress in the integration processes does not meanthe absence of problems. We attach great importanceto resolving issues essential for the development of oursociety  such as the empowerment of women  improvingthe situation of the Roma population  and settling thestatus of refugees  internally displaced persons and othervulnerable groups. We are fully committed to tacklingthese complex challenges through efficient and lastingsolutions and models for the better social integrationof every individual. We are particularly aware of thisat times when social and economic disparities becomemore visible and demand stronger efforts by the Statefor their elimination.The promotion of and respect for human rightsare important goals in our internal and foreign policyagenda. We are therefore confident that Montenegrowill gain the trust of States Members of the UnitedNations this coming November and be elected to theHuman Rights Council for the period 2013-2015. We arestrongly committed to contributing to the efficiency andeffectiveness of the Council and the system of protectionand improvement of human rights and freedoms.Support for the United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights  full cooperation with the Council and its special procedures  and active promotion of humanrights and freedoms at the international level in orderto respond in a timely manner to situations of humanrights violations in the world — these will be majorguidelines for our activities in the Council.The results of the implementation of the UnitedNations Delivering as One reform programme speakin favour not only of reform of the Organization but also of even greater effectiveness in adaptingthe United Nations to the development needs of acountry. Montenegro has achieved tangible progressin implementing an integrated programme and  toa certain extent  is already implementing the jointprogramming model as a next phase of Deliveringas One. Strengthening national ownership and jointprogramming  as well as making use of the relativeadvantages of the various United Nations agencies are fundamental principles on which our cooperationprogramme is based up to 2016. We will continue tosupport all efforts aimed at improving the UnitedNations system and its effectiveness and operationalactivities in the field.Sustainable development  poverty reduction andeconomic growth  conflict and post-conflict situationsare just some of the issues that require joint action.In that context  sustainable development with all itspillars stands out as our priority. Montenegro is amongthe countries that are on track to meet the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs). In that regard  we stressthe importance of the MDGs as a basis for definingsustainable development goals  which must be a centralpart of the global post-2015 development agenda andthus help us to form a clear expression of politicalcommitment to sustainable development. We standready to actively contribute to shaping and determiningthe necessary indicators  as well as timelines fortheir implementation. We believe that the questionof sustainable development  as well as the issue ofreaching legally binding agreements on climate changewithin the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change  must involve compromise on the partof United Nations Members. We therefore hope to seepositive developments at the Doha Conference.A shared determination  openness and willingnessto reach compromise and accept reality are all trulynecessary in order for us to move forward. Ourcommitment to meeting the MDGs should not beneglected  however difficult the economic and financialsituation worldwide. Eradicating poverty  and creating partnerships with civil society and the private sector soas to enable us to achieve sustainable energy for all by2030  as well as the Zero Hunger Challenge launchedby the Secretary-General  are our common objectives.Together we can achieve those goals.At a time when interdependence and integrationare major trends in global politics  no country on itsown can handle the increasingly demanding challengesposed by modern society. Cooperation is a prerequisitefor success. I am confident that small countries likeMontenegro can play an important role and be part ofthe solution. We remain dedicated to the principles ofcooperation and mutual trust  and strongly committedto contributing to strengthening the United Nationssystem and its role in global governance  at both thenational and the international levels.Before I conclude  allow me to add a small  personalnote. The first time I attended the General Assembly I was an attaché from the then Socialist FederativeRepublic of Yugoslavia. Today  many years and threedifferent States later  I have the privilege of standingbefore the Assembly as head of the delegation of mycountry  Montenegro. The world may have changed inways we never anticipated  but our Organization andwhat it stands for have weathered the challenges andremain globally important and equally valuable forevery one of us."
"118",4787,"MNG",67,2012,"﻿Last year  Mongolia observedthe fiftieth anniversary of its joining this important body. Thanks to the choice of our free people  this sonof a herder is here today  happy to report on Mongolia’sprogress in building a strong and free society.More than 20 years ago  Mongolia stood at acrossroads. The f lag of democracy was firmly plantedin our rich and historic soil when  in the cold winter of1989 and in the spring of the White Horse Year of 1990 decades of rule without the consent of the governed wereswept aside. Individual rights and liberties prevailed.Our revolution did not break a single window  and notone drop of blood was shed.More than two decades later  Mongolia is a stablebeacon of self-governance  a moving force behind theAsian Partnership Initiative for Democracy and thecurrent President of the Community of Democracies.We are proud to chair that world movement for freedom.Mongolia has demonstrated a firm commitmentto transparency  accountability and the rule of law.We have recognized that that is the only way that ourdemocracy can succeed. Therefore  we cannot toleratepublic corruption at any level  from the highest officialsto the ordinary citizen. Corruption is like an infectiousdisease  growing in the dark  eating away at the publictrust  scaring away investors  robbing average citizensof opportunities and attacking the vital immune systemof a nation. We must shine a light on corruption andattack it head-on.Additionally  our track record of free and fairelections and the peaceful transfer of power from oneparty to another can serve as an example to our sisterdemocracies around the world. Mongolia is movingtowards more direct and participatory democracy.We are empowering our people  not the Government.Mongolia is proud to be the democratic anchor in theEast.No democracy is ever perfect. We have experiencedchallenges similar to those experienced by other youngdemocracies. Democracy does not end with the castingof a ballot. That is just the beginning.Mongolia is uniquely situated on many levels democratically  economically and geographically. Ourdrive for democracy  transparency and hope for peacemakes our nation a vital regional player.Economically  we are blessed by extraordinarygrowth — nearly 17 per cent last year. Keeping up withour high rate of growth is a very real challenge andone that we are prepared to meet directly. We are very focused on balancing two goals — first  sharing theopportunities created by our economic success with allMongolians  and secondly  demonstrating clearly andfirmly that Mongolia is open for business and a fullyengaged member of the international community.Our nation’s needs are significant — improvedinfrastructure  better health care and world-classeducation. We have much to do to meet the immediateand long-term needs of our people. Our people arethe key to our success. We need to invest in theirfuture. We need to invest in both social and economicinfrastructure. We are committed to making theinvestments needed to give our children the brightfutures they deserve.As an emerging leader of the global community Mongolia also has important international priorities.None is more important than protecting ourenvironment. All nations must work to preserve ourplanet as our economies expand and mature. I washonoured and humbled to be recognized by the UnitedNations Environmental Programme this year for thework we are doing in Mongolia to preserve our preciousenvironment. We are committed to doing even more.Another priority for Mongolia is expandinghuman rights. Mongolia has established an effectivemoratorium on capital punishment. We are seeking topermanently abolish the death penalty in Mongolia bylegislative action very soon. A Government is createdby its people; therefore no Government has the rightto take the life of those who have created it. Let me beclear: capital punishment is ineffective and barbaric.Mongolia cares deeply about safeguarding globalpeace. We must preserve our planet by eliminatingnuclear weapons across the world. We are also firmlyopposed to storing nuclear waste on Mongolian soil.We are celebrating 20 years of enjoying nuclear-weapon-free status. I am grateful that on 17 September the five permanent members of the SecurityCouncil — the People’s Republic of China  France the Russian Federation  the United Kingdom and theUnited States — signed a joint declaration reaffirmingthat status for Mongolia.The dialogue on Mongolia and its nuclear-weapon-free zone  which was initiated and has been ledby Mongolia  has continued to make progress. We willhost an event in 2015 to make even further progress.While nuclear power may remain a viable energyoption for some  any nuclear energy programme indevelopment must submit to the permanent supervisionof the United Nations and the International AtomicEnergy Agency. Any nation seeking to build nuclearpower must not endanger the peace and security ofits independent neighbours. The solution to thosechallenges is engagement  not isolation. The solution ismore diplomacy  more dialogue and more action.Now more than ever  it is clear that words aloneare not enough. We must be united in taking action topreserve peace. That goal is even more imperative inlight of the conflicts that have grown ever more tensein areas such as the Middle East. I was saddened by thedeath of the United States Ambassador and others inLibya. The mission of diplomacy is peaceful. Attackson diplomatic compounds violate both the letter andspirit of international law.Today  I join with Mongolia’s allies in condemningthe needless violence and bloodshed in Syria. Last yearI urged action. The protest had started peacefully  butwas met with violence from the Syrian Government.Each day  each hour and  indeed  each minute  thesituation grows worse. In dealing with crises such asthat in Syria  we must remember that those dying arenot just citizens of that nation. They are also citizensof our planet. They are therefore also our brothersand sisters. The world should be unified and direct inbringing the bloodshed to an end before another life isneedlessly lost.Young girls and boys should be in school  studyingfor their future  building their dreams. Young girls andboys  as well as their mothers and fathers  should not bedying in the streets and living through nightmares. Thatcrisis is not just a subject for television programmes.We Members of the United Nations are not spectators.The Organization was not created merely to watch ashow unfold on our televisions. We have to act. We haveto move.Too many mothers suffer when their childrenstruggle  whether it is for a lack of human rights oreconomic opportunity. Mothers want their children tobe free. They want their children to have a job. Theywant a better life for their children. My 92-year-old-mother reminds me daily to serve all people withrespect  especially women  children and the elderly.Women are the backbone of the family and the bedrockof a nation. They bring life into the world. They sensethe cries of an infant. Their instincts are to care for the old  the sick and those in need. Our mothers  sisters anddaughters share a core value of caring for others.We need more women leaders. Women tend to seethe whole picture. For society to advance  we need morewomen in public service at all levels  local to global.They bring a unique perspective that is often missingin global challenges. Has anyone ever heard of a femalebloody dictator or tyrant? I think not. If there were morewomen in power  I think we would have more harmony more engagement  less suffering and less conflict. I amproud to report that in our last elections  we tripled thenumber of women in Parliament.The way to empower women is to ensure that girlsshare the same educational opportunities as boys.Education is the most basic human right. It is thefundamental building block for human development andfree society. We owe our children — all of them — theopportunities that a strong education can offer. Insteadof weapons  we should invest more in education  whichunlocks the potential of every child. The return onsuch investment will be higher  both for the young menand women of tomorrow and for the world. Educatednations are more secure economically  respect humanrights and have greater political freedom.In conclusion  I am happy to report Mongolia’sincredible forward movement and to renew ourcommitment as a part of the community of nations. Weaccept both the rights and responsibilities that comewith that honour.Eight hundred and fifty years ago  our great king Chinggis Khan  was born. He built the largest landempire in the history of the world. Yet that great kingdid not erect a single statute to himself. Chinggis Khanfamously noted  “It was easier to conquer the world onhorseback than to dismount and try to govern.” Let usbe frank. It is not easy to be a diplomat in a troubledworld. It is not easy to fight for equal opportunity forall. It is not easy to shine a light on corruption. It is noteasy to govern by the rule of law. It is not easy to buildreal democracy.It is easier to build statues. It is easier to destroy.It is hard to govern well. But we all must dismount andgovern  and govern well. That is vital in order to builda world where our children feel safer  a world whereour families are stronger  a world where all nations canprosper. That is the legacy that real leaders need to build — notstatues  but opportunities for all humankind. Let us together  build opportunities for all."
"119",4828,"MOZ",67,2012,"﻿It is a greathonour to address the General Assembly. I would liketo join other speakers in congratulating His ExcellencyMr. Vuk Jeremić on his election to preside over theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I amsure that his diplomatic experience will contribute tothe success of the work of this session. I assure himof the full commitment of the Mozambican delegationto contributing to the success of this session. Iequally congratulate his predecessor  His ExcellencyAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of Qatar  forhis commitment and dedication in leading the Assemblyat its most recent session.I would also like to share with the Assembly oursatisfaction at the progress made during the most recentsession’s debate  held under the theme “The role ofmediation in the peaceful resolution of disputes”. Thattheme merited special attention by the internationalcommunity in various forums and was highlighted bythe adoption  last May  of the Helsinki final document which defines the principles regarding the role ofthe States in the mediation of disputes. The Helsinki document and the Manila Declaration on the PeacefulSettlement of International Disputes  adopted in 1982 which set a precedent for the peaceful resolution ofinternational disputes  represent a strengthening of theprinciples that guide States’ actions in the search forsolutions to disputes through peaceful means.We salute the timely choice of the theme “Bringingabout adjustment or settlement of international disputesor situations by peaceful means” for this session  at atime when various factors are hastening the advent ofconflict. Those factors  both internal and external innature  are due to political and/or economic factors.They include the quest for self-determination  socio-political exclusion  the use of natural resources  wealthdistribution  border disputes and cultural and religiousintolerance.Therefore  we believe that conflict resolutionprocesses should prioritize a holistic approach toresolving conflict  through a free and ongoing dialogueamong the parties to a conflict  thereby followinguniversally accepted principles such as dialogue basedon truth and the responsibility of the major stakeholdersat the national  regional and international levels;participation aimed at reaching real solutions andsustainable development based on an understandingof the need to strengthen the synergies between peace development and democracy; and the fight againstpoverty and promotion of sustainable development.The importance we attribute to these principlesstems from our experience in a process of reconciliationand peacekeeping  in which a constant and interactivedialogue within Mozambican society has allowed for theconsolidation of national unity  peace  development andthe fight against poverty so as to further participatorydemocracy.It is therefore with pride that  on October 4 Mozambique will celebrate 20 years of peace inan atmosphere of stability and economic growth accomplishments that are the result of an inclusivedialogue  a process of national reconciliation and ourobservance of the principles of democracy  freedomand justice.The failure of preventive measures leads us toresort to mechanisms for conflict management andresolution. For those mechanisms to be successful  weneed to re-evaluate the mandates of  and conventionalapproaches to  peacekeeping operations  given theunderlying changes that have come about in the actual nature of conflict itself since the establishment of theUnited Nations. Given the multidimensional natureof current conflicts  efforts aimed at their prevention management and resolution require the cooperationof various stakeholders at the national  regional andinternational levels under Chapter VIII of the UnitedNations Charter.We believe that success in the prevention management and resolution of conflicts is directlylinked to an understanding of their nature. The scopeand facilitation of mediation should be extensivelyinformed by the nature and dynamic of the particularconflict  so as to allow for a better analysis and effectiveaction and to ensure that all parties to the conflict takean integral role in its resolution. In order to pursuethese objectives  focus should be placed on cooperationwith regional and subregional organizations.We note with concern the persistence of anenvironment of tension and instability in Africa in particular in Madagascar  the eastern part of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Guinea-Bissau Somalia  the Sudan  South Sudan and Mali.In the Southern African Development Community(SADC) region  the various conflict resolution processesare based on a regional architecture for the prevention management and resolution of conflicts. This issubstantiated within the SADC organ for cooperation inthe political  defence and security areas by instrumentsthat create the conditions for dialogue. To facilitateits intervention in this area  the SADC organ createda mediation unit that is based on the participation ofa group of elders who  through their deep knowledgeof the internal dynamics of the countries referred have been contributing to peacebuilding  security andstability in the SADC region.The SADC Summit of Heads of State and ofGovernment recently held in Maputo in Augustthoroughly examined ways to improve the organization’sintervention in the prevention  management andresolution of conflicts. SADC thus reiterated itscommitment to working with the parties to the conflictsin the Republic of Madagascar  the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and the Republic of Zimbabwewhile at the same time reinforcing its partnership withthe international community.The mediation efforts of SADC for the resolutionof the political deadlock in Madagascar and the SADCfacilitation of the implementation of the comprehensive political agreement in Zimbabwe  continue to makeprogress towards the establishment of conditions forfree  fair and credible elections to take place in bothSADC countries.With regard to Madagascar  the efforts of themediation team led by the former President of theRepublic of Mozambique  Joaquim Chissano  resultedin the signing by 10 of the 11 political groups inMadagascar of the SADC road map to end the politicalcrisis in that country.In Zimbabwe  the political situation is generallystable  as the inclusive Government has madetremendous progress in the socioeconomic and politicalareas. The process for the establishment of a newconstitution  which will guide future elections  is at anadvanced stage.SADC reiterates its appeal for the complete liftingof the economic sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe inorder to contribute to the country’s economic recoveryand that of other countries in the region  with whichZimbabwe maintains close economic ties.However  SADC and the international communitycontinue to be concerned with the prevailing climateof instability and the subsequent humanitarian crisesin the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of theCongo. Cooperation mechanisms among SADC  theInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region the African Union and the United Nations and  aboveall  extensive comprehensive internal dialogue amongthe Congolese are needed in seeking lasting solutionsto the instability in eastern Democratic Republic of theCongo.With regard to Guinea-Bissau  Mozambique  asChair of the Community of Portuguese-speakingCountries  continues to be committed to seeking a viablesolution in order to restore constitutional order to thatcountry through internal dialogue and the coordinatedintervention of the international community. Thepeople of Guinea-Bissau yearn for peace  stability anddevelopment. They want to be the masters of their owndestiny  which was why they fought for liberation. Thatculminated in the country’s independence  whose thirty-ninth anniversary was celebrated on 24 September.Regarding Somalia  the Sudan and South Sudan Mozambique is delighted by the progress in therespective political processes. We are confident that such achievements will contribute to lasting peace andstability in those countries.We follow with concern the lack of progress inseeking viable solutions to the political process inthe Middle East. That process is a challenge not onlyfor the countries involved and for the region  but alsofor the world at large  owing to its implications forinternational peace and security. We therefore appeal toall relevant actors to engage in a constructive dialogueand to work towards a peaceful solution that guaranteespeace  security and stability.We reiterate our belief in the importance of theongoing commitment of the United Nations towardsthe prompt implementation of the relevant resolutionsof the Organization. We further reiterate that internaldialogue  regional cooperation and the realisticintervention of the United Nations must be the priorities.We reaffirm our unequivocal support for thecause of the Palestinian people  who have been deniedtheir inalienable right to self-determination. We fullysupport the principle of establishing the two States ofPalestine and Israel living side by side in peace.Similarly  we reaffirm our support for theinternational community’s engagement in seeking asustainable solution to the issue of the Western Sahara’sself-determination. We cannot understand or accept thedelays in conducting the referendum already agreed onby all parties under the auspices of the United Nations.Mozambique continues to follow with concernthe maintenance of the unjust economic embargoagainst Cuba  which impedes the economic and socialdevelopment of that sisterly country. Mozambiquetherefore reiterates the call of the majority of MemberStates for the immediate lifting of the embargo.The nature of the challenges that we face in thearea of international peace and security lead us toaffirm before the Assembly the increasing relevanceof multilateral mechanisms for the peaceful resolutionof disputes or situations of conflict. We note withsatisfaction that  throughout more than a half a centuryof its existence  the United Nations has made undeniableachievements in the maintenance of peace and in theprevention and resolution of conflicts.In order to more effectively respond to the growingchallenges to resolving conflicts  we must pursue moreresolutely the reform agenda of the United Nationssystem  in particular Security Council reform and the revitalization of the General Assembly. In that task  webelieve that those two organs must adopt the followingapproach. The steps should include a comprehensivestrategic plan of action and a detailed programme toaddress conflict situations; strengthening the capacityof resource mobilization for peacekeeping missions; thenegotiation and implementation of sustainable politicalsolutions; and engaging in a long-term perspective. TheSecurity Council must play a more proactive role in thesolution of conflicts by  inter alia  fully implementingthe resolutions that it adopts.We therefore reiterate the validity and relevance ofthe principles enshrined in the United Nations Charterand of other international instruments. Such values mustremain the main source of inspiration in the pursuit ofpolitical and lasting solutions to conflicts. Mozambiquethus believes that multilateral organizations  suchas the United Nations  the African Union and othersubregional organizations  play a fundamental role inthe pursuit of peace and development.The resolution of conflicts is a crucial condition forthe achievement of internationally agreed developmentgoals  including the Millennium Development Goals in particular by African countries and least developedcountries. In that context  as part of the ongoingdiscussions on establishing a post-2015 developmentagenda  Member States must act jointly in seekingpoints of convergence that will make it possible toadopt consensus and sustainable solutions for the well-being of our people.In that connection  we would like to express ouroptimism over the consensus understanding reachedat the United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment. We are aware of the fact that thesuccess of such an agreement depends on an integratedapproach towards the economic  social  cultural andenvironmental components  as well as on defining acomprehensive framework for resource mobilizationunder the terms of the common vision of resolution66/288  entitled “The future we want”.In conclusion  I would like to reiterate Mozambique’scommitment to continuing to cooperate with the UnitedNations in seeking peaceful solutions to conflicts andto peace  stability and sustainable development."
"120",4874,"MRT",67,2012,"﻿I am pleased and honoured at the outset to express ourheartfelt congratulations on the election of Mr. VukJeremić as President of the General Assembly at itssixty-seventh session. We have every confidence in hisefforts and in everything that he will undertake in orderto maintain the gains made in preserving internationalpeace and security and to promote an internationalorder that will ensure peace  prosperity and progressfor all humankind. I am firmly convinced that theproficiency  political skills and spirit of responsibilitythat he demonstrated when he twice served as Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia will givehim the ability to do so.I would also like to underscore the continualefforts of Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  Presidentof the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  andhis determination to promote dialogue as an effectivetool for cooperation and to formulate the best possiblesolutions to international issues.We would like  too  to congratulate and thankSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his steadfastactivities to preserve international peace and securityand to promote the Millennium Development Goals  aswell as to mobilize the international community to dealwith climate change  which now has a negative impacton the future of humankind.The sixty-seventh session of the General Assemblyis taking place at a time when many regions of theworld are facing particularly difficult political andeconomic conditions. Aware of the importance of therole and responsibility of our citizens in steering thedestiny of the country  we in the Islamic Republic ofMauritania have been able to carry out a peaceful smooth transition from a repressive totalitarian regimeand the mismanagement of public wealth to democraticrule based on credible constitutional institutions thereby restoring the rule of law.We are also pleased to see that the peacefulsettlement of national and international disputes is thetheme selected for this session of the General Assembly and we appreciate the results of the high-level dialogueon that important subject.From that standpoint  my country has enacted aseries of laws and reforms enshrining individual andcollective political freedoms  guaranteeing the peopleas a whole the full exercise of those basic rights  subjectto the rule of law  and ensuring the independence ofthe judiciary. In that context  the Islamic Republicof Mauritania has sought to fulfil all the obligationsand commitments it undertook under the tripartiteagreement with the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees  on the one hand  and theGovernment of the host State  the sister Republic ofSenegal  on the other. The agreement concerned theorganized return of Mauritanians who had been livingin Senegal since the end of the 1980s. The operationwas completed in perfect accord with all the partiesinvolved and consisted of the organized return of 106 contingents  totalling 24 536 refugees  between29 January 2008 and 25 March 2012.Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz  President of theIslamic Republic of Mauritania  personally presidedover an official ceremony on 25 March in the cityof Rosso  which is the capital of the state of Traza.That was an opportunity for the High Commissionerfor Refugees  Mr. Antonio Guterres  to solemnlyproclaim that the issue of the Mauritanian refugeesin Senegal was finally closed. Along the same lines the Government undertook to resolve the issue of theso-called humanitarian debt by paying those victimswho were entitled to compensation and by settling thesituation of members of the armed and security forces Government workers and contract civil servants  whoserights were also restored.There has been a genuine and transparent politicaldialogue between the parties of the President’s majorityand certain democratic opposition parties  which led toan agreement late last year. The agreement included thecreation of a national independent electoral commissionthat is completely autonomous and that will fullyoversee the upcoming elections  beginning with thelegislative and municipal elections. In addition  therehave been many important constitutional reforms  ascalled for by the democratic opposition.Mauritania has worked to strengthen goodgovernance by ensuring transparency in themanagement of public funds and by enhancing theindependent judicial system  particularly by improvingthe conditions of judges and guaranteeing theirindependence. The economy has seen sustained growth including the implementation of ambitious programmesaimed at improving the living conditions of the people especially those with low incomes.Since the accession to the presidency of Mr. OuldAbdel Aziz  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania has beenreactivating its presence in regional and internationalorganizations  first and foremost in the United Nationsand its specialized agencies. We adhere fully to itsnoble ideals  and we comply with the resolutions  as astrategic choice for our foreign policy. In this regard  wereaffirm our support for reform of the United Nationssystem  particularly the Security Council.We reiterate our desire to see the African continentreceive a permanent seat on the Council  since itis the only continent that does not have permanentrepresentation in the body that addresses international peace and security. That is true despite the fact that onebillion people inhabit the continent of Africa and twothirds of peacekeeping operations take place there. Inaddition  we call for a permanent seat on the Councilfor the Arab Group because of its demographic weightvis-à-vis the global population and its considerableeconomic potential  in particular in the area of energy.My country provides effective support tointergovernmental efforts that have been taking placefor a number of years to find a solution that enjoysthe consensus of Member States on the reform ofthe United Nations in general  the working methodsand mechanisms of its decision-making bodies  andabove all  membership in the Security Council andthe issue of defining its authority and codifying itsworking relationship with the General Assembly inorder to ensure the effectiveness of our Organizationin faithfully reflecting the will of the internationalcommunity.We note with great satisfaction the tireless effortsto achieve consensus during the sixty-seventh session including with regard to the conclusions of the UnitedNations Conference on Sustainable Development which will undoubtedly contribute — if they areimplemented  obviously — to limiting the major risksfacing our planet  in particular the phenomena of globalwarming and climate change  which are now the clearconcern and danger facing humankind.We welcome the outcomes of the Second Conferenceto Review Progress Made in the Implementation ofthe United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Armsand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects  which led to aconsensus agreement on a programme of action toprevent the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.Despite the efforts made and results achievedduring the Assembly’s sixty-sixth and earlier sessions including the Millennium Summit  despite theestablishment of goals and the adoption of an agenda toachieve them  most developing countries  particularlythe least developed  are falling short of achieving theirobjectives. This is due to a range of factors  including for example  endemic unemployment  particularlyamong young people; the prevalence of extreme povertyamong the most vulnerable segments of society; and theslowing of growth and stagnation of the global economy.Foreign direct investment is declining in Africa. Theprices of basic goods on international markets are rising  which has a direct impact on purchasing power in manypoor countries  where a large part of the population liveson less than $1 per day. Rates of net financial transfersto developing countries are falling  and revenue fromtourism is falling acutely. Infant mortality is rising.The heavy debt burden seriously slows the economiesof developing countries  especially least developed  anddirectly affects the already modest financial resourcesof the countries  thereby hampering their ability tomeet their basic needs in terms of infrastructure andpublic services.Against this worrying backdrop  we call on richcountries and donors to honour their commitment tocontribute to the economies of developing countries giving priority to least developed  so that they can haveacceptable access to public services  thus ensuringpeaceful civil order  security  stability and socialcohesion in those countries  and thereby safeguardpeace around the world.At the initiative  and with the support  of PresidentMohamed Ould Abdel Aziz  our Government hasendeavoured to provide citizens decent livingconditions and to help them in times of crises. In thisconnection  an emergency intervention plan  known asthe 2012 Hope Plan  supported by some $170 millionof State budgetary resources  was launched to dealwith declining agricultural production and pasturesdeclining owing to a lack of rain last year  as ourcountry is greatly dependent on farming and livestock-raising. This ambitious plan is providing food anddrinking water for both people and livestock  and ataffordable prices with a view to mitigate the impact ofthe crisis  in particular for the poorest segments of thepopulation. This plan has been unanimously receivedas a clear success on all levels. It has allowed us to avertfamine  epidemics and serious malnutrition in children pregnant women and nursing mothers. Even livestockepidemics have been averted  with losses being keptwithin reasonable limits.Our Government is also working tirelessly tobroaden access to education and to improve both thequality and quantity of teaching and to broaden healthcoverage throughout the nation. We have built a moderncancer hospital  which is among the best equipped inthe region  and a cardiology hospital and a diabetescentre  not to mention the establishment of 50 dialysiscentres. All of this was achieved in a record time ofjust over three years since the accession to power of President Ould Abdel Aziz following the elections of18 July 2009.Our subregion  the Sahel  has been for some yearsa haven for organized crime networks of many types from smuggling drugs  weapons and munitions tohuman trafficking  illegal immigration  hostage-takingand especially terrorism. Together they have led to theextremely serious situation currently unfolding in ourfriendly neighbour  Mali  whose northern regions inparticular represent a serious threat to the security ofthe entire subregion.Given those conditions  we are followingdevelopments in Mali with great concern. Reaffirmingour deep commitment to the unity and territorialintegrity of Mali  we hope that the internationalcommunity  through the Security Council  will fullyshoulder its responsibilities and take the necessarydecisions  in consultation with the Government of Maliand neighbouring countries  with a view to achievinga swift solution that would ensure the re-establishmentof State authority throughout the territory  a returnto peaceful civil order for all of Mali’s people andthe complete and lasting eradication of terrorism andorganized crime in northern Mali and the Sahel as awhole.The Islamic Republic of Mauritania has steadfastlytaken principled positions with regard to that tragiccrisis. We swiftly condemned the military coup d’étatthat ousted the elected President and interruptedthe electoral process. We have strenuously rejectedseparatist claims and unequivocally condemned theoccupation of northern Mali by armed terrorist groups.We have continuously reaffirmed our commitment tothe unity  territorial integrity and social cohesion ofsisterly Mali.My country swiftly and early took all appropriatemeasures to accept refugees from Mali. Today thereare more than 110 000 in a camp that has becomethe second largest city in Mauritania in terms ofpopulation  after the capital Nouakchott. Despite thesevere constraints linked to drought and the scarcity offinancial resources  Mauritania is providing shelter tothose refugees in satisfactory conditions that meet withthe approval of international humanitarian agencies including the United Nations High Commissionerfor Refugees  with whom we work very closely andmaintain constant contact. My country is perfectly aware of the closerelationship between security  development anddemocracy and of the fact that security is a necessarycondition for development  for the establishment ofdemocracy and for strengthening the institutions ofthe rule of law. We have therefore made the adoptionof the necessary array of legislation a top priority andhas committed to adopting measures to guaranteethe security and safety of our citizens and of foreignnationals residing in our country among our hospitable warm people. Our armed and security forces haveresolutely and courageously faced criminal terroristarmed groups that have threatened our security and thatof our guests. We have therefore been able to secure ourborders and restore our sovereignty in each area of ourcountry  and we now control all access points  despitethe great length of our borders.The Islamic Republic of Mauritania is mostseriously following the dramatic developments of thesituation in the sisterly Syrian Arab Republic. We callon all parties involved to put an end to the escalatingviolence and to focus on dialogue in order to finda peaceful solution to the crisis so that the brotherlySyrian people can avoid further horror  desolation anddestruction  as well as to ensure the unity and territorialintegrity of Syria and the cohesion of its social fabric.We have every hope that the mission of the Special JointRepresentative of the United Nations and the League ofArab States  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  whom my countryfully supports  will be able to open the path to a positivesolution to that crisis  which poses a serious threat tothe peace and security of the entire Middle East andthe entire world  with extremely negative effects on theSyrian economy.We enthusiastically welcome the democraticchanges that took place in Tunisia  Yemen  Egyptand Libya. We are convinced they will contribute toconsolidating civil peace and security and will bringabout a shining future for those fraternal countries andpeoples.We have the firm hope that the agreements recentlyreached between the Sudan and the Republic of SouthSudan will lead to the peaceful settlement of allpending issues between those two States. My countryis also wholly satisfied with the recent legislative andpresidential elections in Somalia. We hope they willstrengthen peace and security in that brotherly country which has been devastated for two decades by thecollapse of central power and by a number of other difficulties  including the destruction of infrastructureand the displacement of its people  armed conflictsbetween warlords  and the activities of armed terroristgroups that have sown terror among innocent civilians.My country is closely following the issue ofWestern Sahara. We reiterate our full support for theefforts of the Secretary-General and of his SpecialEnvoy aimed at bringing about a lasting  comprehensiveand fair solution that would have the consent of bothparties and would serve to uphold peace and securityin the region and thereby promote the establishmentof a progressive  prosperous Arab Maghreb  which ourpeople legitimately hope for.The Israeli-Arab conflict is a permanent sourceof hatred and hostility and a serious threat to peaceand security in a vital region of the world. The legalframework and the general conditions to address thatsituation have been defined and reiterated for a longtime now  in a spate of resolutions in the SecurityCouncil and the General Assembly. That has all beenformally confirmed via the Arab Peace Initiative which is based on the principle of land for peaceand which aims at resolving the ongoing conflict Therefore we urge the international community togrant the request that Mahmoud Abbas  President ofthe Palestinian Authority  made in the last Assemblysession  seeking the recognition of the Palestinian Stateby the international community  within the borders of4 June 1967.That is the only way to end the suffering of thePalestinian people  which has gone on for almost aslong as this Organization has existed. It is also the wayfor the international community to shoulder its historicresponsibility with respect to Palestine and the desireto achieve justice and to ensure credibility and equitybetween the two parties to the conflict  in compliancewith the relevant resolutions of international legality.We also reiterate our condemnation of the standingembargo of the Gaza Strip and the crimes perpetratedby the Israeli war machine against Palestinian civilians along with the massive destruction of their propertiesand infrastructure.It is no longer acceptable that all those pathscontinue to be firmly closed off to an unarmedPalestinian people  who have been assigned to fictitiousnegotiations that are themselves an insurmountableobstacle to their achieving their most basic right  whichis the establishment of their national independent State on the borders of 4 June 1967  with Al-Quds Al-Sharifas its capital.Promoting a culture of peace and the valuesand spirit of tolerance among different peoples andcivilizations and establishing equity and justice amongand between peoples at a global level are the right waysto safeguard peace and security in our world. There areoutstanding issues without any prospects for solution.There is a huge gap between rich and poor. There areimbalances in the global economic infrastructure andan absence of genuine justice  equity  and equality. Allof those issues have contributed to the escalation ofareas of tension and the expansion of the phenomenonof terrorism.The Islamic Republic of Mauritania rejectsterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We arecommitted to our Islamic values  which require that werespect tolerance and fraternity and reject any form ofextremism and violence. The international communityurgently needs to study the reasons for extremism andthe best ways to uproot and eradicate that problem.The noble ideals by which the internationalcommunity was guided during the creation of thisOrganization will be respected only if the States andpeoples of the world can benefit from the potentialof development to provide the conditions for a decentlife for all human beings  especially in developingcountries  while respecting the values of freedom andequity. That is how we will be able to achieve the valuesthat are at the very basis of the United Nations."
"121",4920,"MUS",67,2012,"﻿The world is livingthrough unprecedented times. The challenges of aneconomic crisis now loom large. All nations  developedand developing  face growing uncertainties about theireconomic prospects. Serious concerns about the globaleconomy arise now just after global prosperity hadreached unprecedented heights. A second paradox isthat the countries most seriously affected by the crisisare those that contributed the least to its root causes.As fallout from the crisis threatens to produce evermore significant impacts  many already vulnerablesmall island States also face a major threat of adifferent nature. The threat is an existential one. Aswith the economic crisis  the countries that may bemost severely affected by climate change are those thathave contributed the least to the root causes of climatechange. Many small island developing States thus facethe dual threat of the impact of the worsening economieson their trading and their development partners and thatof climate change.Already vulnerable nations face greater threats atthe international level  and more vulnerable groups facegreater difficulties within nations. Young people arefaced with higher levels of unemployment  and womenand children are faced with reduced access to publicservices  health and education. Secretary-General BanKi-moon  speaking at the latest Group of 20 meeting put food and nutrition security at the top of the agenda.Meeting the energy needs for development is a majorconcern. Recent meetings convened by the Economicand Social Council have again highlighted other majorconcerns  including structural unemployment  risinginequality and the lag in poverty eradication.Many countries  both developing and developed face a major challenge with respect to youthunemployment. Improving access to education andtackling the mismatch between qualifications andemployment are now a top policy goal. The worldcannot let its young people down and must give theman opportunity to contribute to economic recovery andprosperity. What we do for young people and what they can do for the world they will inherit will shape theeconomic future of our world.As all nations work to promote sustainabledevelopment  essential components of governancerequired to achieve that goal include more equitableand inclusive growth  the fight against corruption greater accountability  more transparency and a generalculture of integrity. Mauritius affirms that along withinitiatives to revisit development objectives  reformof the international financial architecture and globaleconomic governance must remain a top priority.Mauritius strongly supports the view that the presenteconomic crisis is of a global nature and that solutionsfor inclusive green growth also need to be global innature.The inconclusive talks of the Doha Round and thoseon the United Nations Climate Change Conventionboth suffered from a historical divide that regrettablyresurfaces from time to time and is resurfacing nowat a time when global solutions are more than evernecessary. The debate over good economic and fiscalgovernance at the national level will always remainvalid and necessary but  however sound such domesticpolicies may be  the global environment will have animpact on growth and development  especially on thatof developing countries and smaller economies.Thirty-two years ago  the Independent Commissionon International Development Issues highlighted  in the1980 Brandt report  the interdependence of developingand developed economies and the mutuality of theirinterests. The report explained how all nations wouldbenefit from a strengthened global economy. As theworld faces another crisis  all nations should recallhow much interdependence has grown since the Brandtreport and bear in mind the interconnection andmutuality of interests in the development agenda.In that context  nations must resist protectionistmeasures as an easy way out. They would definitelybe detrimental in the medium and long term.The Committee for Development Policy  in itsJuly 2012 report (E/2012/33)  called for a TransformativeDevelopment Agenda. The international communitymust pledge its support for a transformative agendabased on the recognition that globally coordinatedsolutions are necessary to accompany sound domesticpolicies. It is imperative that the General Assembly with its pre-eminent and universal membership  play a crucial role in the debate on globally coordinatedsolutions.We reaffi rm our support for a revitalized Economicand Social Council  which should be able to exercise theeffective role and function attributed to it by the Charter.In that context  we also welcome the reaffirmation ofthe mandate of the United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development (UNCTAD) at Doha. UNCTADmust continue to serve as the focal point of the UnitedNations system for the integrated treatment of tradeand development and the interrelated issues of finance technology  investment and sustainable development.As the world engages in the current debate on globalsolutions  we must promote more economic exchangesamong developing nations. Regional integration andcooperation are key to future development. Tradeand investment must also be accompanied by greaterregional cooperation through the pooling of resourcesand the provision of public goods. Pooling entailsincreased economies of scale and makes it less costlyto acquire technology.One area where regional cooperation can make asignificant contribution is the energy sector. Poolingresources and coordinating policies at the regionallevel and among groups of developing countries withcommon requirements can facilitate the developmentof technology and the implementation of renewableenergies.As we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of theUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea let us remind ourselves of the potential of the oceansas an engine for growth and promote internationalcooperation in a vast collective effort to tap thatpotential. There is potential there with respect not onlyto food and mineral resources but also to transport leisure and the advancement of science.We welcome the reaffirmation by world leadersin Rio de Janeiro that small island developing Statesremain a special case for sustainable development inview of their unique and particular vulnerabilities. Weexpect that the commitment to take urgent and concreteaction to address the vulnerabilities of small islanddeveloping States will be followed by concrete actions.It is imperative that small island developing Statesissues be more effectively mainstreamed throughoutthe entire United Nations system and that a dedicatedand clearly identified focal point be set up withinevery United Nations entity dealing with small island developing States issues. The Small Island DevelopingStates Unit within the Department of Economic andSocial Affairs should be strengthened to enable it toprovide coordinated support for small island developingStates.Mauritius joins other world leaders who havecalled on all countries to deliver on their assistancecommitments. The international community cannotspend so much capital on negotiating new pledges andundertakings in a whole array of outcome documentsand then ignore what has been agreed. We can moveforward only if past commitments are honoured.We welcome the proposed establishment of asustainable development council to follow up on theUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Developmentand formulate sustainable development goals. We alsowelcome the appointment of a high-level panel on thepost-2015 development agenda. Those entities andothers should be able to build on what has already beenagreed through global negotiations.I must say that our hearts go out to the people ofSyria  who are enduring the consequences of a severehumanitarian crisis  as there is no prospect in sight ofa resolution to the political struggle. The internationalcommunity cannot remain indifferent to such suffering.The world can also not remain indifferent to thesuffering of the Palestinian people  who are without auniversally recognized State and face severe economichardships and insecurity. Those challenges will testthe credibility and moral authority of the internationalsystem.I must also say that  while we have the utmost respectfor all faiths and religions  we strongly believe thatthere is no justification for violence  however profoundthe outrage in response to religious vilification. Wealso support the fundamental principle of the protectionof diplomats and diplomatic premises  which is at thecore of the interaction between nations  and we call onall members of the comity of nations to fully respectthat principle.We also call on the international community tosupport the full implementation of the road map workedout in our neighbouring State of Madagascar and toprovide the transitional Government with the meansto ensure a speedy return to constitutional rule anddemocracy in that great country.Mauritius very much welcomed the High-level Meeting of the Assembly on the rule of law.Development and greater economic prosperity gohand in hand with enhanced rule of law at both thenational and the international levels. There will be nomeaningful rule of law at the international level unlessand until all nations  especially the small ones  haveavenues for resolving their disputes with other States.The United Kingdom excised part of Mauritianterritory prior to independence  has refused to enterinto talks in good faith on that dispute and has ensuredthat the dispute cannot be resolved by the InternationalCourt of Justice. Thus  the decolonization of Africahas not been completed. At a time when the UnitedNations debates the rule of law at both the nationaland the international levels  we urge the internationalcommunity to work on machinery that would enableStates  whatever their size or economic power  to haveat their disposal judicial and other peaceful means ofresolving disputes. The rule of law at the internationallevel cannot be normative only. There must also beadequate enforcement mechanisms  without whichthere is no meaningful rule of law. The full realizationof the territorial integrity of Mauritius also requires asettlement that would enable us to effectively assert oursovereignty over Tromelin Island. We look forward tocontinued dialogue with France in a spirit of mutualcooperation.The challenges that our countries currently face callfor exemplary solidarity on the part of the communityof nations. Our common interests must guide all of ouractions. We will not be able to pull through withouteach other. All Governments  civil society  researchersand entrepreneurs must therefore be aware of theinterdependence of our economies and work togetherfor the good of all nations. Countries often turn inwardsin times of crisis and look out only for what they believeto be their own interests. However  true solutions arecollective. A global recovery would serve the interestsof all States.Before I end  let me convey to the Assembly thegreetings of the Prime Minister of the Republic ofMauritius and its people."
"122",4957,"MWI",67,2012,"﻿Allow me to congratulatethe President on his well-deserved election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventhsession. My delegation and I would like to assure himof Malawi’s full support during his tenure of office.It is an honour to address the Assembly today for thefirst time in my capacity as President of the Republic of Malawi. As the Assembly may be aware  I took officein April of this year after the death of my predecessor His Excellency Professor Bingu Wa Mutharika. Onbehalf of all Malawians  I express our appreciation forthe support that the world gave us during that difficulttime in our country. I would like to also acknowledgein particular the support I received from leaders fromthe Southern African Development Community and theentire African continent when I assumed the presidency.The support that I received is a mark that Africa hasindeed embraced women’s leadership.Joining the world’s leaders here and becoming onlythe second female Head of State in Africa’s history after Her Excellency President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf ofLiberia  is a moment of pride for me. However  mineis not the story of the success of an individual  but ofa people. A peaceful and constitutional transition ofpower was not inevitable when my presidency began.It is the courage and determination of the people ofMalawi that made it possible. The people of Malawihave made a decisive choice. They have chosendemocracy  they have chosen peace and they havechosen to work together to realize their destiny. It is mypeople’s courage and determination that has taken meto the presidency  and which we will now apply to ournational development.The theme of the general debate this year is “Bringingabout adjustment or settlement of international disputesor situations by peaceful means”. It allows us to reflecton some of the conflict situations around the world including in Africa. Those conflicts have a devastatingeffect on the lives of millions  especially women andchildren. The impact of conflict goes beyond the peopledirectly involved  affecting the region and the world.Let me agree with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moonwhen he said in his reappointment speech that one ofthe greatest opportunities we have for a better worldwithout conflict is through sustainable development.The biggest threats to security and peace are poverty lack of opportunity and lack of hope. It is unacceptableto me as the President of Malawi  as it should be to theglobal community  that we have children continuing tosuffer from malnutrition  or that they yearn to learn buthave to sit under trees rather than in proper classrooms.It is unacceptable that a mother should die while givingbirth because the nearest health centre is far away  orthat thousands die of diseases that we have answersfor. It is unacceptable that the youth who represent thefuture of our world have few opportunities to realize their potential  or that they are not guaranteed a societywhere they can speak their mind. It is unacceptable thatfarmers and other workers continue to toil to make thebest of what they have  but do not enjoy the fruits oftheir labour due to lack of modernization  a supportivepolicy environment and access to markets; and thatthey are buried under global tariffs and taxes. It is whenthose frustrations are in place that conflict takes root.For decades  I have fought these issues in Malawias a social justice and human rights activist andthrough my work at the gra-ssroots. I have experiencedthe struggles of the poor and the suffering of Malawianwomen. I have championed the advancement of theoppressed and marginalized  fought for the rights ofwomen and children  campaigned for the betterment ofthe rural and urban poor. I can attest to the fact thatthe experience of a poor and disadvantaged Malawianis intimately intertwined with that of Africans  andindeed with that of the people of the least developedcountries.Now  as the President of the Republic of Malawi I have a vision. My vision is to eradicate povertythrough economic growth and wealth creation. Malawiaims to create wealth by transforming the structure ofthe economy  promoting the private sector in order toachieve economic growth  accelerating job creationand protecting the vulnerable and the excluded within adecentralized and democratic environment.Specifically  my vision is to transform Malawiinto one of the fastest-growing African economies inthe next decade. For me  growth is not merely relatedto gross domestic product. Growth is about wealth andprosperity for all  opportunity for all  happiness for all political and economic freedom for all. Growth is alsoabout growing the number of children in school andyoung people in jobs. Growth is about increasing thenumber of mothers who give safe birth in a hospital andof growing the number of families who have plenty offood.As the Assembly may be aware  for the pastthree years Malawi has faced severe economic andsocial challenges brought on by poor political andeconomic governance  which could have impacted ourability to accelerate the attainment of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Therefore  upon assumingoffice I immediately put in place an economic recoveryprogramme to restore macroeconomic stability in thecountry so that we can not only address our immediate macroeconomic issues  but also secure Malawi’s abilityto meet the MDG targets.I would like to share that we are certain that we willbe able to achieve five of the eight MDGs by 2015. Andwe will continue to strive to achieve our goals of thethree remaining MDGs: universal primary education promoting gender equality and empowering women and improving maternal health. Coincidentally  thesethree MDGs are related to issues that I have worked onthroughout my life  and I will personally ensure thatMalawi redoubles its efforts to make improvements inthose areas.My Government realizes that the potential ofMalawi — the potential of our land  our resourcesand  most importantly  our people — is great. Butthat opportunity will be seized only through our ownefforts. That is why my vision is not just hopeful words.Our willingness to take tough decisions does not endhere. Our plans need to be translated into action. To thatend  within my first 100 days in office  Malawi held aninclusive national dialogue on the economy to narrowdown five priority sectors within our medium-termnational development framework  the Malawi Growthand Development Strategy II. The five priorities areenergy  tourism  agriculture  mining and infrastructuredevelopment.Central to those priorities is our emphasis ondelivery through partnership with the private sector.We will facilitate that by making changes aimedat improving the business climate. My Cabinet hasidentified three specific projects within each prioritysector and translated that into an implementationplan for the next two years. The projects range fromthe completion of essential roads and rail lines  tosetting up alternative energy sources and undertakingbusiness climate reform to attract investment intoagro-processing and mining. The projects will set ourcountry on a path of fulfilling its full potential.In addition  I have also launched two initiatives — thePresidential Initiative on Maternal Health and SafeMotherhood  and the Presidential Initiative on Povertyand Hunger Reduction — to fast-track the interventionsneeded to address the social needs of disadvantagedgroups  especially women and youth.Malawi refuses to accept what others may considerto be our destiny — the status of underdevelopment.Malawi is committed to change that perception. But inso doing  my Government and  indeed  the people of Malawi know that we need to engage the rest of theglobal community. That is why  within days of takingoffice  I reopened dialogue and engagement with ourneighbours  with African leaders and with the rest of theworld. The people of Malawi are grateful for the goodwill that many have shown us  and we are encouragedby the support of our partners.Malawi will continue to need global support inthe short and medium terms. We need this supportto protect the rural poor from food shortages causedby prolonged dry spells in some parts of the country.Malawi is looking for partnerships to build its energycapacity. Malawi needs support to attract privateinvestment for the rich potential we have in agroprocessingand mining  among others. We are lookingfor partnerships to support the development of ourtransport and communications infrastructure in orderto improve access to markets.Before I conclude I wish to draw the Assembly’sattention to the following three issues that have abearing on most of the least developed countries.First  I call upon the General Assembly to ensure thatthe Istanbul Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in Turkey in May 2011  will be implementedin their entirety in an effective and timely manner.In particular  duty-free and quota-free market accessand supply-side capacity must be ensured to the leastdeveloped countries.Secondly  most least developed countries are facingthe adverse effects of climate change  which is causingf looding  land degradation and drought. In that regard Malawi welcomes the recent outcome of the UnitedNations Conference on Sustainable Development heldin Brazil  where international consensus emergedand agreement was reached on important areas of sustainable development. The implementation of theseagreements is very crucial for our future.Finally  on the issue of the reform of the UnitedNations  Malawi fully supports the expansion of theSecurity Council in both permanent and non-permanentcategories. As members of the Assembly are aware Africa represents one of the single largest regionswithin the United Nations  and a very significantproportion of issues discussed in the Security Councilconcern the African continent. It is for those reasons therefore  that Malawi joins the rest of the Africannations in demanding at least two seats in the permanentcategory and five seats in the non-permanent category as stipulated in the Ezulwini Consensus. Africa has tolead its own development  and that will be a step inensuring that it can.At this moment  I say to the Assembly that Malawiis on a journey – a journey to change its trajectory; ajourney to make real change happen; a journey to fosterprivate-sector growth; a journey to be an integral partof the global community. Malawi is ready to take itsturn to grow  not just in wealth  but in opportunities hopes and freedoms for all of the Malawian people.As a new President and a new member of the globalcommunity of leaders  I ask for the Assembly’s supportas this one African country journeys to realize its fullpotential — for its people  for Africa and for the world."
"123",5003,"MYS",67,2012,"﻿At the outset  allow me tocongratulate Mr. Jeremić on his election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.I am confident that he will successfully steer theproceedings of this session in an efficient and effectivemanner. I assure him of Malaysia’s full cooperation andsupport throughout his presidency. I would also like totake this opportunity to thank the previous President His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  forhis leadership and guidance throughout the sixty-sixthsession.The release of the distasteful and insulting filmInnocence  of  Muslims caused a wave of widespreadprotests across the Muslim world. The problem wascompounded by the publication of offensive caricatures which further angered Muslims. It is hard to understandhow those responsible could resort to such actions knowing that they would offend and provoke 2 billionMuslims  as anything other than blatant and maliciousintent and purpose.It is our obligation as peace-loving people andresponsible Governments to prevent a small minority ofbigots from sowing the seed of hatred between Muslimsand the Western world. We categorize those people asextremists. They insult Islam and advocate religioushatred. Such extremists have shown absolutely noregard for the implications of their actions. Whilewe condemn the irresponsible actions of those whointentionally incite hatred  we are equally saddened bythe violent reaction that ensued.Expressing anger by resorting to violence  killingand destruction does not offer any solution to theproblem and only results in further division andpossibly more damage and loss of innocent lives.We condemn those responsible for the death ofAmbassador Christopher Stevens and his colleaguesin Benghazi. We are equally saddened by the loss ofinnocent lives  including those of women and children during emotionally charged demonstrations. A lifelost is one too many. Those who made the video anddrew the caricatures  as well as those who resorted tokilling  are equally guilty of extremism and must beheld accountable and brought to justice.I believe that it is time to look deeper into the heartof the problem and dwell on the real debate — therelationship between freedom of expression and socialresponsibilities  duties and obligations. The events wehave witnessed cannot be defended under the pretext of human rights  freedoms and liberties. A line should bedrawn when the prejudicial effect outweighs everythingelse. Malaysia has always maintained that freedom including the freedom of expression  comes withresponsibility. The drafters of the Universal Declarationof Human Rights  I am sure  did not have denigration inmind when they cited the need to promote and protectthe freedom of expression.Human rights need to be guaranteed by takinginto account the cultural and historical sensitivitiesof a society. Nevertheless  they should also beapplied without selectivity or discrimination. Whenwe discriminate against women  it is called sexism;when African-Americans are criticized and vilified  itis called racism; when the same is done to the Jews people call it anti-Semitism; and laws are legislatedto persecute the perpetrators. But why is it that whenMuslims are stigmatized and defamed  it is defended asfreedom of expression?In his statement during the International Day ofPeace on 21 September  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moonrightly said: “We cannot let the voices of extremistsdominate the debate and inflame tensions. We needvoices of moderation and solidarity” (SG/SM/14522).The Prime Minister of Malaysia  two years ago in theAssembly  advocated a global movement of moderatesand called for all people of the world to join the chorusof moderates so as to drown out the voices of extremists.Embracing moderation is an important value thatshould be ingrained in every society. Moderationcomes with a high degree of tolerance  trust and mutualunderstanding. It uses dialogue as an important tool toresolve disputes. With relative political peace comeseconomic stability and socioeconomic developmentin the given country. It is therefore important that wecontinue to practice moderation as we face the risingtide of extremism. Moderation is the best response toextremism.The first international conference of the GlobalMovement of Moderates held in Kuala Lumpur inJanuary this year was well attended by over 500participants from all over the world. It affirmedthe importance of moderation in the context of itsapplication to global issues and situations  especiallyto matters that relate to social  financial  religiousand international politics. The Global Movement ofModerates has gained the recognition and supportof the Commonwealth of Nations  the Non-AlignedMovement and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. We believe that the Global Movement ofModerates provides an effective platform for the globalresponse to extremism.The theme of the sixty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly  “Bringing about adjustment orsettlement of international disputes or situations bypeaceful means ” is timely because it reiterates the coreprinciples and values of the United Nations in facingcontinuing conflicts and situations around the world.We continue to have serious concerns regarding thesituation in the Syrian Arab Republic. We condemn theviolence and senseless killing that have taken place andthat continue to take place. As we contemplate the nextstep forward  we have to bear in mind that any measurewe take must be in the interests of the Syrian people. Itis not about who is wrong or right; it is about putting anend to the bloodshed and suffering  bringing a peacefuland inclusive resolution to the conflict.The unabated violence and killing must stopimmediately. The parties involved have an equalresponsibility for ensuring the end to the appallingatrocities. Military aggression and armed confrontationwill serve only to exacerbate the problem and can neverbe a solution to the crisis; instead  they diminish anylittle hope there is for peaceful settlement. We earnestlyhope that with the appointment of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimias the new Joint Special Representative of the UnitedNations and the League of Arab States for Syria  apeaceful solution to the Syrian crisis will be found.Towards that end  the support of all parties  includingthe involvement of the United Nations  is very crucial.The situation in the occupied Palestinian territoriesremains bleak. For more than six decades  day afterday  month after month  the people of Palestine havecontinued to see their lands confiscated to make wayfor illegal settlements. They have continued to see theirfamilies  including their children  displaced and forcedfrom their homes. Elsewhere  we are quick in callingfor action against those who force others to live underoppression and without freedom and dignity. But we areunashamed in not taking strong and decisive action toensure that the long-deprived Palestinians can exercisetheir right to their homeland and regain their dignitywithin the community of nations.Surely  the international community  especially themore powerful and inf luential nations  could do moreto bring Israel to the negotiating table for a two-Statesolution  whereby the State of Israel and the State of Palestine could exist side by side in peace and security.How can we continue to live in the face of that glaringinjustice without feeling an iota of guilt for not doingenough to bring to an end this long-standing issue?Like others in this Hall  Malaysia welcomes theconvening of the inaugural High-level Meeting on theRule of Law held earlier this week. At that meeting we adopted a solemn Declaration that the rule of lawshall apply to all States equally (resolution 67/1). Werededicated ourselves to resolving disputes by peacefulmeans and in conformity with the principles of justiceand international law. We also committed ourselves toupholding the right to self-determination of peopleswho remain under foreign occupation  and to endimpunity for violations of international humanitarianand human rights law. With that declaration  it is timefor the international community to put pressure onIsrael to fulfil its international obligations.At the same time  Israel must stop all illegalsettlement activities in the West Bank as well as in EastJerusalem. We are particularly concerned by the threatsto invade or divide the site of Al-Aqsa Mosque  whichwould be a breach of Israel’s obligations as an occupyingPower. It is a holy site for Muslims and Christians alike.Furthermore  Israel must lift the illegal blockade overGaza that has caused too much hardship for the people. Itmust also protect the people under its occupation  fulfilits international obligations and respect internationallaw. Most importantly  it ought to have direct talkswith the Palestinian Authority in conditions that clearlydemonstrate its goodwill and sincerity. A peaceful two-State solution  accompanied by sustainable peace in theregion  should be the ultimate goal for all concerned.Recognizing Palestine and welcoming it intothe community of nations has become a contentiousissue. Palestine is punished for wanting to become arightful Member of the United Nations. The feasibilityof a two-State solution is being questioned. However what choice does Palestine have? Furthermore  howwould becoming a Member of the United Nations harmPalestine’s sincere efforts for independence?The issue of Palestine’s membership of the UnitedNations is tied to another bigger issue that is ofparticular concern to Malaysia. Allow me to elaborate.One hundred and thirty-two countries recognize theState of Palestine. That number reflects more than twothirds of the membership of the United Nations. Yet  theSecurity Council — or more accurately  those members on which veto power has been conferred — are giventhe authority to determine the fate of Palestine’smembership  irrespective of the opinions of themajority.That is just one of a host of reasons that the UnitedNations  especially the Security Council  needs to bereformed. The Security Council will need to be ableto cope with the many challenges that the internationalcommunity faces.There are so many instances when it has failedto take action when action was needed most. It hasfailed to do so because of the veto power that has beenconferred on the five permanent members. Thus  timeand again  it has become the victim of its own creation.The composition of the Security Council should alsoreflect current global realities. It should be democraticand accountable so as to be able to fulfil its mandate toeffectively maintain international peace and security.It is ironic that the very institution that was formedin 1945 to promote and defend democracy among itsMember States should itself be undemocratic.Virtually every aspect of reform has been arguedone way or another. There have been many proposals onthe table  but none has made any headway. Therefore despite the many years that the issue of Security Councilreform has been on the agenda of the United Nations we are no closer to actual reform than when we firststarted. We call on all Member States to be realisticand to find workable solutions to reform. There is aneed to approach reform with renewed political will ifwe genuinely want to see progress towards achieving amore efficient and effective United Nations. How longcan we go on like this? How long can we avoid the needto reform the Security Council as well as the UnitedNations as a whole?It would be remiss of me not to mention themeeting that many consider the most important oneto have taken place this year — namely  the UnitedNations Conference on Sustainable Development  heldin Brazil last June. Although the summit is over  muchwork remains. The actions mandated in the outcomedocument need our close follow-up  monitoring andparticipation for their successful implementation.Strengthening sustainable development andenvironmental institutions  formulating a financialstrategy and developing the mechanisms for facilitatingtechnology transfer are among the important areas onwhich we need to act in the year ahead. Accordingly  we need to launch a process to determine sustainabledevelopment goals. The goals should be supported byconcrete action plans  with details on the various areasmentioned in order to implement them. Malaysia looksforward to working constructively and contributing tothat process.I believe that we share similar concerns on all theissues I have raised today. Bringing about adjustmentor settlement of disputes or situations does not concernonly the parties involved in a dispute or situation  butis the joint collective responsibility of the internationalcommunity. In line with this year’s theme  we assurethe Assembly of our commitment to ensuring lastingglobal peace and security through peaceful means byembracing the principles of moderation."
"124",5030,"NAM",67,2012,"﻿I extend warm congratulationsto Mr. Jeremić and his country  Serbia  on his electionas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. My delegation is confident that  underhis leadership  this session will address all burningissues on its agenda. I assure him of my delegation’scooperation and support. I also wish to thank hispredecessor for presiding over the General Assembly atits sixty-sixth session. Similarly  I wish to congratulateHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on assuming hissecond mandate as Secretary-General at the beginningof this year.The unresolved conflicts around the world demandcommitment and resolve from us all in order to finddurable solutions. I therefore commend the Presidentfor choosing the theme for the debate at this session namely  “Adjustment or settlement of internationaldisputes or situations by peaceful means”. Namibiafirmly believes that  if we all dedicate ourselves tofinding lasting solutions to conflicts by peacefulmeans  our collective efforts will be successful. Thereis no better way to achieve peace than by upholding thecardinal principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes as provided for under Chapter VI of the United NationsCharter.In that regard  we should renew the originalcommitment to peace and progress as essential valuesof the United Nations. Namibia believes that respect forthe sovereign equality of States  territorial integrity andindependence constitute the pillars of international lawand  indeed  the bedrock of peaceful relations amongnations. The violation of any of those principles poses aserious threat to international peace and security.Regional and subregional organizations areimportant partners in solving conflicts in affectedareas throughout the world. Their contribution toconflict resolution is provided for under the UnitedNations Charter. There is therefore a compelling needfor the United Nations to take into account the viewsof regional organizations in the areas of mediationand peacemaking. Such institutions should be fullysupported in finding lasting solutions to violentconflicts around the world.In Africa  since its inception  the African UnionPeace and Security Council has cooperated with theUnited Nations Security Council towards those sharedgoals of conflict resolution. Similarly  the subregionof the Southern African Development Community hasestablished initiatives to resolve political conflicts inthe region through mediation.However  we are concerned about the deterioratingsecurity situation in the eastern Democratic Republic ofCongo. We therefore urge the international communityto support the regional initiative aimed at resolvingthat conflict and to provide humanitarian assistance todisplaced persons. We call on all neighbouring countriesto work together with the Congolese authorities to helpresolve the conflict and to ensure that the sovereigntyand territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo is not violated.In Madagascar  we urge the Malagasy politicalactors to expedite the full implementation of the roadmap leading to the holding of free  fair  inclusive andcredible elections.With regard to the Sudan and South Sudan  Namibiacalls on the two countries to resolve all outstandingissues peacefully. In the Darfur region of the Sudan  weurge the Government and the other parties concerned tofind a negotiated and peaceful solution to the conflict.We denounce the unconstitutional changes ofGovernment in Mali and Guinea-Bissau that took place respectively  in March and April this year. Equally  Namibia resolutely rejects the secessionist attemptsin northern Mali and the destruction of ancientshrines in Timbuktu. We wish to commend the roleplayed by the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) in helping to resolve the conflictsin those two countries. At the same time  we urgethe international community to provide support andassistance to ECOWAS.Namibia welcomes the recent positive politicaldevelopments in Somalia  including the election of HisExcellency Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as Presidentof that country. I congratulate him and wish him wellin the noble task of bringing normalcy and stabilityto that sister country. The international communityshould continue to support the people of Somalia asthey embark upon the path to rebuild their country.For many decades  the people of Western Sahara havebeen denied their inalienable right to self-determinationand independence. Namibia reiterates its call for theimmediate and unconditional implementation of theUnited Nations Settlement Plan  leading to the holdingof a free and fair referendum in Western Sahara.Equally  we wish to reaffirm our unequivocalsupport for the inalienable rights of the Palestinianpeople to self-determination and national independenceon the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions.Each year during the general debate  the majorityof States Members of the United Nations express theirconcern over the continued economic  commercialand financial blockade unilaterally imposed againstthe Republic of Cuba  with its adverse effect on theCuban people. Thus  Namibia reiterates its call for theimmediate and unconditional lifting of the embargoagainst Cuba.Namibia attaches great importance to sustainabledevelopment and the search for the best ways tomitigate the adverse effects of climate change. In thatregard  we will continue to actively cooperate with theinternational community to address climate change.In that context  Namibia seeks the support ofMember States in hosting the secretariat of theGreen Climate Fund in our capital city  Windhoek Ifsuccessful  that would provide an opportunity for adeveloping country to host a United Nations agencyof great importance. Given the opportunity  Namibiastands ready to discharge its obligations arising from hosting the Green Climate Fund secretariat. We counton Member States’ support.The reform of the United Nations and its principalorgans should seek to strengthen the Organization inorder to make it more efficient  effective and responsiveto the needs of all its Members. In that context strengthening the role and authority of the GeneralAssembly is of paramount importance. Equally  thereform of the Security Council is at the core of the widerUnited Nations reform  given its primary responsibilityfor the maintenance of international peace and security.Namibia reiterates its support for the common Africanposition on the reform of the Security Council.Let us rededicate ourselves to the principle of thesettlement of international disputes by peaceful meansin order to save current and succeeding generationsfrom the scourge of war and build a prosperous futurefor our children."
"125",5075,"NER",67,2012,"﻿I wouldfirst like to congratulate the President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session on his election. Ialso wish to congratulate his country for that success which allows him to manage the Organization duringhis term of office. I would also like to congratulatethe outgoing President  His Excellency Mr. NassirAbdulaziz Al-Nasser  whose term of office was a very busy one. Lastly  I would like to thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for the tireless work that hehas undertaken through the programme he submittedfor the next five years and through which he particularlyfocuses on sustainable development  peace  securityand the participation of women and young people.Sad reality shows us that some people  using thefreedom of expression that is guaranteed in their owncountries  have believed that that freedom includes theright to publish cartoons and to produce a video thatinsults Islam. Those acts are comparable to anti-Semiticacts or racist acts in general by those who reject anydifferences and insist on making that a rule of conduct.We firmly condemn those actions  which are hurtful andoffensive for Muslims. But however disgraceful theymay be  they cannot justify the outbreak of violence wehave seen  especially those against diplomatic missions.In particular  we condemn the murderous attack againstthe United States diplomatic mission in Benghazi  andwe repeat here the sincere condolences of the peopleand Government of the Niger to the American peopleand Government. We reassert that Islam  a religion ofbalance and moderation  cannot provide a basis for suchhateful responses. Those who  in the name of Islam  arebehaving like savage hordes discredit this great religionand  in doing so  are behaving exactly like those theyclaim to denounce.The sad facts that I have just referred to demonstratethe wisdom of the theme the President chose to placeat the centre of his mandate  that is  “Bringing aboutadjustment or settlement of international disputes orsituations by peaceful means”. The peaceful settlementof disputes  we may recall  was the theme of the generaldebate at the sixty-sixth session. Between the twosessions  the position of my country on the issue hasnot changed.At the sixty-sixth session  my country’s President Mr. Mahamadou Issoufou  said from this rostrum: “Wemight have thought that the end of the Cold War wouldopen the way to an age of full and lasting peace aroundthe world” (A/66/PV.20  p. 17). Unfortunately  becausethere was no ability  or perhaps not even the will  toattack the evil at its roots  the hope for a world withoutconflict recedes like the horizon as one approaches it.The root of the evil is bad governance  politically andeconomically. The promises of liberty  equality andjustice  of the rule of law and solidarity — promisesthat were made to people both globally and at thenational level — have still not been upheld. The lack of any regulation of the global economy  the dominationof banks  unfair trade and the growth of inequalitiesbetween and within nations are factors of disorder crises and conflicts that disrupt world peace. The riseof terrorism and the increasingly strong probabilityof criminal forces controlling great areas will worsentensions throughout the world.Anticipating international conflicts and disputesis the best way to prevent them. As internationaleconomic competition can lead to war  the anticipationof crises should create specific conditions for globaleconomic growth that benefits all. To do that  thereshould be mechanisms to regulate the global economywith the goal  among others  of ending the hegemonyof financial capital and unfair trade. The end of thehegemony of financial capital should allow us to directavailable financial resources towards investments inthe real economy rather than towards speculation.The end of unfair trade will allow countries thatproduce raw materials  such as the Niger  to drawgreater benefit from them  particularly through thechange that generates added value. If a country such asmine were able to get a fair price for its raw materialsand to establish real control over their exploitation  thenthe Millennium Development Goals could be achievedby 2015. That is one of the ambitions of the programmefor the renaissance of the Niger that President Issoufoupresented.On the basis of that programme  the Governmenthas just drawn up an economic and social developmentplan for 2012 to 2015. For financing the programme  theNiger is organizing a donors’ meeting to be held in Parison 13 and 14 November. The 3N initiative — NigeriensNourishing Nigeriens — is an integral and importantpart of the plan. I take the opportunity here to invite allpartners of the Niger  both bilateral and multilateral both public and private  to take an active part.Allow me also to take the opportunity to thankall those who have responded positively to the appealthat our President launched here on 23 September2011 during his address to the Asembly at its sixtysixthsession  calling for assistance to the people ofthe Niger following that year’s mediocre harvest. Themobilization of the people and the Government  as wellas all our partners  enabled us to prevent the droughtfrom leading to famine  while creating the conditions toprepare for the 2012-2013 harvest. The results are verypromising despite the recent f looding in the country. It is said that history has more imagination thando men  because events often escape the control ofthose who cause them. It is my hope that this sayingwill not apply to the Arab Spring  which has createdturmoil from which we hope good will come. Allow meto recall the fact that at the Group of Eight Summit inDeauville on 26 May 2011  President Issoufou drew theattention of the Heads of State and Government presenton the need for them not to lose sight of the foreseeableconsequences of a Libyan conflict in the Sahel-Saharanregion.His fears were unfortunately confirmed withthe outbreak of the rebellion in Mali on 17 January triggered by elements from Libya and followed bythe coup d’état of 22 March  which dealt democracya severe blow while enabling the occupation of twothirds of Malian territory  not just by external forces some of them from Libya  but also by terrorists andcriminal organizations specializing in various typesof trafficking  particularly drugs. In our view  thecurrent situation in Mali constitutes a serious threatto the security and stability of the member countriesof the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS)  as well as the countries in the thick ofthings.The ambition of the jihadists who have subjugatednorthern Mali  destroying the patrimonial historic sitesof Timbuktu  cutting off hands and forcing womento wear the burka  is to conquer the whole of WestAfrica and the Maghreb. Once they have achieved thatgoal  will they stop there? Of course not. They willimmediately go on to attack Europe and the whole ofthe rest of the world. This is therefore a global threat and the response should be global  too.It must be immediate and unhesitating  because weknow well that postponing a fight always puts one at adisadvantage. Therefore the international community and the Security Council in particular  has a duty totake responsibility for the crisis in Mali without delayin order to restore a united  democratic and secularMali. An operational concept for military interventionshould be drawn up and adopted within the frameworkof a coalition that should include troops from ECOWASmember States as well as from the countries involvedand from other African countries wishing to takepart. Such an operation should receive the firm anddetermined support of the friends of Mali and Africaamong the great Powers. It should be carried out througha Security Council resolution in a framework based on the current efforts of ECOWAS but better coordinatedwith and controlled by the African Union through itsPeace and Security Council."
"126",5121,"NGA",67,2012,"﻿Let me start by congratulatingMr. Jeremić on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session. I have no doubtthat under his able leadership the work at this sessionwill progress to a successful conclusion. I also wishto acknowledge the excellent work of his predecessor Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  who guidedthe affairs of the sixty-sixth session with diligenceand consummate skill. I must seize this opportunity toapplaud Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the ablemanner in which he has continued to guide and lead theSecretariat of our Organization.When I addressed the Assembly last year on thetheme of the role of mediation in the settlement ofdisputes by peaceful means (see A/66/PV.11)  the worldwas witnessing important and dramatic changes. TheArab Spring had broken out  setting new politicalstandards for social contracts between Governmentsand the governed. Also  South Sudan  today sitting atthe family table of the United Nations  had just gainedindependence.Since then  we have witnessed considerableprogress and also some setbacks. Knowing that thefuture remains uncertain and perilous  we have alwaysbelieved that much more needs to be done to protectour gains  including developing new strategies forpreventing and resolving conflicts.The situation in Syria  which continues to weigh onthe collective conscience of the world  is a case in point.Every day since the conflict began  innocent peoplecontinue to lose their lives and livelihoods  while tensof thousands of others f lee into neighbouring countriesseeking refuge. I seize this opportunity to call onthe Syrian people  in the face of a seeming lack ofconcerted positive international action  to pause andfind a solution to the crisis in a way that will benefitthe Syrian nation.Indeed  it was in the context of tackling the manycrises that plagued our world that I proposed theestablishment of a conflict mediation commission  underthe Secretary-General’s Office  to further strengthenthe early warning and peacebuilding initiatives of theUnited Nations. Experience elsewhere gives us reasonto believe that there is value in the creation of such amechanism. Nigeria stands ready to work with othercountries to make the protection of innocent civilianscaught in conflict situations a priority of the UnitedNations.I see a consonance between the theme of the sixty-sixth session and that of sixty-seventh session — theadjustment or settlement of international disputes orsituations by peaceful means. Both are concerned withthe peaceful settlement of disputes. This consonance  inmy view  is evidence of the United Nations continuousand justifiable preoccupation with issues of peace andsecurity.Membership in the Security Council in 2010 and2011 afforded Nigeria an opportunity to work withothers to promote the complex peace and security agendaof the United Nations. It was indeed a privilege for usto contribute to the United Nations and internationalefforts to make the world a safer and better place.Nigeria and other emerging nations continue todemonstrate the capacity to add value to the work ofall the organs of the United Nations  including theSecurity Council. For that reason  we must now commitourselves to accelerating the long-overdue reforms ofthe Security Council. They will no doubt make theCouncil more equitable  more inclusive and more effective. Nigeria believes that a reformed SecurityCouncil with expanded permanent membership wouldbenefit from the unique experiences and capacities thatregional representatives could bring to bear on its work.It is a matter of great concern that many regionsof the world  including the West African subregion are plagued by political crises and insurgency. Insome parts of my own country  for instance  we areexperiencing threats from extremist and militantactivities with quasi-terrorist tactics. Our response hasbeen multifaceted  as we seek to address the root causesof those threats  exploring opportunities for dialogueand improving law enforcement to ensure public safetyand security.International cooperation has also been a key factorin tackling our security challenges. We have signedbilateral agreements with our neighbours: Cameroon the Republic of the Niger and Chad. On the multilateralfront  the Lake Chad Basin Commission has been anexcellent platform for cooperation. Those efforts areaimed at safeguarding the security of our individualcountries and denying extremists the use of our regionas sanctuary. We are confident that those measures willstem the f low of and access to small arms and lightweapons  which have indeed become Africa’s weaponsof mass destruction and the most potent source ofinstability. Indeed  the free f low of small arms and lightweapons from the developed countries that manufacturethem to Africa is one of the greater challenges thecontinent is facing in the contemporary world.Nigeria continues to regard the General Assemblyas a veritable platform for collective action to addressissues of common interest to all nations. One such issuedeserving the serious attention of the United Nationsis the adoption of a legally binding arms trade treaty.I believe that important instrument could galvanizethe international community to regulate the transferof conventional weapons and curb the illicit trade insmall arms and light weapons. There is no doubt thatthe absence of a global consensus on controlling thef low of such weapons  including small arms and lightweapons  is fuelling conflicts  constraining growth anddevelopment and increasing human rights violations.A ray of hope was offered early this month withthe successful conclusion of the second UnitedNations Conference to Review Progress Made in theImplementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects  including theunprecedented adoption of an outcome document underNigeria’s presidency. We expect that those positiveachievements will have an impact on the entire UnitedNations disarmament process  including the Conferenceon Disarmament  the Disarmament Commission andother disarmament mechanisms.The correlation between disarmament  peaceand security  and development is axiomatic andself-evident. The work of the United NationsCommission on Life-saving Commodities forWomen and Children — which I have the honour toco-chair with Mr. Jens Stoltenberg  Prime Minister ofNorway — recognizes the need to serve and improvethe health of women and children for the benefitof the future progress of the world. That is indeed alaudable achievement  for which we commend thevision of the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon.The Commission’s overarching objective is to providemedical resources and other life-saving commoditiesin a more affordable  accessible and timely manner thereby saving the lives of at least 4 million women andchildren worldwide by 2015 and helping to achieve thehealth-related targets of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs). Concerned with the unf latteringstatistics on maternal and child mortality in Nigeria my Government has adopted measures for reversingthat unhappy trend  in close collaboration with theCommission and the related Every Woman Every Childmovement.We believe  therefore  that it is time that the worldlooked beyond 2015 to the post-MDG era. The year2015 is not a destination but only a milestone on thelong journey to a better  safer  healthier and more caringworld. It is in that spirit that Nigeria will participate inthe forthcoming intergovernmental process to considerthe development of specific and action-orientedsustainable development goals beyond 2015.Sustainable development and progress are twoultimate aspirations of any nation  and they cannot beachieved without peace and security. Guided by thatrealization  Nigeria has committed and shall continueto commit itself to the attainment of regional andinternational peace and security  in close collaborationwith the United Nations  the African Union andthe Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS).Recently  however  our subregion has sufferedsome setbacks in terms of unconstitutional change of Governments and the emergence of insurgency  amongothers. In Mali  the political crisis stemming from thatreality has escalated to an insurgency that is threateningthe unity of the country. Nigeria and ECOWAS areworking in concert to address that threat  which has thepotential to spill over into neighbouring countries anddestabilize the entire region. Guinea-Bissau is anotherf lashpoint of instability in the subregion in whichNigeria and the Economic Community of West AfricanStates are engaged. Indeed  the contact group  headedby Nigeria  was set up by the authority of the Heads ofState and Government of ECOWAS to help establisha transitional Government with a view to returningthat country to political and constitutional order. Infurtherance of that objective  Nigeria provided the sumof $10 million to the interim Government in Guinea-Bissau to assist in the stabilization of the country.The overall security situation in the West Africansubregion should continue to be a matter of interest andconcern to the rest of the international community. Ibelieve I speak for many in the Assembly when I statethat West Africa can ill afford renewed insurgency.Although ECOWAS is taking measures to address thesituation in Mali  particularly in the north  the urgentassistance of the United Nations and the support ofother partners will be needed to build on recent gainsto secure peace and stability in Mali and across thesubregion.Nigeria’s long-standing commitment to thepromotion of issues of particular concern to Africais widely acknowledged. Nigeria has stood firm andplayed critical roles in all the recent developments inAfrica  including the struggle for independence andself-determination and the fight against apartheid colonialism and discrimination.Today  we are in the vanguard of the fight againstextremism  terrorism and all forms of mindlessviolence. We shall remain undeterred and unf linchingin our resolve to protect our citizens and other personsliving within our borders and to extend such protectionwherever we can to other countries in our region.We know that no country has unilaterally defeatedthe dark forces of violence and terrorism. Theyevidently represent an evil that requires internationalcollaboration. We therefore call upon the internationalcommunity and all like-minded stakeholders to addressthe matter with all the seriousness it deserves. I cannot end my statement without alluding to theimportance of the support that Nigerians are continuingto give to the United Nations in not only advancing butalso upholding international peace and security. Weshall strengthen and deepen our cooperation with theUnited Nations in peacekeeping operations aroundthe world. We shall remain focused and committed toensuring a meaningful and effective contribution toits presence and  if need be  to crucial peacekeepingoperations  particularly in Africa.The events of recent weeks have demonstrated howincreasingly interconnected our world has become andthe extent to which an incident in one area can causereverberations in others. The lesson is that freedomof expression should not be construed as a licence toincitement. The freedom that we all hold dear and trueshould be exercised wisely and consciously. Freedom ofexpression and religious tolerance must not be mutuallyexclusive but should be complementary to each other.We eschew violence and deplore needless loss of livesand destruction of property. We condemn the deliberatedenigration of religious and cultural beliefs andsensitivities  which in turn leads to counter-reactions.As the world grows in knowledge and prosperity so must humankind grow in maturity and wisdom. Careand compassion for our fellow beings must inform allour actions. We must ensure that no nation and no partof the world is left behind in terms of human progress.Working together with commitment and commonpurpose  we can succeed in building an inclusive  saferand prosperous world for present and future generations.The United Nations must lead that effort with renewedcommitment."
"127",5166,"NIC",67,2012,"As I address the General Assembly at its sixty-seventhsession  I would like first of all to convey the warmgreetings and solidarity of the people of Nicaragua andits Government of national reconciliation and unity led by Comrade President Comandante Daniel OrtegaSaavedra  who wishes us success in our work.The changes now taking place in science  economy geopolitics  technology  ecology and culture are trulyrevolutions in the life of all human societies aroundthe world  but they raise doubts about the effectivenessof international organizations in conducting globalaffairs. The situation in the world today proves thatwhen governance is conceived and conducted from theperspective of global capitalism — savage  as it wascalled by His Holiness Pope John Paul II — instead ofbecoming a factor for positive transformation  as wewere led to believe it would  it can lead us to the edgeof civilization.The vertiginous development of speculative venturecapital in developed countries has reduced the role ofthe State in public affairs. The market imposes itselfin all areas — the economy  politics  culture  society individuals and the mass media — thus strengthening theinfluence of the interests of giant corporations involvedin food production  communications  medicine and themilitary-industrial complex. They are the real powerin decisions having a global impact; their decisionsdetermine the course of many important events relatedto the economy and to peace. That is totally contrary tothe idea that gave rise to our Organization. That situationis aggravated by the growing sense that  increasingly well-being and world power are completely in thehands of market and finance elites  that the people’sstandards of living are dramatically crumbling andthat confidence in the capacity of all Governments tosolve the most pressing problems is decreasing at anaccelerating pace.The impact of the economic and financial crisis onthe centres of power of global capitalism is provoking political and social changes with great internationalrepercussions. The United States and Europeancountries  paradigms of that egotistical model  are at aloss to find solutions to their structural problems. Theydrag their citizens and the world into unemployment social insecurity and greater poverty. Thus theexclusive nature of the privatization of the State and itssubjection to market forces  speculation and financialfraud becomes clear  demonstrating the urgent need forequitable distribution of wealth worldwide.Many outstanding thinkers describe the scenario asa struggle between the market and the State. However the paradox is that the very State that wanted to find theparadigm for development in the greater comfort of itscitizens is one that today  without political scruples orethics  develops a new neoliberal programme  disguisedas necessary adjustments to save the economy anddefend the citizens. That reveals that in developedcountries  the economy  the market and political powerare the same thing. In them  the State has evolved only tomerge into one programme the interests of speculativefinancial capital  of large global corporations andindustries and of the military-industrial complex.We are certain that the nature of these adjustments ispermanent  and that it is a new economic agenda thatwill direct the greatest concentration of power to thehighest global level in the quest to dictate the path ofa new capitalist model that in all spheres of life is evermore concentrated.The world of 1945  after the Second World War gave rise to all the institutions that constitute globalgovernance  beginning with our Organization. Thatworld no longer exists. Thus today as never before itis imperative that we re-establish a philosophy of firmand lasting world peace and of economic developmentfor the benefit of all the peoples of the world — that is the philosophy that inspired the founders of the UnitedNations system  the philosophy of global governabilityand management.In that connection  we reiterate the urgency ofmaking progress in the reform of the United Nationssystem  or rather in its reinvention. Nicaraguans havethe honour of having taken the initiative in this matter.Our brother  the former Foreign Minister of Nicaraguaand President of the the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann together with President Daniel Ortega Saavedra andother great present-day thinkers  have taken on the taskof developing a plan for the reinvention of the United Nations system. We say “reinvent” because the presentOrganization no longer permits reforms; those thathave been proposed so far have not made progress  duethe policy of some permanent members of the SecurityCouncil. In the name of the people of Nicaragua  Iinvite all to strongly push for that proposal  in order tomake a reality of a new Charter of the United Nationsthat guarantees democratization of the Organization.Peace is a supreme value and a condition inwhich human activity can develop in a stable mannerbeneficial for all. However  some developmentsestablish a dangerous path.We consider the economic  commercial andfinancial blockade of Cuba a f lagrant violation ofinternational law and the most basic norms of peacefulcoexistence. Furthermore  today it is claimed thatthat blockade is based on the arbitrary  groundlessand unilateral inclusion of that fraternal country in alist of States sponsoring international terrorism. Wedemand the immediate and unconditional end of thatcrime against humanity  which constitutes an affrontto the conscience of our peoples. We also demand theimmediate and unconditional release of the five Cubanpatriots who are unjustly kept in prison in the UnitedStates of America.We demand respect for the sovereignty andindependence of the fraternal Bolivarian Republic ofVenezuela  which faces a wave of conspiratorial actionsseeking to destabilize and destroy the democratic planof the Bolivarian Revolution and the popular interests thus undermining the enormous social and economicgains obtained by the Venezuelan people through greateffort and courage  with the distinguished leadership ofPresident Hugo Chávez Frias.The peace process in Colombia should be fullysupported in order for the people to start on a path oftrue social progress.International law should be given unrestrictedsupport as regards the inviolability of Ecuador’sdiplomatic Mission in the United Kingdom. We alsoreaffirm our support of Argentina’s sovereign rightsover the Malvinas Islands and the right of Puerto Ricoto obtain its full independence.Bearing in mind the information disseminateddaily by the world’s main communication media  ithas escaped no one’s attention that there is a risk ofwidespread war in the Middle East. The situation in Syria is unacceptable. We strongly condemn the acts ofterrorism that have cost the lives of high-level officialsof President Bashar Al-Assad’s Government and ofthe population of Syria. Nicaragua recalls that it is aform of aggression that was already condemned by theInternational Court of Justice in 1986 in the case of TheRepublic of Nicaragua v. The United States of America.It is evident that the mediation promoted by the UnitedNations is going nowhere  simply because it is beingblocked by the members of NATO and their allies withinterests in the region.A peaceful solution with regard to the IslamicRepublic of Iran should be promoted. We need toresolve without delay the aspirations of the Palestinianpeople by supporting the peace negotiations and theirlegitimate right to their own State and to be part ofthe United Nations. We strongly condemn the terroristacts in Benghazi  Libya  on 11 September  in whichUnited States Ambassador Christopher Stevens andthree other United States citizens lost their lives  justas we condemn any act of terrorism that is an assaulton civilization  culture  religion and justice anywherein the world.We welcome the recent positive developments withregard to the relationship between China/Taiwan andthe People’s Republic of China. We have to address thelegitimate aspirations of Taiwan to participate morebroadly in all United Nations specialized agencies andorgans.We reaffirm our commitment to total and completedisarmament and international security. A world freeof nuclear arms and weapons of mass destruction isindispensable.On a different matter  Central America is a transitzone for the drugs produced in the South and that find inthe North  in the United States  their largest consumermarket and the largest money-laundering operation forthe traffic in drugs. Central America has expressedthe need for destination countries to eradicate drugtrafficking and consumption within their borders using all the technology and resources at their disposal.Likewise  we have agreed to demand economic supportfor all of Central America in its constant struggleagainst organized crime and drug trafficking. However the slow pace or lack of commitment to that issuedoes irreparable damage  especially to the peoplesof Mesoamerica  who have to allocate enormous resources for the prohibition and interception of drugs consequently delaying our social investments.In that scenario  which is not very encouragingand in which we are far from being triumphant  LatinAmerica and the Caribbean are making great stridesin strengthening their economic  political  social andcultural integration and unity through the CentralAmerican Integration System  the Bolivarian Alliancefor the Peoples of Our America and the Community ofLatin American and Caribbean States. Our regionalprocess of integration and unity through the CentralAmerican Integration System advances consistently andon solid ground  based on the common objectives thatfurther the peace and economic and social developmentof Central Americans. Our model for integration andunity is also evident in the Bolivarian Alliance for thePeoples of Our America  which has a component offair trade  complementarity  cooperation and solidarityamong its members. Another expression of this processis the Community of Latin American and CaribbeanStates  which was established in 2011 and is convincingproof of our integrationist calling.The principles and purposes of the Movement ofNon-Aligned Countries constitute a broad commonplatform  which has world reach and is contributingto the development of a multipolar world and to thestrengthening of peace and international security. Inthat context  our Government of national reconciliationand unity  presided over by Comandante Daniel OrtegaSaavedra  and our people are achieving importantresults in the struggle against poverty. That strengthensthe process of restoring rights  which translates intomore health  better education  more productive andservice-oriented infrastructure  and a higher livingstandard for all our citizens.Very soon we will have transformed our energymatrix  using sources of renewable energy  so that by2017  94 per cent of energy consumed will be renewableenergy. We have decided to take the necessary steps forthe construction of the great inter-ocean canal throughNicaragua for ships weighing more than 250 000 tons.Climate change and all its related effects constituteone of the most formidable challenges of our time. Thedeveloped countries should comply with their legallybinding environmental commitments. The valuablenatural resources of our planet must not be privatizedin favour of a few. Furthermore  in times of crisis  we can see thatwe run the risk of not reaching all of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals that we proposed to reach by 2015.We cannot allow that to happen. The commitmentsof the developed countries to allocate 0.7 per cent oftheir gross national product to official developmentassistance must be honoured.Another grave problem is that of food insecurity.The food crisis is a serious obstacle in the struggleagainst poverty and hunger. We must work togetherto universally restore that right to the peoples. Oursocieties are struggling with the urgency of satisfyingtheir most basic needs  with equitable profits from thebenefits of development and with the importance ofdeveloping democracies based on representation anddirect participation of the citizens. That is a road whosespecificities must be respected without interference ofany kind.Dangers lurk and have resulted in events that do notcontribute to our political stability. Coups d’état  suchas those attempted in Venezuela  Bolivia and Ecuadoror those carried out in Honduras and Paraguay  mustbe condemned and rejected  regardless of how they areexecuted or attempted. We cannot allow coups to onceagain become entrenched as methods for a politicalsolution to conflicts  whether within any country orbetween States.We cannot ignore that the process of concentrationof global power has repercussions in the politicaland social systems governing our societies. Thefinal blow is intended to destroy or break up popularsocial movements in order to eliminate States andGovernments that do not align themselves with theneoliberal model. Therefore  in the progressive orrevolutionary national projects manifested throughthe nation States of our Latin and Caribbean America our citizens  our peoples  are called to resist and toraise banners of peace  dignity  identity and nationalsovereignty.We are constructing a new world governance withour work to transform international institutions. We arestrengthening a new world governance by incorporatingmore and more citizens in the work of building this newworld to which we aspire. The present global order andits institutions are at an impasse. The only headwaybeing made is through the new effort I am describingto deeply transform the economy  politics  society andculture. That effort alone will endure as the fruit of the best of our human nature and our history. The otherworld  the world that refuses change  the world of warand human misery  the world of the apocalypse beingannounced on television as a novelty  will fail. Thehope and the future for which we struggle will growand shine on its remains."
"128",5213,"NLD",67,2012,"﻿Last month  I visiteda refugee camp at the border between Turkey and Syria.I met children  women and men  who told me how theyhad escaped the violence and suffering in their homecountry. They had f led the bloodshed of a regime thatis using indiscriminate violence against its own people.They had f led a country where children are beingtortured  women raped and innocent civilians killed.They had lost their friends  family and homes  but theyhad not lost hope for a better future.One of the people whom I met near the border wasMedya  the 25-year-old mother of a five-year-old girl.She had f led the city of Homs eight months earlier.Now  she travels back and forth between Homs and arefugee camp in Turkey at great personal danger. Sherisks her life to report to the world on the situation inSyria. Her reports are broadcast on major internationalnetworks.Medya told me about the terrible events that she hadwitnessed. I was touched by her sorrow and impressedby her determination. Her strong desire for freedom issomething to which we can all relate. Those who havestruggled for freedom do not give up easily. However it is also clear that those refugees need the support ofthe international community at large. They need food shelter and security. Ultimately  they need an effectiveUnited Nations and a strong international legal order.Promoting the international legal order is enshrinedin the Constitution of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.It is a mission that we share with many in this Assembly.Together with 49 other countries  we are helping toestablish legal order and security in Afghanistan  forexample. I want to pay tribute to the Dutch and theother men and women  soldiers and civilians  currentlyserving there.The Hague  a city of peace and justice  is knownfor its contribution to the international legal order. Itis home to the International Court of Justice and thePermanent Court of Arbitration  which are both based at the Peace Palace. Next year  we will proudly celebrateits centenary. Former Secretary-General BoutrosBoutros-Ghali recognized the role of the Netherlandsin the international legal order by naming The Haguethe legal capital of the world.We need international law to protect people societies and nations  or  as former Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan recently wrote  the United Nations Charterwas issued in the name of we the peoples  not we theGovernments. So we need a stronger international legalorder  first  to preserve peace and security; secondly to protect freedom; and thirdly  to promote prosperity.That is the task that we face.A strong international legal order helps to preservepeace and security. To achieve that goal  we needgreater unity. I regret the persistent disagreement in theSecurity Council. It has prevented the United Nationsfrom taking decisive action on Syria. The world isin desperate need of a strong  united and determinedSecurity Council.Mediation  arbitration and judicial settlement areindispensable for the peaceful settlement of conflicts.We should cherish and develop those tools  as DeputySecretary-General Jan Eliasson has so rightly said.Better implementation of existing treaties onnon-proliferation  arms control and disarmament is ofparamount importance.An effective international legal order means thatcountries are bound by their promises. Iran mustcompletely fulfil its International Atomic EnergyAgency obligations and abide by Security Councilresolutions. The burden of proof is on Iran. As I saidto my Iranian colleague  Minister Salehi  earlier thisweek: You are the one to convince the world of thepeaceful character of your nuclear programme — notus.The international agendas on nuclear  chemical andconventional weapons must lead to concrete results andnew treaties. The United Nations and the Conferenceon Disarmament in Geneva need to do better.The Organization for the Prohibition of ChemicalWeapons in The Hague will this year celebrate itsfifteenth anniversary. It should stand ready to assist inaddressing the chemical weapons problem in Syria.The Netherlands will host the next Nuclear SecuritySummit  in 2014  as part of our efforts to enhancesecurity and fight nuclear terrorism. Negotiations on a robust and effective arms tradetreaty should recommence as soon as possible.A stronger legal order also promotes freedom. Itpromotes human rights  reinforces the responsibility toprotect and helps prevent atrocities. Greater freedommeans equal rights for men and women alike. Womenmake up 50 per cent of humankind. We need the full100 per cent of humankind. It is in every country’sown interest to make sure that women are activelyinvolved in society  the economy and politics. Theymust participate in the power structures as leaders ofthe world.Human rights cannot be imposed from the outside.But Governments carry the responsibility for observingtheir international human rights obligations andcommitments. There is therefore a need to communicateconstantly about the obligations and commitments.The role of the Human Rights Council in promotingfreedom is crucial. We need to improve the way in whichit functions. Countries that aspire to join the Councilshould be genuinely committed to respecting humanrights. I am proud to reiterate our genuine commitmentand to announce the Dutch candidature for the HumanRights Council from 2015 to 2017.People should be free to live their lives in peaceand security. Therefore  every State has an obligation toprevent aggression  genocide  crimes against humanityand war crimes. Prevention is key. But if countriescannot or will not act  the international community hasa responsibility to protect.A strong international and domestic legal orderpromotes prosperity and  let me state it emphatically economic growth. Trade  investment  innovation andeconomic development will all benefit from a stable predictable and rules-based business climate.The economy cannot thrive in societies wherehuman rights are violated  corruption is rampant andGovernment revenues are wasted. That is one of thelessons of the Arab awakening. Sustainable prosperityand sustainable economic growth depend upon a strong legitimate and reliable legal order.For that matter  free trade agreements and a well-functioning World Trade Organization are crucial forstimulating growth. According to the World Bank  anew global trade deal would increase global welfaretremendously.A good way to promote foreign direct investmentis by enhancing arbitration and conflict resolutionmechanisms. The Permanent Court of Arbitration inThe Hague has an increasingly important role to play.Protecting intellectual property rights effectivelyfosters innovation. We should therefore strengthen theWorld Intellectual Property Organization.Finally  the Millennium Development Goals need anew agenda  with bold ideas to end poverty and plans topromote sustainable development and foster economicgrowth. The private sector is crucial to achievingthose goals  especially when it comes to unlocking thepotential of small and medium-sized enterprises. Toquote renowned economist Paul Collier  “We cannotmake poverty history unless the countries of the bottombillion start to grow”.The United Nations is indispensable for the agendaof peace  freedom and prosperity. The widening gapbetween the increasing expectations we have of theUnited Nations  on the one hand  and of its capacityto deliver  on the other  is a cause of serious concern.Therefore  we need a more effective  efficient andcoherent United Nations.The Security Council must act decisively whenserious crimes are involved and international peace andsecurity are at stake. All United Nations organizationsshould deliver as one. The Secretary-General’s reformproposals must be implemented.Emerging Powers rightly ask for more influence due to new political and economic realities. TheSecurity Council should be reformed while taking thoserealities into account. At the same time  the larger shareof those emerging Powers in the world economy shouldbe reflected in the relative contributions of MemberStates to the United Nations budget.The Members of the United Nations need to takeaction in five areas. First  countries should respectuniversal human rights without distinction. Thatkey principle also applies to lesbian  gay  bisexualand transgender individuals. Secondly  the rights ofreligious minorities should be guaranteed all over theworld. Governments should protect religious groupsagainst violence. Thirdly  countries should recognizethe compulsory jurisdiction of the International Courtof Justice  as the Secretary-General has requested.Fourthly  countries should adhere to the principle ofthe responsibility to protect. That applies to prevention  protection and prosecution. Fifthly  countries that havenot done so to date should join the International CriminalCourt. That will ensure that civilians are protected andthe perpetrators of atrocities are prosecuted.That takes me back to Syria. The Syrian crisishighlights the mounting challenges of the UnitedNations and its States Members. I applaud the activestance of the Secretary-General with regard to Syria.The Office for the Coordination of HumanitarianAffairs  the World Food Programme  the Office ofthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugeesand many other organizations are providing crucialassistance to the victims of the violence. I want to payexplicit tribute to the Governments of Turkey  Lebanonand Jordan for their invaluable efforts to alleviate thesuffering of the thousands of refugees.In conclusion  for me  meeting Мedya  thatcourageous Syrian journalist and mother  has given avoice to those refugees. I hope that I will meet Medya that 25-year-old mother of a five-year-old child  againin the near future in Homs  Syria. I want to see her livein an inclusive and prosperous Syria  where democracyand human rights replace terror and violence. It is aboutdemocracy and human rights. That is our aim. I wantto see her live in a Syria where jobs and economicopportunities have replaced poverty and despair.That woman  Мedya  has already shown the courageand the will to contribute to Syria’s future. Together we  the peoples of the United Nations  should showthat same courage. Together  we must preserve peace protect freedom and promote prosperity. Together  letus build a stronger international legal order."
"129",5258,"NOR",67,2012,"﻿Leadership is about makingchoices. It is about the ability to make the right decisionat the right moment and to have the stamina to deliveraccordingly. It is about the will to help shape the future of individuals  nations and the planet. And it is aboutthe courage that comes with seeking peace with one’senemies  as Yitzhak Rabin once told us. Leadership isalso about creating the conditions for people to choosehow to live their lives. Freedom is more than the mereabsence of physical or legal obstacles.The very purpose of the United Nations is topromote freedom for all people — freedom from want freedom from fear  and the freedom to live in dignity.People are only truly free when they are able to choosethe way they want to live their own lives  regardlessof race  gender or sexual orientation. It is the freedomof a woman to choose when to have children and alsowhen not to have them. It is about her freedom fromintrusion of her physical integrity  as well as her rightto think and say what she wants. It is about the freedomthat allows mother and child to survive birth  and thefreedom that allows every child to live a healthy life receive education and walk to school without fear ofland mines or cluster munitions. It is about the freedomof every man and every woman to organize  to speakout and to have their say as society progresses.Those freedoms lay the ground for development andprosperity. They give men and women a chance to builda better future for themselves and for their families.Some people can only dream about those freedoms  butwhen they do exist they are often the result of collectiveaction by families  communities  regions and States andat the global level. At the end of the day  that is why weare here in this Assembly.In Syria  mass atrocities are continuing. The crisisin Syria started with a call for freedom and dignitythrough peaceful protests. The Syrian Governmentbears the primary responsibility. The privileges of thefew should no longer stand in the way of the aspirationsof the many. The regime of Bashar Al-Assad has lost alllegitimacy and must cede power. The violence in Syriamust stop.Even in war  there are rules. All parties have clearresponsibilities under international humanitarian law.To any party that commits violations of these principles I say this: “You are all individually responsible. Whenjustice prevails  you will be held accountable for thecrimes you have committed. Do not expect to bepardoned by stating that your opponent committed thesame crime.”When the United Nations was formed in SanFrancisco in 1945  we collectively decided to establish a Security Council to act on our behalf. The permanentmembers were then entrusted with the right of veto. Mycountry’s delegation at the time was led by Mr. TrygveLie  who would later become the Organization’s firstSecretary-General. On behalf of my country  he cast hisvote in favour of the right of veto for the five permanentmembers  as did many other small and medium-sizedcountries. They did so not only to reflect the worldorder of the day  but also to ensure that the Councilwould have genuine authority to make decisions and beable to act on our behalf. They did not do so becausethey held certain States to be superior to others.Therefore  and in the light of the Syrian drama  mymessage to the members of the Security Council is thatpeople in the Arab world  in Europe  in Asia  in Africaand in the Americas are watching with horror howhistory is repeating itself. Once again  the permanentmembers of the Security Council are divided andunable to protect people on the ground. In its absence extremists on all sides are free to kill  maim and rape.We now expect the members of the Council to act. Weexpect them to put away outdated ideas of zero-sumgames or spheres of influence and to strive to seek acommon position. Enough blood has been shed.The verdict is harsh against those who choose thewrong side of history. They must not allow narrowself-interest to block the winds of change that thevast majority of members of this Assembly applaud.President Al-Assad of Syria was not forced to take thepath of conflict and confrontation; he could have optedfor compromise and cooperation. Elsewhere in theworld  quite different choices are being made.Today in this Assembly  we have heard howMyanmar’s reformist President Thein Sein is openingthe door for a free and democratic Myanmar. I commendthe courage shown by the Myanmar Government. I alsocommend the courage of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Shehas chosen to talk to the very people who once held herin confinement.Earlier today in Addis Ababa  the leaders of theSudan and South Sudan made the choice to end thebloody conflict that has marred their peoples’ lives fordecades. The Sudan and South Sudan had again beenon the brink of war  but by signing today’s agreementsthey have opted for peace. We salute the African Union which has  in close partnership with the SecurityCouncil  helped make that choice possible. In Colombia  the Government and representativesof the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombiahave made the wise choice of entering into formalnegotiations in order to end another age-old conflict.As Norway’s Foreign Minister  I am the Chair ofthe Ad Hoc Liaison Committee for the Coordinationof International Assistance to Palestinians. We met onthe eve of this session of the General Assembly. I wantto take this opportunity to share with Member Statesmy deep concern about the state of play in the Israel-Palestine relationship. Exactly one year ago  we agreedhere in New York that the Palestinian State-buildingprocess had reached a level where the institutions ofState were in place. Great expectations were created only to be frustrated.Time is running short — shorter than many seemto understand. There is significant fatigue among thePalestinian population. They may become inspiredto look for alternative options — options that wouldseverely hamper the prospects of Palestinians andIsraelis alike. I see a similar fatigue emerging among thecountries that are funding the Palestinian authorities.The two-State solution is the only path to sustainablepeace  but the prospect of realizing a Palestinian Statebased on the two-State solution is diminishing as theexpansion of Israeli settlements continues. Thoseactions remain the main obstacle to peace and they muststop. To get the peace process back on track  we needto break the impasse and reinstall the trust in a politicalhorizon based on the final status issues. Negotiationsremain the key to achieve that; they must start now.Leadership is also about trust. To achieve ourgoals  we need a strong United Nations. I applaud theSecretary-General’s tireless efforts aimed at reformingthe internal workings of the Organization. We haveelected a Secretary-General to lead  but we must allowhim to do so. Intergovernmental micromanagementof what would be the chief executive’s prerogative inany modern organization is nothing but the opposite ofmaking the United Nations work.To conclude  leaders have real choices. Leadershave real responsibilities. Humankind shapes its ownfuture. Failing to solve the most critical challengesof our time not only harms those who suffer underpoverty  war or oppression; it also deprives people ofthe conviction that they too can shape their own future.And that very conviction  that belief in oneself and eachother  is what will make freedom from want  freedom from fear and the freedom to live in dignity possible forall. That is the purpose of our leadership."
"130",5304,"NPL",67,2012,"﻿Let me begin bycongratulating Mr. Jeremić on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventhsession. My delegation assures him of its full support inthe discharge of his responsibilities.I also take this opportunity to place on record ourprofound appreciation to the outgoing President  HisExcellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  for havingsuccessfully presided over the sixty-sixth session of theAssembly. Let me also express our sincere gratitudeto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his strongcommitment and dedication in serving the UnitedNations.In establishing the United Nations at a time whenthe world was emerging from the ashes of successivedevastating wars  our founding fathers envisioneda peaceful  stable  just and prosperous world. Nearlyseven decades later  the lofty objectives of the UnitedNations Charter are yet to be fully realized. Threats tointernational peace and security remain unabated  withtraditional sources of threats continuing alongside theemergence of new sources and forms of conflict. Infact  the sense of insecurity seems to be more pervasive today as people around the world continue to face awide range of situations  characterized by the legacyof colonialism  injustice  domination  exploitation hatred  intolerance  exclusion  xenophobia and so on.Economic insecurity in the face of the heightened globaleconomic and financial crises and fierce competitionfor dwindling resources and energy security also playtheir part in generating tensions in many parts of theworld.The concept of collective security being the corepillar of the United Nations Charter has often beenundermined through recourse to dispute-settlementmeans that are outside the purview of a multilateralmechanism. Unilateralism and the selectiveinterpretation of the provisions of the Charter riskinciting more conflict and confrontation rather thanunderstanding and cooperation. That necessitateswider respect and observance of the principles ofsovereignty  territorial integrity  political independenceand non-interference as the bedrock principles ofinternational relations. Those principles cannotand should not be put to the political test under anycircumstances.The growing challenges do not mean that the roleand importance of the United Nations have diminished but rather demand a more effective and strongerOrganization. We must internalize that reality andmove forward  grasping the true spirit of its foundingprinciples and purposes.Nepal supports a just and lasting solution to theMiddle East. It is our principled position to supportthe legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and a fully independent and sovereignPalestinian State on the basis of the United Nationsresolutions. The peaceful and secure coexistence of theindependent States of a sovereign Palestine and Israelare crucial to ensuring lasting peace in the Middle East.We call for an end to the violence and the peacefulresolution of the Syrian crisis by the Syrian peoplethemselves. The sovereignty  territorial integrity andindependence of Syria must be upheld.We are of the firm opinion that the protractedembargo on Cuba is unjustified and needs to be endedimmediately and unconditionally.We recognize the legitimate rights of everysovereign State to pursue the development of nucleartechnology solely for peaceful purposes and under effective international supervision. We stand firmlyagainst nuclear proliferation  the arms race and themisuse of nuclear technology for ulterior motives.We strongly oppose and renounce violence andphysical attacks on diplomats anywhere under anypretext.We reiterate our call for general and completeelimination of nuclear and all other weapons of massdestruction in a time-bound manner. The internationalcommunity should work in unison to strengthencontrols over small arms and light weapons to preventtheir pervasive abuse by criminal elements.It is heartening to note that  as a major troop-contributing country  Nepal has already providedover 92 000 professional and dedicated peacekeepersto the United Nations for various operations since itsfirst participation in 1959. We remain steadfast in ourcommitment to international peace and security andaffirm that our contribution to that noble cause willcontinue. While calling for timely reforms in thatf lagship activity  we stress the importance of equitablerepresentation of troop-contributing countries  at theleadership level  both at United Nations Headquartersand in field missions.I would like to reaffirm Nepal’s unreservedcondemnation of terrorism wherever it occurs and inall its forms and manifestations. We renew our callfor an expeditious conclusion of the negotiations on acomprehensive convention on international terrorism.As we continue to combat terrorism  we must not forgetthat durable peace can be built only on the firm pillarsof the prevention of conflict  the peaceful resolution ofdisputes  persistent efforts for disarmament  povertyreduction  development and respect for diversity fairness and justice. There is a need to differentiatebetween terrorism and struggles for liberation  freedomand sustainable peace and development.Our commitment to democracy  human rights  therule of law and inclusive development is unf linching.The mutually reinforcing effects of such principles fosterthe active participation of the people in governanceprocesses towards safeguarding peace  securityand development. To address Nepal’s post-conflicttransition needs  we have established mechanisms andprocesses for the protection and promotion of humanrights and for their monitoring at the highest level andat various tiers of the sub-national level. As a party to 22 human rights conventions including seven core instruments  we have establishedseveral laws that ensure the rights of all sectors ofsociety  including women  children and marginalizedand deprived communities. We are committed tocontrolling cross-border human trafficking and todoing our utmost to ensure that the rights and interestsof migrant workers are protected in countries that aredestinations for labour. The National Human RightsCommission  which is an independent constitutionalbody  operates as the country’s all-powerful watchdogfor the protection and promotion of human rights.We are committed to strengthening that specializednational institution as a true custodian of human rights.Nepal has provided shelter to a large number ofrefugees on humanitarian grounds. While we appreciatethe assistance of the international community insupporting refugees  we reiterate that their voluntaryrepatriation to their homeland with dignity and honouris the only durable solution to the refugee problem.We underscore that the rule of law at theinternational level is as important as at the national levelin ensuring the sovereign equality of all States  respectfor their territorial integrity and political independenceand non-intervention in their internal affairs. Thoseare essential principles for peaceful coexistence andmutual cooperation among States.The issue of sustainable development has cometo the forefront of today’s global discourse. It was thefocus of the United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment (Rio+20). We believe that we need topursue not only sustainable development goals  butalso a development path towards equal prosperitythrough meaningful development opportunities byeradicating the deeply entrenched inequalities andglobal exploitative practices. In our opinion  freeingall human beings from the dehumanizing clutches ofpoverty and hunger should be the first essential steptowards that end. The outcome document of Rio+20(resolution 66/288  annex) sets out a broad frameworkfor global action for “The future we want” and a post-2015 global development agenda. The need of the houris to ensure effective implementation.As we all have come to realize  climate change isone of the greatest challenges of our time. Its insidiouseffects are visible everywhere and are compoundedby disasters of increasing magnitude and frequency.Countries like Nepal  which make a negligible contribution to greenhouse gases but have to bear thedisproportionate brunt of the impacts of climate change deserve special assistance in creating and maintainingclimate-resilient societies. Negotiations under theUnited Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange should continue to be guided by the principleof common but differentiated responsibilities in letterand spirit. Nepal hopes that the successor mechanismof the Kyoto Protocol ensures binding commitmentsand climate justice. The various funding mechanismsfor climate change adaptation and mitigation measuresmust be activated  and action must be taken on anurgent basis.The world we live in is more unjust today than whenwe inherited it. Contrary to much-touted popular belief the profusion in knowledge  the revolution in scienceand technology and increased mobility in ideas andglobal capital  though often termed as advancementscharacteristic of the modern world  have failed todeliver significant contributions to making our planetsafer and more just. They could have  but that is notthe reality. It is an irony that our capacities to producegoods and services have increased manyfold  leadingto an unprecedented accumulation of wealth  but overone third of the world’s population is forced to live inabject poverty.The rapid globalization of finance and anunsustainable consumption of resources have madea few people enormously rich at the cost of the rest making for the greatest inequality among human beingsever in history. Obviously  the transformative power ofglobalization has not been utilized for the benefit of themasses. The direction and pattern of the current formof economic globalization therefore call for a change inits mode of operation so that it becomes more inclusiveand responsive to the needs of poor and marginalizedpeople.Nepal views the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)and the Group of 77 and China as important multilateralforums that should play an active role in advancingthe United Nations agenda  in line with the Charterobjectives of pursuing the shared goals of peace  progressand prosperity. The principles and purposes of NAM areof continued relevance in forging developing countries’collective moral resolve to create an equitable  fair andjust world order  combating the conservative forces ofrepression  invasion  intimidation and injustice. Theideals of NAM  as reiterated at its recently held sixteenthsummit in Teheran  go a long way towards fostering better understanding and cooperative relations amongcountries and peoples of the world.The least developed countries (LDCs) are sufferingfrom dehumanizing marginalization and deprivationof the basic necessities of life. This state of affairsis a blemish on the sheer aff luence achieved in theglobalized world. Global sustainable development willnot be possible without sustainable development for theLDCs  including substantial improvement in the qualityof life of their 880 million people. The world must paydue attention in deeds as well as in words to the specialand different needs and requirements of the LDCs.The landlocked LDCs (LLDCs)  among which Nepalfigures  have to bear the additional disadvantages ofphysical and non-physical barriers in trade. That resultsin increased transactional costs for transit transport which renders their international trade uncompetitive.Transit countries  regional groups  the internationalfinancial institutions and other development partnersshould work together to overcome those difficulties byinvesting in transport infrastructure links and tradefacilitation measures. We underline the central roleof the United Nations in promoting the developmentagenda  taking into account the special needs anddevelopment challenges confronting the LDCs  theLLDCs and other vulnerable groups of countries.Timely and ongoing reforms of the UnitedNations are necessary to strengthen and revitalizethis world body so that it can respond to increasingglobal challenges. The General Assembly must bestrengthened and endowed with decision-makingpower and authority commensurate with its globalrepresentation. Nepal supports the expansion of theSecurity Council in both member categories and hopesto see greater accountability and transparency in itsworking methods. The Economic and Social Councilmust be strengthened for the promotion of internationaleconomic cooperation  coordination  policy review anddialogue. It must also formulate and develop the socialand economic agenda and work for the implementationof agreed international development goals  with specialemphasis on development for LDCs  LLDCs and smallisland developing States  among others.We seek an increased role for the UnitedNations system in global economic governance  withstrengthened coordination and cooperation withthe Bretton Woods institutions and the World TradeOrganization  to reflect the dynamics of change. Let me brief ly say a few words about the currentsituation in my country. The historic task we face isstill to positively conclude the historical transitionwe are undergoing as early as possible. We need theConstituent Assembly to promulgate a new constitutionand we need to finally complete the peace process.Based on the historic people’s movement of 2006  whichwas the culmination of many decades of struggle by theNepalese people against autocracy  we abolished themonarchy and established a republican State. We alsoadopted other important principles  such as secularism federalism and inclusive  proportional representationand participation  although they are yet to be codifiedin a new constitution.The Constituent Assembly was elected for thefirst time in Nepal’s political history in 2008 andwas mandated to draft a constitution addressing theaspirations of the people for change  a restructuring ofthe State and an end to all forms of exploitation anddiscrimination based on class  ethnicity  gender andregion. The Constituent Assembly worked for fouryears to draft the new constitution and completed 80to 90 per cent of the drafting  but never finalized thetext. Not having met its deadline  and after the SupremeCourt ruled against extensions  it was dissolved on27 May this year.We have made qualitative progress on the technicalside of the peace process  mainly the integration offormer Maoist combatants. There is no outstandingproblem left in that regard and the process is nearcompletion. A transitional justice mechanism is in placeto promote the peace and reconciliation process neededfor the completion of the peace process. But we haveyet to find a solution to the Constituent Assembly’sinability to create a constitution. Political parties areengaged in dialogue and negotiations in that regardand are seriously committed to finding a consensussolution. National consensus is the only option to find away out of the current impasse. We hope we will be ableto do so without excessive delay.As we go through the process of institutionalizingchange  we are of the firm belief that democracy development and peace are interrelated andinterdependent. By “democracy”  we mean inclusiveand participatory democracy  and by “development”we mean people-centred development with socialjustice and socioeconomic transformation. Withoutdemocracy and development  there cannot be lastingand sustainable peace. And democracy  development  peace and stability should safeguard nationalsovereignty. Thus democracy  development  peace andnational sovereignty are the major components of ourprocess of change. From our experience  we can say thatdemocracy has both universal and particular aspects.We thank the international community  includingthe United Nations  for its continued support for andcooperation in our peace and constitution-makingprocess from the very beginning  and hope that it willcontinue in the future.Nature has blessed us with an outstanding mountainrange with gushing rivers  incredible biodiversity and alandscape spectrum of contrast and vibrancy. We areequally rich in ancient cultural heritage  multiple ethniccultures and a diverse mosaic of hardworking people.We need a stable and peaceful environment if we areto make effective use of those diverse endowments forsocioeconomic transformation  along with ongoingState restructuring. Only then will it be possible totranslate the historic achievements we have made onthe political front into tangible results in economic andhuman development terms.As a symbolic gesture to institutionalize peacefor development in the national  regional and globalcontexts  we want to develop Lumbini  the birthplace ofLord Buddha  the apostle of peace  into an internationalcity of peace. In that respect  we call for internationalsupport and cooperation to realize the initiative.In conclusion  I would like in all humility to drawthe attention of all world leaders to the core realitythat if we do not reach the goal of global peace andprosperity together  then nobody will. That is why wemust act together accordingly."
"131",5321,"NRU",67,2012,"﻿Allow me to congratulateMr. Jeremić on his assumption of the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session and alsoto commend his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. NassirAbdulaziz Al-Nasser  for his effective leadership duringthe sixty-sixth session. The President can be assured ofmy delegation’s full support and cooperation during histenure.This body was a very different place when MinisterPaul-Henri Spaak  another presidential predecessor opened the first session of the General Assembly. Theworld had just emerged from the most devastatingcarnage it had ever seen  and the United Nationshad the enormous task of stitching civilization backtogether again. Finding common purpose among theoriginal 51 Member States promised to be a Herculeaneffort — a similar endeavour had faltered only a decadeearlier — but the stakes were far too high for failure tobe an option. Accordingly  the Organization embarkedin earnest on the long process of strengthening therule of international law based on the principles ofnon-aggression and the sovereign equality of all nations.It is a testament to the success of those earlyefforts that the membership of the United Nations hasswelled to 193 countries and the past 67 years havebeen a period of relative stability. While the benefitsof multilateralism during this time were often sharedunequally  as were the costs  the promise of a morestable and secure future for all imbued the UnitedNations with the legitimacy it needed to pursue itsambitious mandate. But we must never forget that thelegitimacy underpinning our essential work here is nota birthright; we must earn it. When our words becomehollow  that legitimacy is threatened.The work of our early predecessors was one ofconstruction. The task at hand today  perhaps evenmore challenging  is one of restoration. We are awash inunfulfilled promises stretching back decades. Barringa brief resurgence in the early 1990s  multilateralismhas for the most part deteriorated into a scramble forfinite resources  a destructive fight for a bigger pieceof the economic pie  sugarcoated with empty rhetoric.Look at the beginning of any international agreementand you will find reaffirmation upon reaffirmation ofour non-binding commitments to live up to our loftyideals. Perhaps their greatest value is as a reminder of how often very little has been achieved. Our wordsmust have meaning if our multilateral institutions areto remain effective in addressing emerging globalchallenges. Once again  the stakes are too high forfailure to be an option.That dynamic could not be moreevident than it was in the climate change negotiations.This summer  we were treated to a new round of trulyterrifying news. Arctic sea ice dropped to its lowestextent in recorded history  shattering the previousrecord by a jaw-dropping 18 per cent. Some scientistsare now predicting that the Arctic Ocean could beice-free during summer in as little as five years. The icemelt is already wreaking significant havoc on weatherpatterns around the globe and has probably contributedto the historic heat waves that struck many places thisyear.Just last week  a new study found that half of allcoral reefs could be lost with a temperature rise above1.2 degrees Celsius. The scientists further concluded:“There is little doubt... coral reefs will no longer beprominent within coastal ecosystems if global averagetemperatures exceed 2 degrees Celsius...” That wouldbe devastating for the economies of small islands andcoastal communities around the world  not to mentionthe staggering and irrevocable loss of biodiversitythat would be incurred by our shared natural heritage.More and more studies are concluding that the door tolimiting temperature rise to even 2 degrees is rapidlyclosing  if it has not closed already.Meanwhile  greenhouse-gas emissions continueto climb higher each year  with no end in sight. Smallislands may be the canary in the coal mine  but we allare staring a global catastrophe right in the face.It is revealing just how much our ambition toaddress the crisis has been downscaled in just threeyears. The fifteenth session of the Conference of theParties to the United Nations Framework Conventionon Climate Change  held in Copenhagen  was theconference to save the world. The United NationsClimate Change Conference  held in Cancún  Mexico was the conference to save the process. The Conferenceof the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties tothe Kyoto Protocol  held in Durban  South Africa  itseems  was the conference to save the rest for later.Instead of increasing the urgency of our work torespond to the growing climate crisis  we have insteadseen the steady dismantling of the internationalregime and a concerted effort to delay additionalaction until 2020. Such an outcome is unacceptable. Ifmultilateralism is to have any credibility  then we mustmove to an emergency footing  and those countrieswith the greatest capacity must immediately beginmobilizing the significant resources necessary toremake the energy infrastructure that powers the globaleconomy. That must begin at the eighteenth session ofthe United Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange in Doha with the reprioritization of pre-2020mitigation ambition and the mobilization of meansof implementation  including finance  technology andcapacity-building.Nauru’s delegation will arrive in Doha preparedto make its contribution to the global effort. We haveadopted a very ambitious renewable energy goal of50 per cent by 2015. We think we can achieve it  butwe will need climate financing from internationalsources to do so. As with most developing countries obtaining the means of implementation will be the keyto unlocking our ambition.The ultimate objective of the Convention on ClimateChange is to stabilize greenhouse gases at a level thataverts dangerous interference with the climate system sothat ecosystems can adapt naturally  food production isnot threatened and economic development can proceedin a sustainable manner. We should stop pretending thatthis is still within reach.We must realize that we have polluted theatmosphere so much that many dangerous climatechange impacts are now unavoidable. Therefore the United Nations system must begin analysing andaddressing the security implications of climate change.Climate change will become an increasing driverof conflict in the future if we do not take steps now.Increased competition over dwindling natural resources food and water insecurity  and forced migration arejust a few of the security issues that climate changeis expected to exacerbate. For that reason  the Pacificsmall island developing States (SIDS) have called forthe appointment of a special representative on climateand security  supported by adequate resources  tobegin analysing the security threats of climate changeand to work with interested Member States to buildtheir resilience. In addition  the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations should be requested to conduct anassessment of the United Nations system’s capacityto respond to the various security implications ofclimate change. Member States  particularly the mostvulnerable  must have confidence that the international community has the tools and resources to respond tothe crisis.Some countries have been sceptical of SecurityCouncil involvement in climate change. That isunderstandable because the Council’s currentcomposition does not accurately reflect the diversityof United Nations membership. The time has come forthis to be remedied. However  reform should not belimited merely to membership. The Council must alsoprovide a forum for addressing the security challengesof all countries  not just those of concern to the mostpowerful.The United Nations sustainable developmentinitiatives have been graced with an abundance oflofty rhetoric but few resources. Many countries including my own  are not on track to meet theirMillennium Development Goals  and in some caseshave suffered setbacks because of the recent globaleconomic downturn. At the same time  the f low ofofficial development assistance from some channelshas diminished  further jeopardizing our ability toachieve our MDGs.We often forget that oceans cover 70 per cent ofthe Earth’s surface and that healthy marine ecosystemsare vital to the sustainable development and sustainablelivelihoods of small islands. For many of us  the onlyvaluable natural resource we have is our fish. It formsthe cornerstone of our efforts to eradicate poverty andprovide livelihoods for our people. For us  fishing isnot just another economic sector — it is often the onlysignificant economic sector  and we must jealouslyguard our modest natural wealth so that it can providefor many generations to come.While the outcome document of the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development in Rio hadfew concrete deliverables  it did capture the PacificSIDS vision of a blue economy. If fully implemented the new provisions could help stem the steep declinein fish stocks. We welcome the recognition of oceanacidification as an emergent threat  and we must workcollectively to build the resilience of marine ecosystemsto climate change impacts. The commitments made inRio must be backed by real resources so they can betranslated into concrete results on the ground.Rio also infused new energy into making islandsa model for sustainable development by agreeing toconvene the third Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States  which is to be held in the Pacific in 2014. The Conference willprovide an opportunity for the international communityto make good on the promises of the BarbadosProgramme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy forImplementation by setting specific goals and mobilizingreal resources. We call on the international communityto provide support for the Conference and to summonthe political will necessary to make it a success. It wasagreed at the first Earth Summit that the sustainabledevelopment of SIDS would be the first test of theglobal partnership. We must demonstrate to the worldthat this partnership means something.A central aspect of that work must be enhancingthe international system to better target the uniquecombination of challenges faced by SIDS  whichshould include the creation of a formal SIDS categoryat the United Nations. It is clear from 20 years ofexperience that the current arrangements for improvingthe sustainabIe development prospects of SIDS areineffective. We must demonstrate that the multilateralsystem is nimble enough to evolve in response to theshortcomings that have been identified.Nauru welcomes the attention that the theme ofthis year’s general debate brings to the need to addressdisputes by peaceful means  and it commends theefforts made by Taiwan and China to reduce tensionsand increase cooperation. I call on Member States tosupport continuing dialogue between the two sides ofthe Taiwan Strait and the parties concerned in the EastChina Sea dispute to recognize Taiwan’s positive rolein consolidating peace and stability in East Asia. Nauruurges a rapid and peaceful settlement of the situationin South Ossetia and Abkhazia in a manner that treatsthose affected with dignity and that respects their rightsas a sovereign nation.Nauru continues to support the right of Israel to livefree from the fear of terrorism. We also acknowledgePalestine’s right to statehood as part of a two-Statesolution  which can be achieved only through peacefulmeans.The challenges facing the international communityare great and can be solved only by concertedmultilateral action. President Jeremić’s task and oursis to begin the process of rebuilding the Organization.That process must restore the integrity of the institutionentrusted with the protection of human dignity. Itwas accomplished once before in the aftermath of acatastrophe. This time  our goal must be to prevent one.I pledge Nauru’s full support in that endeavour."
"132",5368,"NZL",67,2012,"﻿I bring greetingsfrom the South Pacific. For the past year  New Zealandhas had the privilege of chairing the Pacific IslandsForum  a regional body that represents some of thesmallest and most vulnerable States on this planet. Forus that has been an important responsibility.Because we are a small country with modestresources  we choose to focus much of our attentionon our own region. Over 60 per cent of our officialdevelopment assistance is spent in our ownneighbourhood. Serving as Chair of the Pacific IslandsForum has caused us to reflect on the role of regionalorganizations  and also on the extent to which we alldepend on the United Nations for solutions to challengesthat are truly global in character. I say with someconfidence that we have been making good progressin dealing with those challenges that are capable ofregional solutions.But I must also say that we need and expect morefrom this institution. The Pacific Islands Forum has16 members  of which 16 are small island States. I waspleased this week to attend the first meeting betweenthe Secretary-General and Pacific Islands Forumleaders  which I hope will mark a new era of enhancedhigh-level engagement between this Organization andour region and a greater understanding of our needs.The Pacific has had its share of stability andsecurity challenges in recent times. As a region  wehave done reasonably well in dealing with them. Most recently it has been in Solomon Islands that a regionalinitiative has been required. The Regional AssistanceMission to the Solomon Islands has involved a trulyregional approach  with the participation of policeand other personnel from every member of the PacificIslands Forum. I am pleased to report that the securityelement of that initiative has been significantly scaleddown and will soon be fully withdrawn. But there isalso more that this Organization  particularly theSecurity Council  can do to acknowledge and supportregional leadership on peace and security matters in thePacific and elsewhere.Concerns about democracy  the rule of law andhuman rights are not mere abstract considerations withinthe Pacific. Those principles have been challenged in anumber of States  most notably  in recent years  in Fiji.In that respect  I am pleased to report that progress isbeing made towards the holding of elections in 2014 and that support has been forthcoming to ensure thatsuch elections are free and fair.Stability and security issues are not the onlypriorities for our regional body. In our year as ForumChair  New Zealand chose to focus on a number ofdevelopment priorities  two of which I wish to mentionin my remarks today.For many of the poorer States within our region their fisheries resource is the major economic asset theyhold. Yet due to illegal fishing practices  unreportedcatch and inadequate management practices  thosecountries have received far too small a return on thatresource. Because of the highly migratory characterof the tuna resource  this is truly a matter requiringregional management. Solid progress is being madein such areas as improved surveillance  the trainingof monitors and improved management practices  bothto protect the last really healthy fishery on the planetand to ensure that its owners receive a fair share of theresource they own.One of the highest priorities within our regionis the need for practical initiatives in the area ofrenewable energy. Ours is a region heavily dependentupon fossil fuels for the generation of electricity. Thecost of expensive imported diesel in most small Pacificeconomies is absolutely crippling. The climate changeimpact is obvious.After a decade of climate change conferences andhundreds of millions of dollars in so-called climatechange initiatives  one might be forgiven for imagining that the Pacific  overendowed as it is with good sunlight would by now be positively festooned with solar powerplants. Sadly  I must report that that is not in fact thecase. Indeed  one of the most striking features of ourregion has been the complete lack of progress in puttinglofty climate change rhetoric into any form of renewableenergy practice.In our year in the Chair of the regional body wehave set out to correct that serious shortcoming. Asmall but important illustration lies in our work inthe tiny Tokelau Islands. Until now  Tokelau has been100 per cent dependent on fossil fuels for the generationof electricity. By the end 2012  Tokelau will be over90 per cent resourced with renewable solar electricity.Good progress has also been made in Tonga  whereI recently participated in the opening of a solar powerplant supplying around 20 per cent of the electricityrequirements of the main island  Tongatapu. And weare working with the Cook Islands Government  too to assist in meeting their bold aspiration to 50 per centrenewable electricity by 2015  mostly through solarinitiatives.These New Zealand-funded programmes arean important part of our overall commitment to ourregion. Our parting legacy from our year as Chairof the regional body is a renewable-energy pledgingconference to be held early next year  with the objectiveof matching donors  suppliers of concessional andcommercial finance  and others with the renewableenergy plans of our Pacific neighbours. Here I shouldacknowledge the European Union’s commitment inco-leading this initiative  as well as the support of theWorld Bank  the Asian Development Bank and theGovernments of Australia  the United States and othergenerous supporters.While there is much that can be achieved byregional action  we must acknowledge that sometimesregional solutions are just not enough. That goes rightto the very heart of the reason for the existence of thisOrganization. My point is most vividly illustratedtoday in relation to Syria. It would be difficult forme to overstate the level of frustration of the peopleI represent with the complete inability of the SecurityCouncil to act in relation to Syria. And it would beeven more difficult to overstate the extent to which theSecurity Council is at risk of losing its credibility in theeyes of reasonable and fair-minded people through itsinability to act. People in my country ask a very simple question:If 25 000 deaths  countless thousands injured andmany more displaced and homeless are not enough toget the Security Council to act  then what does it take?Just what does it take? I welcome the leadership thatthe Arab League and Arab States have shown on thisissue  and we have seen similar leadership from themon other difficult issues in their region. And I welcomethe fact that the General Assembly has been lookingfor opportunities to be more engaged. In the absence ofleadership from the Security Council  1 suggest that theAssembly must find ways to play a more activist role.But from all of this  the case for Security Councilreform has become utterly compelling. Indeed increasingly  the future credibility of the UnitedNations may depend on it. If we are to make progressin this area we will need to see Members move past theextravagant attempts to maximize individual positionsand try to find some meaningful  practical reforms thatactually hold the prospect of widespread support.I represent a small nation of practical  constructivepeople. And it is because we seek practical constructive reform that our Government supports theso-called intermediate solution: the creation of a newcategory of seat for the group of larger countries thatfeel underrepresented in comparison with the fivepermanent members of the Security Council (P-5)  butseats that they would have to win in open electionsso as to make them fully accountable to the broadermembership.I do not intend in these remarks to discuss any otherspecific proposals we would like to see considered  withone exception. There are now compelling reasons for usto ask the P-5 to voluntarily accept restrictions on theuse of the veto. To go further and to seek its abolition ispointless; it simply will not happen. But to ask the P-5to acknowledge and respect the genuine concerns of thewider membership by voluntarily accepting a curb onthe exercise of the veto is an entirely reasonable andachievable objective.My country was one of those that led the oppositionto the veto when the Organization was being established;indeed  it was the only Charter issue that was forced to avote. The permanent members argued at that stage thatthe veto was necessary in order to protect their vitalnational interests. Yet today we routinely see the vetoexercised in circumstances that have little to do withnational interests. My request to the five permanent members is simply that they stick with what they saidto us back in 1945. And my challenge to them todayis to consider a process by which they collectively andvoluntarily agree to confine their use of the veto tothose issues that clearly and directly affect their vitalnational interests; and also that they voluntarily agreenot to use their veto in situations that involve massatrocities.While on the topic of the Security Council  Iwould like to take the opportunity to urge the Counciland the relevant organs of the General Assembly torespond positively to the requests from the EconomicCommunity of West African States for support indealing with the conflict in Mali and the Sahel. Toooften we have seen the Council fail to respond ina timely way to requests for help — in Rwanda  inGuinea  in Darfur and in Somalia. Too often it has beena case of too little  too late. In all of these cases we haveseen good leadership from within the African Union and that leadership deserves a timely and constructiveresponse from New York.Many of those here will be aware that New Zealandis an energetic candidate for election to the SecurityCouncil for the term from 2015-2016. I can assure theAssembly that it will hear more from us on these topicsover the next two years. We are a small country witha big voice and an approach that is fair-minded andconstructive.In the past few days. the Assembly has heard fromboth Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas.We are now on notice that the issue of Palestinian statusin the United Nations will come before the Assemblyduring this session. We look forward to seeing the textof a draft resolution and to engaging in the consultationsthat have been signaled to us. I said earlier that NewZealanders are practical and constructive. They are alsofair-minded people; they expect to see their Governmentbring all of those attributes to the consideration of sucha resolution  and that we will surely do. Having saidthat  let me also be clear that we see such a resolutionas a very poor substitute for the direct discussions thatshould occur between two leaders who live half an hourdown the road from each other.In his address to the Assembly earlier in the week(see A/67/PV.12)  Prime Minister Netanyahu set outclearly the grave implications for the Middle East  andfor the global community more generally  of a nuclearbreakout in the region. Like other Member States  New Zealand believes Iran must be told to step back froma course that risks further dangerous escalation of thesituation. We hope the international community willstand firm in sending that sort of message. In return however  I suggest that it is fair for the internationalcommunity to make a request of Prime MinisterNetanyahu. And that is to put the settlements on hold  atthe very least while negotiations proceed  and to engagein the direct talks with his Palestinian counterpart thatrepresent the only basis for a durable solution to thisissue  and an essential step in removing the seeds ofwider conflict within the region.I would like to remind the Assembly that these arevery difficult times for Governments around the world.Budget economies have affected foreign ministries my own included. It is only fair that we should inturn ask this large institution to find economies andimprove working methods in order to deliver bettervalue for our taxpayers. Smaller countries  like NewZealand  depend more than most on good multilateralinstitutions. We need a United Nations that is modern efficient and able to meet changing needs. We all needa Security Council that is more responsive to the needsof the wider membership and more effective in dealingwith the significant challenges that we all confronttoday."
"133",5412,"OMN",67,2012,"﻿At theoutset  I would like to offer the President and hisfriendly country  the Republic of Serbia  my warmestcongratulations on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I wouldalso like to express my appreciation to his predecessor Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  from the brotherlyState of Qatar  for the exemplary way in which heconducted the work of the previous session.I would also like to take this opportunity to conveymy appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moonfor his role and efforts in improving the Organization’sworking mechanisms  and to wish him every successin his endeavours. The record of the United Nationsincludes numerous positive and tangible achievementsthat have helped to promote international peace andsecurity and reach a political consensus on manyregional and international issues.In our Middle East region  the Syrian crisiscontinues to be of great concern  owing to the great lossof life and property that it has caused and the instabilitythat it has produced in the region and the world as awhole. Despite the efforts of the United Nations andthe League of Arab States  the parties involved in theSyrian crisis have failed to reach a peaceful solutionthat could spare the lives of the Syrian people.We call on our brothers in Syria to renounceviolence  end hostilities and launch a political processthat will fulfil the aspirations and hopes of theSyrian people and preserve Syria’s security  stabilityand unity. At the same time  we call on the SecurityCouncil  the international body primarily responsiblefor the maintenance of international peace and security to reach consensus on a unified position on the Syriancrisis  without political disagreements and without biastowards any side  by way of starting a serious nationaldialogue between all political forces in Syria  with noexceptions. We believe that the principles and guidelinesfor a Syrian-led process of transition  as contained inthe final communiqué of the Action Group for Syria(S/2012/523  annex)  issued at its meeting in Geneva inmid-2012  could form the basis for a solution  if agreedon and accepted by all Syrian and international parties.The conflicting interests among some countriesand their disagreements on how to address the Syrianconflict no longer serve any purpose  because the timehas come to take collective action that can preservesecurity  stability and development for every countryin the Middle East  especially since the alternativewould be the spread of violence  killing  destructionand chaos. We believe that it is not in the world’s bestinterests to allow the Middle East to become anotherglobal f lashpoint.I would also like to take this opportunity to say thatmy country welcomes the appointment of Mr. LakhdarBrahimi as the Joint Special Representative of theUnited Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria.We hope that he can provide practical and concreteproposals to pull Syria out of the current cycle ofviolence and killing.We are aware of the complexities that arise in anydiscussion of the question of Palestine at sessions of theAssembly. We all know  however  that while the UnitedNations has explored every avenue and adopted manyresolutions and policies on the Palestinian question  thatissue continues to be a cause for concern and a sourceof unending threats and conflicts in the Middle Eastand beyond. We believe  therefore  that the role of theUnited Nations with regard to the question of Palestineshould change from one of managing the crisis to oneof seriously seeking a just  lasting and comprehensivepolitical solution that would take into account theinterests of both Palestinians and Israelis and lead tothe establishment of a State of Palestine  living side byside with the State of Israel. In that context  my countrysupports Palestine’s application for non-memberState observer status at the United Nations  hopingthat that will usher a new phase in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and one that could make a positivecontribution to settling the issue.The Somali people have long suffered from anabsence of security  stability and State institutionsand bodies; we therefore welcome the formation of thenew Somali Parliament and the election of Mr. HassanSheikh Mohamud as President of Somalia. We hopethat his Government will be able to achieve nationalreconciliation and establish security and stabilitythroughout Somalia.provide support and assistance  whether political economic or humanitarian  to the Somali people  weurge the Somali factions and parties from variouspolitical and tribal affiliations and organizations toreject violence  cease hostilities and place the higherinterest of the nation above all others. We believe thata national dialogue  involving all parties in the Somaliconflict  regardless of their ideological and politicaldifferences and inclinations  is essential and willhelp restore security  stability and nation-building inSomalia.We would like to commend the international effortsto combat piracy and the armed robbery of merchantvessels in the Indian Ocean  particularly in the ArabianSea. The Sultanate of Oman  which is located on theArabian Sea  reaffirms its continuing support forinternational efforts to eradicate the problem  and willcooperate with countries that have a naval presencein the area in order to protect international trade andnavigation.From the outset  the Sultanate of Oman hassupported the proposal to establish a zone free of nuclearweapons and all other weapons of mass destructionin the Middle East. In that regard  we welcome theReview Conference of Parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  scheduled to beheld in Finland at the end of this year. We hope it willbe able to officially declare the Middle East a zone freefrom nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction similar to other such zones that have been establishedelsewhere in the world.At a time when Muslims are trying to promote aculture of tolerance and coexistence  we note that thereare those who abuse their right to express themselvesby deliberately slandering monotheistic religions andprophets and messengers of God. My country condemnsthe video slandering the Prophet Muhammad — peacebe upon him — which clearly and deliberately sought tospread a culture of hatred against Muslims. Despite thegravity of the offence  we reject escalating the reactionto a level resulting in attacks against diplomaticmissions and representatives  such as those againstUnited States and other Western diplomatic missions.Against the backdrop of those events and similarincidents earlier  we believe that it is incumbent onthe United Nations to adopt international legislationthat would hold accountable those responsible for any deliberate abuse of and slander against the sanctity ofpeople’s beliefs  with a view to deterring others whomay attempt to spread hatred among people.The world today is facing a genuine threat of foodshortages  owing to the steady increase in the world’spopulation and the problems facing the global economy which have resulted in the famines currently plaguingmany parts of Africa  Asia and Latin America. Thereis no doubt that addressing that problem will requireus to undertake a practical study of alternatives thatcould alleviate the negative impacts of food shortages.Among the ideas we deem worthy of exploring isthe establishment of a global food reserve system todeal with food shortages  with food reserve centreslocated in various continents of the world and managedthrough an international fund specifically establishedto support the system. States  international institutionsand sovereign funds that have the capacity to contributeto the fund would also be allowed to do so. We are ofthe view that the Food and Agriculture Organizationof the United Nations  in the light of its expertise inthat field  could be the appropriate body to oversee thepreparation and implementation of such a study.We would like to take this opportunity to encourageindustrialized countries to increase their investmentin agricultural research and to utilize science andtechnology in their search for innovative solutionsaimed at increasing food production so as to keep pacewith the steady increase in the global demand for food.In conclusion  I would like to reiterate mycountry’s support for all international efforts to achievethe aspirations of peoples to a safer  more stable andprosperous world."
"134",5459,"PAK",67,2012,"﻿Before I begin my statement I want to express the strongest condemnation of therecent acts of incitement to hatred perpetrated againstthe faith of the billions of Muslims around the worldand our beloved Prophet Muhammad  peace be uponhim. Although we can never condone violence  theinternational community must not remain a silentobserver and should criminalize such acts  which destroythe peace of the world and endanger global security byabusing the freedom of expression. Pakistan asks thatthe United Nations immediately address this matter ofgreat alarm and concern and bridge the widening rift inorder to enable the comity of nations to be one again.I would like to congratulate the President onhis election to his important post and to convey ourappreciation to the previous President  His ExcellencyMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  from the brotherlystate of Qatar  who carried out his work with skill. Iwould also like to express our appreciation for thelaudable work of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Wegreatly appreciate his leadership in guiding the workof the Organization. It is a special privilege to be atthe General Assembly today  representing the brave andcourageous people of Pakistan.Globally  we face enormous challenges. But withcollective efforts and commitment we can provide ourpeople with a better future. We must work to end poverty.We must work to protect the planet and mitigate climatechange. We must ensure that all people have equalrights  and we must protect the weak and vulnerable.We must pursue justice and fairness for all. We mustpursue the peaceful settlement of international disputes.We must save our current and future generations fromthe horrors of war. I think of my own children and thegenerations of unborn children yet to come. They  andall the children of the world  deserve safety  stabilityand security. Those goals have guided me throughoutmy four years in office as President of Pakistan. Theyare the goals and principles about which I want to talktoday.Pakistan’s engagement with the United Nationslies at the heart of those goals. We are proud of goingabove and beyond the call of duty in fulfilling ourinternational responsibilities. Pakistan has consistentlybeen among the top United Nations peacekeeping troopcontributors for many years. Today  more than 10 000Pakistani troops proudly wear the Blue Helmet of theUnited Nations in the service of our brothers and sistersaround the world.Our election to the Security Council reflectsour commitment to world peace. It is also a vote ofconfidence in Pakistan on the part of the internationalcommunity.The United Nations represents our commonaspirations for peace and development. However  itneeds reform. The United Nations system must becomemore democratic and accountable  and reform shouldbe based on consensus and democratic principles.In the last several years  Pakistan has repeatedlysuffered natural calamities. The people of Pakistanappreciate the support of the United Nations and theinternational community in that connection.Being a democratic country  we believe thatthe legitimate aspirations of any people should beaccommodated peacefully and in a manner consistentwith the sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity ofStates. We support the rights of the Palestinian peopleand an independent Palestinian State. We also favourthe admission of Palestine to full membership of theUnited Nations.There are many questions that are asked ofPakistan these days. I am not here to answer questionsabout Pakistan. The people of Pakistan have alreadyanswered them. The politicians of Pakistan haveanswered them. The soldiers of Pakistan have answeredthem. We have lost more than 7 000 Pakistani soldiersand policemen  and more than 37 000 civilians. Wehave lost our Minister for Minority Affairs  ShahbazBhatti  and my friend Salmaan Taseer  Governor ofPunjab  our most populous province  to the actionsof extremists. And I need not remind my friends heretoday that I bear a personal scar. On 27 December 2007 knowing that her life was under threat from the mindsetthat she had warned the world against  Pakistan’s firstelected female leader  and my wife  Shaheed MohtarmaBenazir Bhutto  was martyred by the bullets and bombsof terrorists. Terrorism and extremism have destroyedhuman lives  torn the social fabric and devastated theeconomy. Our economy  our lives and our ability to livein the shadow of our Sufi saints and our freedom-lovingforefathers have been challenged.We have responded. Our soldiers have responded.So I am not here to answer questions about Pakistan.I am here to ask some questions on behalf of thePakistani people: on behalf of the two-year-old babywho was killed in the bombing at Lahore’s MoonMarket on 7 December 2009; on behalf of PervaizMasih  a Christian Pakistani who was killed with sixothers while trying to protect Muslim Pakistanis duringa bomb attack on Islamic University in Islamabad on20 October 2009; on behalf of Commandant SiffatGha-yoor of the Frontier Constabulary police force inPeshawar  who was martyred by militants on 4 August2010; on behalf of the traders and businessmen inPeshawar  Quetta  Lahore and Karachi and in thedozens of marketplaces that have been ravaged bymultiple bombings  over and over and over again; and perhaps most of all  on behalf of my three children whose mother  Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto  wasalso martyred by terrorists.For more than 30 years  our doors have been opento our Afghan brothers and sisters.For many years  we were left to fend for ourselvesand our Afghan guests.I remember the red carpet that was rolled out for allthe dictators in our country — dictators who promisedthe international community the moon — while Pakistanwas kept in the dark. Those dictators and their regimesare responsible for suffocating and throttling Pakistan Pakistan’s institutions and Pakistan’s democracy. Iremember the judicial execution of Pakistan’s firstelected leader  Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. I rememberthe jailing of Pakistan’s elected leaders.I remember the 12 years that I myself spent inprison  and I remember the billions provided by theinternational community to support those dictatorships.My country’s social fabric and its very character havebeen altered. Our condition today is a product ofdictatorship.No country and no people has suffered more in theepic struggle against terrorism than Pakistan. Dronestrikes and civilian casualties on our territory add to thecomplexity of our battle for hearts and minds throughthis epic struggle. To those who say that we have notdone enough  I say in all humility: please do not insultthe memory of our dead and the pain of our living. Donot ask of my people what no one has ever asked of anyother people. Do not demonize the innocent women andchildren of Pakistan  and please  stop this refrain to domore. The simplest question of all is: how much moresuffering can Pakistan endure?I am sure that the international community does notwant any suffering anywhere  least of all in Pakistan.We believe  in fact  that the international community isa partner. That is because it is in the common interestof all nations to work together.In Pakistan  I have helped bring about a majorstrategic shift in how we view working together. WithinPakistan  our democracy has brought about majorchanges. God willing  this will be the first civilianGovernment in Pakistan’s 66-year history to completeits full five-year term.In that time  Parliament has passed unprecedentedreforms. We have restored the consensus 1973Constitution.The National Assembly has enacted wide-rangingsocial reforms. We have established a NationalCommission on Women and a National Commissionon Human Rights. We have established  for the firsttime  a truly independent election commission  toensure free  fair and transparent elections. Our mediais free  uncensored and thriving. Our civil society isflourishing under the protection of democracy. We havecreated the first social safety net  through the women ofPakistan  for the weak and less privileged. Millions offamilies have benefitted. We have aided the poor and atthe same time empowered the women of our households.That safety net is called the Benazir Income SupportProgramme. These are the gifts of democracy. This isthe dream of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto.The growing regional pivot in Pakistan’s foreignpolicy is a symbol of our democratic policy-making. Inengaging with our region  we are changing the future.In China  our strategic partnership is growing fromstrength to strength. In Afghanistan  we have begun toengage and deepen our friendship with the entire rangeof the Afghan political spectrum.We believe that a sovereign  stable and secureAfghanistan is good for the Afghan people  and whatis good for the Afghan people is good for Pakistan.While our hearts and homes remain open to ourAfghan brothers  it is imperative that the internationalcommunity support the 3 million Afghan refugees inPakistan in their quest to return home with dignity. Abrighter Afghan future will be possible only when thequest for peace is Afghan-owned  Afghan-driven andAfghan-led.We respect and support the efforts of theGovernment of Afghanistan for reconciliation andpeace. Pakistan will support in every way possible anyprocess that reflects Afghan national consensus.Similarly  we approach our relations with Indiaon the basis of mutual trust. The contacts betweenour leadership are expanding. I was encouraged bymy discussions last month in Tehran with the PrimeMinister of India  whom I met with for the fifth timein four years.Our principled position on territorial disputesremains the bedrock of our foreign policy. We willcontinue to support the rights of the people of Jammuand Kashmir to peacefully choose their destiny inaccordance with the Security Council’s long-standingresolutions on this matter. Kashmir remains a symbol of the failures  rather than the strengths  of the UnitedNations system. We feel that a resolution of these issuescan be arrived at only in an environment of cooperation.By normalizing trade relations  we want to createa regional South Asian narrative. Such a narrative willprovide an environment that will mutually benefit thecountries of our region.Along this road  there are pitfalls. One of themis the tendency to respond to failure through blame.Pakistan does not blame others for the challenges itfaces. We believe that we should look for a win-winsolution. Regional cooperation and connectivity willbring us closer and bind us together. It will make usstakeholders in one another’s futures. Our hosting of aquadrilateral summit next month and our signing of theAfghan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement are proof ofthat commitment to regional connectivity.In Pakistan  the lesson we learned from the last 30years is that history cannot be changed  but the futurecan — to a future that is brighter  more prosperousand more secure  not only for Pakistanis but for all thepeoples of the region  and  indeed  the world.I must thank the member States of the EuropeanUnion (EU) for recognizing the value of trade toPakistan. We seek trade  rather than aid. By grantingtrade concessions to Pakistan  the EU has sent apositive message. Those concessions will help us revivethe economy and fight terrorism.As we embark on this ambitious transformativeexperience  we are aware that there are threats andpitfalls. One of them is the expanding illegal trade ofheroin. Despite the presence of international forces inAfghanistan  the size of the heroin trade has increasedby 3 000 per cent in the last decade. The heroin industryis eroding the social fabric of our society.Terrorist activities within our region and  indeed all over the world are funded and fuelled by theunrestricted production and sale of illegal drugs.Pakistan has pursued an ambitious agenda to controlthat menace. We are coordinating with our neighboursand will hold a conference later this year to develop aunified approach to stamping out the drug trade.My call upon this body  and especially those nationsrepresented here that are actively engaged in the region is: here  today  let us begin to work together.I have committed my presidency and my nation’sfuture to a paradigm shift  a permanent democraticfuture for Pakistan. It has not been easy  but nothingworth fighting for is. We long ago stopped thinkingof doing what is easy. Instead  we have committedourselves to doing what is right. In that regard  I recallthe powerful words of my beloved martyred wife andmy leader  Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto  whenshe appeared before this body 16 years ago.Her words ring out and guide us into a new future.She said in 1996 “I dream of a third millennium in which thegap between rich and poor evaporates; in whichilliteracy  hunger  malnutrition and disease areat long last conquered; in which every child isplanned  wanted  nurtured and supported; and inwhich the birth of a girl is welcomed with the samejoy as that of a boy. I dream of a millennium oftolerance and pluralism  in which people respect other people  nations respect other nations  andreligions respect other religions.“That is the third millennium I see for mycountry and others”. (A/51/PV.20  p.4)We have made some progress towards achievingthose goals. But so much remains to be done. In hermemory and in the name of God Almighty  Pakistancommits to that path again today.May peace be upon all countries and their people."
"135",5502,"PAN",67,2012,"﻿I congratulate the President on his election to presideover this session of the General Assembly. I respectfullyoffer him the support of the Panamanian delegationduring his tenure. We welcome his proposal to focusthis high level debate on the theme “Bringing aboutadjustment or settlement of international disputes orsituations by peaceful means”. That theme is basedon Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter  whichaddresses the peaceful settlement of disputes.Since its establishment  the United Nationshas played an essential role in the prevention and resolution of international conflicts. The commitmentof the United Nations continues to be to protect futuregenerations from the scourge of war and to ensure thatpeace and respect among nations are the permanentconditions for global coexistence.International conflicts have always been and willremain a challenge for the international communityand a grave threat to freedom and the right to enjoy apeaceful coexistence among all the nations and peoplesof the world. That is why all the countries of the worldhave the responsibility to ensure the maintenance ofinternational peace and security.The Panamanian people possess the strongconviction and the commitment to use all existingpeaceful means to solve international conflicts on thebasis of the United Nations Charter and internationallaw. Those are simple truths that are easily forgotten but which we all must defend. They are the basiccondition for our existence in full peace  freedom andindependence.Panama advocates for the solution of all internationalconflicts by peaceful means. We support the promotionand defence of multilateralism and of all multilateralorganizations as ideal frameworks for solving  throughdialogue and cooperation  the problems that afflicthumankind so that we may thereby maintain peace andinternational peace and security.The search for mediation and dialogue hasbeen the stance that Panama has historically alwaysmaintained with regard to the conflicts that disturbpeace and international political stability. That searchmust include legitimate representatives of the partiesin conflict  who must make efforts to recognize therights of their counterparts and comply with their ownobligations  with sincerity and a generous spirit  toreach just and permanent solutions.For that reason  the Government of the Republicof Panama considers that Palestine has the right to berecognized as a nation-State. However  it must resolveits differences with its neighbour  Israel  recognizingthat Israel has the right to a peaceful and safe existencewithin its national territory — a right that has alreadybeen recognized historically and legally by theinternational community.Panama expresses its concern at the escalatingviolence that has been developing in the Middle Eastand calls upon the international community to propose and attempt to enforce plans and solutions orientedtowards peace  contributing to ending violent acts thataffect the most vulnerable populations.The Government of the Republic of Panamaexpresses is concerned about the severe crisis that hasaffected the fraternal Syrian Arab Republic for overa year. We therefore respectfully remind all partiesinvolved that peaceably resolving conflicts is the onlymeans acceptable to the community of nations andpeoples of the world for achieving a just and permanentsolution.The Panamanian people deeply deplore themurder of His Excellecy Mr. J. Christopher Stevens Ambassador of the United States of America to Libya as well as the Foreign Service personnel who werevictims of the nefarious attack against the AmericanConsulate in Benghazi. Our prayers and thoughts arewith their families. Panama energetically condemnssuch actions  which cause sorrow and grief to a friendlynation and which violate the fundamental principles ofinternational law  particularly the Charter of the UnitedNations and the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic andConsular Relations.The recent attacks on the diplomatic missions ofthe United States  Germany  the United Kingdom Saudi Arabia  Turkey  Israel and France are absolutelyunjustifiable. We reiterate that host States have anobligation to ensure the principle of the inviolability ofthe diplomatic and consular missions of the world andto safeguard international peace and security  as theyare the source of communication and understanding.We call loudly and clearly for tolerance  dialogue andpeaceful coexistence The Republic of Panama is convinced that allinternational conflicts should be settled by peacefulmeans  using the instruments and mechanisms thathave been created for those purposes. For that reason Panama formally joined the Group of Friends ofMediation  demonstrating its historic commitment tothe peaceful solution of conflicts  which is the centraltopic of this debate at the current session of the GeneralAssembly.As a firm believer that dialogue is a powerful toolfor facilitating peace and the international politicalstability so necessary to ensure economic and socialdevelopment for our peoples  Panama wishes to reiterateits call  as it has done on other occasions  to support theChinese people in Taiwan so that they may have greater  participation as observers in international forums organizations and initiatives and may cooperate andsupport the development and maintenance of peaceboth in Asia and other parts of the world.Panama is a multicultural country where peopleof diverse ethnicities  cultures and religions coexistin peace and harmony and which has historicallymaintained friendly relations with States of differentpolitical and ideological orientations. I am speakingof a demilitarized country  one that by virtue of itsdomestic law adheres to the doctrine of human securityand that possesses a canal that is neutral. In addition Panama has tradition and experience as a participantin efforts for the peaceful solution of internationalcontroversies. Those conditions are our guarantee andasset in advocating for a world that is peaceful andrespectful of international law.Panama continues to be committed tomultilateralism  dialogue and negotiation among Statesas the only way to seek and achieve just solutions inglobal affairs. As a part of this commitment  in 2013 wewill host a series of important international meetings atthe global and regional levels.Panama will welcome the International Congressof the Spanish Language  an event of a universalcharacter and a forum for the ref lection on the statusof the Spanish tongue  which shapes our identity asa nation and unites the peoples of Hispanic America.In 2013  Panama will also host the Conference of theStates Parties to the United Nations Convention againstCorruption. That demonstrates that the fight againstcorruption and the promotion of transparency areessential elements of the modern rule of law to whichmy Government is fully committed.We will also host the fifty-fourth annual meetingof the Board of Governors of the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank  at which ministers of economy andfinance  central bank presidents and representatives ofvarious multilateral financial institutions will discusstopics related to their financial appointments.In addition  we will host the AmericasCompetitiveness Forum  which will address the issueof the development of the region’s competitivenessagenda on the basis of the 10 general competitivenessprinciples of the Americas.We will also host the Ibero-American summit which will bring together the 22 States of LatinAmerica and those of the Iberian peninsula. Thatsummit represents an effort  involving dialogue andcooperation  to foster the development of our countriesby opening up new markets and new opportunitiesfor trade and cooperation with the peoples and thecountries of Europe.The international meetings set to take place in 2013will be held in the context of the celebration of a historicevent that marks Panamians to this day. I note thattoday is the anniversary of that event — the discoveryof a passage  through our country  to the Pacific Ocean.Today — 25 September — marks almost 500 years sincethe so-called discovery of the South Sea  later known asthe Pacific Ocean  a feat that changed the geography ofworld navigation and the history of humanity.With the discovery of a passage from the Atlanticto the Pacific  we saw the beginning of a process ofeconomic and demographic globalization around theworld. From that moment on  Panama began to playan important role in global navigation and trade thatcontinues today. Since then  Panama has become theprimary hub of the Americas. Indeed  it is one of themost important telecommunications and navigationroutes in the world.We continue to make good progress in the expansionof the Panama Canal and Tocumen internationalairport  which will become the largest airport in LatinAmerica. Both of those projects will make it possibleto further develop the Panama Canal route and willhave a tremendous impact on international trade andon tourism.The feat accomplished by Vasco Núñez de Balboaon 25 September 1513 helped to forge Panama’scharacter as a country dedicated to the global transit ofgoods  and  with the construction of the Canal  it wasconsolidated as the hub of worldwide maritime trade.There is no magic formula for the resolution ofconflicts. Nor do the global conditions exist for thecomplete fulfilment of Chapter VI of the Charter of theUnited Nations  on the peaceful settlement of disputes.The world still has some important steps to take inorder to ensure that dialogue is always the means ofadjudicating differences. There must be a commitmentat the State level for meeting that goal.One of the major steps forward we must take isin the area of education. Education not only sets usfree: it makes us free thinkers. It helps us understand and respect different ideas. It provides us with anopportunity to be dreamers. Through education we canlearn to value cultures that might seem strange to us;being different does not make us enemies. But in orderto understand this in an all-encompassing way  we needa good and objective education.Access to information through the Internet andsocial networks is an indispensable tool to raise thelevel of knowledge and discernment among all peoples.While I advocate for the responsible use of thosetools  I think that we have to go further. I believe thatwe must also address the issues of equality and self-esteem  which help distance us from resentment andviolence. Once again  education is the answer.Such intangible wealth leads us to honestcompetition. The substitution of competition forviolence can be achieved only through a modernizationprocess in which our principles are preserved. A goodeducation is one that is built upon a foundation of ethicsand values. Money is not the best type of assistancewe can give our children. The best assistance we cangive them is an education that is divorced from politics passions and paradigms. That is the only way to achieveexcellence.We must focus our educational efforts on youngchildren. Good  balanced primary education is the baseof a solid pyramid. Educating our children properlytoday is the best guarantee of a better future for alltomorrow.Without education  there is no possibility ofdialogue and vice versa. That is the reason for myGovernment’s focus on the well-being of Panamanianchildren through the improvement of our schoolsand classrooms; the creation of a free nationalInternet network; the provision of free computers; theimplementation of a universal scholarship  without anydistinction on the basis of class or politics; and  finally the transformation of our educational curriculum.However  access to information must be providedto children in keeping with their developmental stage respecting the fact that they are children and requiringthat they do the best they can for their age. To respectchildren is to harvest peace.As I stated at the recent Connect Americas Summit held in our country in July  we must continue to harnessour respective wills to reduce the digital divide and tomaximize Internet access around the world. Every step in that direction will be key to the achievement of theMillennium Development Goals by 2015.Nevertheless  I remain uneasy about the risksposed by the misuse of cyberspace for boys  girls andadolescents.Our job will not be finished if we do not assume theresponsibility of facing up to one of the most significantethical and moral challenges of our time: the protectionof children and young people from the threat posed tothem by the misuse of cyberspace.For that reason  we support the initiative promotedby the International Telecommunications Union in thatrespect. I also invite all States represented here to sharetheir experiences in order to establish and harmonize  onthe basis of international telecommunications criteria norms that will allow us to ensure that minors are nolonger exposed to the risks and dangers disseminatedthrough cyberspace. That should in no way beinterpreted as a means of limiting or distorting freedomof expression or the universal use of the Internet  whichwe defend firmly and with great conviction.Panama is preparing draft legislation in orderto establish minimum regulations geared towardsprotecting our children and adolescents from thedangerous content spread through the Internet andother electronic media. We are currently workingto pass that legislation based on consensus with allof Panamanian society. We must become allies andclose ranks against Internet sites that promote childpornography and pornography in general  obscene andlascivious conduct  and physical  sexual and emotionalviolence.Let us combine efforts and take concerted actionagainst sites that facilitate the making of weapons orexplosives  that incite illegal drug use  and that promoteracism  xenophobia or any other type of discriminationthat runs contrary to human dignity.Let us take measures against those who dedicatethemselves to making public  using and disseminatingminors’ personal information and to making threats ofall kinds against our boys  girls and adolescents. Let usharness information and communications technologyfor the benefit of development and to ensure a betterquality of life for our children  and let us not allow thebenefits of accessing the Internet to put them at risk.The Government of the Republic of Panamasupports the international community and the United Nations through two large-scale projects. The first isthe United Nations Regional Centre for Latin Americaand the Caribbean in Panama  which will host the 16United Nations subregional offices already establishedin our country. That Centre will contribute to greatercoordination and synergy within the United Nationssystem  thereby contributing to its operational process as outlined in the report of the High-level Pannel onUnited Nations System-wide Coherence  “Delivering asOne” (see A/61/583). We invite friendly nations who arecommitted to those reforms to financially contribute tothat project  which will soon be open to internationalbidding. The other project is the regional humanitarianassistance logistics centre for the Americas for thedelivery of humanitarian aid in the event of disasters inthe region. Panama is committed to being a responsiblehumanitarian actor in the region  and we place ouradvantages as an international logistical platform at thedisposal of the international community.Panama’s economic growth is widely recognizedthroughout our region. From 2012 to 2013  Panamamoved up nine places — from 49 to 40 — in the GlobalCompetitiveness Index  which represents our biggestjump in that ranking since 2005  when our countrybegan to be monitored by the World Economic Forum.Such an increase indicates we are doing things well.Panama’s economic growth is the greatest inLatin America. It is based on free market principles is respectful of the environment  social standards andfree enterprise initiatives  and is strongly committedto social inclusion. That has made it possible for us tosignificantly reduce unemployment in our country to4.6 per cent and to reduce poverty  including extremepoverty  from 33.4 per cent to 25.8 in just three years without compromising the riches of our environment.At the same time  our economic growth allows us toallocate resources to confront the threats of climatechange  which is affecting and will continue to affectlarge and small nations without regard for their levelof development. We all need to be more responsible inthat regard.Panama will continue to advocate for theinternational community to work on an institutional andmultilateral structure that would reinforce the rights ofall people to a planet with an environment suitable forthe development of a healthful and peaceful life. Wewill insist on a new high-level discussion forum onthe protection of the environment in the context of theGeneral Assembly.Finally  Panama reaffirms that it is a country thatfavours peaceful and respectful coexistence amongall the peoples and Governments of the world. WePanamanians believe that humankind will always becapable of fighting for that cause  united by the hopethat we can all build a better tomorrow. There is stilltime to share  as brothers  in the feast of existence on apeaceful planet that truly belongs to all."
"136",5549,"PER",67,2012,"﻿At the outset  on behalf of President OllantaHumala Tasso and the Government and people of Peru I wish to congratulate the President of the GeneralAssembly on his election to lead this session  duringwhich we are very honoured to support him as one ofthe Vice-Presidents. I would also like to congratulatehim on his initiative to make the pacific settlement ofdisputes the central topic of our debate. The pacificsettlement of disputes is the fundamental way toeradicate the scourge of war  which  in turn  is themain objective of the Organization and its Charter. Thecommitment not to resort to the threat or use of forceis the cornerstone of international peace and security.Peru reaffi rms its ongoing and resolute commitmentto the principles that inspired the birth of the United Nations: multilateralism  the pursuit of internationalpeace and security  solidarity and cooperation. Inthat context  Peru solemnly affirms its continuingcommitment to the pacific settlement of disputes.In that task  the International Court of Justice  asthe main judicial organ of the United Nations system plays a fundamental and  fortunately  increasing role in particular in Latin America. Peru reaffirms its fullrespect for the work of the Court and calls on States toturn to it to resolve their differences and to respect andcomply with its decisions  pursuant to Chapter XIV ofthe United Nations Charter.The 123 disputes that had been submitted to theCourt as at December 2011 are proof of the fact thatthe international community is actively committed tothe pacific settlement of disputes  to diplomacy andnot to war. Recourse to the Court  far from being anunfriendly act  is an eloquent testimony to our desirefor peace.We reiterate our faith in multilateralism anddeplore the existence of situations to which  to date  ourOrganization has not been able to find solutions. Thelatest and most painful one of these  due to the high tollit is taking in human lives  is the crisis in Syria. Perucondemns the use of force and violence in that country and calls once again on all parties to the conflict toimmediately cease hostilities and to initiate a genuineprocess of dialogue and peacemaking  in the frameworkof respect for the independence and sovereignty of thatcountry and for the fundamental rights and freedomsof its citizens.We support the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General and the Arab League to find a negotiated andpeaceful solution to the conflict. We would encouragethe mission of the Joint Special Representative  LakhdarBrahimi  to continue its efforts.However  that is not the only outstanding issue. Perudeems regrettable the fact that in more than 60 yearsour Organization has not been able to find a solutionto the legitimate demand of the Palestinian people toestablish an independent State and to live in peacewithin secure and internationally recognized borders.Peru recognizes the Palestinian State  has establisheddiplomatic relations with it and  based on Peru’shistorical position since 1947 and on international law supports its admission as a full Member of the UnitedNations  without detriment to Israel’s right to its ownsecurity. Peru also condemns once again the unfair illegitimate and illegal economic  financial andcommercial blockade imposed against Cuba  to whichthe Organization has been unable to put an end despitethe countless condemnations from the Assembly.We also regret that it has not yet been possibleto find a solution to the nearly 200-year-old disputebetween Argentina and the United Kingdom regardingthe Malvinas Islands. We call upon the parties onceagain to initiate a dialogue leading to a negotiatedsolution.To overcome these and other shortcomings anddeficiencies of the current international order  it isurgent to adopt measures within our own Organization the most urgent one probably being a reform of theSecurity Council aimed at making it a more efficient transparent  democratic and representative forum. TheUnited Nations must reflect the realities of the twenty-first century and update the current architecture  whichremains best suited to the post-war world of 1945. Thecurrent scenario requires that developing countries takegreater responsibility for preserving peace and security.We deplore the limited progress made in negotiations onthis issue. We consider that the time is ripe to relaunchthe reform process  and we call upon Member Statesto spare no effort in bringing this process to a speedyconclusion.As a concrete sign of Peru’s contribution tostrengthening the rule of law  it was my pleasure todeposit yesterday the instruments of ratification ofthe Convention for the Protection of All Persons fromEnforced Disappearance and the Convention on ClusterMunitions  as well as the amendments to the MontrealProtocol regarding ozone-depleting substances. We callon all countries to accede to these instruments  whichare aimed at protecting the environment  ensuringrespect for human rights and fighting against allforms of impunity. It is a moral duty to ensure that theperpetrators of serious crimes against humanity areduly tried and punished.The rule of law also requires more inclusivesocieties. Civil  political and social citizenship mustencompass everyone equally. Accordingly  Peru hasincorporated into its national legislation the provisionsof Convention 169 of the International LabourOrganization. Since Peru is the first country to adoptthese measures  its indigenous peoples will be able tofully exercise their rights and ensure that all investors have obtained the requisite social licence  within theframework of State powers.In spite of all of those efforts  new and diversethreats to the rule of law have emerged. Transnationalorganized crime  funded mainly by drug trafficking today constitutes the main threat to democratic societies.The magnitude of this problem requires  more than everbefore  combined efforts with an integrated vision ofshared responsibility at the global level.It is for that reason that this past June Peru hostedthe International Conference of Ministers of ForeignAffairs and Heads of Specialized National Agenciesagainst the World Drug Problem  in an attempt to resumea political dialogue that had been interrupted for nearly20 years. That valuable opportunity proved to us thatamid our diversity there are many more convergencesthan discrepancies  and that the will exists to intensifycooperation in this area.We are confident that this first step will be furthercomplemented by new initiatives that will guaranteegreater exchange of information  a better allocationof resources  and better results in reducing the supplyand demand of narcotic drugs as well as in the field ofalternative development  a topic that will be addressednext November at an international conference to behosted by Peru.That Peruvian initiative on the fight againstdrugs is not the only ref lection of our commitmentto multilateralism and integration. Since June  Peruhas held the presidency pro tempore of the Union ofSouth American Nations (UNASUR). We want to seedemocracy consolidated throughout South America.Many lives have been lost during the long journeytowards consolidating democracy in our region. For thatreason  we will not be deterred by any circumstancethat may threaten that undertaking.In our capacity as President Pro Tempore ofUNASUR  we reiterate that democracy will remain anessential requirement for integration and cooperationin South America. We also hope that South Americawill become a zone of peace  without exclusions. Itis already a nuclear-weapon-free zone  and we willwork tirelessly so that it can soon be a zone free ofanti-personnel mines. The money currently spent onarms must be redirected towards development andovercoming poverty and inequality.Peru is peace-loving country and a staunch defenderof disarmament. At the international level  we are party to the main disarmament and non-proliferationtreaties. Furthermore  Peru hosts the headquartersof the Regional Centre for Peace  Disarmament andDevelopment in Latin America and the Caribbean.We promote confidence-building measures withneighbouring countries  especially measures aimed atconventional disarmament to favour the developmentof our peoples. In that context  we cannot but welcomewith enthusiasm and high expectations the efforts madeby the Government of President Santos Calderón ofColombia to open the path of dialogue in order to endlong years of violence  as justly claimed by the peopleof Colombia. Peru expresses its best wishes for thesuccess of that initiative.From the South American perspective  we alsoaspire to build bridges with all the regions of the world.In such a spirit  Peru will in a few days welcome headsof State and Government of South American and Arabcountries to the third Summit of South American andArab Countries. The Summit has become an importantinstrument in bringing the two regions closer togetherand  through it  its member countries have opened achannel for dialogue and political understanding atthe highest level. That will afford us the opportunityto develop common interests in areas such as trade investment and culture  all for the benefit of our peoples.Thanks to appropriate macroeconomic policies Peru has continued to grow  reaching a growth rate in2011 of 6.92 per cent and a 5.7 per cent average rateover the past 10 years. Despite those good results  widesectors of the population do not fully participate in thebenefits of economic growth. Hence  it is time to ensuregrowth with social inclusion  as President OllantaHumala Tasso has pointed out since the beginning ofhis Administration. The new vision that Peru promotesis oriented towards further economic growth anddemocratic stability as it expands and maximizessocial well-being and harmonizes productive activitieswith environmental preservation. In Peru’s view starting with the Rio+20 Conference on SustainableDevelopment  the establishment of the post-2015development agenda must achieve a convergence of theprocesses of the Millennium Development Goals withthe processes of the sustainable development goals.Peru’s commitment to the United Nations islong-standing and deep. Allow me to conclude byhonouring here to three prominent Peruvian diplomatswho have held the highest responsibilities within theOrganization — Ambassador Javier Pérez de Cuellar  Secretary-General from 1982 to 1991; AmbassadorVictor Andrés Belaúnde  President of the GeneralAssembly at its fourteenth session  from 1959 to 1960;and Ambassador José Luis Bustamante y Rivero President of the International Court of Justice from1967 to 1969. The recognition and responsibilitiesthat those individuals received from the internationalcommunity show that Peru has always been committedto peace and to the observance of international law. Iam pleased to see the Permanent Representative of Perupresiding over the debate this evening.As a co-founder of some of the main regionalforums  such as the Andean Community  the Unionof South American Nations and the Community ofLatin American and Caribbean States  Peru has alwaysbeen a standard-bearer for integration and for positive respectful relations with all countries of the worldand  in particular  with the countries of our region andneighbouring countries. As a basis of that policy  Peruhas always trusted — and will continue to place itstrust — in the strength and primacy of internationallaw and in the peaceful settlement of disputes. It iswith that conviction that the Government of PresidentOllanta Humala Tasso reiterates its staunch adherenceto the purposes and principles of the United Nations."
"137",5596,"PHL",67,2012,"﻿Allow me tocongratulate the President on his election and to offerthe steadfast support of my country for his term.Each year we renew our commitment to our UnitedNations and to the Charter that enshrines  in the plainestof language  our hopes and aspirations for a progressive peaceful and secure world. Our Organization and ourCharter have survived and thrived through dark timesand great adversity. The letter and spirit of the Charterremain alive and vibrant in a constantly changing world.Our work continues to be important  even in the face ofdoubts about the relevance of multilateral institutions.All that was possible because at the heart of ourdetermination to build peace has been our commitmentto the rule of law. Keeping faith in the law allows usto treat each other fairly and in the spirit of sovereignequality. It provides the rules that enable nations torelate to one another and work together. It reducesarbitrariness and unilateralism. Fidelity to the rule of law allows us not only the means to resolve differencesbut also the substance on which to build betterunderstanding.Our advocacy for the rule of law not only is bornof our experience and insights as a founding Memberof the United Nations and an active participant ininternational affairs  but also is deeply rooted in ourexperience as a nation. Our freedom was hard-won.Our democracy was achieved only after decades ofdictatorship. Our governance was sullied by corruptionand patronage in previous years.Our President  Benigno S. Aquino III  has placedthe rule of law at the centre of his governance. As aresult  the culture of impunity has been neutralized our economy is on the upswing and our people’s rightsand freedoms are assured.Among the gravest threats that continue to face ustoday is the deadly testament of man’s ability to destroyhis fellow man. The full force of the rule of law must bebrought to bear to prevent the proliferation of nuclearweapons  to promote nuclear disarmament and to endthe f low of illicit weapons. The Philippines is proudto have presided over the 2010 Review Conferenceof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons. The historic adoption of the 64action points strengthened the legal regime of theTreaty.We also support nuclear-weapon-free zones including the Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-FreeZone created by the Association of Southeast AsianNations. It is essential that such a zone be created for the volatile Middle East  as envisaged by the 2010Review Conference. The Philippines commends theStates of the region  the depository States of the 1995resolution 50/78  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon andthe Government of Finland for setting the stage forthe 2012 Conference that will pursue that most urgentobjective.The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyis another critical pillar of global disarmament andnon-proliferation. The Philippines commends Indonesiafor being the latest annex 2 State to ratify the Treaty and it reiterates its call to the remaining eight annex2 States to accede at the soonest possible time. OtherStates not included in annex 2  but not parties to theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  must do thesame to ensure the universality of the Treaty.We must also actively pursue respect for the law ofpeace and humanitarian law in the numerous regionalconflicts that affect the lives  safety and well-being ofmillions of people around the world. Towards that end peacekeeping is the crucial tool by which the Charter’smandate is carried out. Despite its limited resources the Philippines is doing its part in that important task.We are currently a major contributor to United Nationspeacekeeping missions. We call on others to also doall that they can. And we support innovative efforts tohelp embattled communities  including proposals onpossible unarmed peacekeeping that would expand thecivilian component of our endeavours.The Philippines also recognizes the important roleof women in the promotion of peace and continues todeploy more female peacekeepers to peacekeepingmissions. We aim to attain and surpass the 10 percent deployment target of women in country troopcontingents and 20 per cent for police deployments.With a tenth of the population of our country inforeign lands  there is a very real and human dimensionto our quest to strengthen the rule of law. To furthergalvanize international dialogue and cooperation  thePhilippines has been among the principal advocates fordeveloping norms of international law that will protectnot only our overseas Filipinos but all migrants. Humantrafficking is a crime of such magnitude that it cannotbe dealt with by a single nation or even by a group ofnations. The international community as a whole muststand together against that scourge. For that reason  thePhilippines became a founding member of the Groupof Friends United against Human Trafficking  and weare the main sponsor of the biennial General Assemblyresolution on trafficking in women and girls.In pursuit of that objective  we call on all MemberStates to implement the Global Plan of Action againstTrafficking in Persons and to ratify and enforce humanrights instruments such as the Palermo Protocol andthe International Convention on the Protection of theRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of TheirFamilies.Many of my country’s overseas Filipinos are foundon merchant ships. Filipinos form the bulk of seafarers.Many have fallen victim to pirates. Maritime piracycontinues to be a menace to the entire world. A full 80 percent of world trade travels by sea — almost six billiontons of cargo  moved by some 93 000 merchant vessels manned by 1.25 million seafarers. The business andhuman costs of piracy cannot be overstated. We supportbilateral  multilateral  regional and interregional effortsto address the impact of piracy  including measures toimprove the welfare of affected seafarers.The Philippine Constitution values the dignity ofevery human person and guarantees full respect for allhuman rights. Our National Human Rights Action Plan2009-2014 aims to mainstream human rights standardsinto all parts of the national Government and nationallife. The Plan fully respects our obligations under theeight major international human rights treaties.As a founding and current member of the HumanRights Council  the Philippines works with the othermembers of the Council to safeguard the humanrights of vulnerable groups  such as migrants  women children  young people  the elderly  indigenous peoplesand persons with disabilities. The Philippines hasactively contributed to initiatives on human rights extreme poverty  human rights education  combatingtrafficking in persons  especially women and children and climate change.The Philippines was one of the first nations tosubmit to the universal periodic review process ofthe Human Rights Council. Last month  the Counciladopted by consensus our second report under thatreview mechanism.The noble vision of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights and of many other profound declarationsis far from being realized for the poor  the deprived the oppressed and the marginalized. The recent globalfinancial and economic crises have left such vulnerable sectors of our societies in even greater danger. ThePhilippine Government therefore strongly supportsmeasures for the empowerment of those disadvantagedand endangered groups and strongly advocates policiesthat aim to raise their participation and integration insociety.For that reason  it is important to achieve theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to planfor the post-MDG period  after 2015. Accordingly the Philippines  together with Tanzania  initiatedresolution 66/124  entitled “High-level Meeting of theGeneral Assembly on the realization of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals and other internationally agreeddevelopment goals for persons with disabilities”. The2013 High-level Meeting seeks the inclusiveness of thedisabled  a cause to which all should rally.We are instituting measures to enhance the roleand the status of women and are strengthening theirprotection through the Philippine Commission onWomen  whose foundation predates the Convention onthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination againstWomen  through the key legislation of the Magna Cartaof Women and through the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development 1995-2015.Migration remains an unheralded andunderappreciated dimension of globalization today. Yetthe reality is that hundreds of millions live and workoutside their native lands  providing benefits to boththeir host nations and their countries of origin. TheGlobal Forum on Migration and Development  whichthe Philippines chaired in 2008  allows us to share ourpractical experiences in migration management and inprotecting the rights and welfare of all migrants. Welook forward to a successful outcome of the Forumsummit in Port Louis  Mauritius  in November.Earlier this year  the Philippines was pleased toratify two key international instruments that affectmigrants everywhere  namely  the Maritime LabourConvention and the Convention concerning DecentWork for Domestic Workers. Our ratification bringsthose two agreements into force next year.As a further indication of our commitment toprotecting the rights of migrants  the Philippineswill co-host a regional meeting of the Global Forumon Migration and Development  under the title“International Migrant Domestic Care Workers at theInterface of Migration and Development”  in Manilalater this month  with the support of UN-Women  the International Labour Organization and the InternationalOrganization for Migration.The rule of law is an instrument of justice anddevelopment. Yet the continuing global economicchallenges and financial instability make it even moreimportant that we focus on ensuring that the rule oflaw gives everyone their due. Poverty  hunger  poorhealth and education and a deteriorating environmentare threats to all and require nothing less than ourconcerted and collective response.In all development efforts  we must respect theprinciples and norms of sustainability that are crucialto the continued health of the Earth and of our peoples.Consequently  the Philippines will further integratekey ideas from the United Nations Conference onSustainable Development into the review of its medium-term development plan  even as we continue to pursuethe attainment of the Millennium Development Goalsby 2015.For many developing countries such as thePhilippines  food security remains a crucial issue.Recent events have shown that the capacity tosource affordable food can affect millions of people sometimes even to the extent of their sheer survival. Weexpress our appreciation to the General Assembly forthe adoption of resolution 66/222  declaring 2014 theInternational Year of Family Farming.As a country particularly prone to natural disasters including those wrought by climate change  we valuethe work being done in advancing the management ofnatural disaster risk reduction. Global and regionalcooperation through partnerships is the best wayto strengthen the international humanitarian andemergency response system.Natural disasters plague mankind. The forces ofnature are difficult to contain. That should not be thecase in humankind’s quest for peace. While naturaldisasters are impossible to prevent  the same is not trueof war and conflict.The United Nations was created to protect theweak from the strong  to provide for the equality ofall sovereign States and to enshrine the rule of lawas the governing principle in regulating internationaldisputes.The Philippines is therefore steadfast inpromoting the peaceful settlement of disputes througha rules-based approach. We stand firmly behind theefforts of the United Nations to promote the rule of lawand mediation. In 1982  we adopted the Manila Declaration onthe Peaceful Settlement of Disputes. This year marksits thirtieth anniversary. The principles and processesset out in the Manila Declaration remain applicable tothis day and are a stark reminder that we have yet toovercome the barriers that divide countries and peoplesthroughout the planet. For that reason  we share thePresident’s view that “Bringing about the adjustmentor settlement of international disputes or situationsby peaceful means” is essential to the future peace progress and prosperity of all nations.Furthermore  from the perspective of the rule of law and given the maritime disputes that have intensifiedin the Asian region  the United Nations Convention onthe Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) has never been morerelevant than it is today. All States must respect theirobligations to settle their maritime disputes by peacefulmeans under UNCLOS  without the threat or use offorce. A rules-based approach under UNCLOS canpeacefully resolve the Asian maritime disputes.Today  my country faces its most seriouschallenge — a challenge to the security of its maritimedomain and the integrity of its national territory  as wellas its effective protection of its marine environment.To address this challenge and to arrive at a durableresolution  we must rely on the rule of law and not theforce of arms. We must rely on the body of rules thatstate that disputes must be resolved peacefully. We mustrely on the norms and rules enshrined in UNCLOS. Wetherefore rely on our friends and allies and all thosewho believe in the peaceful and fair management of theseas and oceans to uphold the rule of law and UNCLOS.We will endeavour to elicit a more proactive approachfrom the General Assembly.We often hear the quote that “we are a country oflaws and not of men”. I shall modify it to say that “weare a community of nations and not of hegemons”. Let usmake this a reality. Let us all  without exception  respectthe international legal framework to utilize institutionsand adhere to commitments in treaties and conventions.For in so doing  we create global norms that will serveour nations in good stead today and in the future  andwe will preserve the one great institution that we havecharged with promoting peace and prosperity in ourworld  our United Nations. If we achieve this  ratherthan being forced to accept that might is right  we willinstead demonstrate that right is might."
"138",5615,"PLW",67,2012,"﻿This year’s general debate beganwith a Declaration by world leaders that our collectiveresponse to all challenges must be guided by the ruleof law (resolution 67/1). Palau is very proud to join inthat Declaration  as our national story is inextricablylinked with the international rule of law. Not longago  Palau emerged as the last United Nations TrustTerritory  granted independence after more than 100years and four successive colonial administrations. Ourunique road to freedom left us with a lasting legacy: astrong partnership with the United States of Americaand a constitution that guarantees the Palauan peoplethe rights and freedoms enshrined in the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights.Through independence  we have preserved ourheritage  our culture and our environment. Thatpreservation was marked this year by UNESCO’sdesignation of the Rock Islands of Palau as 2012’s onlynatural and cultural world heritage site. And  just lastyear  the United Nations Development Programmeranked Palau forty-ninth in the world in its HumanDevelopment Index  a composite measure of lifeexpectancy  health  educational attainment and livingstandards. We are very proud of that ranking for thissmall  new country. It is a tribute to Palau’s success.Having gained so much  Palau has worked to giveback to the international community and to make theworld a better place. Palau proudly deployed officers aspeacekeepers in Timor-Leste and the Solomon Islands and continues to do so today in Darfur.Upon first taking its United Nations seat  Palaufocused its energies on the odious practice of deep-seabottom trawling. And though it has taken some timeand considerable buy-in from others  the two consensusresolutions 61/105 and 66/68 show that we can helpprotect vulnerable deep-sea marine ecosystems andbiodiversity on a global scale.In 2009  from this rostrum  Palau’s President Johnson Toribiong  launched the first volley in an effortto save the world’s dwindling shark populations. Hedeclared the world’s first shark sanctuary in his generaldebate address. The ocean’s vitality depends on healthyshark populations. So we are grateful that States andterritories from across the globe have joined Palau incommitting to nurture shark sanctuaries. Today  almost2 million square miles of ocean — an area approximatelynine times the size of Palau’s waters — are safe forsharks.Palau was also the first to sound the alarm on thesecurity impacts of climate change. With our Pacificbrothers and sisters  we moved early on to declareclimate change a security issue that demands the specialattention of every organ of the United Nations system.That was a new and different way of thinking aboutthe problem. Some sceptically questioned whether BlueHelmets would be able to hold back the rising tides.But 18 months after we began  the Assemblyadopted consensus resolution 63/281  inviting therelevant organs of the United Nations to intensifytheir efforts to consider and address climate change including its possible security implications. That callwas heeded by Germany  when it took up the issue lastJuly as President of the Security Council. Thanks toGermany’s efforts  as well as those of others on theCouncil  we now have a historic presidential statementhighlighting the potential risks of climate change tointernational peace and security.Germany’s statement and resolution 63/281 havenot stemmed the rising tides  but they have helped tochange the way we understand and discuss climatechange. No longer can anyone question the impact ofclimate change on energy security  on food security  onwater security or indeed on our territorial integrity. Nolonger can anyone deny that rising seas and oppressivedroughts are displacing people across the globe. Asthe United States Permanent Representative saidat last year’s Council meeting  to deny the securityimplications of climate change would be pathetic.The world has reached a crossroads on sustainabledevelopment. We have recently concluded discussionsat the United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment and will soon delineate new sustainabledevelopment goals  focusing again on small islanddeveloping States. For Palau  that crossroads is anopportunity to better integrate healthy oceans andfisheries into the regulatory development framework.Sustainable fisheries are Palau’s lifeblood. ForPalau  it has always been  and continues to be  a blueeconomy or no economy. That is why we have limitedpurse seine fishing  agreed with our neighbours toclose the doughnut holes between our jurisdictions  andimplemented an innovative vessel day scheme strategythrough the parties to the Nauru Agreement. That isalso why we have conserved 58 per cent of our in-shoremarine area through the Protected Areas Network banned bottom trawling and declared the world’s firstshark sanctuary.We were honoured this year that the Protected AreasNetwork Act and the Shark Haven Act received the 2012Future Policy Award for outstanding maritime policyand for contributing most effectively to the sustainablemanagement of the world’s oceans and coasts for thebenefit of current and future generations. We thank theWorld Future Council  the Convention on BiologicalDiversity  the Food and Agriculture Organization ofthe United Nations  the Okeanos Foundation for the Seaand the Global Environmental Facility for conferringtheir generous recognition and support through thataward.Palau champions three straightforward principlesfor global fisheries. First  global fisheries should befair. If distant-water vessels want to come for fish thattraverse Palau’s waters  they should respect our laws.They should fish within our limits and recognize ourright to realize the benefits of our natural resources.Illegal fishing is tantamount to piracy; it robs us of ourlivelihoods and undermines our security.Secondly  global fisheries should be sustainable.We should use every means at our disposal to achievestock levels that will ensure healthy fisheries forthe long term. That includes closing fisheries whennecessary.Thirdly  global fisheries should be accountable.Reports show that 87 per cent of global fish stocksare now fully exploited or overexploited. Those arethe worst numbers on record. Regional fisheriesmanagement organizations  which stand in the shoes ofthe General Assembly  should do better and should bemore transparent. We are encouraged that negotiationsthis year enabled the resolution on sustainable fisheries(resolution 66/88) to better reflect those three principles.  Palau is pleased to report on the success of a numberof key domestic initiatives  which we have previouslyraised in the general debate. Palau has taken innovativesteps to reduce our emissions by solarizing our airport our Government buildings and our highways. By2020  we will generate 20 per cent of our energy fromrenewable sources. We have also created a successfulgreen mortgage programme to assist the financing ofgreener homes. That programme  which began witha small amount of financing from Italy  was recentlythe subject of a workshop among 13 regional financinginstitutions  with plans for expansion throughout thePacific.Palau is also working to connect itself to theworld — literally. It is inconceivable to many of us herein New York  but Palau remains without broadbandInternet. That means that no Palauan can watchthe streaming video of this speech. The BroadbandCommission of the International TelecommunicationUnion tells us that broadband access is a prerequisiteto achieving the Millennium Development Goals andthat a 10 per cent increase in broadband penetrationincreases a developing country’s gross national productby 1.4 per cent. We are sure that a 100 per cent increasewould fundamentally improve Palauan health  businessand civic engagement. We continue to seek partnersthat might help Palau to reach that goal.Last year Palau underwent its Human RightsCouncil Universal Periodic Review. The most repeatedrecommendation by Human Rights Council memberswas that we should establish a national human rightsinstitution. With the help of new partners  we aretranslating human rights conventions into Palauan bringing the lessons of international human rights intoPalauan schools  harmonizing our national legislation regulations and practices with the international humanrights instruments  and supporting human rightsprogrammes and services in Palau through that formalinstitution.All those activities have been complemented bythe outstanding work being done to remove explosiveremnants of Second World War from Palau. As PresidentToribiong stated from this rostrum last year  many ofthose explosives are still live and are being discoverednear our schools  roads and utilities. With the help ofour partners  much of this unexploded ordnance is beingdestroyed. We hope that anyone interested in our effortswill attend our upcoming regional workshop in Octoberto see first-hand the successful model of cooperationbetween Palau’s Government  non-governmentalorganizations  donors and the local community that iseradicating that scourge from our midst.We would like to express our gratitude for thestrong support and friendship of our partners forhelping to get those and other important projects offthe ground. Palau thanks especially the United States Japan  Australia and the Republic of China (Taiwan).Palau continues to believe that Taiwan’s meaningfulparticipation in the United Nations system will help tofurther promote the system’s efficacy  goals and ideals including those of the International Civil AviationOrganization and the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).Palau very much appreciates the President’schoice of “Bringing about adjustment or settlementof international disputes or situations by peacefulmeans” as the theme for this year’s general debate. It isas important as ever that we commit to upholding thepeace and condemn violence wherever it occurs. To thatend  Palau condemns in the strongest possible terms therecent attacks on the diplomatic premises in the MiddleEast. We agree with President Obama that such attacksare “an assault on the very ideals upon which the UnitedNations was founded” (A/67/PV.6   p.  11). We must bevigilant in protecting all diplomatic missions  whereverthey may be.Closer to our shores in the Pacific  Palau is alsohopeful that tensions in the East China Sea willdissipate  and that all of our neighbours can engage in amore peaceful dialogue.Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon cautioned theworld last week that we are wilfully blind when itcomes to climate change. We are awash in reportstelling us that the situation is dire. We have experiencedmore than 100 consecutive months of temperaturesabove global averages. Nine of the 10 warmest yearson record have occurred since the year 2000. Arcticsea ice is at its lowest level in recorded history. Coralreefs are disappearing at an alarming rate. Now  buriedin the recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change regarding the management of risk isadvice to policymakers in small island States that  incertain cases  they may wish to consider relocating theirpopulations. We assure the members of the Assemblythat Palau has no intention of moving its people. Ourislands are their home. They are the essence of Palau’svery being. I can state with every confidence that Palau will pursue every legitimate recourse available beforewe concede hope.The current situation at the UNFCCC isunacceptable. After more than 20 years of negotiations we are running out of creative ways to say that countriesare being destroyed. Sadly  it seems that the mostvulnerable countries have become acceptable collateraldamage. The world knows the causes of climate change.It is within our grasp to effect a solution. No armystands in our way. If something is not done soon  allthe good  hard work to which Palau and the other islandnations of the world have dedicated themselves will befor naught.In conclusion  we know that the times we live inare turbulent  but we must heed our leaders’ call to beguided by the Charter of the United Nations and theinternational rule of law. Palau will continue to doits part by being a moral voice for what is right  andhopefully  a model global citizen."
"139",5656,"PNG",67,2012,"﻿Papua New Guineacongratulates Mr. Jeremić on his recent election asPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventhsession. Our country pledges its support to him in thatrole. I also commend his predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  for the valuable workthat he has done in the past year.Papua New Guinea recently celebrated its 37years of independence  on 16 September. Prior to that despite various challenges  our country successfullycompleted its general elections in a fair and peacefulmanner. Those elections culminated in the conveningof our ninth National Parliament and the formationof a new Government. We thank our close friendsand development partners that have assisted us in theelection process  including Australia  New Zealand Japan  South Korea  China  the United States  GreatBritain  the European Union  the United Nations andthe Commonwealth.As a young developing nation  we are proud of ourConstitution-based and evolving democracy. While ourpeople have subsisted on the island nation of Papua NewGuinea for many centuries  our short modern historycontinues to be a testament to the will of our people tomaintain and consolidate our burgeoning democracy inline with the rule of law. In today’s world  that is thebasis on which a just and fair society is built and onwhich societies have been built.Papua New Guinea’s key development priorities inthe next five years are contained in our Medium-TermDevelopment Plan 2011-2015. That seeks to achieve a long-term national road map under our Vision 2050.We need to strengthen our economy for it to be moreresilient to global market shocks by diversifyingtrade and investment and by reviewing developmentcooperation  ensuring that our people’s basic needs aremet.Papua New Guinea is also increasing investmentin our children’s future  security and success by theprovision of free and quality education from theelementary to the secondary level and by furthersubsidizing education from Grade 12 to the tertiarylevel. We believe that that will help us to achieveMillennium Development Goal 2 on universal primaryeducation  which will enhance our nation-buildingprocess.We are also rehabilitating and developing our majorinfrastructure  such as roads  airports  ports  schoolsand hospitals  as key drivers of sustainable developmentin our country. We are increasing support for fundingto ensure the delivery of basic health-care and socialservices countrywide. That includes the revitalizationof our institutional and human resources capacity totake the country to a higher development level  whichis our national development priority.Our Government has prioritized combatingcorruption at all levels of society. In doing so  we haveadopted the principle of zero tolerance. In that respect our country is setting up the Independent Commissionagainst Corruption to enhance implementation of theUnited Nations Convention against Corruption. Webelieve that such legislation and policy efforts willimprove good governance  resulting in the effectivedelivery of basic services and the provision of access toopportunities for participation in national developmentby all relevant stakeholders.The economy of Papua New Guinea is growing atan annual rate of 8 per cent. Our improved economicperformance is underscored by political stability  soundmacroeconomic management and the development ofthe first large liquefied natural gas project. The revenuefrom that project is likely to increase the growth of oureconomy  doubling the revenue base by 2014. We intendto share that wealth with our Pacific neighbours in theappropriate manner. In that context  a sovereign wealthfund has been set up to professionally manage therevenue from the liquefied natural gas project and otherextractive industries. We plan to reinvest that revenuefor the future of our country.We believe that a strengthened economy willimprove our social indicators  particularly byaddressing our literacy levels  high maternal and infantmortality rates  law and order enforcement  the ageingpublic sector workforce and the declining state of ourcountry’s infrastructure.Papua New Guinea supports the Secretary-General’s five-year action agenda on sustainabledevelopment  enhanced human security  enhancing thecore values of the international community  supportingnations in transition  and working with and for womenand young people  which was launched on 25 January.Papua New Guinea continues to benefit from a strongUnited Nations presence  through which variousdevelopment programmes have been implemented. Wehighly value the contribution of the United Nations inthat regard.We have also been implementing the One UnitedNations initiative since 2006 as a self-starter country.So far  that is working exceptionally well for ourcountry. We are also grateful that the United Nationshas heeded our call and has synergized its developmentassistance framework 2012-2015 with our Medium-Term Development Plan. However  we can do more. Weurge donor partners to abide by the principles of theParis Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the AccraAgenda for Action. Through the Pacific Islands Forum we have adapted the Cairns Compact in order to bettercoordinate development assistance and to ensure theeffective delivery of aid.We welcome the proactive engagement of the UnitedNations with the Pacific region and thank the Secretary-General for his visit and ongoing commitment. Weare encouraged by that and by the fact that contactswith the United Nations system and personnel will bestrengthened in the Pacific Islands region.The challenge for Papua New Guinea is to ensure thatthe development of our natural resources is sustainableand that the benefits are effectively translated into theimproved livelihoods of our people. That  in turn  willassist us in meeting our Millennium Development Goals(MDGs)  especially the 22 indicators and 90 nationaltargets that we have set ourselves. We acknowledgethat it will be a challenge to attain all the MDGs by2015  but note there has been measured progress inthe eradication of extreme poverty and hunger  whichis MDG 1  and the reduction of child mortality  which is MDG 4. So for our part  our country is taking fullownership of the MDGs.With the support of our development partners suchas the European Union and the United Nations  PapuaNew Guinea is conducting a trial of the MillenniumVillage concept this month. We recommit ourselvesto working with our international partners  includingthe United Nations  and we reiterate that the MDGsneed to be the priority while we discuss sustainabledevelopment goals for the long term.Papua New Guinea continues to scale up itsefforts to further strengthen human rights protectionand advancement in the country. We are workingclosely with United Nations agencies and our otherdevelopment partners in the furtherance of theseobjectives. To date  we have reported to the HumanRights Council on work done relating to the Conventionon the Elimination of All Forms of Discriminationagainst Women in July 2010. We have also reported tothe Human Rights Council under the universal periodicreview process. Additionally  the 2012 report of theSpecial Rapporteur on violence against women  itscauses and consequences (A/HRC/20/16) and the 2010report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and othercruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishmentare being considered by our Government this year.Papua New Guinea is committed to genderempowerment and equality. We recognize women andgirls as not only key national development partnersbut also persons whose inherent human dignity mustbe respected and safeguarded. This is a central pillarof our Constitution and a core value of our nationaldevelopment road map. A testament to the success ofthis measure is that more girls are enrolling in primaryand upper levels of education with an increasingly highretention rate. Women are also increasingly employed recognized and given greater responsibilities inour public and private sectors. In fact  we achieveda historical milestone this year  and one which isunprecedented in our political history  in that  for thefirst time  three women were elected to the nationalparliament. This positive trend is increasing in ourcountry at all levels.We also recognize the critical importance ofprotecting our women and girls from violence anddiscrimination. Papua New Guinea is taking aproactive approach through education  advocacyand legislation to prevent gender-based violence. We have made violence against women and girls a crimepunishable by law. Partnership with all stakeholders including our development partners and civil society forms an important part of the gender empowermentand equality issues in our country. In this context  wecommend the funding  substantially from the AustralianGovernment  that was announced at the margins of thePacific Islands Forum in Rarotonga in August 2012  aswell as that from other development partners  includingNew Zealand  the United Nations and the United Statesof America.Having acceded to the Convention on the Rights ofPersons with Disabilities  Papua New Guinea is now inthe process of ratifying the Convention. Our country isworking with our Pacific Islands Forum member Statesto host the Pacific Islands Forum Disability MinistersMeeting on 3 and 4 October 2012 in Port Moresby.We are also working towards setting up anindependent national human rights commission and  atthe same time  we are in the process of withdrawingthe seven reservations on the 1951 Convention relatingto the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. In thiscontext  we are partnering with Australia to addresshuman trafficking and human smuggling issues in ourregion.The theme that was chosen for the High-levelMeeting during this session  the rule of law at thenational and international levels  is timely andcommendable. Papua New Guinea fully subscribes  as Ihave said  to the principles of the rule of law.Papua New Guinea also fully subscribes todisarmament and non-proliferation to secure a peacefulworld. We urge nuclear nations to denuclearize andthose thinking of going nuclear to refrain from doingso. The Pacific region remains a nuclear-free zone  andwe urge other Member States that have yet to sign and ratify the Rarotonga Treaty  which prohibits nuclearweapons in the region  to do so.We remain concerned about the continuedproliferation of small arms and light weapons. Inthis context  we call for the recent impasse on thenegotiations on a global arms trade treaty to be endedas soon as possible.Papua New Guinea supports the Group of SevenPlus forum for its efforts to strengthen peacebuildingand State-building in fragile and post-conflict countriesand commend Timor-Leste for their leadership. As partof our national commitment to fostering global peaceand security  Papua New Guinea has commenced itscontribution to the United Nations peacekeeping forceand is looking to expand that contribution.We remain committed to the United Nationssustainable development agenda  especially on climatechange  with respect to mitigation and adaptation.We are committed to working closely with the globalcommunity under the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change and subscribe to theRio+20 outcome declaration  “The future we want”(resolution 66/288  annex).Papua New Guinea recognizes the pivotal roleof the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) forsustainable development. As a founding member ofGGGI  Papua New Guinea pledges to work togetherwith other stakeholders to ensure the desired outcomesthrough the Institute. In this context  we pay tribute tothe work that has been done by the Republic of Korea.In conclusion  we support the call made by theSecretary-General for the reform of the United Nationssystem. We also again call for the reform of the SecurityCouncil in both the permanent and the non-permanentcategories of members  in order for it to reflect thegeopolitical realities of today."
"140",5702,"POL",67,2012,"﻿May I offermy warm congratulations to Mr. Vuk Jeremić on hiselection to the position of President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session.Following the experiences of recent years  the worldis poised at a difficult moment in its development. Theweakness of international institutions in the face ofeconomic  security  humanitarian and environmentalproblems is indisputable  and yet those institutionswere designed to resolve such problems. That alsoapplies to the Security Council  especially in thecontext of the conflict in Syria. It is also clear thatinternational financial institutions are not capable ofhandling the destructive volatility of financial markets which results from the opaqueness and arbitrariness ofpowerful private interests operating in this area.The signals coming from Asia point to anundiminished number of tensions and disputes. Wehave been following with concern the tension resultingfrom the Iranian nuclear programme. We are worriedby the increasingly tangible threat of the proliferationof weapons of mass destruction and of an intensifiedarms race among the Gulf States.The results of the Mission in Afghanistan are notentirely satisfactory. We must learn a lesson from theshortcomings of the strategy devised for that country thus far. The approach that suggests the military optionfirst is not a suitable method for resolving complexinternal conflicts.The hopes raised by the Arab Spring have beenjustified  but only to a certain extent. The civil warin Syria and the resulting toll in lives  as well as theUnited Nations and Arab League’s inability to containit  cast a shadow across the entire region. The tragicdeath of American diplomats and the circumstancesof their death should also prompt ref lection among allthose persuaded of the automatic nature of democratictransformations.When we signed the United Nations Charter  whichis the constitution of the contemporary internationalorder and testifies to our faith in a better world  wepledged our readiness to make concerted efforts andcooperate in pursuit of the ideals invoked in it. Oneof the main paths to a more secure and fair world isthe peaceful resolution of disputes and conflicts. Thatconcept is the main theme of this year’s session of theAssembly  and the choice of that subject is timely. Inrecent years  we have seen numerous occasions in whicha commitment pursuant to Article 2 of the Charter wasignored  with very dramatic consequences. The bestexample is the crisis in Syria  but such situations alsooccur in other parts of the world.Throughout the twentieth century  the internationalcommunity developed various means and ways toachieve a peaceful settlement to disputes at both theglobal and regional level. Volumes have been written onthe subject. There are many international institutionsinvolved in this field  as well as many renowned andprominent experts  diplomats and politicians. Some ofthem  including Jimmy Carter and Martti Ahtisaari have been rightly acknowledged by being awarded aNobel Peace Prize. They were able to effectively useexisting procedures to quell conflicts and peacefullyresolve difficult disputes of an international orinternal nature that otherwise could have escalatedinto international conflicts. However  success was notpossible everywhere. If success was not achieved  itwas because of the absence of one crucially importantfactor without which it is impossible to settle a disputein a peaceful  lasting and just manner  namely  realizingthe obvious truth that without compromise one cannotarrive at a lasting solution to any conflict. That isembedded in the very nature of conflict.In that connection  I would like to refer to the Polishexperience with the Solidarity movement and the roundtable talks of the spring of 1989. Both sides of the deepsocial conflict of those days — the communist regime on the one hand  and the champions of democratictransformation who ultimately strove to overthrowcommunism  on the other — demonstrated wisdom andwere thereby able to reach a compromise  even if it wasnot fully satisfactory to either party. It was neverthelessa compromise that opened perspectives for furtherchange  which extended beyond Poland to the entireregion of Central and Eastern Europe. What made thatcompromise possible was the capacity for self-controlby those actors who ultimately strove to achieve arevolutionary change. Let us recall that all previousattempts undertaken by the democratic oppositionoutside the system ended in military interventions bloodshed  tens of thousands of refugees and furtherrepression. That could have also been the case on amassive scale in the spring of 1989.In the long run  the capacity for self-control andthe strength of a wise compromise make a much bettersolution than pushing one’s own demands and trying toadvance one’s own arguments by force. We know all toowell what happens in the latter case; it usually ends inpeople taking up arms in order to prove their rightnessby military means. In line with the rules of geopolitics both parties to a conflict seek allies abroad. Finally the logic of holding each other in check and an “all ornothing” mentality start to prevail. Costs are no longercounted. As the conflict continues  the scale of the crisisgrows. The situation develops into a truly internationalone. In order to fend off any further escalation ofantagonisms  major humanitarian and stabilizationoperations supported by the army and police force areinevitable. The process of reconciliation  normalizationand reconstruction is greatly delayed.We have seen that process in various situations indifferent countries. It can be avoided provided that from the very outset of a dispute  both sides anticipatedialogue  acknowledge the limits of what is feasible show sensitivity to the potential costs of conflict andseek compromise. The art of self-control and of wisecompromise  embodied by Nobel Prize winners LechWalesa and Nelson Mandela  are worth promoting.However  this approach is not promoted oftenenough in the context of efforts for peaceful conflictresolution and situations that may lead to conflict.Syria is a dramatic example of how a wasted chance for compromise can unfold. We expect that an endwill be soon put to the bloodshed in Syria and that theconflict will be settled on the basis of United Nationsprinciples  using the instruments available to theOrganization. May the new United Nations envoy forthat conflict never lack determination in the fulfilmentof his mission.After many centuries of antagonism  disputes andconflicts in Europe  yet another preventive methodwas invented in order to do away with wars and stopdifferences and competing claims from turning intobloody crises. That method is the process of regionalintegration  which was ushered in after the SecondWorld War by the creation of the European Coal andSteel Community. The project’s hidden intention wasto firmly establish the “no war” principle. It was notenough to ban war  as had been done through theKellogg-Briand Pact of 1928. What was needed was forwar to be made impossible by the process of integration.Through the establishment of the Community and itsexpansion to new areas of integration  including most ofthe countries on the continent  the disputes threateningEurope’s security and peace were consigned to the past.Even if that experience cannot be used in a completelycopy-and-paste manner  it can still serve as an exampleto other regions of the world.The plight of civilian populations  in particularchildren  is the most dramatic consequence of the lackto self-control and the absence of a culture of  andwillingness to  compromise in contemporary disputesand internal and international conflicts. The methodsand means of combat spare soldiers  sometimes at theexpense of innocent civilians  especially children who often become a target of military operations.This phenomenon is related to efforts to move theaggression to the other side. The responsibility forcivilian casualties  even if unintended  can also fall oninternational and peacekeeping forces.Based on experience gathered by the internationalcommunity  the contentious idea of humanitarianintervention has been replaced with the concept of the“responsibility to protect”. I believe that this was a verywise path to take to end the stalemate that emerged inthis area more than 10 years ago. The concept of theresponsibility to protect has been approved by theentire international community and has been a UnitedNations norm since 2005.As we know  a norm and its practice may sometimesbe worlds apart. Given the developments that haveunfolded over the past decade  including several eventsin North Africa  and in the light of the humanitariantragedies  in particular the suffering and death ofthousands of innocent children  that should stir people’shearts and consciences  we cannot afford for theresponsibility to protect to remain a dead letter. Whatwe put forward for the Assembly’s consideration is thatthe United Nations should initiate work on defininga catalogue of instruments to be applied in situationsthat entail the responsibility to protect. This is aboutthe international community being effective withoutexceeding a mission’s mandate and inciting disputes onthat count.This is a particularly important consideration forus in Poland. Our nation has more than once fallenvictim to crimes perpetrated on a mass scale. Promptedby that awareness  Tadeusz Mazowiecki  specialrapporteur on crimes in the Balkans for the HumanRights Commission  embarked on his mission 20 yearsago. The effectiveness of the international communitywhen faced with f lagrant violations of human rights ona mass scale and crimes and suffering that call for rapidreaction  as in Syria these days  depends largely uponthe credibility of our action in previous such situations.We must always act in good faith and in line with themandate given to us.I am speaking on behalf of a country that  over thepast 20 years  has managed to travel the difficult roadfrom a totalitarian regime  the collapse of its economyand mass social unrest curbed by force to democraticstability  economic growth and the ability to supportpeaceful transformations beyond its borders. Thirtyyears ago  when martial law was imposed in order tocrush the Solidarity revolution  it was suggested thatPoland’s attempt to enter the world of democracy wouldentail potential imbalances between the East and West and even a war between the Warsaw Pact nations andNATO — in effect  a world war.Fortunately  those days are gone. Hardly anyonewould think in such terms now. Today  Poland is a freecountry that develops its relations without limitations shares its experience  spreads the word about thebenefits derived from our transition to democracy andextends development and humanitarian aid. We are acountry that has had a positive economic growth ratefor the past 20 years.Poland’s commitment to the stability of theEuropean integration process mirrors our understandingof the process as one that serves the security of all ofEurope and its neighbourhood. That is why we activelyendeavour to bring together the two parts of Europe oncedivided by the Cold War. The European Union EasternPartnership programme was designed to that end  withPoland and Sweden as its initiators and promoters.Poland readily offers support to and sharesexperiences with countries and societies embarkingon the road to democracy in North Africa  Asia andEurope. To the extent we are able  Poland is involvedin developing contact with countries from differentregions and civilizations. Our policy in that regardarises from the conviction that an effective UnitedNations is as urgently needed today as it was in thedays of the Cold War. The world cannot be driven bya bipolar or multipolar concert of Powers. Of course although the Powers will not cease to exist  stabilityand regulation of the international legal order willrequire the more extensive engagement of multilateralinstitutions  as well as norms and mechanisms securingfull observance. Only the United Nations system canensure all of those.In order to improve its effectiveness  we needto reform the Organization along the way  respectagreed norms and honour our commitments in goodfaith. We recall that a return to a Hobbesian world isalways possible and that some people continue activelyto bring it about. That is why Poland felt sorely triedunder the effects of the twentieth-century dramas.However  Poland is committed to promoting respect forthe principles  integrity and full implementation of theoutput of our Organization. Such action will ensure thatthe tasks we propose will be carried out effectively andthe United Nations will meet the expectations we setout at its very beginning and continue to promote today."
"141",5728,"PRK",67,2012,"﻿Allow me to congratulate you  Sir on your election to preside over the General Assemblyat its sixty-seventh session. I expect your proficientstewardship will guide the Assembly to success.At the outset  I would like to express our profoundgratitude to the heads of State and Government andpeoples of the States Members of the United Nations the Secretary-General  the President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-sixth session  representativesof United Nations bodies and of many countries fordeep condolences they extended to us at the demise inDecember last year of the great leader of our people Kim Jong Il. General Kim Jong Il devoted tirelessefforts until the last moment of his life to firmlysafeguarding the dignity and sovereignty of our countryand the prosperity and happiness of its people  as wellas to accomplishing the cause of global independenceand world peace and stability.Today  having hailed dear respected Marshal KimJong Un as the Supreme Leader of the Party  State andArmy  our people are striving to build a prosperousand powerful socialist State. Dear respected MarshalKim Jong Un safeguards the peace and stability of theKorean peninsula by carrying forward the Songunpolicy of General Kim Jong Il in good faith. He wiselyleads the general advance march for developing oureconomy  improving people’s livelihood  and devisinga development strategy of our own style and innovativemethods with his insight into the world. Our dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un is firmlydetermined to make our people  who have overcomemanifold hardships  enjoy a happy life to their heart’scontent in a prosperous socialist State. Dear respectedMarshal Kim Jong Un is implementing independentforeign policy and opening up a new chapter in thedevelopment of relations with other countries that arefriendly to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea not bound by the past. Our people are following dearrespected Marshal Kim Jong Un with absolute trust inhim and are vigorously advancing to the final victorywith full conviction in and optimism about the future single-heartedly united behind him.The founding of the United Nations in the lastcentury gave hope to mankind following a tragicworld war — hope of achieving common prosperityby ensuring peace and security and developingcooperation among States based on the principle ofsovereign equality. Yet today  after the first decadeof the new century  that desire of the mankind has yetto be achieved. At present in international relations high-handedness and arbitrariness are becoming evermore undisguised  and the use of force and acts ofState terrorism aimed at infringing on sovereignty interference in internal affairs and effecting regimechange are being perpetrated under such pretexts asnon-proliferation and humanitarian intervention.We are now witnessing the resurrection of theoutdated international relations of the first half of thetwentieth century  when a handful of great Powersdominated the world by resorting to the use of force.This resurrection tarnishes the credibility of the UnitedNations  whose mandate is to ensure global peace andsecurity.The fact that the theme “Bringing about adjustmentor settlement of international disputes or situations bypeaceful means” was chosen for the current sessionshows the seriousness of the current internationalsituation. The most serious issue in the internationalarena at present is a f lagrant violation of the principlesof respect for sovereignty and equality. Unless thehigh-handedness and arbitrariness of certain countriesare thoroughly eliminated  it will be hard to say thatthe United Nations is fulfilling its role and function asa centre for coordinating cooperative relations betweenStates based on the principle of sovereign equality asenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.The unjustifiable interference  pressure and useof force that violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria and the right to self-determinationand existence of Palestine should be rejected.Democratizing the United Nations and  inparticular  strengthening the authority of the GeneralAssembly are urgent issues for enhancing the centralrole of the United Nations in international relations.The Assembly resolution adopted long ago ondismantling the so-called United Nations Commandstationed in South Korea and the resolution adoptedannually on ending the United States blockade againstCuba remain unimplemented. These are typicalexamples that show the need to strengthen the authorityof the General Assembly.It is quite natural for the General Assembly  whichrepresents the general will of all Member States  tosupervise the overall activities of the Organization. Inparticular  it should be given the authority to undertakefinal review of Security Council resolutions related topeace and security  such as sanctions and use of force.The abuse of the Security Council as a tool for pursuingstrategic interests by a handful of countries shouldnever be overlooked. Last April  the United States tookissue with our legitimate and peaceful space launch which followed universal international law  and forcedthe Council to adopt an unjust statement. That aloneshows how the Council has been abused.Security Council reform  which is at the core ofoverall United Nations reform  is a matter that shouldno longer be delayed. It should be carried out in amanner that guarantees responsibility  transparency impartiality and objectivity in its activities and ensuresfull representation of developing countries in itscomposition.Other United Nations bodies in which doublestandards and the theory of force are extremely evidentare the Third Committee of the General Assembly andthe Human Rights Council. Politicization  selectivityand double standards in deliberations on human rightsshould be put to an end. We should never allow thecontinuation of the practice whereby human rightssituations of selected countries are either called intoquestion or simply ignored in accordance with thepolitical purposes and interests of the West and theWestern standard values.In the field of sustainable development  whichis now one of the three targets set by the UnitedNations  the agreement reached in the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  held last Junein Rio de Janeiro  should be implemented. Practicalmeasures should be taken to solve such issues asestablishing fair international economic and traderelations  fulfilling official development assistancecommitments  transferring environmentally cleantechnologies to developing countries and strengtheningfinancial support.Today  due to the ongoing hostile policy ofthe United States towards the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea  a vicious cycle of confrontationand aggravation of tension continues to afflict theKorean peninsula  which has become the world’s mostdangerous hotspot  a place where a spark could set offa thermonuclear war. At the root of that hostile policy which has lasted for more than half a century  towardsthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea lies theintention of the United States to destroy the ideas andsystem our people have chosen and to occupy the entireKorean peninsula  in order to use it as a stepping stonein realizing its strategy of dominating all of Asia.Since the day the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea was founded  the United States has designated itan enemy and refused to recognize its sovereignty. Sincethen  it has pursued every kind of sanction  pressure andmilitary provocation against the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea for more than half a century. Itshostile policy is most deeply rooted in the military field.No precedent can be found in modern history for thesituation whereby the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea and the United States have continued as warringparties after hostilities ended and for more than 60years altogether.With a view to eliminating the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea by force  the United States hasalready finalized various war scenarios  and is waitingfor a chance to implement them  as it has outlined in acontingency plan to impose military rule after a militaryinvasion. In accordance with those plans for militaryoperations  the United States has staged various jointmilitary exercises under different names in and aroundthe Korean peninsula for several decades. A typicalexample was a combined military exercise named UljiFreedom Guardian  staged at the end of last August andinvolving huge numbers of armed forces  which pushedthe situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink ofwar.It is only the patience and military deterrent self-defence capacity of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea that have prevented the continued militaryprovocations of the United States from turning into all-out war on the Korean peninsula. However  this doesnot mean that the patience of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea is inexhaustible. Our people valuepeace and stability in pursuing their overall goal ofbuilding a prosperous and powerful State. But thedignity of our nation and the sovereignty of our countryare even more valuable.Our principled stand is based on reacting to anaggressor’s reckless provocations with an immediate corresponding strike in defence of our nation’s dignityand sovereignty  and to respond to a war of aggressionwith a just war of reunification of the country. Therealities of the situation on the Korean peninsulaprove that we have been absolutely right to have builta military deterrent capacity for our self-defence  bytightening our belts in order to pursue the path ofSongun and independence. Our military deterrent is amighty weapon that defends the country’s sovereigntyand a powerful means of preventing war on the Koreanpeninsula  as well as a strong guarantee that enablesus to focus our efforts on economic construction andimproving people’s livelihoods.The only way to prevent war and ensure lastingpeace on the Korean peninsula is to put an end tothe hostile policy of the United States towards theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. That policyis the root cause that has made the Korean peninsulathe world’s most dangerous hotspot  and it is the chiefobstacle to lasting peace and security. The nuclearissue on the Korean peninsula is also a product of thatpolicy. None of these problems  including the Koreanpeninsula nuclear issue  can be resolved without firstending the hostile policy of the United States  whichviews the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as anenemy target and tries to stif le it at any cost. That is theessence of the process of our dialogue with the UnitedStates and a lesson we have drawn from practicalexperience.Since the turn of the new century  North-Southsummit meetings have been held twice  amid the joyfulenthusiasm of all our fellow countrymen. They resultedin the adoption of the 15 June North-South JointDeclaration and the 4 October Declaration  and createdan atmosphere in which the desire for reconciliation cooperation and reunification between North and Southreached a peak. Soon after taking office  however  thenew South Korean authorities annulled all inter-Korean agreements  including the 15 June North-South JointDeclaration and the 4 October Declaration  which hadbeen warmly welcomed and were fully supported by theentire Korean nation and the international community including the United Nations. Furthermore  theconfrontation between fellow countrymen and systemshave caused an extreme deterioration in inter-Koreanrelations. The South Korean authorities rubbed salt inthe wounds of our people  who had suffered such a hugenational loss  even insulting our supreme dignity withacts of political terrorism  and leaving inter-Koreanrelations totally bankrupt. History will bring them tojustice.The Government of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea will join hands with anyone whotruly desires the country’s reunification and nationalreconciliation and prosperity. With responsibility andpatience  and relying on the nation’s concerted efforts it is making every effort to realize the historic causeof national reunification by preventing interference byoutside forces and any attempt by anti-reunificationforces to achieve permanent national division.The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea willcontinue to further strengthen and develop the relationsof friendship and cooperation with all countries thatrespect its sovereignty  pursuant to the principlesof independence  peace and friendship on which itsforeign policy is based  and will actively cooperate withthe efforts of United Nations Member States to secureworld peace and stability and to achieve sustainabledevelopment."
"142",5773,"PRT",67,2012,"﻿I congratulateMr. Vuk Jeremić on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Hiselection represents one more important step in analready illustrious career  as well as a historic momentfor Serbia  one that recognizes its courageous effortsto overcome a difficult recent past and to proceed withdetermination towards European integration.Allow me also to express a word of recognitionto Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for hissuccessful leadership of the Assembly in a particularlydemanding year. We also offer praise and support toour Secretary-General for his commendable work  inparticular for his efforts made to promote peace in atime of great challenges.As Portugal is three months away from theconclusion of our mandate in the Security Council to which we were elected by a significant majority ofthe Member States present in this Hall  we considerit appropriate to present an assessment to the GeneralAssembly. We fulfilled our mandate with both rigourand transparency  always seeking to strengthen thecredibility and efficiency of the principal organentrusted with the protection of international peaceand security. We were guided by the same principlesthat have always oriented our foreign policy and whichhave merited the trust of the Assembly  namely  thedefence of the primacy of international law  the searchfor effective multilateralism and the central role of theUnited Nations in the international architecture.With equal coherence and firm resolve we havedefended the promotion of human rights  the role ofwomen  the protection of civilians  the strengtheningof action defending children against violence and theprotection of children in the context of armed conflict.Sustainable development  the fight against poverty food security and the particularly devastating effectsof climate change on small island developing States which threaten their very existence  remain  forPortugal  fundamental pillars for our action within theUnited Nations.With equal perseverance  we have sought tostrengthen the role of the Security Council in the fightagainst new challenges to international peace andsecurity  such as organized crime; the proliferation ofillicit trafficking  terrorism and pandemics; the Council’scapacity to prevent conflicts and to bring mediationinto play; and its efforts to improve coordination withregional and subregional organizations. We have playedan active role  and continue to do so  in the collectiveefforts to overcome crises  such as those that emergedin Côte d’Ivoire  Libya and Yemen  or the currentchallenges in Syria  Guinea-Bissau and Mali.Our actions have always been driven by opennessto dialogue and a constructive and balanced attitude embodying our vocation to build bridges and generateconsensus without abdicating our values and principles.We hope to have lived up to the high expectations andtrust placed in us.As Chair of the Informal Working Group onDocumentation and Other Procedural Questions  wesought to improve the internal working methods ofthe Council and its communication with the GeneralAssembly  with a view to making it more effective andopen and more in harmony with our times. We willpresent a report to the Assembly on the work undertakenon that issue.It is important  however  to recognize that thecredibility of the Security Council is also underpinnedby a need for its composition to reflect the currentgeopolitical reality  one that is quite different from thedynamic that was in place in 1945. It is increasinglydifficult for us  as it is for many others  to see that theincreasing role of Brazil and India in the internationalscene has not yet been acknowledged with permanentseats on the Security Council  or that Africa is the onlycontinent without a permanent seat on the Council.The Security Council continues to confrontserious obstacles. The number of victims in Syriais exponentially increasing day by day. We remainimpotent witnesses before a true humanitariancatastrophe and a generalized systematic violation ofthe most basic rights of the Syrian people. In addition the catastrophe could have been avoided had the SyrianGovernment not chosen military force and brutalrepression in response to the legitimate protests by itspeople  which systematically excluded any possibilityof a politically negotiated outcome to the crisis. However  there is no alternative to a politicalsolution  one that supports the legitimate aspirations ofthe Syrian people and allows for a democratic transitiondriven by the Syrians themselves  one in which they seetheir wishes reflected. Increased militarization of theconflict will undoubtedly lead to even more suffering forthe civilian population  threaten the territorial integrityof Syria and increase the risks of destabilization for itsneighbours and indeed for the region as a whole.The appointment of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  adiplomat whom we greatly respect  as the Joint SpecialRepresentative of the United Nations and the League ofArab States for Syria should be seen as a new opportunityfor the parties to revisit their options  cease the violenceand seriously engage in a process of political transition.For the Joint Special Representative’s mission to be asuccess  the Security Council will finally have to exertjoint  continued and effective pressure on all partiesand most certainly on the Syrian authorities  who bearprimary responsibility for the current situation.The impasse in finding a lasting solution to theIsraeli-Arab conflict is also of great concern and anincreasingly urgent issue in the light of the recentdevelopments in the Middle East and North Africaand the fight of the people of those regions for liberty democracy and dignity. There will be no lasting peace no stability and no security in the Middle East withouta solution to the question of Palestine.We understand and share Israel’s legitimatesecurity aspirations. Yet we also understand and sharethe frustration of the Palestinian people  for whoman independent Palestinian State is not simply aninalienable right  but also a straightforward question ofjustice. Only a comprehensive deal that is negotiateddirectly by the parties on the basis of United Nationsresolutions and internationally recognized parametersand which solves the pending questions and is dedicatedto the two-State solution of Israel and Palestine livingside by side in peace will meet both the securityconcerns laid down by Israel and the aspirations ofthe Palestinian people for independence  liberty anddignity. We appeal to the Israelis and Palestinians toquickly restart direct negotiations.Another regional issue still at an impasse and ofserious concern in the Middle East is the question ofa nuclear Iran. We regret the absence of any positivedevelopments on the issue despite the significantdiplomatic efforts under way and the application of mechanisms of international pressure. The onus of thesituation is on Tehran.In Africa  we are faced with a grave situation inthe Sahel  particularly in Mali  which threatens thewhole region and could spread throughout WesternAfrica  putting both stability and development at riskin a number of countries. As a result of a tapestry ofhistorical  economic and social influences  we arewitnessing an exponential growth in terrorism  withincreasing links to organized transnational crime drugs and other sorts of illicit trafficking. In that regard the international community should be more active.Accordingly  we support the outcome of the recentHigh-level Meeting on the Sahel  which contributed tothe creation of an integrated international strategy forthe region.It is against that grave regional background thatthe crisis in Guinea-Bissau is unfolding. The militarycoup of 12 April interrupted a democratic electoralprocess  violating the principles defended by theUnited Nations  as was clearly recognized in SecurityCouncil resolution 2048 (2012). It is imperative that theconstitutional order in Guinea-Bissau be restored. Thatrequires the appointment of an inclusive Governmentthat includes the African Party for the Independenceof Guinea and Cape Verde  which is the party holdingthe majority in the National Assembly; permission forthe legitimate leaders to return without restrictions ontheir civil and political rights; and the organization offree and credible elections. Any and all solutions to thepresent crisis will have to respect international legalityand the constitutional order of Guinea-Bissau  and mustbe translated into an internal  inclusive  and crediblepolitical process capable of creating national stability.To that end  coordinated action by the internationalcommunity — the United Nations  the African Union the Economic Community of West African States  theCommunity of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP)and the European Union — is essential. Portugal isfully engaged and available to work with all interestedparties in the process.It is inconceivable that  in the twenty-first century democratically elected African leaders are pushed asideby force and are made to live outside their countries. It isup to all of us to defend the principles of the Charter andto apply  without any ambiguities  the principle of zerotolerance in such situations. In that context  I note theincreasingly relevant role of the African Union  which has been working in close coordination with the UnitedNations for the promotion and protection of peace andsecurity on the African continent. I also take advantageof this opportunity to congratulate Mrs. Dlamini-Zumaon her election as President of the Commission of theAfrican Union. That also represents a milestone in thestrengthening of the role of women in Africa  which wealso welcome with great satisfaction.Allow me also to refer to a successful case and agood example  Timor-Leste. It is a successful examplethanks  first of all  to the Timorese themselves  but alsoowing to the efficient support of the United Nations.The United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste will conclude its mandate at the end of the year.It will do so with the sense of having accomplishedits purpose  thanks to the maturity shown by theTimorese people over recent years  as exemplified inthe successful presidential and legislative electionsheld just a few months ago. A new cycle of cooperationbetween the international community and Timor-Lesteis now opening in line with the priorities defined bythat country’s Government.In that context  Portugal will continue to supportTimor-Leste on its path to economic and socialdevelopment  including the strengthening of itsinstitutions and democratic values  as well as the ruleof law and the promotion of the human rights of theTimorese people. Timor-Leste  like Guinea-Bissau  is amember State of the CPLP  along with Angola  Brazil Cape Verde  Mozambique  and Sao Tome and Principe.Within the CPLP we share a common language andhistory  but we have also developed shared effortstowards the defence of universal values  through activemultilateralism within the framework of the UnitedNations and the regional organizations to which webelong.The significance of the Portuguese language asa language of global communication  business andculture  with about 250 million speakers  should betaken advantage of by the international community. Forthat reason  we will continue to work together to havePortuguese recognized as an official language of theUnited Nations.I referred at the beginning of my statement toPortugal’s commitment to multilateralism as the mosteffective means for finding common solutions to theglobal challenges that we face. I specifically notedour efforts in the defence of human rights and in the promotion of sustainable development. In that context we support the outcomes achieved at the UnitedNations Conference on Sustainable Development  inpart thanks to the notable efforts of Secretary-GeneralBan Ki-moon and the Brazilian Government.We continue to defend the universal  indivisibleand interdependent rights of all human beings  bethey political  economic  social or cultural. We havea solid commitment to humanitarian law and to theexcellent work of the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees. In that context  with thecommitment to defend and promote human rights andwith the same sense of responsibility with which weundertook our current mandate in the Security Council Portugal has announced its candidacy for the HumanRights Council for the years 2015 to 2017. We hope tobe able to merit  once again  the trust of the Assemblyand to serve  for the first time  in that body.The changes in today’s world call for the promotionof a culture of dialogue on a global scale based ontolerance and the respect for human dignity. TheUnited Nations should remain in the vanguard of thoseefforts  namely through initiatives such as the Allianceof Civilizations. I would like to congratulate the HighRepresentative of the Alliance of Civilizations forhis leadership and work in the defence of peace andof a better understanding among peoples. Indeed  thedialogue among different cultures  civilizations andreligions is at the very heart of the work of the UnitedNations.In conclusion  today  as in the past  the UnitedNations has to reflect on what it is and what wecollectively want it to be. It should translate theindispensable convergence of the common will ofStates into actions that contribute to a better world.Its central objective should be the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and greater prosperityfor all. Portugal stands steadfast in its commitment tothose efforts."
"143",5819,"PRY",67,2012,"﻿Atthe opening of my statement in today’s general debate allow me to express to Mr. Vuk Jeremić  Presidentof the General Assembly  the satisfaction felt by theRepublic of Paraguay at seeing him preside over thework of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventhsession. He can be assured of my delegation’s constantsupport during his time in office. Allow me also tocongratulate Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasserfor his important and effective work as President ofthe General Assembly at its previous session. I alsoextend my congratulations to Secretary-General BanKi-moon for his commendable work during the past sixyears at the head of the Organization  during which hedemonstrated his firm commitment to global peace andinternational security.In relation to the theme of the general debate “Bringing about adjustment or settlement ofinternational disputes or situations by peaceful means” the Government of Paraguay once again asserts andconfirms the importance of settling disputes by peacefulmeans while respecting the principles of internationallaw. Relations between States would be fairer  moresupportive and more equitable were they governed byfull compliance with international law  the principlesof which guide and direct the peaceful settlement ofdisputes. In my country’s view  favouring politicalexpediency over treaty commitments is unacceptable because political considerations can never takeprecedence over formal international agreements.On this first and last time that I will addressthe General Assembly  I believe it is necessary andunavoidable to elucidate to the international communitythe political process that my country is currentlyundergoing. The history of Paraguay changed on thenight of 22 June. The National Congress  exercising itsconstitutional powers — and I would like to publiclyexpress my appreciation for the presence here today ofthe Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Paraguay senators and members of Parliament  the President of theChamber of Deputies  and persons of various politicalstripes — decided by near-unanimity to remove thethen-President from office by means of an impeachmentprocess established under the Constitution.The Paraguayan Congress sought in that manner toput an end to a very serious political crisis that threatenedthe country  in which 17 fellow countrymen had alreadylost their lives  and to avoid further bloodshed and griefon Paraguayan soil. As mandated by the Constitution andowing to my duty as Vice-President  I assumed officeas President of the Republic. Since then  in accordancewith my oath of office  I have been governing Paraguaypeacefully and democratically  fully respecting publicfreedoms. The Government of Paraguay  along with theoverwhelming majority of Paraguayans  takes pridein the fact that there are no political prisoners in thecountry  that nobody has been exiled  that freedomof the press and freedom of expression are fullyguaranteed  and that each and every right enshrined inhuman rights agreements signed within the frameworkof the United Nations  as well as in the Organization ofAmerican States  is ensured.Paraguay has normal diplomatic relations with thegreat majority of the States Members of the UnitedNations. We guarantee to all of them that Paraguaywill continue to work tirelessly in favour of peace andsecurity  the basic pillars of our Organization.Nonetheless  Paraguay finds itself in a difficultinternational situation  one created by its neighbours the members of the Southern Common Market and theUnion of South American Nations. Both entities haveadopted sanctions against the Republic of Paraguaywithout allowing it to exercise its right to defend itself a right that is clearly set forth in the internationalagreements that are invoked for the application ofsanctions. In violation of international treaties  thosecountries have attempted to become the custodians ofParaguayan democracy  putting aside the principle ofnon-intervention enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations.Throughout its history  Paraguay has repeatedlysuffered from arrogant interventions in its internalaffairs.The holocaust brought on by the War of the TripleAlliance  stemming from an unjustifiable coalition has still not faded from the memory of my people. Itdecimated my country’s population and destroyed itseconomy.In the short period that my Government has served our critics have been unable to find a single violation ofthe agreements that I have mentioned. The great JustoPastor Benítez  a famous Paraguayan politician  rightlymaintained that it is dangerous to be right where thereis no justice.Before humankind’s highest Assembly  I clearlystate that Paraguay will never accept interference inits internal affairs by foreign Powers. We will continueto build our democracy in accordance with the will ofthe Paraguayan people  and fully implement it throughour freely elected institutions. We are certain thatwe know how to get through this crucial period withdignity and integrity. We will not be subjugated. Wecall on members to reflect and work together to find thepath towards rebuilding South American integration which is currently compromised. Peace is built throughdialogue  to which we are open.Those who today wish to become leading actors inthe international community will have to acknowledgethat that is not possible without regional unity.Leadership is built through respect for internationallaw. That is the only way that we will have a commonposition on Security Council reform  which is a long-standing wish of the universal institution that embracesus.In such difficult times for the internationalcommunity  we will find solutions to our currentpolitical and economic difficulties only by puttinginternational institutions on the path for which theywere established  namely  to serve the women and menthat build humankind’s future day by day. Paraguay a founding member of the Organization  remainscommitted to that.The various events in different parts of our planetthis past year demonstrate the relevance and truevalidity of a forum such as the United Nations in theinternational arena. That is why there is an urgent needfor the courageous  innovative and profound reform ofits organs  structure and functions. Changes are neededto adapt the Organization so that it can respond withgreater effectiveness and agility to an internationalagenda that is very different from that which existedwhen the United Nations was conceived. Moreover  itfaces a shifting dynamic in the international picturethat was impossible to envision at its inception.That is why Paraguay calls on the internationalcommunity to strive towards the wonderful internationalutopia of a universal Organization governed by thestrong and the weak  the large and the small  and therich and the poor  all equal in a great world Assembly.Paraguay believes that it is necessary to insist that thereform process include the gradual elimination of theveto power.This year  on the twentieth anniversary of thehistoric United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment  held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and knownas the Earth Summit  we believe that it is necessaryto reaffirm the belief that sustainable developmentand its economic  social and environmental aspectsmust be the linchpin of the United Nations focus. TheRepublic of Paraguay therefore reaffirms its beliefin that goal and in the need to maintain the balancebetween economic development  social developmentand environmental protection as interdependent pillarsof human development.As the world’s largest producer per capita of cleanrenewable hydroelectric energy  which drives oureconomy and its industrialization  we will use thatenergy for the country’s development for the benefit ofthe Paraguayans and foreigners who inhabit our landand shape its future. That energy  which we will uselittle by little  will be another driver of our well-being.The issue of landlocked developing countries(LLDCs) is an important aspect of Paraguay’s foreignpolicy. The asymmetry and disadvantages of ourgeographical position have caused and continue tocause a huge problem that can be offset only throughinternational recognition and special and differentiatedtreatment on the part of the developed economies thatseeks to include Paraguay in the globalized world.In that regard  on 12 September  during the recentfourth Meeting of Trade Ministers of LandlockedDeveloping Countries  a group that Paraguay had thehonour of chairing during the biennium 2010-2011 the need for transit States  in the first place  and theinternational community  as a whole  to duly recognizethe comparative disadvantages of our countries inrelation to the conditions needed for their developmentwas underscored.Paraguay wishes to reiterate here its commitment tointernational peace and security. In the specific contextof United Nations peacekeeping operations  it affirmsits political willingness to continue contributinghuman resources to such operations. Regionally  wehighlight the progress achieved by the United NationsStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Paraguayincreased its deployment to MINUSTAH by morethan 100 troops to show its firm commitment to thereconstruction of a brother country devastated by thescourges of nature.I would also like to underscore the effort andcommitment of the Paraguayan military observers inthe increasingly difficult situation in the Syrian ArabRepublic  where they have remained  even in the mostdifficult circumstances. I take this opportunity to paytribute to those soldiers who perform their duties  inmany parts of the world  with dedication  hard work andsacrifice in the service of the United Nations. Today we must all also remember the obligation of MemberStates to protect and defend the security of diplomaticand consular premises in all countries.Paraguay is increasingly concerned about thegrowth in transnational organized crime in its worstmanifestations  namely  drug trafficking on a large and asmall scale  arms trafficking and trafficking in migrantsand in persons  among others. Those transnationalcrimes stem mainly the social and economic inequalityof our peoples. Joint international efforts are needed therefore  in order to fight such scourges head on. TheGovernment of Paraguay reaffirms its unequivocalcommitment to the fight against all activities ofcriminal organizations and calls for a stronger positionon the part of developed countries  where most of thedemand associated with those crimes originates.Paraguay also reaffirms its strong condemnationof terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Forthat reason  Paraguay  through its Secretariat for thePrevention of the Laundering of Money and Goods andin close cooperation with other national institutions has made a coordinated effort to bring its legal andnormative framework in line with its commitments andwith the recommendations made by the internationalorganizations charged with preventing and prosecutingcrimes related to money laundering and the financingof terrorism. Laws and resolutions have been passedpursuant to the recommendations of the FinancialAction Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF). InFebruary 2012  Paraguay was removed from the FATF grey list and is now  as a result of our efforts  includedon the white list  a fact that we are proud of  as amember of our region and in line with our commitmentto the fight against money-laundering and the financingof terrorism.Promoting and building awareness of  and fullrespect for  human rights worldwide must continueto be one of the unchanging and incontrovertiblecommitments on our Organization’s internationalagenda. Human rights violations are a scourge thatmust forever be eradicated from our civilization.The Government of Paraguay reiterates that thegrowth of nations can be achieved only through socialequality  by prioritizing basic needs such as education health and land reform. Growth without socialdevelopment will only result in a world that is moreunequal and unjust.The Paraguayan Government is actively working tobuild a development model that gives priority to decentwork. In that regard we are promoting mechanismswithin the framework of a State policy aimed atimproving working conditions. They include  first the creation of a Ministry of Labour  Employmentand Social Security; secondly  the ratification ofthe Domestic Workers Convention No.189 of theInternational Labour Organization  adopted in 2011 bythe International Labour Conference in order to improvethe working conditions of thousands of domesticworkers in Paraguay; and thirdly  the implementationof an employment policy for young people througha bill aimed at enabling young people to enter theworkforce  which has been partially approved by theNational Congress.Since its beginning  my Government has maintainedits belief in and commitment to making inexorableprogress towards equal opportunities and rights forall of Paraguay’s inhabitants. In that regard  we havenever faltered in the constant struggle for full social economic  political and cultural rights for women. Asevidence of those firm beliefs  soon after assumingits duties  my Government decided to upgrade theSecretariat for Women’s Issues to an executive ministry in accordance with United Nations recommendations.Finally  in that respect  I must mention our satisfactionwith  and full commitment to  Paraguay’s election for anew term as member of the Commission on the Statusof Women for 2013-2017.The Government of Paraguay  which I haveproudly led since the end of June  now has a historicdemocratic obligation to organize the general electionsscheduled for 21 April 2013 and to guarantee that theyare peaceful  transparent and exemplary. When the nextPresident takes office  on 15 August 2013  the soundnessof Paraguayan democracy will be confirmed. At thattime I will look into the eyes of my countrymen andthose of foreigners who live in our country and shapeour future alongside us and will be able to say: missionaccomplished. I ask God and the Virgin to help us andto bless us so that all Paraguayans together can movetowards the future that we want."
"144",5838,"PSE",67,2012,"﻿I wish tobegin by extending my appreciation to the heads of allthe delegations who in their statements to the Assemblystressed the urgency of progress towards the realizationof a just peace in our region  one which would allow thePalestinian people to enjoy their inalienable nationalrights.Developments over the past year have confirmedwhat we have persistently drawn attention to and warned of: the catastrophic danger of racist settlers moving intoour country. During the past months  attacks by terroristmilitias of Israeli settlers have become a daily reality with at least 535 attacks since the beginning of the year.We are facing relentless waves of attacks against ourpeople  our mosques  our churches and monasteries and our homes and schools. They are unleashing theirvenom against our trees  fields  crops and properties and our people have become fixed targets for acts ofkilling and torture  with the complete collusion of theoccupying forces and the Israeli Government.The escalation of settler attacks should notsurprise anyone  for it is the inherent byproduct ofthe continuation of the occupation and a Governmentpolicy that deliberately fosters the settlements andsettlers and deems their satisfaction to be an absolutepriority. And it is the inherent byproduct of the racistclimate fuelled by a culture of incitement in Israelicurriculums and extremist declarations and fatwas which are rife with hatred and are rooted in a seriesof discriminatory laws created and enacted over theyears against the Palestinian people by the Israelisecurity apparatus and courts. Those entities provideexcuse after excuse for the settlers’ crimes and fortheir accelerated release should one of them happento be arrested. Official and military commissions ofinquiry fabricate justifications for soldiers who havecommitted what are clearly considered war crimes andhave perpetrated acts of murder  torture and abuse ofpeaceful Palestinian civilians.Over the past year  since the convening of theGeneral Assembly’s previous session  the occupyingPower has persisted with its settlement campaign focusing on Jerusalem and its environs. It is a campaignclearly and deliberately aimed at altering the city’shistoric character and the glorious image of the HolyCity as etched in the minds of humankind. It is acampaign of ethnic cleansing against the Palestinianpeople of Jerusalem via the demolition of their homesand prevention of their reconstruction  the revocationof residency rights  the denial of basic services especially with regard to the construction of schools the closure of institutions and the impoverishment ofJerusalem’s community via a siege behind walls andcheckpoints. That chokes the City and prevents millionsof Palestinians from freely accessing its mosques churches  schools  hospitals and markets.The occupying Power has also continued itsconstruction and expansion of settlements in different areas throughout the West Bank and has continuedits suffocating blockade  as well as raids and attacksagainst our people in the Gaza Strip  who to this daysuffer from the disastrous impact of the destructive warof aggression committed against them a few years ago.Nearly 5 000 Palestinians remain captive as prisonersand detainees of conscious in Israel’s jails. In thatregard  we call upon the international community tocompel the Government of Israel to respect the GenevaConventions of 1949 and to investigate the conditionsof detention of Palestinian prisoners and detainees  andwe stress the need for their release. They are soldiers intheir people’s struggle for freedom  independence andpeace.At the same time  the occupying Power continuesto tighten the siege and impose severe restrictions onmovement  preventing the Palestinian Authority fromimplementing vital infrastructure projects and providingservices to its citizens  who are also being preventedfrom cultivating their land and deprived of water forirrigation. The occupying Power is also obstructing theestablishment of agricultural  industrial  tourism andhousing projects by the Palestinian private sector invast areas of the occupied Palestinian territory  whichare classified as areas subject to the absolute control ofthe occupation  areas that encompasses approximately60 per cent of the West Bank.The occupying Power continues to deliberatelydemolish what the Palestinian Authority isbuilding — projects funded by donor brethren andfriends — and is destroying the Authority’s buildingprojects involving roads  simple homes for its citizensand agricultural facilities. In fact  over the past 12months  the Israeli occupying forces demolished 510Palestinian structures in those areas and displaced 770Palestinians from their homes. Those measures havecaused great damage to our economy and impeded ourdevelopment programmes and private-sector activity.They compound the socioeconomic difficulties ofour people under occupation  a fact confirmed byinternational financial institutions. Israel’s overallpolicy is ultimately leading to the weakening of thePalestinian Authority  undermining its ability tocarry out its functions and projects and to implementits obligations. This threatens to undermine its veryexistence or cause its collapse.All of that is taking place in the context of an Israelipolitical discourse that does not hesitate to brandishaggressive  extremist positions. In many aspects and in their practical application on the ground  they incitereligious conflict. That is something we firmly reject based on our principles and convictions and due to ourunderstanding of what it means to fuel such fires in thissensitive area  which is full of explosive f lashpoints and how that can fuel the action of extremists fromvarious quarters  especially those trying to use tolerant monotheistic religions as an ideological justificationfor their terrorism.For our part  as proof of our seriousness and oursincere intention to create an opening in this impasse we conducted exploratory talks with the IsraeliGovernment at the beginning of the year  at the initiativeof the brotherly Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Wehave also encouraged the expressed desires of severalcountries to contribute to efforts to break the cycle ofdeadlock and have ourselves undertaken initiativesto create favourable conditions for the resumption ofnegotiations. Unfortunately  however  the result of allthose initiatives has been very negative.There can be only one reading of the IsraeliGovernment’s actions and practices in our homelandand of the positions it has presented to us regarding thesubstance of a final status agreement to end the conflictand achieve peace: that the Israeli Government rejectsthe two-State solution.The two-State solution — namely  the Stateof Palestine coexisting alongside the State ofIsrael — represents the spirit and essence of the historiccompromise embodied in the Declaration of Principles which was agreed to in Oslo and was signed  19 yearsago  by the Palestine Liberation Organization and theGovernment of Israel under the auspices of the UnitedStates of America and on the White House lawn. It isa compromise by which  for the sake of making peace the Palestinian people accepted to establish their Stateon only 22 per cent of the territory of historic Palestine.Recent years have actually witnessed a systematicacceleration and intensification of Israeli measuresaimed at gutting the Oslo Accords of their meaning while simultaneously building facts on the ground inthe occupied Palestinian territory that are making theimplementation of the Accords extremely difficult  ifnot completely impossible.The Israeli Government aims to continue itsoccupation of East Jerusalem  to de facto annex largeareas of the rest of the occupied Palestinian territoryand to continue occupying a large portion of the territory under different designations. It refuses toengage in any serious discussion of the issue of thePalestinian refugees. It wants to continue its occupationof Palestinian aquafers and its control over the mostfertile agricultural areas in our land  as well as over ourair  skies water  borders and our life in its entirety.The final map and borders that can be drawn inaccordance with Israel’s official positions reveal to ussmall Palestinian enclaves surrounded by large Israelisettlement blocs and walls and checkpoints  and vastsecurity zones and roads reserved for settlers. Theenclaves would therefore remain subject to the fulldominance of military and settler occupation  onlypackaged under new names  such as the unilateralplan for a so-called State with provisional borders. Irepeat — a State with provisional borders. That is aproject that we categorically reject from A to Z becauseit will not bring about peace.Israel refuses to end the occupation and refuses toallow the Palestinian people to attain their freedom andindependence. It rejects the establishment of the Stateof Palestine. Israel is promising the Palestinian peoplea new catastrophe — a new Naqba — a new setback.I speak on behalf of an angry people who feelthat while they demand their right to freedom  adopt aculture of peace and adhere to the principles and rulesof international law and resolutions of internationallegitimacy  rewards continue to be illogically bestowedupon Israel  whose Government pursues a policy ofwar  occupation and settler occupation. Israel continuesto be permitted to enjoy impunity  and some continueto obstruct the adoption of a decisive position regardingits violations of international law and covenants. Thatrepresents a licence for the occupation to continueits policy of dispossession and ethnic cleansing andencourages it to entrench its system of apartheid againstthe Palestinian people.Despite our genuine feelings of anger  we — inthe name of the Palestine Liberation Organization  thesole legitimate representative of the Palestinianpeople — will not allow our country to be divided intwo.We are the sole legitimate representative of thePalestinian people. I reaffirm without hesitation thatwe are as committed — equally and by the samemeasures — to peace and international legitimacy andits covenants and resolutions as we are to upholdingour inalienable national rights and aspirations. And we reaffirm that we are committed to non-violenceand reject terrorism in all its forms  particularly Stateterrorism.Despite our disappointment  we continue to sincerelyextend a hand to the Israeli people to make peace. Werealize that ultimately the two peoples must live andcoexist  each in their respective State  in the Holy Land.Furthermore  we realize that progress towards makingpeace can be achieved through negotiations betweenthe Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel.Despite all the complexities of the prevailingreality and all the frustrations that abound  we saybefore the international community that there is stilla chance — maybe the last — to save the two-Statesolution and to salvage peace. However  this urgent taskmust be pursued via a new approach.Whoever rushes to advise us to repeat an experiencethat has proven to be futile  such as negotiations withthe Israeli Government without clear terms of reference must understand that this will result in the reproductionof failure and again provide cover for consecrating theoccupation and will deal the final blow to an alreadydying peace process. Whoever advises us to wait mustrealize that the hotbeds of tension and the festeringsituation in our country and our region have their owntiming and cannot withstand further procrastinationand delay  nor are they amenable to being relegated tothe bottom of the global agenda.The approach required for salvaging the chance forpeace must  first and foremost  be predicated on theunderstanding that the racist settler occupation mustbe condemned  punished and boycotted so that it iscompletely halted and eliminated. That approach alsorequires a reaffirmation of  and adherence to  the termsof reference and the foundations of the solution to theconflict  which have been endorsed by all here.We do not need to belabour the core componentsof a just solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.Rather  what is needed is the will to implement thosecomponents. Marathon negotiations are not required todefine them  rather it is the genuine and sincere intentionto reach peace that is needed. Those components areby no means a mysterious puzzle or intractable riddle;they are the clearest and best-known secrets in theworld. They include  in brief  the establishment of anindependent State of Palestine  with East Jerusalem asits capital  over the entire territory occupied by Israelsince 1967  and the realization of a just  agreed solution to the Palestine refugee issue  in accordance withresolution 194 (III)  as prescribed in the Arab PeaceInitiative.The fundamental components of the solution tothe conflict exist in the documents and resolutions ofthe United Nations. Member States already have them.The components of the solution are also endorsed inresolutions of regional organizations  beginning withthe League of Arab States  the Organization of IslamicCooperation  the Non-Aligned Movement and theAfrican Union. They can also be found in the statementsof the European Union and the international Quartet.However  what is the use of all those terms of referenceif Israel continues to refuse  and is encouraged byothers to continue to oppose the terms of reference?The international community  embodied in theUnited Nations  is required now more than ever to upholdits responsibilities. The Security Council is called uponto urgently adopt a resolution comprising the pillarsand foundations for a solution to the Palestinian-Israeliconflict that would serve as a binding term of referenceand guide for all if the vision of two States  Israel andPalestine  is to survive and if peace is to prevail in theland of peace — the birthplace of Jesus  peace be uponhim  the ascension of the Prophet Muhammad  peacebe upon him  and the final resting place of Abraham peace be upon him — Palestine  the land of the threemonotheistic religions.All things considered  the establishment of a freeand independent State of Palestine is a sacred right ofthe Palestinian people and an entitlement that must berealized  for it has been overdue for too many decades.It is not a grant to be bestowed upon us by anyone. It isa right  and the Palestinian people are entitled to thatright.At the same time  the Palestinian Authority hasaffirmed  through the implementation of its Stateinstitution-building programmes  the ability to createan advanced model for an effective  modern Statethrough the development of the performance of itsinstitutions and public finance management andthrough the adoption of standards for transparency strict accountability and rules of good governance.Those achievements have been deemed by the AdHoc Liaison Committee for the Coordination ofthe International Assistance to Palestinians  theWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund toconstitute an impressive undertaking and success story. Those achievements were again commended in thelatest report just a few days ago  which confirmed thePalestinian Authority’s total readiness for the transitionto an independent State while at the same time stressingthat the Israeli occupation remained the only obstacleto the realization of the State of Palestine.During the previous session of the GeneralAssembly  we submitted our application forconsideration by the Security Council to allow theState of Palestine to assume its rightful place amongthe community of nations as a full Member of theUnited Nations. A major and hostile uproar was raisedby some against that political  diplomatic  peacefulstep par excellence aimed at saving the peace processby asserting its principles and foundation. Despite thefact that the overwhelming majority of the countriesof the world supported  and continues to support  ourapplication  our endeavour was aborted. I do not seeeven a single reason for opposing that request.Yet when the countries of the world had theopportunity to declare their stance without anyrestrictions or veto during the previous autumn  theyvoted  despite enormous pressure  in strong support of theacceptance of Palestine as a member State of UNESCO.A year has passed  and Palestine  the homeland ofMahmoud Darwish and Edward Said  is playing itsrole in UNESCO with a high level of responsibility andprofessionalism. Palestine is committed to internationalconventions and is cooperating with all member Statesin order to advance the objectives of the organizationand providing a model of what its positive  constructivecontribution in international organizations would be.In order to enhance the chances for peace  we willcontinue our efforts to obtain full membership forPalestine at the United Nations. For the same reason we have begun intensive consultations with variousregional organizations and Member States aimed atthe General Assembly’s adoption during this sessionof a draft resolution considering the State of Palestineas a non-member State of the United Nations. We areconfident that the vast majority of the countries of theworld support our efforts to bolster the chances for ajust peace. In our efforts we do not seek to delegitimizean existing State  that is  Israel; but rather to establishthe State that must be realized  that is  Palestine. Weare not trying to delegitimize them; they are trying todelegitimize us.More than 64 years have passed since Al-Nakbaand a large number of those who were its immediate victims and witnessed its horrors have died. They diedwith memories  preserved in their minds and hearts  oftheir beautiful world that was devastated  their warmhomes that were demolished and their peaceful villagesthat were erased from existence  and of the renaissancethat was undermined  and their loved ones  dearmen  women and children  who were killed in wars massacres  attacks  raids and incursions  and of theirbeautiful country that was a beacon of coexistence tolerance  progress and a crossroads of civilization.They died displaced and in refugee camps to whichthey were expelled following their uprooting from theirhomeland  as they awaited the moment in which theywould resume their suspended lives  complete theirinterrupted journey and repair their shattered dreams.They died while they clung to their legitimate humanright to justice  freedom and redress for the historicallyunprecedented injustice inf licted upon them. Has thetime not come to undo that injustice?At present  77 per cent of the Palestinian people areunder the age of 35. Although they did not experiencethe horrors of Al-Nakba  they know very well all itshorrendous details from the accounts of their parentsand grandparents who endured it. They continue tosuffer from its ongoing effects today and every dayas a result of the practices of the occupation and ofthe settlers on a land that is diminishing in size. Thehorizon before them is closed to their simple  ordinarydreams. They see their homeland and their present andfuture vulnerable to continued usurpation and they sayfirmly: we shall not allow a new Al-Nakba to happen.I say to the Assembly that the brave Palestinianpeople will not allow themselves to be the victimsof a new Al-Nakba. We will not allow that. We willstay on our land. My people will continue their epicsteadfastness and eternal survival journey in theirbeloved land  every inch of which carries evidence andlandmarks affirming their roots and unique connectionto the land throughout ancient history. There is nohomeland for us except Palestine and there is no landfor us but Palestine. We shall not accept an alternativehomeland  nor an alternative land. Palestine is ourhomeland and shall remain our homeland.Our people will continue to build the institutions oftheir State and strive to achieve national reconciliationto restore the unity of our nation  people and institutionsvia resorting to the ballot box  which will confirm ourpeople’s pluralistic democratic choice. Our peopleare also determined to continue peaceful popular resistance  consistent with international humanitarianlaw  against the occupation  against the settlements andfor the sake of freedom  independence and peace.Let us prevent the occurrence of a new Al-Nakbain the Holy Land. Let us support the realization of afree  independent State of Palestine now. Let peace bevictorious before it is too late."
"145",5884,"QAT",67,2012,"﻿At the outsetI would like to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić on hiselection as President of the General Assembly at itssixty-seventh session and to wish him all success.I would also like to express my thanks toMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  President of theGeneral Assembly at its previous session and one of themost capable Qatari diplomats  for his efforts to ensurethe successful work of the General Assembly. I would also like to seize this opportunity to thankSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his continued workin support of the role of the United Nations.These days  the Arab world is experiencing adifficult and risky period that is  at the same time  fullof hope. As a matter of fact  it is an impressive attemptto correct prevailing conditions in a region with aspecial history  at a time when the world order is rapidlychanging. The current period represents a special  newand unprecedented experience that forms part of humanhistory. Today’s experiences differ from the previousexperiences of nations and peoples who participatedin changing times. They accepted the necessaryconsequences and bore the costs with the knowledgethat the costs were consistent with moving forward atthe appropriate time in response to ambitions towardsfreedom  enlightenment  respect for the dignity of manand development. But the Arab experience of transitionis unique in its pace and process.Conditions in the Arab world  seen from afar may show disturbances and problems in many placeswith images of smoke and flames. However  I wouldlike  from this rostrum  to reassure all those who arefollowing the events in the region and may sometimesfeel uncomfortable about what they see and hear. Thoseevents represent the movement of a nation struggling tocope with the times and continue its forward march  asit has many times before. Yet now that march has beeninterrupted by obstacles  both external and internal andregional and international.Those obstacles have frustrated its will and derailedits march. But it has recently taken matters into its ownhands after having suffered dictatorship  dependenceand corruption.We remember that the American political and socialexperience was born of a civil war that the countryhad to undergo to affirm its unity. Today’s Europeexperienced terrible world wars until it achieved adegree of unity that could not be achieved by arms orhegemony. And Asia has seen highly successful casesof nations advancing and achieving their aspirations after long periods of painful new birth.I say this to assure whoever cares about our partof the world and its future that what is going on in ourregion is natural and historic.It is not reasonable to expect that people can attaintheir freedom as soon as they ask for it. Human history shows that peoples have sacrificed their lives and wealthto gain freedom. In the same way  dictatorships do notchange at the first signs of revolution but require realresistance to depose them. The desire for advancementwill not eliminate backwardness except through hardwork. Occupied territories will never be restored by amere rejection of the occupation  but by persistence indemanding rights and by resistance using all legitimatemeans.What adds to the difficulties of the transition inour Arab world is that it takes place in a time of greataspirations and a climate subject to all sorts of changesand complications. Our peoples have had to fight tochange their lives under circumstances that differgreatly from those faced by others in similar situations.In America  Europe  Asia and other places  historicaltransitions have taken place within certain limits. In theArab world  however  that birth has had to take placeunder spotlights  before the eyes of the entire world under the watchful eye of satellites crisscrossing spaceand shaped by electronic media  without any shield orbarrier of any sort.In order to achieve their objectives  those whoundertake internal and external interventions to peoplesfrom attaining their legitimate rights do not hesitateto use all means at their disposal  from exploitationof the past and its complex legacy to other means ofprovocation. They can even use arms  shedding seas ofblood  if other means fail or take too long. All of thathas made our transition from past to future and frombackwardness to development a risky process  underfire from all corners.Together with others  we realized the risks inherentin the current phase of the evolution of our nation and ofthe Arab world. If we could ask for one thing during thissession  it would be an encouraging reconfirmation ofthe right of our Arab world to continue its advancementand achieve its aspirations in a new world  a worldshaped by science and technology  a world that thepioneers who wrote the well-known conventions onrights and freedom could not have imagined.On the other hand  I hope that this world gatheringwill take a stand that reflects sympathy with thehistoric transformations under way in the Arab world.That would reassure the people who are workinghard and with determination to carve out a place forthemselves in history and who struggle to achievefreedom and dignity  hoping for a better tomorrow forfuture generations.The situation in Syria has reached an unacceptablephase. Hundreds of innocent Syrians are killed everyday  under the fire of a regime that does not hesitateto use all sorts of weapons against its own people. Wehave used all available means to help Syria extricateitself from the cycle of killing  but in vain. The SecurityCouncil has failed to reach an effective position.In view of that  I believe that the Arab countriesthemselves should intervene  in order to fulfil theirnational humanitarian  political and military duties  anddo what is necessary to stop the bloodshed in Syria  thekilling of innocent people and their displacement andguarantee a peaceful transition of power. We do havea precedent in that respect. Arab forces intervened inLebanon in the mid-1970s to stop the internal fightingthere  and their efforts proved effective and useful. Weurge all countries that believe in the cause of the Syrianpeople to provide every type of support to that peopleuntil they are able to secure their legitimate rights.Despite all the suffering in the Middle East  thecore problem remains the Palestinian question: thecontinued Israeli occupation of the Arab territoriesin the West Bank  the Golan and Shaba’a farms insouthern Lebanon  the stif ling blockade imposed on theGaza Strip and the continued arrest and imprisonmentof thousands of Palestinians in Israeli prisons. Thepeace process has stalled because of the currentIsraeli position that insists on continuing the policy ofsettlements in the Palestinian territories and Jerusalemand refusing to cede them.Sometimes I would like to ask why the internationalcommunity does nothing to implement the relevantresolutions on the Middle East. Why does the SecurityCouncil not adopt a resolution under Chapter VII thatwould force Israel to lift the blockade of Gaza and stopits settlement activity  a resolution that would returnthe peace process to the comprehensive track instead ofthe piecemeal approach  which does not lead to results?I find no answer to my questions.We firmly believe in the importance of the freedomof expression and the right of people to express theiropinion based on our belief in the sanctity of humanityand the dignity of man  who was created by God asfree and dignified. At the same time  we believe thatfreedom should not exceed reasonable limits andbecome a tool to hurt and insult the dignity of others orther dignity of religions  faiths and sacred beliefs. This is a phenomenon that we have seen lately and which hasregrettably led to the killing of innocent people.We have called and we continue to call for dialoguein order to exchange information and experience. Wehave called and continue to call for dialogue amongcivilizations and religions. We have established theDoha International Centre for Interfaith Dialogue.We have called and still call for dialogue aimed atacquainting ourselves with ideas and experiences fromall over the globe and to learn about different faiths inorder to ensure that human culture is interconnected andeveryone has a say in its creation. Everyone should reapits dividends  based on understanding  appreciation knowledge and the full exercise of rights.I have on previous occasions reiterated theimportance of that question and the need to strike abalance between respect for sacred faiths and religionsand freedom of expression in order for tolerance toreplace intolerance and acceptance of the other toreplace rejection and stereotyping  which is neither fairnor right. Today  I would like to take this opportunity tocall on the United Nations  those who exercise wisdomand reason and those who have decision-making powerat the international level to drsft internationally agreedlaws  procedures and controls aimed at preventingreligions and faiths from being insulted under anypretext and  at the same time  upholding the right ofmankind to know and express its opinions.Ms. Flores (Honduras)  Vice-President  took theChair.One of the great challenges that we must face isthe question of climate change and its terrible anddestructive consequences for all countries. Thisrequires us to cooperate and work together to reachthe best solutions to that challenge and overcome ourdifferences.I would like to note that the State of Qatar will hostthe eighteenth session of the Conference of the Parties tothe United Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange. The importance of this conference is that itcould produce a road map that could help us deal withthe negative effects of this phenomenon. I would liketake the opportunity of speaking in this internationalforum to invite all countries of the world to participatein the conference so that we may reach an internationalconsensus on the matter.Before concluding  I would like to welcome theelection of our brother Hassan Sheikh Mohamud asPresident of the Somali Republic  and to wish himevery success in achieving security and stability in thatcountry  whose people have suffered so much. I callon the international community to exert greater effortto help Somalia to reach a solution to its crisis that isacceptable to all the Somali parties  one that will pavethe way for the return of peace to the country and willhelp rebuild the State after the long years of war anddestruction."
"146",5930,"ROU",67,2012,"﻿Thecurrent session of the General Assembly gives us acomplete picture of today’s world with all its challengesand opportunities. We can also glimpse various pathsopening up before us to help us meet the needs ofhumankind and of nations.I would like to focus on the three main areas ofactivity of the United Nations — peace and security;development; and human rights  democracy and the ruleof law. In our approach we believe that the realities of thelast decade have confirmed the profound and complexinterdependence that exists between these areas. Thereis no peace and security without development andrespect for human rights and democracy. Developmentis a catalyst for democracy and respect for human rights and  at the same time  an essential factor for peaceand security. In their turn  respect for human rights democracy and the rule of law strengthen developmentand create the conditions for lasting peace and security.New situations of internal instability  civil strifeand insecurity  with spillover effects  have arisen in theMiddle East and other regions. It is regrettable that thenew session of the Assembly is beginning in the shadowof the sorrow over the recent events in Benghazi.Attacks on diplomatic representatives are unacceptablefor any reason. Diplomats are bridges between cultures links among nations. Their inviolability is part ofancient custom. I strongly condemn the attacks andoffer my sincere condolences to the families of thevictims. The perpetrators must be brought to justicethrough a fair and equitable trial. At the same time  theideals of democracy must be preserved. Stability andthe rule of law should be the future pillars of societyin Libya and elsewhere. We are firmly committed tosupporting the efforts of the international communityto consolidate stability and security  tolerance andreligious understanding.Throughout 2012 we have been confronted with thedire effects of the crisis in Syria  where human rightsviolations are now rampant. The Syrian Government must comply with its international commitments andobligations relating to human rights. Justice must bedone in all cases of violations of human rights and allthose who are guilty must be permitted a fair trial even if it was not something they allowed their victims.Romania has stated throughout that it is imperativethat the international community curb the escalatingviolence in Syria; and of course we favour a politicalsolution.In that regard  I would like to voice our firm supportfor the mission of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi in his newcapacity as Special Representative of the United Nationsand the League of Arab States for Syria. We were alsoa wholehearted supporter of the full implementationof the Joint Special Envoy’s six-point plan for Syriaand  similarly  gave full and direct support to theactivitiees of the United Nations Supervision Missionin the Syrian Arab Republic. In that context  I wouldlike to remind the Assembly that Romanian monitorswere part of its structure. I strongly believe that theonly future for Syria must be an inclusive one for allSyrians  irrespective of religion or ethnic group. Anyother option would be nothing less than a nightmare.The time has come for a more structured responseon the part of the United Nations  based on a consensusapproach by the Security Council. Obviously  wecannot and should not allow violence to prevail whenpeople in Syria rely on our capacity to offer stabilityand predictability and when regional stability andsecurity are at stake.Recent developments in the area of peace andsecurity  at both the global and regional levels  donot offer many reasons for optimism. The year 2012has seen limited progress with the Middle East peaceprocess. The expectations raised by the statement of theQuartet for the Middle East on 23 September 2011 willremain unfulfilled as long as direct Israeli-Palestiniannegotiations are not resumed.Romania is a strong supporter of all efforts toachieve a comprehensive peace in the Middle East.We support all the initiatives of the Quartet and thefull implementation of the road map’s vision of twoStates  Israeli and Palestinian  living side by side inpeace and security. We are also concerned about thelack of progress in finding negotiated solutions toprotracted conflicts in the Black Sea region  such asthose in Transnistria and Nagorno Karabakh and thatin Georgia involving Abkhazia and South Ossetia. We must all keep our attention focused on these unsettledsituations. Meanwhile  we express our satisfactionwith the efforts carried out over the past 12 months bythe special representatives of the United Nations  theEuropean Union and the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe.Over the past year  the Security Council reactedpromptly to new crises by adopting resolutions aimedat preventing the escalation of conflict or calling for there-establishment of constitutional order or for efforts byall the parties involved to find negotiated solutions tonew problems. The resolutions adopted have not alwaysmet expectations. In spite of the fact that the mandatesof several United Nations peacekeeping missions wereextended  little progress was made.Under the auspices of the United Nations  througha joint innovative and intellectual effort  the conceptualapproach has been enlarged to include human security the responsibility to protect  and mediation. Thereis still a long way to go before those concepts areoperational. When the time comes  Romania standsready to implement them.New categories of participants must be includedin our common endeavour. Beside Governments non-governmental organizations  civil society parliaments and local communities are already actingto identify optimal solutions. Based on my previousexperience as Chairman of the Foreign AffairsCommittee of the Senate  I consider that the role ofparliaments as elected bodies could be increased inprevention activities or in efforts to settle existingconflicts. In that respect  cooperation and interactionbetween the United Nations  national parliaments andthe Inter-Parliamentary Union in peacebuilding effortsis highly relevant.Over the past 15 years  my country has taken akeen interest in  and offered important contributionsto  civilian and military missions under United Nationsmandates. Today Romania is honoured and proud tohave contributed in a consistent way to various UnitedNations operations. I pay my deepest respect to the menand women of Romania who have lost or risked theirlives in conflict areas  as well as to all the military police  gendarmes and civilian personnel serving allover the world to bring peace and security under thef lag of the United Nations.As I have already mentioned  development isequally a major area of interest  action and cooperation within the United Nations. One area where we couldfind solutions within the United Nations framework isimproving the functioning of the banking and financialsystems and institutions. National and internationalbanking and financial institutions should becomeever greater partners for Governments — a part of thesolution to the economic crises confronting countriesand regions.Young people are the future of our nations and ofour world. The United Nations has  in the past  takemup the problems facing younger generations  includingthrough programmes of action adopted by the GeneralAssembly. The time has come to revisit this area ofinterest to assess the achievements as well as the stepsto be taken in order to meet the current expectationsand needs of youth.We should reconsider from a broader perspective thevital role of the education sector in providing support especially but not exclusively  to young people. Suchsupport should include universal access for youngergenerations to education; professional training allowingrapid and efficient integration into the labour market;and participation in  and contribution to  the shaping offuture societies in all the countries  especially in thosein transition.For many years now  water has been a major concernas climate change affects its availability in all regions.Water  our planet’s most precious resource  must not beallowed to become our most disputed resource and asource of bitter conflict.Our attention should be focused on the follow-up toand implementation of the decisions recently adoptedby the United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment. Relevant resolutions on enhancementof the institutional framework for sustainabledevelopment  agreement on sustainable developmentgoals  and determination of certain financial aspects ofthe achievement of those goals are expected by all of us.I should like to share some thoughts relating to thearea of human rights  which is of growing relevancefor our cooperation in the framework of the UnitedNations. International cooperation and discussionspromoting human rights received renewed momentumwith the establishment of the Human Rights Council.As an elected member of the Council since it beganits work  Romania has contributed to the development and adoption of its working methods  based on a moreanalytical approach as well as on in-depth cooperationand interactive dialogue with Member States. Themain objective of the Romanian presidency of theHuman Rights Council in 2007 was to strengthenand more actively promote human rights at the globallevel. We believe that the universal periodic reviewis an appropriate instrument for implementing theinternational protection of human rights in all itsaspects. It can also respond to new human rightschallenges  such as those posed by the Internet.This spring in Geneva  Romania  together withMorocco  Norway  Peru  Qatar and Tunisia  promoted adraft resolution entitled “Human rights  democracy andthe rule of law”  which was sponsored by 124 countriesfrom all regional groups. The broad support for theresolution  and the large number of Member Statesthat supported its adoption by the Council  confirmsthe interest of Member States in this subject. We sawa broad recognition of the close interlinkage of humanrights  democracy and the rule of law. We would like tosee in the near future the same approach taken by theGeneral Assembly in the form of a similar resolution.In that respect  Romania is ready to set to work and toact together with other interested Member States.In conclusion  I would like to reaffirm my country’scommitment to the principles and values promotedand constantly enhanced by the United Nations. Werecognize that there is no alternative to the frameworkof cooperation offered by the United Nations system which aims to resolve the complex and interrelatedproblems of our day. Reforming and adapting thesystem to the new realities of the world depends entirelyupon us as Member States. It depends on our politicalwill as political leaders. By doing so  we will meet theexpectations of our peoples."
"147",5976,"RUS",67,2012,"﻿For over a year and a half  the situation in theMiddle East and North Africa has been the nerve centreof global politics. The deep changes that have sweptover the region intertwine with the key problems ofmodern international relations and require everyone totake a comprehensive approach and to reject simplisticand ideology-driven patterns and double standards.Russia has consistently supported peoples in theiraspiration to determine their destiny and to pave theway to more effective models of public governance.We believe it is particularly important to carry outthose transformations in a non-violent way and withoutoutside interference. We strongly believe that allmembers of the international community should beinterested in making the Middle East-North Africaregion peaceful  stable  democratic and free fromdomestic and inter-State conflicts. So far  however there has been no progress in reaching unanimity inthe efforts of outside players to create conditions forachieving that goal.Of particular concern is the deepening internalconflict in Syria. We have consistently called forconsolidated efforts by the international communityto compel the Government and its opponents toimmediately cease the violence  come to the negotiatingtable and work out a compromise on the content andpace of reforms that would satisfy all Syrians andensure the safety and rights of all ethnic and religiousgroups. That was the substance of the consensusrecorded in the final communiqué of the Action Groupfor Syria (S/2012/523  annex)  agreed upon in Genevaas a follow-up to the Kofi Annan plan.We call upon all members of the Action Groupto fully abide by the commitments we all took on inGeneva. That is the fastest way to stop the loss of humanlife in Syria. We proposed a Security Council resolutionendorsing the Geneva communiqué as the basis fornegotiations at the beginning of the transitional period  but that proposal was blocked. Those who oppose theimplementation of the Geneva communiqué bear anonerous responsibility. They insist on a ceasefire bythe Government alone and encourage the oppositionto intensify hostilities  in fact pushing Syria evendeeper into the abyss of bloody internecine strife. Themilitarization of the conflict continues  with calls foropen intervention.Extremist organizations including Al-Qaidahave become more active in Syria. They perpetrateterrorist attacks against innocent civilians and civilinfrastructure. The number of war crimes is growing  onthe part of both Government forces and the opposition as recorded in the recent report of the Human RightsCouncil’s commission of inquiry (A/HRC/21/50).Russia resolutely condemns any violence  whereverit comes from  and is convinced that there is still anopportunity to undertake collective action. Practicalsteps to overcome the crisis need to begin with acomprehensive ceasefire  the release of prisoners andhostages and the provision of additional humanitarianaid. That would create the conditions to start aninter-Syrian dialogue. We hope that Lakhdar Brahimi Joint Special Representative of the United Nations andthe League of Arab States  will be able to bring his vastexperience to bear on moving towards an agreement onsuch arrangements  with the support of the internationalcommunity. Russia will provide its full support topromote the success of his mission.The changes taking place in the Middle Eastshould not marginalize the Palestinian problem. Theachievement of a comprehensive  just and lasting Arab-Israeli settlement  which should lead  among otherresults  to the establishment of an independent  viableand contiguous Palestinian State  coexisting in peaceand security with Israel  would be a major contributionto the normalization of the overall regional situation.The Arab Peace Initiative fully retains its relevance and we support the efforts of the League of Arab Statesto move it forward.I also wish to stress the importance of implementingthe decision on convening in 2012 a conference onestablishing in the Middle East a zone free of weaponsof mass destruction and their means of delivery (seeNPT/CONF/2010/50 (Vol.I)). It is clearly necessary toensure the participation in the conference of all States inthe region  and they should agree on key arrangements among themselves. In that matter  the League of ArabStates should play an important role.On the whole  we support closer ties between theUnited Nations and regional entities. I would notethat in our part of the world today a memorandum oncooperation was signed between the secretariat of theCollective Security Treaty Organization and the UnitedNations Department of Peacekeeping Operations. I amconvinced that it will increase the efficiency of commonefforts to ensure stability and security.All our actions should be founded solidly on theUnited Nations Charter  which makes no provisionfor the right to change regimes. It is unacceptable toimpose a political system on a country and its people.Our position was clearly stated by President VladimirPutin speaking at the Kremlin on 26 September. Theentire sequence of events in the Arab world and otherregions proves the futility of any such policy  which canlead to dangerous interethnic and interreligious clashesin international relations.We believe it is an obligation of all States to protectfrom provocations and blasphemy the religious feelingsof people of any religious affiliation. At the sametime  of course  there can be no justification for actsof terror  regardless of where they are committed  bethey in Libya  Syria  Iraq  Yemen or anywhere else.Attacks against diplomats or United Nations personnelare absolutely unacceptable.In general  we are convinced that today  when theworld is going through a transition period characterizedby instability in the spheres of the economy  politics andinter-civilizational relations  it is particularly importantfor United Nations Member States to be able to relyon accepted rules of conduct and to agree on a jointresponse to the threats to global stability. We shouldnot allow irresponsible actions dictated by expedientinterests to shatter the system of international law. Theworld order is threatened by arbitrary interpretationof such essential principles as the non-use or threat offorce  the peaceful settlement of disputes  respect forthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of States andnon-interference in their domestic affairs.Those are the key principles of the United NationsCharter  which confers the primary responsibility forthe maintenance of international peace and security onthe Security Council. In advancing the reform of theUnited Nations  it is essential to preserve the capacity ofthe Security Council to perform those functions. Their erosion would deprive the international community ofan essential mechanism for developing joint approachesto the settlement of crisis situations.It is appropriate to mention the compulsoryinstruments at the disposal of the United Nations. Underthe United Nations Charter the imposition of sanctionsfalls exclusively under the jurisdiction of the SecurityCouncil. Decisions must be made on a collegial basis with the understanding that sanctions should not leadto isolation of the State targeted for sanctions  butrather encourage it to engage in a dialogue to removequestions that the Member States may have. It isessential that sanctions should be well-measured andthat they not cause any suffering to the population. Inthe past the Security Council has discussed the issue ofthe humanitarian limits of sanctions  but somehow thediscussions have faded away. We believe it is importantto resume them.Another issue that needs to be discussed in theSecurity Council is the consequences of unilateralsanctions imposed by a State or a group of Statessidestepping the United Nations to advance theirpolitical goals. We have no doubt that such sanctions especially when they are applied extraterritorially weaken the unity of the international communityand undermine the effectiveness of its efforts. Formany years  the commercial  economic and financialrestrictions imposed by the United States on Cubahave remained an illustration of the negative impactof unilateral sanctions. Russia  together with theoverwhelming majority of members of the internationalcommunity  calls for the swift lifting of the blockade which is a relic of the Cold War.Special attention should be given to the practicalenforcement of Security Council decisions regardingsanctions against non-State actors and illegal cross-border formations. In general  the events of recentyears have clearly shown that unilateral action whichviolates international law and circumvents or distortsthe decisions of the Security Council does no good.Of course  the legal norms of international affairswill be further adjusted as necessary. But thesetransformations should be treated with the greatestsense of responsibility and full consciousness of theserious risks involved. Consensus should be the soleroute to their adoption. Violations of internationallaw should not be portrayed as some sort of creativedevelopment.All of this is related to the debate regarding theconcept of the so-called responsibility to protect. Furtherdiscussion of this concept should be held on the basisof the approach agreed on at the 2005 World Summit which reaffirmed the need to observe the principles ofthe Charter of the United Nations when responding toconflicts within States. The protection of civilians is anissue far too serious to be exploited to achieve politicalgoals. The ambiguity of the so-called responsibility-to-protect concept can be better understood in light ofinitiatives formulated by Brazil and several other Statesto move towards consensus.Let us not forget that the founders of the UnitedNations  in their wisdom  agreed upon and endorseda Charter that enshrined principles for the regulationof a multipolar world order. Now that the abnormalbipolar period of the Cold War is over  and now thatit has become clear to all that there is no place formonopolarity in the modern world and internationalaffairs can only be polycentric  we have a uniquechance to fully implement the original potential of thatCharter.This is a difficult challenge. International relationsare clearly experiencing a lack of credibility. We regardthis as the main obstacle to practical progress towardsthe establishment of universal foundations for equaland indivisible security  whether in the Euro-Atlanticarea  Asia-Pacific region or other parts of the world.Such a state of affairs clearly contradicts the conceptof collective security embodied in the Charter and thedeep interdependence of the modern world  where mostchallenges and threats are common to us all and have across-border dimension.Strengthening confidence and collective principlesin international affairs  with the emphasis onnegotiating the pursuit of compromise solutions  wouldhelp substantially reduce the level of instability andmove forward in the settlement of crisis situations  notonly in the Middle East  but also with respect to Iran Afghanistan  the Korean peninsula and other situationsthroughout the world.The final goal of the efforts to settle a conflict isto ensure the right to life and other fundamental humanrights  be they political  economic or social. The eventsof recent years confirm that  without lasting peace andsustainable development  it is impossible to ensurehuman rights. In turn  the protection of human rightsshould contribute to security and development  rather than serve as a pretext for illegal interference in thedomestic affairs of States.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights statesthat everyone is entitled to an international order inwhich their rights can be fully realized. Those who usemilitary force and sanctions  bypassing the Charter engage in illicit supplies of arms  or provide cover forterrorists grossly violate this right.Russia stands for the implementation of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and respect forthe traditional values on which human civilization isbased and where all world religions converge. This isa moral foundation of modern society. It is the cementthat bonds together nations and peoples. In recentyears  these values have been put to the test by displaysof immorality  extremism and racial intolerance. Ofsimilar concern are the even more assertive actionsof those who  citing freedom of speech  condone theglorification of the Nazis and their accomplices anddesecrate the memory of the victims of the SecondWorld War and the victors of fascism. Such actions areincompatible with the obligations of States under theCharter of the United Nations.Let me recall that the International Covenanton Civil and Political Rights directly prohibits thepropaganda of war and incitement of national andreligious discord. This means that freedom of speechand assembly cannot be used to justify the promotionof Nazi or other radical or extremist views  in violationof the basic principles and norms of international law.Yesterday  the Human Rights Council endorsed aresolution proposed by Russia on the interrelation ofhuman rights and traditional values. It is regrettablethat a number of Western States voted against thisdocument  which is especially relevant today.Progress towards genuine partnership ininternational relations is possible only on the basisof equality and mutual respect. The course of eventsin the world leaves no alternative for anyone but tojoin efforts in order to build a stable  equitable anddemocratic international system. It would be possibleto resist this objective trend and try to preserve the oldorder for some time  but such resistance would cost yetmore lives  suffering and destruction. Let us displayour vision and  instead of looking back at the history ofprevious centuries  take the side of the events unfoldingbefore us today  and answer the call for strong collectivestatesmanship."
"148",6023,"RWA",67,2012,"﻿It is timely that we are meetinghere over the next few days to seek ways and meansto prevent and generally manage conflicts. Whileit may seem that conflict is perennial and its formsincreasingly destructive  we have the urgent task ofseeking more effective ways to prevent  manage andsolve it. The losses we witness or experience on adaily basis in terms of human life and devastation areunacceptable. Moreover  at a time when widespreadpoverty robs too many people of the opportunity torealize their full potential in life  conflict also divertsus from development. We might ask ourselves why  after decades ofefforts to rein in conflict on a global scale and fostermultilateral cooperation for sustainable peace  theresults are still not where they should be. The reasonsfor this are several and multifaceted.First  we must appreciate that many conflicts arisewhen people are  or feel they are  excluded from fullparticipation in the affairs of their country  particularlyaround issues that affect their everyday lives. Evena cursory look at the conflict hotspots around theworld shows us the dangerous consequences of adisenfranchised and despondent citizenry. Durablesolutions can come only from an inclusive approach toboth politics and development.Secondly  thorough analysis of the specificpolitical and cultural contexts of any given conflictis key to finding lasting solutions. Too often  theinclination is to parachute into a situation with ready-made answers based on a superficial examination ofthe conflict’s dynamics  doing considerably moreharm than good  despite good intentions. There isno one-size-fits-all remedy; these issues are complexand should be approached as such to arrive at the bestpossible outcome.Thirdly  the links between conflict anddevelopment are often overlooked. If we are lookingfor peaceful ways to resolve and prevent conflicts promoting development tops the list. The stakes arehigh. A civil conflict costs the average developingcountry about 30 years of gross domestic productgrowth  and violence can easily spill over borders  threatening hard-won progress. Since security anddevelopment cannot be achieved without each other  weall — from the average citizen to Government leadersand global institutions like the United Nations — haveto play our roles in order to find inclusive solutions forlasting peace and prosperity.Finally  it is increasingly obvious that local orregional initiatives aimed at resolving conflicts yieldmore positive results because those involved havea deeper understanding of the issues at hand. Theirproximity to the conflict makes them more invested ina comprehensive resolution and enables the necessarysupport for whatever process is agreed upon. We needto see these initiatives strengthened. We should behighlighting root causes as we address conflicts.In the 50 years of our independence andmembership of the United Nations  Rwanda has livedthrough conflicts. Our country was destroyed bypolitical exclusion and subsequent genocide. Over thepast 18 years  we have been able to rebuild the countrythrough policies that include all citizens in governanceprocesses and by applying home-grown conflictresolution and development mechanisms.While our experience with the United Nationssince becoming a Member has been a mixed one  ithas taken on a positive trajectory in recent years  andwe are optimistic that it will remain there. The historyof how conflicts have been handled in Rwanda  andindeed in our region  however  shows that improvementis needed. It is our obligation to point this out not inorder to be critical  but because we subscribe to theideals and principles on which the United Nations wasfounded. We can and should do better.Rwanda remains committed to a more effectiveUnited Nations  particularly with respect to its worktowards a more peaceful  just and equitable world. Wewill continue to contribute to various programmes fordevelopment and peace  from our role in promoting theMillennium Development Goals and supporting theBroadband Commission for Digital Development to ourtroops participating in peacekeeping missions. We hopeto contribute and participate even more going forward.Let me conclude by saying that although thechallenge to better prevent and resolve conflict mayseem daunting  it remains ours to take on. When we seeleaders work with the people in an inclusive manner;when development can proceed unhindered by conflict;when regional groupings take greater responsibility in tackling their own issues; and when internationalcooperation takes place in a spirit of true partnership I believe that the results will speak for themselvesand billions of lives across the globe will improve.Ultimately  this is what we all should work towards."
"149",6060,"SAU",67,2012,"﻿At the outset  it gives me great pleasureto convey to Mr. Vuk Jeremić my sincere congratulationson his election as President of the General Assembly atits sixty-seventh session. We wish him every successin the performance of his duties and responsibilities particularly under the current critical circumstancesin which the international community finds itself atpresent. I would also take this opportunity to expressmy deep gratitude and appreciation to his predecessor Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  President ofthe General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  whofulfilled his mandate with wisdom and professionalism.Moreover  it gives me pleasure to commend once morethe great efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon inserving the Organization and promoting its messageaimed at achieving international peace and security especially under difficult and critical circumstances.The Palestinian issue  which is at the core of theArab-Israeli conflict  has been a constant challengefor the United Nations since its inception more than60 years ago. The cause of the stalemate is Israel’sattitude. We all know how intransigent Israel has beenin its positions  which have undermined negotiationsand have emptied all discussions of any meaning.Moreover  Israel has taken unilateral actions that couldlead to more complications in the occupied Palestinianterritories and to undermining the efforts of Arabcountries and others in the international communityto reach a just  comprehensive and lasting solution byestablishing an independent  viable and contiguousPalestinian State  with Jerusalem as its capital.The situation requires that the internationalcommunity  as represented by the United Nations move quickly in order to put an end to the calamity thatthe situation represents for the Palestinian people andprovide all manner of support and assistance for thePalestinian Authority. My country finds that Palestinemust receive full membership in the United Nations  asthat is its natural and legitimate right  and we should allhelp the Palestinians to achieve that objective. For itspart  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is sparing no effortin fulfilling its commitment to the peace process withrespect to our Palestinian brethren by providing varioustypes of support and assistance.The issue of Syria is a very complex and exacerbatedone and has led to the killing and displacement of tensof thousands of people. The international communityhas shown its inability to act  because of divisions in the Security Council and because of the failure of allArab and international initiatives as a result of theintransigence of the Syrian regime  which still believesthat it can use the power of its security apparatus toend the crisis without taking into account the highhumanitarian cost.Since the first day of the crisis  my country hasbeen dealing with it in accordance with the frameworkand resolutions of international legitimacy and withfull respect for the principles of human rights andinternational humanitarian law  through the GulfCooperation Council  the League of Arab States  theUnited Nations and the outcomes of the Organizationof Islamic Cooperation summit meeting  held in Meccain August  on the status of Syria.The success of Joint Special Representative LakhdarBrahimi’s efforts will depend on the implementation ofa new strategy and a clear plan that aims at achieving apeaceful transition of power. The Security Council mustprovide him with the support he needs to deal with theSyrian crisis at both the political and the humanitarianlevels.We call upon our brothers in Yemen to continue totake the same positive and constructive approach and tostand against any foreign interference in their internalaffairs in order to achieve security and stability andeconomic development throughout Yemen. Meanwhile we call upon the international community to fulfil itspledges to Yemen by providing it with all forms ofsupport and assistance to achieve those goals. SaudiArabia reaffirms its full support for all internationalefforts undertaken in that context. We hosted the donors’conference  held earlier this month  and participatedin the Friends of Yemen conference held at the UnitedNations on 27 September 2012.The Iranian nuclear crisis is one of the mostimportant challenges threatening international peaceand security in general and the security and stabilityof the Arab Gulf region in particular. In that context my country supports the ongoing efforts of the fiveplus one group to peacefully resolve the crisis in amanner that guarantees Iran and all countries in theregion the right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in accordance with the criteria and procedures of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) andunder its supervision. On the other hand  we urgeIran to respond to those efforts and to implement therelevant Security Council resolutions by cooperating with IAEA inspectors monitoring its nuclear facilitiesin order to put an end to the crisis.In that regard  Saudi Arabia reaffirms theimportance of making the Middle East a zone freefrom nuclear weapons and all other weapons of massdestruction. We also stress the need for Israel to placeits nuclear facilities under the international inspectionand safeguards of the IAEA and to sign the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.The security and stability of the Arab Gulf regionwill be reached only through the establishment ofgood relations based on good-neighbourliness andconstructive cooperation. Also  Iran must end itsoccupation of the three islands belonging to the UnitedArab Emirates. We must solve that issue peacefully either through bilateral negotiations or by referring theissue to the International Court of Justice.The phenomenon of terrorism is one of the mostimportant challenges that we currently face and the mostimportant issue confronting the entire internationalcommunity. We must eliminate terrorism in all its formsand sources. In order to fight that scourge and uprootit completely  the efforts of the Kingdom have notbeen limited to fighting it locally. We have reinforcedefforts at all levels  whether regional or international including by hosting an international conference in2005 that resulted in many recommendations  includingthe establishment of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre  which was launched in New York on19 September 2011.Our world today urgently needs to spread theculture of tolerance and understanding and dialoguebetween the followers of different religions. Ourefforts in that regard are led by the Custodian of theTwo Holy Mosques  King Abdullah Bin AbdulazizAl-Saud  aimed at achieving a dialogue betweenreligions and cultures. That was reflected in the 2008World Conference on Dialogue  held in Madrid. Therewas also a call for a high-level meeting hosted by theUnited Nations to promote dialogue and tolerancebetween different cultures and religions. Our call formutual understanding  the acceptance of others andcoexistence has led to the establishment in Vienna of theKing Abdullah bin Abdulaziz International Centre forDialogue among Followers of Religions and Cultures.In addition  the foresight of the Custodian of the TwoHoly Mosques was demonstrated by his announcementof the establishment of a centre for dialogue among Islamic sects at the fourth special session of the IslamicSummit Conference  held in Mecca in August 2012.In that regard  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabiastrongly condemns the production by an irresponsiblegroup of an offensive movie about the ProphetMuhammad — peace be upon him. The Kingdomasserts its rejection of all acts that offend or disdainreligions and their sacred symbols. In that context  theKingdom renews its call to enact the necessary lawsand legislation that forbid the defamation and disdainof religions and their sacred symbols.Meanwhile  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabiacondemns the acts of violence against the United Statesforeign missions and any attack against any foreign ordiplomatic mission around the world for any reason regardless of the disagreement involved. Such actsprevent missions from carrying out their diplomaticfunctions and international interests.In the light of the ongoing discussion on the questionof global economic  social and human development  theKingdom of Saudi Arabia  through its participationin the Group of Twenty  emphasizes its support ofthe efforts aiming to stabilize the global economy  toadvance world trade  to take further action to liberalizetrade and to avoid protectionist policies that impede theefforts to end the global financial crisis. Meanwhile we should not ignore the matter of helping developingStates to overcome the consequences of that crisis.Furthermore  my country believes that effortsto reform the international financial  monetary andtrade system should be channelled through existing institutions in order to build a global economic systemthat is based on a new partnership between developingand developed countries. That partnership shouldbe established on the basis of cooperation  justice equality  transparency and mutual benefits.Concerning energy security  the Kingdom of SaudiArabia has spared no effort in the pursuit of stability inthe world oil markets in a manner that has served thedevelopment and growth of the global economy. In thatregard  we cannot ignore the fact that energy securityis not limited to the security of supply  but includes thesecurity of demand as well. My country believes thatthere should be a dialogue between energy producers andconsumers in order to avoid volatility and speculationin prices  and to avoid imposing discriminatory taxeson oil. We welcome the establishment of the Secretariatof the International Energy Forum headquarters inRiyadh in order to promote such dialogue.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  as one of the UnitedNations founding countries  has since its inceptionparticipated in its meetings and conferences on thebasis of its belief in the Organization’s noble principlesand the role it can play in service to humanity and itsadvancement.In conclusion  I would like to reaffirm that theKingdom of Saudi Arabia will be at the vanguard ofany international efforts aimed at implementing andachieving the principles and purposes of the UnitedNations and achieving the security  stability andprosperity to which we all aspire."
"150",6105,"SDN",67,2012,"﻿At the outset allow me to express our warm congratulations toMr. Vuk Jeremič on his election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.I am confident that his experience will ensure thesuccess of our meetings. I should like to commend hispredecessor  Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser and to express my appreciation and gratitude toSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts tostrengthen the role of the United Nations. It is my hopethat deliberations at this session will be successful which would contribute to fulfilling the hopes andaspirations of the peoples of the world to a life ofsecurity  peace and stability  on the basis of the values and principles enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations.We were pleased to see that the main theme for thissession of the General Assembly relates to the peacefulsettlement of disputes. That principle is a fundamentalone  as the Charter of the United Nations stresses theneed to maintain international peace and security bypacific means or through effective collective measuresaimed at eliminating threats to international peaceand security  in accordance with the Charter andinternational law.The peaceful settlement of disputes requires jointefforts on the part of the international communityin order to tackle the root causes of conflicts. Webelieve that the absence of sustainable and balanceddevelopment is one of the main reasons why a smallminority of people have been able to appropriate thegreatest wealth in the world while the vast majority ofhumankind lives in abject poverty  lacking all basicservices. Greater efforts must therefore be made toachieve the Millennium Development Goals.Disseminating a culture of peace  tolerance respect for others and the prevention of any violenceor incitement to cultural  religious  sectarian or ethnicstrife must be among the fundamental priorities andconcerns of the United Nations. The Organization mustensure that no offensive statements about prophetsare made under the pretext of freedom of expression.Perhaps the latest video insulting Prophet Muhammadand the reactions thereto are the best evidence of theseriousness of this issue and its effect on internationalpeace and security.My country suffered through a long conflict — morethan six decades — that hampered the achievementof peace  development and stability  and had strongnegative repercussions on the region. Proceedingfrom the conviction of my Government as to the needto put an end to that conflict  on the basis of UnitedNations instruments for the pacific settlement ofdisputes  difficult and thorny negotiations began thattook over a decade and culminated in the signing ofthe Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) underthe auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority onDevelopment (IGAD). Many regional and internationalpartners helped in reaching that Agreement.The Government of the Sudan was committed toimplementing the Agreement during the prescribed time frame  which led to the known referendum inwhich the people of South Sudan decided to secede.The Government of the Sudan immediatelyrecognized the Government of South Sudan and fullycommitted itself to assisting that nascent State  as wasstated by the President of my country — Mr. OmerHassan Al-Bashir — personally when the new Statewas born in the south. Despite all of the assistanceprovided by my country to facilitate the birth of theRepublic of South Sudan  many obstacles have croppedup on the road to the normalization of relations betweenthe two neighbourly countries. The delay in the draftingof important agreements provided for in the CPAfollowing the referendum has led to many tensions resulting in the adoption by the African Union Peaceand Security Council of a road map in April 2012 and inSecurity Council resolution 2046 (2012)  which stressesthe spirit of the African Union decision.We have begun a new phase of serious negotiationsunder the African Union High-level ImplementationPanel  headed by President Thabo Mbeki  which ledto the signing on 27 September in Addis Ababa ofvery important agreements on the economy  securityand citizenship status in both States and a frameworkagreement for cooperation between the two countries inall fields. None of that would have taken place withoutthe firm determination  wisdom and patience of myPresident  Omer Al-Bashir  who insisted on the need toresolve disputes by peaceful means  beginning with thesigning of the CPA  the Abuja Agreement on Darfur the agreement on Eastern Darfur and the DarfurDocument. That has shown the world that Sudan’sleadership acts on the basis of firm principles that prizesecurity and stability and are aimed at achieving peaceand development. We want everyone to know that thegoal of attempts to distort Sudan’s image and impugnits leadership is merely to defame us and that they aredevoid of any substance.We in the Sudan have been determined to addressthe reasons underlying war and strife despite the strongeconomic and political pressures brought to bearagainst my country and the unfair sanctions imposedby the United States of America. The Sudan requiresassistance in order to traverse this very sensitive stagetowards better horizons  and to that end we believe thatthe sanctions must be lifted  our debt cancelled and oureconomy supported. The Sudan has repeatedly stressed its commitmentto a policy of good-neighbourliness and is determinedto strengthen its brotherly relations with South Sudan.The great achievements registered have brought an endto the longest war on the Africa continent. With the samedetermination  we have attempted to tackle the fewremaining issues. In order to ensure continuing sincerecooperation with the Republic of South Sudan  onThursday  27 September 2012  an agreement was signedin the Ethiopian capital between the two Governmentson security  the economy  borders  oil  trade  ratesof exchange  pensions  debts and other economicissues. That is an important step that shows Sudan’scommitment to a policy of good-neighbourliness and itsdetermination to improve brotherly relations with SouthSudan and to reach a comprehensive understanding onall issues.Despite the fact that no agreement has been reachedon the final status of Abyei  and no terms of referencehave been found for its resolution  the Sudan stressesits full support for the Abyei protocol and agreementof June 2011  as well as the referendum law on Abyeisigned by both parties in the Sudanese Parliament in2010.We must stress here the important role played bythe two parties  with the mediation of the late EthiopianPrime Minister  Mr. Meles Zenawi  and his successor Mr. Hailemariam Desalegn  in the context of thepresidency of IGAD  as well as by other internationalpartners. Without those efforts  no agreement could havebeen reached or signed with South Sudan. We wouldtherefore like to stress the importance of mediation andserious negotiations in resolving disputes by peacefulmeans.Allow me also to stress the role of the internationalcommunity in fulfilling its responsibility to help bothparties and to keep all promises made following thesigning of the CPA by providing assistance in fundsand in kind for the development and growth of theSudan and South Sudan.In his statement  the Vice-President of SouthSudan asserted that his country lays claim to Hegligand sympathizes with those bearing arms against us inSouth Kordofan and Blue Nile states (see A/67/PV.13).That is regrettable and goes outside the spirit of theagreement of Addis Ababa  taking us back to square oneas far as conflicts are concerned. As I have said before I sincerely hope that those words of the Vice-President were intended to be delivered to the General Assemblybefore the agreement was reached in Addis Ababa.The Government of the Sudan calls on theinternational community to put further pressure onthe rebels to stop attacks on South Kordofan and BlueNile states. Let me also say that the Government of theSudan will continue to live up to its responsibilitieswith respect to the protection of civilians and thecompletion of development projects. Blue Nile stateis now home to the largest development project in theSudan — the building of a dam — together with manyother development projects.The Government has a green-land policy designedto expand agricultural projects in South Kordofanand a policy to improve water quality and educationand health services there. Moreover  proceeding fromour belief that it is the fundamental responsibility ofthe Government to protect its citizens  we renew ourcommitment to the joint tripartite initiative betweenthe United Nations  the African Union and the Leagueof Arab States to bring humanitarian assistance tocivilians in the regions controlled by rebels in SouthKordofan and Blue Nile states.Despite the efforts made by the Sudan to tackle thenegative effects following the secession of the south the burden of foreign debt weighs very heavily onthe Sudanese economy. Let me take this opportunityto recall the pledges of the international community following the signing of the CPA  to cancel the Sudan’sdebts. Those promises have gone unmet. I am sure theAssembly knows that the issue of debts was among thefundamental questions that were discussed with theGovernment of South Sudan. Based on the zero-optionapproach  we are determined to work with our brothersin the Government of South Sudan to take the stepsagreed upon with the international community and ourcreditors so that we both may enjoy the fruits of peaceand ensure the viability of the two States.At the same time  we stress the need to lift thecoercive unilateral sanctions imposed on the Sudan which run counter to General Assembly resolutionsand international norms and laws. At this point  wecannot fail to mention the progress made in sustainabledevelopment in Africa or the fact that such progresshas not risen to the ambitious level of the objectivesset forth in the Millennium Development Goals.International cooperation and effective partnerships arethus required  in the form of the complete cancellationof debts  in accordance with the Debt Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries  if we are to fulfil ourcommitments and build national capacities.My country is also witnessing another importantdevelopment — the signing of the Doha Document forPeace in Darfur  following the peace negotiations thattook place under the auspices of the State of Qatar. Ishould like to take this opportunity to pay tribute toQatar and His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin KhalifaAl-Thani for their much-appreciated efforts on behalf ofpeace and stability in Darfur. The Doha Document hasbeen widely accepted and supported by the people ofDarfur and the regional and international communities.With that instrument  we have turned a new page inthe book on Darfur — towards stability  development peace and the return of displaced persons — afterclosing the chapter on fighting.We call on the international community to protectand secure the peace by countering the armed rebelgroups that have refused to join the peace process. Wefurther call on the Security Council to put pressure onthose movements in order to compel them to subscribeto the Doha Document. I would also appeal to theinternational community to effectively participate inthe donors’ conference for the rebuilding of Darfur tobe held in December in Doha.The Government of the Sudan will continueto implement its five-point strategy for Darfur’sdevelopment. We shall give the utmost priority to thereturn of displaced persons and refugees  in coordinationwith the regional body that was set up pursuant to theDoha agreement. The parties have begun to fulfil theirduties in implementing the Doha peace agreement  andnow the five provinces of Darfur are enjoying security stability and a return to normality.That  in turn  has led the Security Council toreduce the number of military contingents in theAfrican Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation inDarfur  because  as expected  there has been a generalimprovement in both the security and the humanitariansituations. That improvement crowned with success themany efforts made by the Government of the Sudan paved the way for launching development projects inDarfur and facilitated the return of displaced personsand refugees to their homes and villages to resettle andre-engage in production and development.The current session is being held while the worldis witnessing many varied and intertwined changesand developments. Those require cooperation and coordination between members of the internationalcommunity for the good of humankind. We must makesure that the reform of the United Nations and itsprincipal and subsidiary bodies is given the importanceit deserves. It has now become necessary to acceleratethe reform of the Organization so that it can undertakeits role in a just  transparent and effective manner andconfront the challenges that the world faces. Indeed  thereform will not be genuine unless the General Assemblycan play its full role in a balanced and transparentmanner.The reform of the Security Council is a fundamentalpart of the reform of the United Nations. The Councilno longer reflects the realities of today’s world. Unlessits membership is enlarged  unless working methodsand procedures are reformed  and unless its decisionsare taken in a more democratic and transparent way reform will not be comprehensive but will merelybe partial or transitional. We call today for a morebalanced  multilateral and just international system.What is needed is a system able to tackle the challengesthat we face  one in which respect for international lawprevails  in which the primary rules are the purposesand principles of the United Nations  including respectfor the sovereignty of States  non-intervention intheir internal affairs for any ostensible reason and thenon-use or threat of force.The Sudan is greatly concerned about newconcepts and agendas that are not internationallyagreed  controversial concepts such as humanitarianintervention  preventive wars  the responsibility toprotect  political and economic sanctions and newmechanisms to bring pressure to bear on States politicizing international justice. In this context  theSudan refuses and rejects the approach taken by theso-called International Criminal Court. That body hasgone beyond the boundaries set for it at its foundingRome Conference. Regrettably  it is now a political toolthat criminalizes entire States  while fully ignoringheinous crimes being perpetrated by other States inthe name of humanity and the fight against terrorism.Rejection of the request of the Palestinian Authority bythe Court is clear evidence of injustice in the name oflaw and a good example of the politicization of justice.The phenomenon of climate change corroborateswhat we have already said. The problems associatedwith it have grown ever greater and States cannot tacklethem on their own. That is the case too for many otherissues  such as energy  food security  immigration and terrorism. We therefore believe in the need to strengtheninternational cooperation on climate change  based onthe United Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange and its Kyoto Protocol.We commend the State of Brazil for hosting theConference on Sustainable Development in July and forthe effective role it played in reaching agreement on itsfinal document (resolution 66/288  annex). That outcomereflects the fundamental concerns of Member States stresses the promotion of international cooperation forsustainable development through a green economy andstrengthens the institutional framework for sustainabledevelopment. We hope that the implementation of theconcept of the green economy will take into accountthe differences between developed and developingcountries  so that all may implement their own greenpolicies  and will ensure the f low of financial  technicaland technological assistance to developing countrieswithout discrimination.My delegation condemns all forms andmanifestations of terrorism  whether perpetrated byindividuals  groups or States. Terrorism is a phenomenonthat is not linked to any one religion  culture or State.We also renew the call for an internationally agreeddefinition of terrorism  since terrorism is a grave threatto all our societies. We must not confuse the conceptof terrorism with that of legitimate struggle againstforeign occupation  invasion or colonialism. We alsoreject the stigma of terrorism currently being attachedto particular cultures  groups  religions or ethnicities.Measures taken to fight terrorism must not infringe onpublic freedoms  human rights or a State’s sovereigntyover its territory.The current session of the General Assemblycoincides with some important indicators in theinternational economy. First and foremost are theconsequences of the world financial crisis and theescalation in the price of staples  particularly foodstaples  and their effect on sustainable development.Despite that  the Government of the Sudan is makingmajor efforts to realize economic and social developmentin the country  in the belief that that can only comeabout through realizing peace and security and growth.That was reflected in the Sudan’s commitment toimplementing the objectives of the long-term nationalstrategy for 2007-2013 and our Poverty ReductionStrategy.The question of Palestine has been on the agendaof the United Nations for more than six decades. Our Organization has adopted countless resolutions thatwere rejected or remained unimplemented by Israel.Israel continues to defy the will of the internationalcommunity. The Sudan expresses its full supportfor the decision by the Palestinian Authority to seekmembership in the United Nations. It is their legalright  based on the right to self-determination  one ofthe fundamental principles of international law.The situation in the Middle East continues to bea threat to international peace and security  despitecontinuing declarations by the Arab side of their wishto reach a just  comprehensive and lasting peace in theregion  based on the relevant United Nations resolutionsand the Arab Peace Initiative. However  Israel  theoccupying Power  continues to reject the option ofpeace. It continues its inhuman  unjust siege  which isin contravention of international law. It also continuesits plans for colonialist settlement. It continues to try tochange the demographic character of Al-Quds Al-Sharifby demolishing homes  uprooting trees and engaging inethnic cleansing and coercive displacement  as well asdetaining thousands of Palestinians.We renew our call on the United Nations  andthe Security Council in particular  to shoulder theirresponsibility for maintaining international peaceand security and to take the requisite measures to endIsraeli occupation of Arab and Palestinian land. Fromthis rostrum  we renew our call for the establishmentof a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and allother weapons of mass destruction. Meanwhile  we alsounderline the right of States to obtain nuclear technologyfor peaceful uses  and we call for the resolution ofdisputes through negotiations and dialogue  free fromattempts to spread fear and tension in the region.Also with regard to the Middle East  my delegationexpresses its deep sadness and regret at the currentdevelopments in Syria. There has been an escalation ofviolence and an excessive use of force. That is not theright way to resolve the disputes. From this rostrum  wecall on all parties to heed the voice of reason  to enterinto negotiations and to cease hostilities and militaryconfrontation. We believe that the appointment of thenew Joint Special Representative  Lakhdar Brahimi  tothe region is a good opportunity to continue to seek apeaceful settlement to the dispute  and we hope that allparties will cooperate with him  to protect Syria and itssocial fabric.The Sudan welcomes the latest politicaldevelopments in Somalia  notably its recent successful presidential elections. We congratulate the newPresident  Hassan Sheikh Mohamud  and we wishhim every success in promoting peace and securityin Somalia. In this context  the Sudan commends theAfrican Union for its efforts in Somalia. We call on theinternational community to support those efforts andto stand shoulder to shoulder with the fraternal Somalipeople at this critical juncture in the country’s history.We want Somalia to resume its natural role within theinternational community.In conclusion  let me express our sincere goodwishes for a successful session under the wise leadershipof President Vuk Jeremić."
"151",6150,"SEN",67,2012,"﻿I should liketo begin by extending my congratulations to HisExcellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his election as Presidentof the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session  and Iwish him every success. I would also like to commendAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  President ofthe Assembly at its sixty-sixth session  for his positivecontribution to the proceedings of the Assembly. Iwould like to reiterate to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon the encouragement and support of Senegal inthe conduct of his delicate mission at the head of ourOrganization.On 25 March 2012  in a two-round  keenly contestedpresidential election  the Senegalese people  inspiredby its values of democracy and freedom  calmly andserenely voted massively  by more than 65 per cent  forchange and the respect of republican norms. We weresupported by friendly countries and organizationsin that great undertaking  which was aimed at theconsolidation of our democratic tradition  especiallythrough the improvement of our electoral institutionsand the monitoring of the various stages of the process.I would like to express here my deep gratitude to allthose who supported that process.In my capacity as Senegal’s newly elected President let me reiterate our faith in our shared values and inthe mandate of the United Nations to promote  throughcooperation  the advent of a better and friendlier worldfor all.Building a better world entails  undoubtedly andabove all  working together for peace to reign amongand within our peoples  as suggested by the theme ofthis session: “Adjustment or settlement of internationaldisputes or situations by peaceful means”.Born out of the ashes and ruins of war  the UnitedNations is the expression of the dream of and hope fora world free from the spectre of antagonism and of anyManichaean view whereby the good are on one side andthe bad on the other.Sixty-seven years on  through mediation effortsand good offices  conciliation  arbitration and peacemissions  the United Nations has made a considerable contribution to the pacification of internationalrelations. Yet  although commendable progress hasbeen achieved  threats to peace and security remainworrisome and have radically evolved.That is the case in northern Mali  where organizedand heavily armed terrorist groups  living offtrafficking of all kinds  are occupying  in completeillegality  two thirds of the country  sowing despairamong the population and destroying symbols of theworld’s cultural heritage. Northern Mali has become alawless area  used as a safe haven for recruitment andtraining by the international terrorist nebula  whichwrongly uses Islam as a pretext to disguise its criminalactivities and seeks to attack foreign interests as wellas extend its reach to other countries of the subregion.As the guarantor of the collective security ofMember States under the Charter of the United Nations the Security Council has an obligation to act in orderto bring an end to such a situation. If it does not doso  it will have failed to live up to its responsibilities.Therefore we call once again on the Council to authorizeall actions required to combat those terrorist groupsand restore the country’s territorial integrity.In addition  I reiterate our firm rejection of anypartition of Mali and our condemnation of the 22 March2012 coup d’état. It is our conviction that in Africa aselsewhere  the place of the army is in the barracks under the command of a civilian authority.As for Guinea-Bissau  we  like other EconomicCommunity of West African States member States appreciate the efforts made by the transitionalGovernment towards national reconciliation  there-establishment of the country’s institutions  theholding of credible elections and the definitivewithdrawal of the army from the political arena.Already ravaged by years of institutional andeconomic instability  Guinea-Bissau also faces the issueof foreign drug traffickers. The country deserves theattention and support of the international community.The same holds true for Palestine.In its capacity as Chairman of the Committee onthe Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the PalestinianPeople  Senegal restates its support for the creation ofa viable and independent Palestinian State  with EastJerusalem as its capital and with a seat here amongfree nations. A viable and independent Palestine  livingin peace with the State of Israel  each within secure and internationally recognized borders  is one of ourlongest-standing unfulfilled promises  even thoughits fulfilment is the only guarantee for a peaceful fair and lasting settlement of the Middle East crisis.In the interest of all the peoples of the region and theworld  it is high time that the Holy Land of the threerevealed religions no longer be a land of fire  blood andtears. The light of wisdom emanating from its spirituallegacies requires it instead to be a land of peace andhuman fraternity.In Africa  as in the rest of the world  Senegalwelcomes and supports the progress of democracyand fundamental freedoms. We are deeply concernedbecause some leaders deny the obvious fact that thedestiny of humankind is to live free  and respond tothe legitimate aspirations of their people with appallingviolence against innocent civilians.The adjustment or settlement of internationaldisputes or situations by peaceful means  the apt themeof this session  should not overshadow other emergenciesand unmet needs. More than ever before  we live todayin an era of paradoxes and unanswered questions.The greatest paradox of our time is that never beforein human history has the world accumulated so muchwealth even though never before in human history hasthe world counted so many poor. So what will the worldof tomorrow be like? The question is indeed difficult but to govern is to foresee and we cannot dodge it.What kind of world do we want when  20 years afterthe Rio Earth Summit  it is a proven fact that continuousenvironmental degradation as a result of human activitythreatens to jeopardize the conditions for life on Earth?What kind of world do we want when  according toestimates by the Food and Agriculture Organizationof the United Nations  more than 900 million peoplesuffer from undernourishment even though agriculturehas the potential to feed more than twice the planet’spopulation? What kind of world do we want when in our towns and villages  millions of human beingshave no access to basic social services and millions ofwomen die in childbirth?What kind of world do we want when millionsof young people  after years of study  hard work andsacrifice to escape their misery  rather than realizingtheir dreams are rewarded with nothing but thenightmare and indignity of unemployment? Whatkind of world do we want when millions of fathersand mothers working for the minimum wage wake up one morning unemployed because the company hasgone bankrupt  while those responsible enjoy generousgolden parachutes?In a time of so many old and new challenges  historyhas shown that paradigms have changed and that oldsolutions will definitely not work. We need to redefineour priorities  invest in the real economy and agree ona new and fairer world order. The African continent having endured centuries of slavery and exploitation cannot afford to accept yet another Trojan Horse and beduped into forfeiting its resources in a contest hobblingits progress and well-being.We call for new relations with Africa  not actingupon Africa and Africans but acting with Africa andAfricans  in a spirit of cooperation and fairness  takinginto account all parties’ priorities and interests. Thatis the hope we declare here in the United Nations. Itis also what we call for in the relations between theNew Partnership for Africa’s Development  on the onehand  and the Group of Eight  Group of 20 and otherpartnership mechanisms  on the other hand.As for Senegal  beyond the demands of democracyand good governance  about which we agree  our nationalpriorities must more than ever focus on agriculture infrastructure and energy. That is the only path to theprogress that will improve people’s day-to-day lives the sine qua non of development and democratization.With respect to the reform of the Security Council Senegal reaffirms its belief in the African positionexpressed in the Ezulwini Consensus. It is only justiceand common sense that Africa  the continent with thelargest number of countries at the United Nations  andwhose problems take up most of the work of the Council should be fairly represented in that body. Indeed  thedemocracy required of States should also be required ofthe Organization to which they all belong.To conclude  on behalf of the Organization ofIslamic Cooperation  currently chaired by Senegal I hope to renew our common faith in dialogue andthe peaceful coexistence of religions  cultures andcivilizations. Entering into dialogue and learning tolive together depends on recognizing and respectingour differences as a source of richness rather than as aspringboard for confrontation. It requires rejecting thedefamation of religions and violence in all its forms.It demands renouncing any thought of domination byone culture or one civilization over others. It is aboutpromoting mutual understanding in order to overcome unfounded feelings of suspicion and fear that deformour common humanity.If humankind embraces the “civilization of theuniversal” advocated by my illustrious compatriot the late President and poet Léopold Sédar Senghor man will no longer be a wolf to man  as Hobbes said.Instead  as the saying in our country goes  man willbecome a remedy to man. We owe that to ourselves andto future generations."
"152",6197,"SGP",67,2012,"﻿I extend mycongratulations to Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventhsession. I wish him every success in the year ahead.The global economic situation remains uncertain.Europe is in recession and growth in other places isweakening. There is increasing concern that thiscombination of weak consumer demand in developingcountries and a continuing crisis in the eurozone maylead to a global recession. An even greater danger especially for small States like Singapore that dependon global trade  is the risk of increased protectionism.Populist pressures in countries affected by austerityand economic crisis can cause further instability aspoliticians become unwilling or unable to deal withlong-term  structural economic problems. Whileemerging economies focus on maintaining economicgrowth  developed economies are preoccupied withboth immediate and structural socioeconomic problems.Understandably  there is less focus on strategic regionaland international issues. However  serious  long-termchallenges remain. Rising income disparities  climatechange issues and worries about food security are notbeing adequately addressed at the global level.Amid that uncertainty  no State or group ofStates currently has the power to definitively set theinternational agenda. Decision-making and governanceon global issues have and will continue to becomeincreasingly complicated. The multiplicity of interests makes finding consensus in international forums thatmuch more difficult. Frustration over the inability ofexisting multilateral institutions to deal with thoseglobal challenges is growing  and that has given rise toa greater tendency for countries to turn to smaller andmore exclusive groupings outside of the United Nationsframework for solutions.The Group of 20 (G-20) is one such example.Without the G-20  the 2008 economic crisis may havewell led to a global depression. However  the G-20 is anexclusive grouping; it leaves out the vast majority of theUnited Nations membership  particularly small States.It is a self-selected group  but one that is here to stay inthe foreseeable future. The Global Governance Groupwas therefore established by like minded-countries including Singapore  to strengthen the engagementbetween the G-20 and the general membership of theUnited Nations. Even as we work with the G-20  weshould look for ways to strengthen and reform existingmultilateral institutions  including the United Nations the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund andthe World Trade Organization. That will help us toachieve greater efficiency  rather than continuing toinvent more smaller groupings.Many of us often fault the United Nations  includingthe Security Council  for its inability to act to resolveongoing conflicts. However  as frustrations mount  letus not forget that the United Nations and its organs including the Security Council  can do only whatits Members choose to do  so we are responsible forthe current state of affairs. The United Nations is anorganization of sovereign nation States. It has no moreauthority than what its Members give it. Any failureof the Security Council and the United Nations inmaintaining peace and security represents a failure ofthe Member States themselves.We should therefore support ongoing and newefforts aimed at strengthening the United Nations instead of denigrating it. The United Nations is uniquein its ability to come up with global solutions becauseof its universal membership  legitimacy  experienceand presence on the ground. No other organizationis as well equipped to do so. A significant expansionof the United Nations mediation capabilities  goodoffices and peacekeeping efforts has made it central tointernational crisis prevention and the mediation andsettlement of disputes. We should continue to supportthe strengthening of those aspects. The five permanent members of the SecurityCouncil  with their veto powers  have the primaryresponsibility to make the Council more effective.That is why Singapore has consistently called forimprovement in the Security Council’s workingmethods. The Security Council is not a rubber stampfor the interests of its individual members. Its power  ifnot visibly and openly wielded for the greater good andto discharge its mandate in all instances  will eventuallyundermine its legitimacy and leadership role in theinternational community. That is in no one’s interest.Singapore believes that the long-term goal of theUnited Nations should be to provide an effective systemof international law and resilient mechanisms for thepeaceful settlement of disputes. That will provide aplatform for States under threat to bring their problemsbefore those mechanisms with confidence  rather thantrying to resolve them by force.The President has selected an important theme forthe sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly:bringing about adjustment or settlement of internationaldisputes or situations by peaceful means. In a fast-changing environment  where the global governancestructure is fragmented and coordination is difficult the parameters of dialogue among States becomecrucial.In that dialogue among States  respect for the ruleof law by all parties is essential. If that were not thecase  small States would lose their independence andautonomy  and even the larger and stronger States couldnever feel entirely secure. A stable international systemis critical to our collective security. Small States likeSingapore are vulnerable even at the best of times  andthese are not the best of times. It is therefore particularlyimportant for small States to be in an internationalenvironment where international law and institutionsbased on law can flourish. We need a predictable andstable  rules-based international system in order for allof us to survive.Singapore firmly believes in the importanceof safeguarding the international rule of law. Wehave participated actively in various multilateralnegotiations  used international dispute mechanisms such as the International Court of Justice and theInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea  toresolve disputes we have had with other countries. Ourview is that disputes  including those over territorialsovereignty  can and should be resolved peacefully  inaccordance with international law. As major beneficiaries of a stable internationalsystem  it is incumbent upon small States to not onlysupport the international rule of law  but to also speakup against its violation. This year  the 105-memberForum of Small States will commemorate its twentiethanniversary with a high-level conference on smallStates on 1 October. The conference will discuss therole of small States in international relations  includingour commitment to the rule of law and the peacefulsettlement of disputes. We invite all Member Statesto attend the conference. We hope that the conferencewill be a platform for small States to share ourexperiences and remind the international communitythat small States  too  have contributions to make to themaintenance of an international system that benefits allnations of any size."
"153",6230,"SLB",67,2012,"﻿I wish to congratulateMr. Vuk Jeremić on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I alsocommend his predecessor  Mr. Nassir AbdulazizAl-Nasser of Qatar  for his fine leadership during thelast session. In addition  I thank the Secretary-General Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his tireless efforts in advancingsecurity  development and human rights  the threepillars of the United Nations Charter.Global security remains a serious challengetoday. States are increasing their military capabilitiesand arms sales have tripled in the last year and arereaching record levels. Closer to home  in the Asia-Pacific region  new Cold War lines are being drawnand low-intensity territorial disputes are brewing. Thatsituation provides the option of unilateral action  whichundermines the rule of law at the international level.Those challenges now demand an effective multilateralinstitution that responds meaningfully in real time touphold the rule of law. In that regard  Solomon Islandswelcomes this year’s theme on adjustment or settlementof international disputes or situations by peacefulmeans. It is our desire that States that find themselvesin international disputes adhere to the rule of law andwork towards ensuring global peace.Solomon Islands emerged from an internal conflictsome 10 years ago. A regional peace initiative knownas the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands(RAMSI) has helped restore law and order and createdan environment for nation-building and development.Our gratitude goes out to all our regional neighbours.A national truth and reconciliation commission thatwas set up in 2009 to investigate the causes of the conflict  submitted its report early this year. The Commissionhas facilitated the national reconciliation and healingprocess  and the Government has established a workinggroup to carefully consider the recommendations in thereport.Solomon Islands commends the General Assemblyfor convening the High-level Meeting on the Rule ofLaw at the National and International Levels this week.The rule of law is fundamental in guiding the conductof actors and addressing the realities within nationaland international jurisdictions.Since regaining peace and stability  SolomonIslands has achieved some social and economicprogress. For example  economically  the country hasenjoyed steady growth in the last five years. Externalreserves continue to improve and  as of February 2012 they stand at 10 months import cover. In addition Solomon Islands is one of the 11 countries identifiedby the World Bank in 2012 as having most improvedthe ease of doing business in the country across severalareas of regulation. An economic core working grouphas also been established to coordinate donor assistanceand is playing an important role in public financereforms  including debt management  and in creatingfiscal buffers that enable us to cushion external shocks.In the health sector  I am pleased to report that wehave almost eradicated malaria from two of our nineprovinces. Infant mortality has significantly decreasedfrom 80 to 35 per 1 000 live births  and the maternalmortality rate has also decreased from 500 to 200deaths per 100 000 live births. The Government andits development partners continue to fund medical andhealth centres to deliver the services needed by ourpeople.Major improvements in the law and order situationhave resulted in the reduction of major crimes andcreated a safer environment in the country. We havealso successfully hosted a number of internationalevents  such as the Oceania football tournament of theInternational Federation of Association Football  theFestival of Pacific Arts and recently the visit by theDuke and Duchess of Cambridge. We have regainedour image of the country known as the happy isles inthe Pacific.As part of our efforts to address governanceissues  Solomon Islands has intensified its nationalconsultations to determine the appropriate mechanismsto improve political integrity and stability. Nationalconsultations have been conducted to obtain feedbackfrom the community on the required institutions andprocesses. Strengthening governance is expensive andneeds international partnership. I take this opportunityto thank the Department of Political Affairs for itsassistance towards our electoral reforms.After almost 10 years  RAMSI is now in itstransitional phase. The Government is working closelywith the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islandsto ensure a smooth transition as the responsibility forsecurity and development is placed back in the hands ofthe Government and community. My Government willengage with various stakeholders  including UnitedNations bodies  to consolidate the gains that have beenmade so far and in building a resilient State.Solomon Islands continues to strengthen itsrelationship with the United Nations. This year weopened a second diplomatic Permanent Mission inGeneva. We are also pleased to see that the World HealthOrganization office in Honiara has been upgraded froma liaison office to the level of resident representative. Werequest the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP) to follow suit. I believe a stronger UnitedNations presence at the country level will furtherenhance understanding of the country’s developmentpriorities and challenges. The United Nations will onlybe strengthened with a secretariat that represents thediversity of its membership.Solomon Islands recognizes the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of Fiji.We will continue to dialogue with Fiji and call onthe region and the international community to supportFiji’s “Engaging with the Pacific” process and its roadmap to the 2014 general elections. We welcome Fiji’scommitment to hold its general elections in 2014.Solomon Islands has also strengthened its mediatingrole at the subregional level through the MelanesianSpearhead Group (MSG). The MSG is made up of Fiji Papua New Guinea  Solomon Islands  Vanuatu and theFront de libération nationale kanak socialiste. Withinthe MSG secretariat  a peacekeeping unit has beenestablished. However  Solomon Islands and the otherMSG members believe that the United Nations remainsthe bedrock of international peace and security.The promotion of human rights is fundamentalto creating a culture of peace and security. SolomonIslands welcomes the ongoing intergovernmentalprocess to strengthen the effectiveness of human rights treaty institutions during this session. We recognize theuniversality of human rights and call for the eliminationof double standards and the politicization of humanrights violations.On the situation in the Middle East  I believethe United Nations is uniquely placed to provide acomprehensive solution to the region’s complex issues including the current situation in Syria. It is a region thatdeserves freedom  democracy and long-term security.Solomon Islands continues to support the work of theQuartet and the good offices of the Secretary-Generalin defusing tensions and advancing political discussionon a two-State solution for Israel and Palestine.There is no justification for the killing of innocentcivilians  wherever it may occur. We therefore jointhe international community in expressing our deepconcern about the sad events in Benghazi.With respect to Non-Self-Governing Territories inthe Pacific  Solomon Islands supports New Caledonia’saspirations to self-determination. I wish to informthe Assembly that  last month  members of the MSGundertook a second ministerial visit to the territoryto monitor progress under the Noumea Accord. Weencourage all efforts to enable the Kanaks to assumeleadership in determining their future. Solomon Islandsalso joins its regional neighbours in supporting thereinscription of French Polynesia in the list of countriesto be decolonized. We also support other peopleswithin the Asia-Pacific region that aspire for self-determination and independence.I welcome the work done by the General Assemblyon strengthening the smooth transition process forcountries graduating from the group of least developedcountries. In working towards graduating from thegroup  we are embarking on a number of developmentinitiatives. Under the Istanbul Programme of Action Solomon Islands is pursuing three high-value nationalinvestments. First  with support from New Zealand  asecond international airport is being constructed in thewestern part of our country. Secondly  the submarinefibre-optic cable project is expected to go on line by2014. Thirdly  Solomon Islands is in the process ofestablishing two tertiary universities  the SolomonIslands National University and the University of SouthPacific Solomon Islands Campus.Those national projects place Solomon Islands ona path to transforming its economy and ensuring thatinclusive and equitable economic growth takes root in the country. We have done this by unlocking domesticand regional resources through the establishment of adebt strategy in partnership with the private sector andthe Asian Development Bank.Furthermore  we are taking steps to maximizereturns from our natural resources. As a party to theNauru Agreement  we have closed off pockets of highseas between our exclusive economic zones in a bidto protect and manage fish stocks. In that regard  wehave adopted the Vessel Day Scheme to guarantee anequitable share of benefits. We hold the position that theScheme must be embodied in bilateral and multilateralfisheries agreements. We call on all distant-waterfishing nations to respect that principled position.In the mining sector  we are now a member of theExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative  and wecontinue to develop policy and translate it into local lawsand regulations. Mining presents a major opportunityto broaden our economic base. In that regard  we willbe granting mining leases to a major nickel-miningcompany before the end of the year. It is estimated thatthe company will produce around 69 000 tons per yearand generate significant job opportunities.At the United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment (Rio+20)  we charted a new course todevelop an improved paradigm for advancing andmeasuring the three pillars of sustainable development.The full and timely implementation of the Rio+20outcome (resolution 66/288  annex) is crucial. As weapproach 2015  we must accelerate efforts to achieve theMillennium Development Goal targets in the remainingthree years.Solomon Islands is implementing its nationaldevelopment strategy for the period 2011-2020.We call on our development partners to align theirassistance with the priorities that are contained in ournational development strategy. The proposed post-2015 development agenda must take into account anyshortcomings in the implementation of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  and the sustainable developmentgoals must be viable economically  community-basedand time-bound. We look forward to working withthe experts who will be establishing the framework.Solomon Islands is pleased to be one of the 50 countriesthat UNDP will consult in developing the post-2015global development agenda. We request that thisconsultation process also mainstream issues of concernto small island developing States into the agenda of the 2014 Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States.I join my colleagues in the Alliance of Small IslandStates in reiterating that climate change is an urgentand irreversible threat to humanity. Solomon Islands isdeeply troubled by the current low ambition level of thepledges by developed countries. There is a discrepancybetween what has been pledged and what is necessary tostabilize temperature decrease. That means mitigationmust be prioritized at the eighteenth ordinary meetingof the Conference of the Parties to the Conventionon Biological Diversity in Doha and greenhouse-gasemission levels meaningfully decreased. We need tohave certainty that we are working towards a temperatureincrease of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius  and not3 to 5 degrees Celsius  in order to ensure the survival viability and sustainable development of small islanddeveloping States and least developed countries.We deeply regret that some countries have optedout of the Kyoto Protocol  some have refused to takea second commitment and others have remainedundecided on taking a second commitment.However  at the national level I am pleased toannounce that  in June  Solomon Islands launched itsnational climate change policy  which mainstreamsclimate change into all sectors of the country. SolomonIslands is a country with rich biological and culturaldiversity. It is a member of the Coral Triangle Initiativeon coral reefs  fisheries and food security. This year  22Pacific Island countries and territories came togetherin Solomon Islands to showcase their cultural diversityand heritage. The region has indigenous biological andcultural diversity  which makes it an indigenous andbiocultural hot spot. That hot spot remains fragile andexposed to threats and needs international support. Wewill be seeking ways and means of having that initiativefeatured on the global agenda.The reform of the Security Council must keep pacewith the changing global realities. We support the callto make the Security Council more representative relevant and effective. After four sessions  we areconcerned about the slow progress of negotiations andhope to see progress during this session.My Government recognizes Taiwan’s flexible moderate and rational foreign policy  which continuesto promote friendly cross-Strait relations. SolomonIslands continues to support Taiwan’s meaningfulparticipation in the United Nations system  including its aspiration to be a member of the InternationalCivil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change(UNFCCC). Although not a member of ICAO  Taiwanmanages more than 1 million f lights and 40 millionpassengers per annum. Similarly  Taiwan is the twenty-second-largest emitter of greenhouse gas  but it is nota member of UNFCCC. I firmly believe that it is ourshared responsibility to engage Taiwan in our efforts toadvance sustainable development and address climatechange.With regard to Cuba  I thank the Government andpeople of Cuba for the support they have provided tothe medical students of Solomon Islands. We join theinternational community in calling for the immediatelifting of the United States economic and trade embargoagainst Cuba. Solomon Islands encourages the UnitedStates to respect the principle of good-neighbourliness.Finally  with regard to gender equality and theempowerment of women  I would like to thank MemberStates for their confidence in electing Solomon Islandsto the Executive Board of UN-Women. I also welcomethe call by the Secretary-General to convene the WorldConference on Women in 2015. Solomon Islands furtheracknowledges the $320 million in regional assistancefrom Australia to support gender programmes forPacific island countries. Women play a very importantrole as peacemakers and leaders in Solomon Islandssociety. Our gender challenge has grown with time.Today we have national gender programmes thatsupport empowerment. We look forward to workingclosely with Australia and the other Board members inadvancing the cause of women and girls.Solomon Islands is committed to working closelywith the President in establishing an inclusive transparent and effective multilateral system. I wouldalso like to assure him of our support for our commonendeavour to build a peaceful and secure world for ourchildren and future generations."
"154",6276,"SLE",67,2012,"﻿It is a distinct honourfor me to convey the sincere regrets of my President Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma  who  on account of unavoidablecircumstances  was unable to address the Assembly atits sixty-seventh session.I wish to join previous speakers in congratulatingthe President on his election to direct the affairs of thissession and to assure him of my delegation’s fullestsupport and cooperation throughout his tenure. Allowme to commend his predecessor  Mr. Nassir AbdulazizAl-Nasser  and to thank him for the skilful manner inwhich he efficiently conducted the affairs of the lastsession. My profound appreciation also goes to theSecretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his tirelessefforts in advancing the United Nations agenda to makethe world a peaceful and safer place for humankind.The President’s choice of the theme “Bringing aboutadjustment or settlement of international disputes orsituations by peaceful means” is a timely wake-up callfor the United Nations to fully embrace the fundamentalprinciple upon which our Organization was established.Indeed  only with such adjustments and the practical manifestation of our collective commitment to peacefulcoexistence can we  as a global family  successfullytackle the myriad of prevailing global challenges.They include poverty  hunger  the gross and systematicviolation of human rights  extremist fundamentalism terrorism and transnational organized crime  as well asthe reconstruction and strengthening of fragile Statesand economies emerging from conflict. In that context we should remind ourselves that  a little over a year ago the Assembly adopted the landmark resolution 66/291on mediation that recognizes its growing usefulnessas a means of preventing disputes from escalating intoconflicts and as a cost-effective tool in the peacefulsettlement of disputes and the prevention of conflicts.Amid such security challenges and global economicuncertainties  the African continent continues tostrive hard to contain and to address the resurgenceof conflicts in the region by peaceful means. Atthe regional and subregional levels  the year underreview has been marred by sporadic terrorist strikesby extremists  leading to the extensive loss of life andmassive destruction of property  including covetedworld heritage sites  and the recent killing of the UnitedStates Ambassador and three other Americans inLibya. Sierra Leone strongly condemns such brutal andcowardly acts and will continue to work closely withall partners  particularly within the framework of theMano River Union  the Economic Community of WestAfrican States  the African Union (AU) and the UnitedNations  in seeking a lasting solution to that scourge.Until recently  the use of preventive diplomacy inthe maintenance of international peace and securitywas not used to its fullest potential by the UnitedNations system. Rather  it was used more as a tool incrisis management. I am  however  heartened by thepresent impetus and would like to take this opportunityto commend the role of the Secretary-General  hisSpecial Representatives and the crisis-managementoperations and missions around the world  as well asthe increasing role of the AU  subregional organizationsand international contact groups  in tackling crisissituations that have emerged globally in recent times.Sierra Leone will continue to wholeheartedlyembrace mediation and other conflict-preventioninitiatives as a key and indispensable tool in settlingdisputes and in preventing and resolving conflicts. Thelessons learned from our experience have enhanced ourconviction in the core principles of democracy  humanrights and good governance as prerequisites for political stability  sustainable peace  security and development.We therefore remain strongly committed to the rule oflaw  respect for and the protection of human rights  genderequality  the empowerment of women  equal access tojustice  fighting corruption with zero tolerance andpursuing the internationally agreed development goals including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).To that end  we are committed to ensuring participatorygovernance  conducting free  fair  transparent andcredible elections  and combating transnationalorganized crime in all its forms.Sierra Leone therefore views with disappointmentthe fact that the United Nations Conference on the ArmsTrade Treaty ended without a negotiated consensuson the treaty’s adoption. The Sierra Leone delegationbelieves that we must all earnestly endeavour toadopt a well-considered and balanced treaty withadequate provisions to effectively regulate the transferof conventional weapons. If we continue to delayin that respect  we face the risk of their continuoususe in committing grave violations of national andinternational law  which has the potential to destabilizepeace and security. We therefore urge Member Statesto consider our moral obligation to humankind asour key guiding principle and to sincerely commit tocontributing to the establishment of mechanisms toprevent the diversion of such weapons into the illicitmarket.In three years  we will reach the target date of 2015for the implementation of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. For many Member States  particularly thoseof the global South  the voyage has been rough and at times  turbulent. Worse still  the effects of thefood  fuel and financial crises that struck the globalcommunity in 2008  as well as the impact of climatechange  conflicts and deadly pandemics  have furtherexacerbated the situation and compromised thedetermination and efforts of developing countries especially least developed countries (LDCs)  to attainthe internationally agreed development goals  includingthe MDGs.We commend Brazil on successfully hostingthe United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment (Rio+20). We also applaud our solidarityand flexibility during the negotiation process enabling the incorporation of LDCs and conflict-affected countries in the Rio+20 outcome document(resolution 66/288  annex). We look forward to a similarspirit of solidarity in defining sustainable development goals that take on board the concerns of the mostvulnerable members of the community of nations.Despite the onerous challenges facing the globalcommunity  Sierra Leone has recorded significantprogress in strengthening its political and economicgovernance  including the improvement of its socialindicators. We have made substantial progress inimplementing the President’s Agenda for Change(2008-2012)  which covers the priorities of our nationaldevelopment aspirations  as well as key peacebuildingpriorities  in tandem with the United Nations JointVision for Sierra Leone.The ongoing foreign direct investment in varioussectors of the economy  notably the mining sector  isbrightening the prospects for the economy. Hopefully it will place Sierra Leone among the fastest growingeconomies in the world in the next few years.The Agenda for Change continues to provide astrong partnership link between Sierra Leone andthe United Nations  as well as other internationaldevelopment partners. To date  its implementation hashad a great impact on peacebuilding and on layingthe foundations for sustainable development and theconsolidation of peace.Sierra Leone today is considered a showpiece ofbest practices in donor coordination and a success storyin peacebuilding. In that regard  we reiterate our call tothe international community to continue to invest in oursuccess in the spirit of the New Deal for Engagementin Fragile States  which was agreed in Busan  andthe need for special attention to be paid to countriesemerging from conflict. The successor developmentframework to our Agenda for Change  entitled Agendafor Prosperity  is anchored on the New Deal and is wellunder way.In its short existence to date  the peacebuildingarchitecture has proven its worth as envisaged by theleaders at the 2005 World Summit  whose goal wasto help countries emerging from conflict make anirreversible transition from war to sustainable peace.As one of the first countries on the PeacebuildingCommission’s agenda  Sierra Leone has charted apath that can serve as a learning model for others. Inthat regard  we strongly believe that strengtheningpeacebuilding will help to better safeguard countriesfrom relapsing into conflict and sustain peace beyondthe life of peacekeeping missions. It will also helpensure that the enormous investments that Member States make in peacekeeping operations will achievetheir intended result.Sierra Leone continues to uphold the principlesof interreligious tolerance  peaceful coexistence andrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Atthe national level  we have enhanced political stabilityby strengthening good governance institutions  givingthem sufficient leverage and latitude to deliver on theirrespective statutory mandates. That arrangement hasearned the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leonean “A status” accreditation from the InternationalCoordinating Committee of National Human RightsInstitutions. In that regard  we remain focused on ourobligations to report to international treaty bodies andhave therefore submitted our initial report with regardto the International Covenant on Civil and PoliticalRights  while work is well under way on our reportsin compliance with the Convention against Tortureand Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment orPunishment and the African Charter on Human andPeoples’ Rights.Along those lines  we recently established a nationalcommission for disabled persons  consistent with therelevant provisions of the 2011 Disability Act  enactedthe 2012 Sexual Offences Act to address the specificissue of sexual violence against women and girls  andpassed into law the 2012 bill on arms and ammunitionto regulate gun ownership so as to ensure compliancewith the Economic Community of West African StatesConvention on Small Arms and Light Weapons. Agender-equality bill is also in process for enactment.I commend the support of the United Nations andthe international partners for the work of the SpecialCourt for Sierra Leone  which has made a numberof critical contributions to the advancement of therule of law at both the national and the internationallevels. In particular  we compliment the Special Courtfor bringing to trial perpetrators of crimes againsthumanity and violations of international humanitarianlaw committed in Sierra Leone during the course ofour 11-year conflict. Sierra Leone  the United Nationsand the international community can be proud of theSpecial Court’s immense achievements. With ourcontinued support  the Special Court can complete itsremaining work.President Ernest Bai Koroma  in his address tothe General Assembly at the opening of its sixty-sixthsession  underscored the imperative of peacefully settling disputes in Africa and the world at largeby emphasizing that the world is so interconnectedin trade  politics and the social spheres that a singlenation’s upheaval could affect many other countries(see A/66/PV.20). It is against that background thatwe  as a country  have continued to nurture closerties with our sister States in the Mano River basin inorder to deepen cooperation and collaboration andaddress issues of common concern  ranging fromtransnational organized crime to border disputes.The recent decision by the Presidents of Sierra Leoneand her sister Republic of Guinea to demilitarize theYenga border area and establish a joint committee ofthe two countries in order to ensure a final peacefulresolution of the Yenga problem is consistent with ourcommitment to the peaceful resolution of internationaldisputes. Indeed  our steadfast commitment to globalpeace and security is evident in our participation inUnited Nations peacekeeping missions in Lebanon Somalia  the Sudan  South Sudan and Timor-Leste.The 2012 presidential  parliamentary andlocal council elections scheduled to take place on17 November are barely 46 days away. With the supportof our bilateral and multilateral partners  preparationsare in full swing for the conduct of the third round ofsuch elections within the decade following the endof our civil conflict. The Government is fully awarethat the conduct and outcome of the elections will be acritical benchmark for assessing the level of our gainsin the area of peace consolidation and democracy. TheGovernment  relevant stakeholders and our developmentpartners are therefore expressly determined to exert acollective effort and use every available opportunity toensure that we put solid mechanisms in place for thepeaceful conduct and achievement of transparent andcredible democratic elections. It is in that regard that in May this year  all key stakeholders in the countrycommitted themselves to a credible and violence-freeprocess by signing the declaration on the 2012Elections. We have thus consolidated the electoral lawsand established electoral offences courts to ensure thelegitimacy and credibility of the electoral process.As Coordinator of the Committee of Ten Heads ofState of the African Union for the reform of the UnitedNations Security Council  I am pleased to report to theGeneral Assembly that  at the last AU Summit held inAddis Ababa  African heads of State reaffirmed theirstrong commitment to the Ezulwini Consensus andthe Sirte Declaration containing the African commonposition on the reform of the Security Council. Tothat end  we are committed to building alliancesin support of the African common position withvarious interest groups and Member States engagedin the intergovernmental negotiations  with a view toachieving reform of the Security Council as soon aspossible. In that pursuit  member States of the AfricanUnion have been called upon to include the issue ofSecurity Council reform among the priorities in theirforeign policies.In that respect  Africa continues to engage in theintergovernmental negotiations with an open-doorpolicy aimed at correcting the historical injusticesuffered by Africa as the only continent not representedin the permanent-member category of the Council and atthe same time underrepresented in the non-permanentcategory. Since the Security Council remains at thecentre of global governance in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  it is both imperativeand compelling that the international communityrecognize the need described in the 2005 WorldSummit Outcome to make the Council more broadlyrepresentative  efficient and transparent in orderto enhance its effectiveness and the legitimacy andimplementation of its decisions  as well as the need todemocratize the Council’s decision-making process andcorrect the lingering historical injustice inf licted uponthe continent. In that regard  we urge the wider UnitedNations membership to work with Africa to urgentlyaddress that injustice. Africa is not being unreasonablein its demand  and we all know that procrastination onthe matter has led to a travesty of justice and fair play which undermines the dignity of our peoples.We are determined at the national level to surmountall impediments on our way to development and todelivering fully on all the projects in our “Agenda forChange”. We are confident that with sustained supportfrom our bilateral and multilateral partners  we shallpromote socioeconomic progress and provide a betterstandard of living for our people in an atmosphere ofpeace and security. What we cannot afford at this timein our history is to fail in our duty and obligation toprovide peace  security and sustainable developmentfor our people.At the global level  as we look at the work thatlies before the sixty-seventh session  let us not losesight of our shared obligation to ensure a peacefuland secure world by resolving our differences throughconstructive dialogue and thus strengthen the existing mediation mechanisms provided in the Charter andinstitutionalized within the United Nations system."
"155",6323,"SLV",67,2012,"﻿Ibring cordial greetings to the authorities of the UnitedNations and to all the Heads of State and representativeshere with us. This session of the General Assembly which will address the theme of the settlement ofdisputes by peaceful means  offers us an opportunityto reflect on the course of the history of our countriesand humankind  and to showcase the issues that theworld’s peoples need to solve. The peaceful settlementof conflicts is an essential part of how we strengthenour democratic institutions and the rule of law in aworld that has not yet consolidated peace.For various reasons that we need not go into we are witnessing violations of the principle ofnon-interference — through various mechanismsthat are not necessarily military — of our countries’constitutions and our own international treaties  as wellas various manifestations of intolerance  xenophobiaand other attitudes that provoke violence and fomentconflict. Hard as it is to believe  we still see politicalparties  leaders  intellectuals and representatives of themedia who continue to see global realities through ColdWar eyes  as if the last half-century had not producedenormous changes in the international political map.Such outdated positions hinder the progress of ourpeoples and nations in strengthening and broadeningtheir democratic borders. My country  El Salvador  is aclear example of such contradictions  finding itself asit does stuck between a process that is strengtheningthe rule of law and the persistence of conservativeforces that still entertain the fantasy of communism.I bring these thoughts to this forum because Ibelieve that El Salvador’s young democracy is a goodexample of how to settle disputes through dialogue. Itis also a good example of structures that are mired inbackwardness  privilege and the Manichaean view thatbelongs to the Cold War. As is well known  El Salvadorendured a long armed conflict that lasted 12 years andcost more than 80 000 lives. Our emergence fromthat conflict has been a model of the effectiveness ofdialogue and negotiation for my country and the entireworld.We took a giant step forward as a nation20 years ago when  on 16 January 1992  we signed the Chapultepec  Mexico  peace accords that brought thearmed conflict to a definitive end. The United Nationsitself acted as mediator; the then Secretary-General Mr. Javier Pérez de Cuellar  in consultation with theSecurity Council  appointed the Peruvian diplomatÁlvaro de Soto as mediator. I would like  if I may  topay tribute to Mr. De Soto’s work  as it is an example ofhow even exceedingly difficult disputes can be settledthrough dialogue. In that regard  he proved to be a truearchitect of peace. We can say that  beginning in 1992 Salvadorans launched a new process that has graduallyconsolidated our democracy and created moderninstitutions.Three years ago El Salvador passed anothermilestone signaling a step forward in the strengtheningof our democracy. After 20 years of Governments led bythe same political forces  we witnessed a political changethat brought in the current Government to administer theState. This was not simply a change of political party; itopened the way to a movement of renewal that has beenexpressed in various issues of enormous importancefor the rule of law and for reinforcing the work ofour democratic institutions. The long-term control ofour country’s Government by a single political partyfor two decades gave absolute power to a small groupover the organs of State — executive  legislative andjudicial — and over other institutions such as the Courtof Accounts  the Office of the Prosecutor General andthe Public Ministry  among others.As change and the break with absolute controltook place  they began to permit genuine independencein the branches of Government  which in turn beganto lead to the genuine f lowering of democracy thatthe people had demanded. Those changes  far fromchanging the rules of the game  effectively guaranteedjudicial certainty and eliminated the privileges thathad protected Governments in the past. On behalfof the State  the Government asked for forgivenessfor the crimes committed by State agents during thearmed conflict  and has undertaken and continues toundertake concrete efforts to make moral and materialreparations to the victims of barbaric atrocities andtheir families. This was a debt to the Salvadoran peopleand the international community that had not beensettled by previous Governments.Not long ago  our country experienced aninstitutional crisis whose nature and scope werevery different from those of the armed conflict  butnonetheless put Salvadoran democracy to the test.I am referring to the recent crisis that arose betweenthe constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court ofJustice and the Legislative Assembly in my country. Atno time did the crisis cause political instability; rather it brought two State bodies in conflict and  in thatrespect  it was an example of the independence of thosetwo branches of Government in our country today.The conflict  arising from different and conflictinginterpretations of the Republic’s Constitution  lastedalmost five months. It was a protracted crisis thatgenerated opposing positions within our country  andthe lack of agreement between the parties drove theLegislative Assembly to call for a settlement throughthe Central American Court of Justice. The conflict andthat decision of the parliamentary majority set off strongreactions from groups on either side. Unfortunately it was also exploited by foreign groups  including bycampaigning United States senators who blew theconflict out of proportion without understanding itfully.Therefore  with no agreement to resolve the crisis the President of the Republic offered to mediate andfacilitate the dialogue. After 17 long days of meetingswith representatives of the different political camps inthe Legislative Assembly  the longed-for agreement wasfinally reached. In the end  that agreement led to theappointment of a new President of the Supreme Courtof Justice and the normalization of the administrationof justice in our country.I wished to share with the Assembly this briefsketch of events in order to underscore that once againEl Salvador was able to find a felicitous solution to aninstitutional crisis through dialogue and as the fruit ofnegotiation. In short  it was a new triumph of the youngand ever-stronger Salvadoran democracy. Of course many challenges lie ahead  such as that of promotinga process of constitutional reform that will lead to anunequivocal interpretation of our Magna Carta so thatwe do not once again suffer conflicts such as the onewe saw recently. We also must move to update Stateinstitutions in the light of what we have learned overthe past two decades.El Salvador resolved on its own an institutionalconflict that in other eras would have led to coupsd’état and breaches of constitutional order with serioushuman  economic  political and social consequences forcountries that suffered such situations. We found thesolution through dialogue  which is a fine example ofthe theme for this session of the General Assembly. At the same time  we are aware that the strengthening ofdemocratic processes — which  happily  is the one-wayroad on which Latin America is now travelling — shouldbring profound changes in the economic and socialstructures of our countries  which must clearly be basedon the rule of law.The fact that there are people who are marginalizedand excluded from the progress and goods that only asmall portion of humankind is able to enjoy remainsan open wound that we cannot and should not continueto tolerate. We live from crisis to crisis  ever morefrequent and ever deeper  which lead to a system andmodels based essentially on the accumulation of wealthin the hands of a tiny minority  leaving large majoritiesin poverty and backwardness. The phenomenon ofmigration  which we once addressed in this forum  isthe child of that planet-wide inequality and an strikingref lection of the need to change and change quickly.Latin America has taken important steps in thatdirection. We are leaving behind a perverse model thathad impoverished our people and turned our region intothe most unfair of the planet — not the poorest  butthe most unfair. Today  we are aware that no model issuccessful if it leaves out vast majorities. With all thepeople involved we can achieve much  but without thepeople we can achieve nothing. That is the road that wehave begun to travel in our region. Without a doubt  itwill be a difficult and long road  full of progress andsetbacks  but in the end  and I stress this  it is the onlyroad that will allow for certain success.The unfair distribution of wealth and goods  theconstant aggression against the environment  and thelack of global control over financial f lows that leadsto recurring crises — which are always paid for by thepeople and never by those who are responsible — arerealities that do not arise from any ideology. The problemis not one of ideology. These are realities that we mustchange in order to establish a climate of peace andsecurity in which we see the domestic changes that giveour peoples better living conditions and access to thematerial and cultural goods that produce progress inour global society.I do not wish to conclude without first alluding toa topic that we have also addressed in this forum andthat is a source of ongoing concern for the internationalcommunity. I am referring to civic security and thefight against organized crime and all forms of violence.El Salvador is today the focus of the region  multilateralorganizations and the countries that historically have close ties to my country. That is due to a phenomenonthat we have been experiencing for more than halfa year and that has brought a significant drop inviolence and crime. El Salvador was the second mostviolent country on the American continent until a fewmonths ago. We had 15 murders per day on average as a result of violence  crime and infighting amongcriminal organizations  in particular among gangs. BySeptember  the average had fallen to 3.8 murders perday. We have seen drops in other crime rates that  whileless significant  are still steady and substantial.For the past three years  El Salvador has beenundertaking a policy of civic security that has beenbearing fruit. Recently  a truce signed between rivalgangs  with the Catholic church as intermediary andfacilitated by the Government  contributed decidedly tothat crime reduction process. However  let me also saythat if violence and organized crime are to disappearin our countries  we must modify the conditions formillions of young people who live without hope andwithout opportunity. These are tasks that are incumbentupon the Governments and societies of each of ourcountries.However  there is more. As we have said on otheroccasions  without the strong and decided support of thedrug-consuming countries  and without an unequivocalcommitment from those large markets  we cannot wagethis good fight successfully. Central America  togetherwith Mexico and Colombia  have agreed upon jointpolicies to wage that battle. We need the support ofthe Government and people of the United States in thatbattle. It is essential.El Salvador has launched a massive campaign toraise awareness and mobilize our people against genderviolence in the understanding that violence againstwomen is violence against all of society. If gender-basedviolence is a problem throughout all of our societies it is one that we should address and that is even morepressing in societies where there is a strong tradition oftolerance of violence and chauvinism against women.Governments bear the biggest responsibility  butsocieties should also show solidarity and commit tothose efforts. We are certain that the differences thatdivide us within our countries can be overcome onlythrough dialogue. That is the manner in which we mustresolve conflicts. Dialogue  consensus and agreementare the guidelines for the road maps that will lead tosocieties that are more fair and prosperous.I should therefore like to conclude my remarksby sending along a warm greeting to the people andGovernment of Colombia for their efforts to attain adefinitive peace in their country. For several decades our sister Republic of Colombia has suffered an armedconflict that has limited its possiblities and clearlyhindered its economic growth and the well-being of itspeople. For that reason  the dialogue and negotiation thathave been launched by President Juan Manuel SantosCalderón deserve the full support of the internationalcommunity  and in particular of the Latin Americancountries. We congratulate the Colombian people andwish them the greatest success on the road that theyhave taken towards peace and national concord.Along the same lines  we hail the process ofeconomic reforms undertaken by the sister Republicof Cuba  which is bringing about a transformationthat is worthy of our support and encouragement. Wetherefore reiterate the call we made last year in thisHall. The blockade against Cuba must be lifted. It isan anachronism from a past that has been overcome inour America.Peace  unity and change are essential values whenit comes to working for the happiness of our peoples."
"156",6348,"SMR",67,2012,"﻿On behalf ofthe Government of the Republic of San Marino  Icongratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventhsession  and I wish him a fruitful year. The San Marinodelegation assures him of its utmost cooperation in allthe work of the General Assembly. I also express mycountry’s gratitude to the outgoing President of theGeneral Assembly  Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  for theexcellent work carried out during the sixty-sixth session.He distinguished himself by his leadership in thedifficult and complex issues before the United Nations.He promoted the most important themes on the GeneralAssembly’s agenda with courage and determination laying foundations for solutions based on the widestpossible consensus  while continually working tostrengthen the global governance architecture.My country also extends special thanks to theSecretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his energyand extraordinary determination in leading the UnitedNations. San Marino supports the basic priorities of theSecretary-General’s political action and his idea that theUnited Nations should play a key role in strengtheningglobal governance by creating new cooperationmodels capable of managing today’s challenges andthe ever-increasing calls for change. The Organizationis in a unique position to provide solutions in deeplyinterconnected fields  such as development  peace andsecurity  human rights and humanitarian action.San Marino appreciates the focus of the Secretary-General’s attention on all United Nations MemberStates  without distinction  as well as his commitment inthe field of reform and his presence in all international politically relevant and emergency situations. Amongthose worth underlining is the Secretary-General’stireless commitment to finding a solution to the terribleSyrian conflict.I thank the President for the theme chosen for thissession: “Bringing about adjustment or settlementof international disputes or situations by peacefulmeans”. The Republic of San Marino strongly believesin the settlement of international disputes by peacefulmeans. My country has always believed in the power ofdialogue  democracy and respect for others as values atthe basis of peaceful coexistence among peoples.In that respect  with reference to the recent bloodyattacks on Western diplomatic missions  San Marinointends to voice once more its firm condemnation ofany form of violence. We do not believe that violenceis the right answer when someone feels hurt in hispersonal beliefs or opinions  regardless of the gravity ofthe statements made. Human life must always be aboveeverything and everyone. Those actions are even morereproachable when directed to institutions that are theemblems of international collaboration and mutualassistance and when States bear no responsibility forthe statements made.Our country is therefore grateful to the Presidentfor having chosen the theme  most of all at a time whenthe international scene is unfortunately characterizedby ever-increasing and bloody conflicts. In thatcontext  the role of the United Nations  and in particularof the General Assembly  in peaceful transitions anddemocratic solutions is even more fundamental.For that reason and because the internationalcommunity is now called upon to face major globalchallenges in a consistent and rapid manner  the reformprocess of the United Nations is crucial to future worldstability and must remain the target of all our efforts.We have the duty to guarantee the full effectiveness ofthe Organization’s activities with a view to preservingand strengthening its essential value as a point ofreference for the international community and for anyindividual.I have the pleasure to reiterate again this year thesupport granted by San Marino to the revitalizationprocess of the General Assembly. In that regard  I thankGeorgia and the Gambia  as co-Chairs of the Ad HocWorking Group on the Revitalization of the GeneralAssembly  for the report recently adopted (A/66/891) which is the outcome of considerable effort and numerous informal meetings with Member States andthe representatives of the various political groups. Thatreform is particularly important for my country  sincethe General Assembly is the most democratic body ofthe United Nations and  as such  the most adequateand sometimes the only forum where a small State canexpress its opinions.The revitalization process of the General Assemblyis fundamental to strengthening the global governancearchitecture and must be an objective common to allMember States. The rationalization of the agenda andimprovement of the methods of work of the GeneralAssembly are important aspects of the reform  which isnecessary to enhance the technical and administrativeefficiency of this body. But more importantly  therevitalization process should include the political roleof the General Assembly and its authority  as definedin the Charter of the United Nations. The reform of theGeneral Assembly should also improve its relationswith the other main organs of the United Nations inorder to avoid duplication of functions and means.The Republic of San Marino believes that the roleof the General Assembly should not be limited to thatof a mere body where resolutions are adopted. On thecontrary  it should be a forum for the exchange of ideasand debate  where solutions to today’s challenges canbe found  and where a global consensus on issues ofcommon interest can be reached. In that regard  with aview to enabling the Assembly to fully perform its task San Marino supports the prerogative of its Presidentto organize thematic debates on the most relevant andurgent issues at the international level.In that context  I underline the great importanceattached by my country to the initiative of the outgoingPresident to organize  together with the Secretary-General  the high-level thematic debate on the stateof the world economy and finance in 2012  whichtook place on 17 and 18 May here in New York. TheRepublic of San Marino  together with Turkey  had thehonour and the pleasure to facilitate that event. Thedebate was an efficient way to reaffirm the central roleof the United Nations  and in particular of the GeneralAssembly  by enhancing its deeply democratic natureand its indisputable legitimacy in dealing with issuesthat affect the entire world community.Four years ago  the world economy suffered adevastating financial crisis  the consequences of whichare still evident to all. A prompt response by the Group of Twenty and its central banks was able to avoid theworst effects of this crisis  but the situation is stillprecarious. According to forecasts  many developedcountries will experience stagnation and in some casesrecession. Economic growth has slowed down in manyother countries. Today  unemployment has reached thehighest levels  in particular among young people andwomen. Increases in the prices of food products andpersistent inequalities contribute to higher povertyrates and cause increasingly violent social tensions.Problems connected with sovereign debts inEurope have further worsened global economic crisis.The crisis has severely hit many countries of the world thus becoming one of today’s major challenges to ourOrganization as well. It is now more than ever necessaryto find new strategies  solutions and  more importantly to create a sense of solidarity among our countries andpeoples.For those reasons too  the organization this year ofa thematic debate on the state of the world economy andfinance was extremely important. My country firmlybelieves that this exercise should be repeated at thissession of the General Assembly and perhaps at latersessions  at least until the crisis has been overcome.Indeed  when we talk about the revitalization of theGeneral Assembly  we think of a forum where allmembers of the international community have theopportunity to exchange ideas on the most importantand urgent themes that have a global dimension andneed a global response. In our opinion  the Organizationshould play a leadership role in the promotion of fairand inclusive growth  sustainable development and theelimination of poverty and hunger.The reform of the Security Council is part of a widerreform of the United Nations and remains a centraltheme of the activity of the General Assembly. Overthe past few years  the Security Council has approveda growing number of peacekeeping operations and hasbeen increasingly involved in extremely importantissues concerning international peace and security.The reform of that body  based on the widest possiblepolitical consensus  is therefore necessary and must becarried out with the utmost commitment by all MemberStates.The Republic of San Marino is grateful toAmbassador Tanin for the wisdom and impartialitywith which he has presided over intergovernmentalnegotiations on the reform. Our country is convinced that the intergovernmental negotiations launched threeyears ago still represent the right framework to find asolution  taking into account the interests and positionsof all. Although the various groups of countries stillexpress different positions  it must be recognized thatsome steps forward have been taken in the reformprocess. San Marino believes that the reform shouldlead to an enlarged  more representative  transparentand efficient Security Council. Moreover  it believesthat the five strongly interconnected fundamentalthemes of the reform need to be considered as a whole.Over the past few years  some new bloody andviolent conflicts have broken out. We have alsowitnessed a massive popular uprising spreading acrossthe squares of cities in North Africa and the MiddleEast. At the forefront of the Arab revolution were youngpeople  educated and penalized by exclusion from thelabour market. The situation is still unstable  and weare unable to imagine what the future of such countrieswill look like. However  we must support them in theirstruggle for democracy  liberty and social justice.Furthermore  today we are witnessing the Syrianconflict  the violence of which is unacceptable. Thereare clear reports on the atrocities perpetrated against thepopulation: mass killings  rapes  summary executionsand torture. Children have been among the innocentvictims of the massacres. San Marino firmly condemnsthose atrocities  in the same way as it condemnsany violation of human rights and internationalhumanitarian law.We hope that the Security Council will be able toreach an agreement soon on how to settle the Syriancrisis. San Marino seizes this opportunity to expressits most sincere wishes to His Excellency LakhdarBrahimi for having accepted a difficult task.The commitment of the General Assemblyconcerning the Syrian crisis reflects an importantmission of our Organization: to keep the peaceworldwide and to ensure respect for freedoms andhuman rights. The Republic of San Marino expressesits satisfaction with the adoption  on 3 August last  ofresolution 66/253 B  which we co-sponsored.Another important theme this year on the agendaof the General Assembly has been the improvementof disaster prevention and response. That theme hasrecently gained greater importance in the politicalagenda. Rising temperatures  earthquakes anddroughts have caused unprecedented humanitarian disasters. Many populations have suffered food andhealth insecurity  thus becoming fully aware of theirvulnerability. Disasters are  of course  not only naturalones but also caused by human beings. The internationalcommunity must be able to rapidly and efficientlyrespond to emergency situations. A fundamental wayto reduce the risks connected with natural disasters isundoubtedly to invest in the most vulnerable regions inorder to build the capacities necessary to prevent them so that action can be taken before disasters occur.In the short term  however  it is essential to provideour political and financial support so as to overcomethe consequences of disasters. In that regard  I amproud of the fact that my country  despite its small size is ranked fifty-second among donors to the CentralEmergency Response Fund.We are extremely grateful to the Secretary-General  as well as to the Office for the Coordinationof Humanitarian Affairs and the Fund  for their rapidand fundamental action in favour of populations inhumanitarian emergency and for their substantialcontribution. Humanitarian and development issues particularly sustainable development  are inevitablyintertwined  and our success in providing an efficientresponse to natural disasters certainly has a directimpact on our capacity to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.Indeed  as this is a global economic crisis  responsesmust also have a global dimension. The United Nations on account of its universal character  must play a keyrole in the decision-making process on the worldeconomy and sustainable development  with a viewto finding new solutions and to promoting a politicalconsensus on these issues.The Organization must play a leadership role inthe promotion of fair and inclusive growth  sustainabledevelopment and the elimination of poverty and hunger.In that context  San Marino welcomes the resultsof the United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment  held last June in Rio. Resolution 66/288 entitled “The future we want”  marked the conclusionof long and complex negotiations at the end of whichStates finally recognized their common responsibilities.Now the most important thing is for the commitmentsundertaken to be respected so that the future thatis wanted and set out in the resolution can become areality. The 1948 Universal Declaration of HumanRights states that everyone is entitled to the samerights and freedoms  without distinction of any kind.Unfortunately  in today’s world there is a clear anddirect relationship among disability  poverty and socialexclusion. According to estimates  approximately15 per cent of the world’s population is affected bydisabilities  and about two thirds of disabled people livein developing countries. Many of them cannot activelyparticipate in their societies. This situation is notlimited only to developing countries. Indeed  women men and children with disabilities are often victims ofdiscrimination even in the richest societies.San Marino was among the first countries to ratifythe United Nations Convention on the Rights of Personswith Disabilities. That Convention and its optionalProtocol cover a wide range of civil  cultural  economic political and social rights. My country is pleased thatthe Convention has been ratified by more than half ofMember States and hopes that it will soon be ratifiedby all. Each country has the duty to fully implementthe Convention. An effective and positive change in thelives of people with disabilities will be possible only ifit is fully implemented.The Republic of San Marino congratulates theGeneral Assembly on its decision to convene a high-level meeting on disability and development inSeptember 2013 and hopes that the meeting will be agreat success.Today we all recognize and appreciate thefundamental role of women. Nonetheless  thediscrimination and violence to which women are stilloften subjected are among the major concerns of theUnited Nations. In many countries  maternal mortalityis still worrisome  especially in the poorest areas of theworld. Women are the most affected by HIV. In manyparts of the world  women continue to be subjectedto atrocious and humiliating practices. Improving thestatus of women all over the world is our responsibility a responsibility which all States must share. To thatend  in order to promote the empowerment of women it is essential to guarantee women’s access to schoolingand education and to improve their participation inpolitical  social and economic life at all levels. TheRepublic of San Marino welcomes the proposal to holda global conference on women in 2015  20 years afterthe Beijing summit. Despite the fact that child mortality is decreasing the most recent estimates show that in 2010approximately 7.6 million children died before the ageof 5. Moreover  according to estimates  in 2015 about72 million children will not have access to schooling.Recently  the drought and food emergency in theHorn of Africa has had a devastating impact on about13 million people  in particular women and children.Almost 5 million young people between the ages of 15and 24 are affected by HIV.Children are still the most vulnerable group of thepopulation and are subjected to violence  abuse andexploitation. A vast number of children all over theworld do not still have access to basic services  healthcare and education. Besides facing global challengessuch as the economic crisis and the problems connectedwith climate change  States must find the resourcesnecessary to best meet the needs of children and toimmediately improve the conditions of those living inthe poorest areas of the world. It is imperative for usall if we want to guarantee to the global community afuture worthy of the name."
"157",6385,"SOM",67,2012,"﻿I would like to congratulateMr. Jeremić on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session and to commendAmbassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for themanner in which he guided the proceedings of theAssembly last year.Just over two weeks ago  Somalia took a bold anddecisive step away from decades of division  disorderand conflict  and instead towards the reconstitutionof a more representative  more democratic SomaliRepublic  at peace with itself  with its neighbours andwith the rest of the world. On 1 August this year  aNational Constituent Assembly adopted the new SomaliConstitution and on 20 August a new Parliament wassworn in  which elected our new President  HassanSheikh Mohamud  on 10 September. In the comingweeks  the President will appoint a Prime Minister anda new cabinet will be duly established.Let me take this opportunity to convey the sincereregrets of President Mohamud. He would have liked tobe here himself to address the Assembly on this greatoccasion. However  the tremendous scale and urgencyof the challenges facing him as leader of Somalia andthe demands of his new role did not permit him to travelhere to New York to present his remarks in person. He asked me to come here to convey his warm greetingsand his vision for Somalia’s future.For more than two decades of crisis  the Somalipeople have suffered and endured  but we have not doneso alone. The United Nations has stood by us  providinghumanitarian assistance to those of our people in need helping us to rebuild from the ruins of war  bringingus time and again to the negotiating table to resolveour differences and maintaining the dignity of theSomali nation by keeping our f lag f lying throughoutthese long  dark years. As we emerge from the long dark days  I wish to express my personal thanks  andthose of the Somali people  to the Secretary-Generaland his Special Representative  Augustine Mahiga  fortheir tireless support and crucial role in helping to openthis new chapter in Somali history.Somalia’s progress is also due in great measureto the self less courage and sacrifice of our brothersand sisters in the African Union  including our closestneighbours  whose forces have fought long and hard with so many laying down their lives in the battle togive our children a better future. With the support ofthe African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)and other partners  our armed forces are becomingincreasingly experienced and capable  but we will needAMISOM’s steadfast presence and mentoring for sometime to come  and we call upon our brothers in theAfrican Union to renew their commitment as we moveforward to assume our own responsibilities in full. Wethank our international partners who are diligentlysupporting AMISOM  especially the European Unionand the United States  among others.The members of the League of Arab States andthe Organization of Islamic Cooperation have alsoextended the hand of friendship to the Somali peopleduring these difficult times. We are especially gratefulto the Government and people of Turkey for their faith courage and leadership in ending our long isolation andbuilding bridges between Somalia and the rest of theworld.But now  with all these partners standing by us wemust increasingly learn to travel our own path with ourown energies  developing the ability to stand on ourown feet and step free from reliance on our kind friends.Already  the Somali diaspora from around the world arereturning to the country with investment and skills thatwill build the future Somalia. We can also learn fromhow peace and growing prosperity have developed in other parts of the country. We must build on the returnof normality in Mogadishu  and elsewhere in Somalia and on the growing public confidence in the future. Itis the Somali people in the villages and the nomadicpastoralists  with their resilience  drive and dynamism who are best placed to lend real stability to Somalia’sfuture.The end of Somalia’s transition was brought aboutby the tremendous joint efforts of the TransitionalFederal Government  Somali regional administrations civil society and our traditional elders. Against allodds  within one year Somalis were able to adopt a newprovisional Constitution  create a new Parliament andelect a new President  heralding the beginning of a newera. This one-year experience has shown several things.When we put our minds to it  we Somalis are capableof overcoming tremendous obstacles and deliveringon expectations. It has shown that we can effect ourpolitical transitions within our own country. It hasshown that Somalis are indeed ready for a new chapterand are calling for a permanent Government that canbuild on the foundations of this remarkable year.Somalia’s transition has officially ended  butthe work of rebuilding our nation continues. Thenew administration has four short years to translateagreements and objectives made on paper into concrete tangible progress for our people  and to place Somaliafirmly on an irreversible path to enduring peace andgrowing prosperity.The most urgent challenge is to restore peaceand security throughout Somali territory. Our forces together with our African Union allies  are makinggreat progress in that regard. But a stable peacecannot be achieved through military means alone. Wemust practise the politics of inclusion  establishinga credible  representative  inclusive and capableGovernment — a Government by the people  for thepeople  not a Government of the few  serving theinterests of the few. Initially  that Government must beabout delivering real governance and connections withthe people. It must be about the process of buildinglocal representation  addressing community justiceand seeking to build basic services  rather than aboutdistant institutions of Government from Mogadishu or even provincial centres. Power and responsibilitymust be devolved as close to the people as possible  inaccordance with the principles of federalism. It will beimportant to recognize the existence of other Somaliauthorities  as well as de facto political and military forces across the country  with which we will work toestablish a vibrant  prosperous and stable representativeGovernment democracy  firmly adhering to andgrounded in Somali and Islamic values.We will also require a fair and independent judiciary one resistant to executive interference  and one that willmeet the needs and earn the trust of ordinary citizens while bringing an end to the culture of impunity thathas gripped our nation for the past two decades.We have repeatedly extended an olive branch to theGovernment’s adversaries  and  although this has beenrepeatedly rejected  our new President will continueto reach out and offer peace. Al-Shabaab is a complexand heterogeneous movement. Most of its members areordinary citizens who have aligned themselves withAl-Shabaab out of fear or a sense of grievance. At thesame time we must also be honest with ourselves andadmit that some of the members come from a nationalist conservative faction of our fractured country  whichhas been disillusioned and damaged by decades ofconflict  and they have sought refuge in an extreme andharsh source of justice and security. To them we mustprove that there is a better way. To them we have alwayssaid and will continue to say  “Brothers and sisters  laydown your arms and let us talk”.We Somalis have a saying — after every war comespeace. So let us remember that we have no choice as anation but to live together. Let us settle our differencesthrough dialogue and compromise  so that there is nolonger any justification for any Somali to take up armsagainst another. To those few ideological extremists inAl-Shabaab’s ranks who remain committed to the useof terror and the murder of innocents to achieve theiraims  we say  “There is no place in Somali society  norin international society  for you and your violent creed.We will fight you until Somalia is once again a nationfounded on the peace  tolerance and management thatconstitute the true spirit of the great religion of Islam”.As we focus our energies on these immediatechallenges  we must nevertheless keep our longer-term goals clearly in view. The new Governmentunderstands clearly that its purpose is not to entrenchitself indefinitely in power  but to lay the foundationfor a democratic system of governance  anchored inIslamic values and based on universal  competitiveelections  by August 2016.The new Government has just four short yearswithin which to establish the states and regions of this federation  and to do so in a way that unifies our peoplerather than dividing them. We must validate the newConstitution through consultation and referendum  andestablish systems of governance that serve the interestsof the Somali people. We must design representativeelectoral systems that serve to heal the divisions of oursociety rather than to aggravate them.As we move away from transitional Governmentinto the era of permanent Government  we must establisha new compact for national coexistence in which theaspirations of all Somalis  not only some  are reflected.We recognize that the bonds of love and solidarity thatbound us together in 1960 have been heavily damagedand sorely tested. The talks initiated earlier this yearbetween the Transitional Federal Government and theSomaliland administration have begun well  and weintend to continue them. We will not use military orpolitical coercion to bring out an artificial unity; wewant a genuine unity that results from negotiations mutual respect and mutual agreement.The durability of our stabilization efforts willdepend in large part upon our ability to revive anddevelop the Somali economy. Security and durablepeace cannot exist without jobs and food  and thereforewe must work hard to ensure that food is on the table ofthe average Somali family  to create job opportunitiesand to enable Somalis to work for themselves.Our country is abundant in resources; we have thelongest coastline in Africa  9 million acres of fertileland  the highest per capita number of livestock in theworld. We have oil and minerals. We are strategicallylocated at the gateway of the Middle East and Africa at the conf luence of the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea.Our challenge as Somalis is to use those resources tobring our country and our people back onto the globaleconomic playing field.On the topic of resources  we are committedto strengthening the Government’s financialaccountability. Somalia is a poor country  and wecannot afford corruption. We seek the assistance of ourinternational partners in establishing and strengtheningtransparent systems of public financial management.The problems of Somalia have spilled far beyondour borders. Foreign countries have taken in hundredsof thousands of Somalis f leeing the crisis in our country at considerable sacrifice to their own citizens; Somalipirates have become the scourge of shipping far fromour shores. Extremists from across the world have used our territory as a base from which to plan and launchattacks against foreign countries.As Somalia reclaims its status as a full memberof the international community  we must acknowledgeour responsibility as a nation  both for the proliferationof these problems and for their eventual resolution.We recognize the urgency of tackling these threatsto international security  but we are also conscious oftheir complexity and of the fact that lasting solutionscan be achieved only through ref lection  consultation the force of law and only  as a last resort  the judicioususe of force. We intend to engage with our internationalpartners on all of these fronts  as we strengthen ourinternal capacity to address these challenges.The road ahead is long  but we  the Somali people are committed  and we are ready. We have created theguideposts  and we have chosen a new leadership tohelp us move forward. We are grateful for the supportof the world community; we would not be here todaywithout its moral  political and financial support. Mostdear to us is the personal sacrifice made by our Africanbrothers and sisters who came in person to help usprotect our country and people. We cannot thank themenough  and we hope one day to be able to repay them.As many today have noted  the United Nationswas founded on the conviction that the nations of theworld could come together in the spirit of cooperationto tackle their common problems for the sake of thewhole of humanity.The world is going through a challengingperiod — economic crises  religious tensions andresource disputes. Every nation has its own challengesand priorities. And yet we come together as the UnitedNations to forge a common way forward  because werecognize that this small Earth is all the space wehave  and we must find a way to share it and coexistpeacefully.As Somalis  we have learned this hard lessonthrough bitter experience  and we are living throughit every day  each time another young man choosesto take his own life and the lives of others; each timea young mother has to bury a child. Let us not forgetthat in rebuilding a nation  or in steering the world toa better place  we are dealing with the lives of humanbeings  each life as precious as the next. For the futureof our children  we must work harder to make our worldpeaceful and prosperous. In that context  on behalf of the Somali people  Iwant to convey our condolences to the United Statesand Algeria on the recent violent loss of their seniordiplomats. Diplomacy is a peaceful calling and thefoundation of the United Nations  and we must protectdiplomats for their important role in promoting dialogueand better understanding across countries and cultures.The members of the Assembly are not strangersto conflict and war. Many countries have experiencedviolence and destruction equal to or greater than myown. But few other countries in modern times haveexperienced such a prolonged period of statelessness:a nation without a recognized Government  a validpassport or a convertible currency.But it is not just the material attributes of statehoodthat we have missed. To be stateless in this world ofStates is injurious to a people’s identity  to its rights andprivileges as a nation  and to its dignity. It is time for usto reclaim Somalia’s rightful place in the community ofnations  to shoulder our duties and obligations  and toplace our country in the service of peace  security andprosperity on this planet we share."
"158",6391,"SSD",67,2012,"﻿Allowme  at the outset  to join fellow Member States incongratulating the President of the General Assemblyon his election to preside over the Assembly at its sixtyseventhsession and to commend his predecessor for hissuccessful stewardship of the most recent session.I would like to seize this momentous occasion toexpress our deepest gratitude and appreciation to theSecretary-General for the passion and compassionhe has shown in responding to the various globalchallenges facing the Organization and  most important his unwavering personal support for our referendum onself-determination  our independence and the speedyadmission of the Republic of South Sudan into theUnited Nations.Furthermore  we are also deeply grateful to theAssembly for the warmth  generosity and hospitality accorded to our President when he addressed theAssembly last year. He made that address at the timewhen the international community was concernedabout the viability of our new nation. In the light ofthe progress we have made and despite recent events I am pleased to address the Assembly this year underthe theme of the sixty-seventh session “Bringing aboutadjustment or settlement of international disputes orsituations by peaceful means”.The Republic of South Sudan achieved itsindependence peacefully  through the exercise of theright of self-determination by the people of SouthSudan in an internationally supervised referendum as stipulated in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement(CPA). The international community played animportant role in this  our independence process. Weare therefore very thankful to all those who helped usachieve independence  not least the United Nations.Our declaration of independence on 9 July 2011 didnot resolve all the issues between us and the predecessorState  the Republic of the Sudan. These unresolved post-independence issues include border demarcation oil infrastructure  security and the final status of theAbyei Area. The bilateral engagement between the twocountries failed to achieve an agreement. As a result the African Union intervened by mandating the AfricanUnion High-level Implementation Panel  under formerPresident Thabo Mbeki  to facilitate negotiationsbetween the two parties.As the situation continued to deteriorate  theSecurity Council intervened and adopted resolution2046 (2012). That resolution sets out a clear road mapfor resolving all the remaining differences between theSudan and South Sudan  including Abyei  and addressesthe conflicts in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile.Before I discuss the developments in the talks inAddis Ababa  allow me to also brief the Assembly onother issues of importance such as State-building  foodsecurity  public service reform  access to education security and accountability in my country.We have embarked upon laying a secure foundationfor a prosperous  democratic and stable nation byestablishing institutions at the national  state and localGovernment levels for governance and the delivery ofservices to the people. We believe that food securityis not a privilege but a basic right of each and everycitizen in South Sudan. No citizen should go hungry.As the saying goes  a hungry man is an angry man. It will not be good for the stability of the country if wehave many hungry and angry men. In our endeavour toachieve food security  we are diversifying the economyby utilizing oil revenues to fuel agriculture and buildthe necessary basic infrastructure. This is the only waywe can benefit from the vast fertile agricultural landsthat our country is generously endowed with.Our public service is functioning satisfactorily especially after the introduction of far-reaching publicservice reforms. That has brought about efficiency andtransparency in service delivery. We have introducedconstructive and effective reforms in our publicfinancial management and have strengthened measuresto improve transparency and accountability.As for education  we have increased access toeducation for all children in South Sudan. Since thesigning of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  in2005  enrolment in our primary schools has more thandoubled. In the past year  we continued to strengthenand expand the education sector by further introducingalternative education. This innovative notion of analternative education system is currently offeringaccelerated learning programmes to more than 200 000youth and adults. Favourable conditions and terms ofservice for teachers have been introduced throughoutthe country  and the Government is working tirelesslyto meet the rapidly increasing demand for secondaryeducation caused by the increase in primary schoolenrolment.However  the Government still has a long way to goin providing educational opportunities for our childrenand youth that prepare them for the future and meet theirexpectations and aspirations. At this juncture  allowme to commend the launch by the Secretary-Generalof the Global Initiative on Education  which we hopewill open up avenues of collaboration between SouthSudan and the international community on improvingeducation access for our children.Our nascent nation has been tested enormously inits first year of independence. We have been tested byconflicts within and beyond our borders; we have beentested by severe economic hardship; and we have beentested by the revelation of severe abuse of the publictrust and funds resulting partly from malpracticeand lack of capacity. The Government is undertakingserious corrective measures and institutional capacitybuildingto address that issue in order to restore publicconfidence.My Government is striving harder than ever tocombat corruption in our public service. Along withreformed systems for management of public funds andtighter controls  we are combating corruption throughthe rule of law and through greater transparency andaccountability. The Government has enacted legislationthat holds public officials accountable and brings themanagement of our resources closer to internationalstandards.The Government has published the entire annualbudget and opened our books to public scrutiny. Bythe end of the year  we aim to be up to date on all ofthe audits of our national accounts since the signingof the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  in 2005. Asan accountable Government before our people  westill believe that there is a long way ahead to achievethe efficiency  transparency and accountability in ourpublic service and financial management. Despite theeconomic peril since the shut-down of oil production we are  nevertheless  encouraged that the currentperiod of austerity has strengthened our resolve to pressahead in our reform agenda and has allowed us to laya strong foundation for more efficient and accountablegovernance beyond the austerity period — tough timesnever last  but tough people do.With regard to security  the Republic of SouthSudan is currently facing security threats in the formof armed militia groups that are creating insecurity andundermining our young democracy. The Governmenthas accorded the highest priority to reaching a peacefulresolution to these internal conflicts. Four of the armedmilitia groups have laid down their weapons and haveintegrated voluntarily into our national army andcivilian life.We believe that the internal and external securityof our nation is a prerequisite for having meaningfuleconomic development and social progress. While we areworking tirelessly towards achieving and maintainingpeace within our borders  critical unresolved issuesremain between South Sudan and the Sudan  includingborder demarcation  citizenship rights  the status ofAbyei and oil-related issues. The lack of progress onthose post-independence issues has been posing a threatto peace and stable relations between the two countries.Our relations with the Sudan reached a criticaljuncture last year  when Khartoum blocked tankersloaded with our crude oil and prevented them fromdeparting from Port Sudan. In addition  Sudan seized and resold crude oil that we had sold to internationalcustomers. By January  we had lost some $800 millionin revenues. At that point  my Government was left withno choice but to shut down oil production. The decisionwas publicly supported by the majority of our people.In the context of relations of South Sudan and theSudan  it is incumbent upon my Government to shedsome light of what became known as the Heglig orPanthou incident between us and the Republic of theSudan. That crisis was the result of increasing bordertensions and repeated bombings in the border areas ofmy country by the Sudanese Armed Forces.In April  our forces clashed with the Sudanese armyin an area inside South Sudan  several kilometers southof Heglig. That resulted in our armed forces taking overHeglig temporarily; we acted in self-defence to preventHeglig from being used as a launching pad for militaryattacks by the Sudanese Armed Forces on our country.In compliance with advice from the internationalcommunity  we withdraw our forces soon thereafter.Although Heglig is historically part of South Sudan  itwas not our intention to take it by force. We believe thatwe can settle the matter through peaceful negotiations.Another area in which we believe we have not beenwell understood by the international community isour alleged support for the Sudan People’s LiberationMovement – North (SPLM-North). What may not befully appreciated by outside observers is that thoseforces were integral members of the SPLM. Butalthough they fought side by side with us  they werenot fighting for the independence of southern Sudan but for their own cause through alliance with us. Ofcourse  we shared a common vision of creating a new fundamentally restructured united Sudan of inclusivity equity and dignity for all  without discrimination on thebasis of race  ethnicity  religion or culture. But we alsohad issues that were specific to our particular situationand which  for us  eventually led to our independence.It should be recalled that the CPA included a specialprotocol on Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile statesthat addressed their special grievances. That protocolis yet to be credibly implemented. As the SPLM-Northwere former allies who contributed significantly to oursuccess in achieving the objectives of our struggle  weobviously have a moral and  indeed  political obligationto assist them in addressing their legitimate grievances as stipulated and agreed in the CPA. In that connection  South Sudan is currentlycarrying the burden of accommodating an increasingnumber of refugees from the two areas. We therefore callupon the international community to assist in meetingthe humanitarian needs of the refugees within SouthSudan  as well as throughout the Sudanese territory forthose internally displaced by the conflict.Our President stated in his statement at ourindependence celebration:“We cannot abandon them  but would support theircause peacefully through negotiated settlementbetween them and the Government of the Sudan”.South Sudan will use its good offices as a formerally of the SPLM-North to assist the Sudan by actingas an honest broker in mediating a peaceful  but just resolution of the conflict. We believe that our role ashonest brokers will in the long term assist our neighbourto the north  the Government of the Sudan  to achievepeace and stability. We are glad that the United Nationsrecognizes that there can be no military solution tothe conflict and that a negotiated settlement is the wayforward.I am pleased to inform the Assembly that  today President Salva Kiir Mayardit and President OmerHassan A. Al-Bashir signed an agreement that will allowthe two countries to pursue their national developmentefforts under a secure and lasting peace. We are hopefulthat the new agreement with the Sudan will lead to theresolution of our differences on security  borders andthe use of petroleum infrastructure.It is envisaged that if each side upholds its part ofthis agreement  the most significant causes of disputebetween our two countries will have been amicablyresolved. Diplomacy will have won  and reason willhave prevailed.With the resolution of those key matters preparations to resume oil production in South Sudanwill now begin. The following agreements were signedtoday between our two countries: first  the AgreementConcerning Oil and Related Economic Matters;second  the Framework Agreement on the Status ofNationals of the Other State; third  the Agreement onthe Demarcation of the Boundary; fourth  an agreementon border issues; fifth  the Agreement on a Frameworkfor Cooperation on Central Banking Issues; sixth  theAgreement on Trade and Trade-related Issues; seventh the Agreement on Certain Economic Matters: Divisionof Assets and Liabilities  Arrears and Claims and Joint Approach to the International Community; and  finally eighth  the Framework Agreement to Facilitate Paymentof Post-Service Benefits.While we are happy with all that has been agreedtoday by our two countries  I wish to inform the GeneralAssembly that we have failed to reach agreement onAbyei. President Al-Bashir has rejected the proposalof the African Union High-level ImplementationPanel  as stipulated under Security Councilresolution 2046 (2012). It is now incumbent upon theAfrican Union (AU) Peace and Security Council together with the United Nations Security Council  totake the action necessary to move forward.We are thankful to both the AU Peace and SecurityCouncil and the United Nations Security Councilfor their great efforts to bring about this agreementbetween our two countries.As our President stated in this forum one yearago  “The ambition of the people of South Sudan isto be able to transform their country into a regionalagro-industrial powerhouse” (see A/66/PV.19)  withreduced dependence on external assistance  and thepotential to feed the people of South Sudan and to be abreadbasket for East Africa.Our strategy is aimed at utilizing oil wealth asa catalyst to stimulate our economic developmentpotential  with an emphasis on agriculture.We are conscious of the fact that we cannot achievethose goals alone. We need continued support fromfriends  partners and the international community.We are confident that together we shall overcome thechallenges ahead. I take this opportunity once more on behalf of the people and the Government of SouthSudan  to express our profound gratitude for the supportrendered to us by the United Nations  the AU  regionalorganizations  friends and partners.Finally  allow me to reiterate the resolve and thecommitment of the people and the Government ofthe Republic of South Sudan to be a productive andactive member of this global family of nations  and tomake their contribution to promoting world peace andprosperity for all humankind."
"159",6423,"STP",67,2012,"﻿First of all  on behalf of the Government of Sao Tomeand Principe  and in my own name  I would like tocongratulate Vuk Jeremić on his election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.I am convinced that his experience as Minister forForeign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia will be a mostpositive contribution to strengthening the affirmationof the principles of the United Nations Charter forworld security and peace  and I trust that he will leadthe work of this session with clarity and balance.The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principealso wishes to express its great appreciation for thework of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and for hisrole in expanding our Organization and encouragingit to continue its efforts to achieve the objectives ofworld peace and security. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Ambassador Nassir AbdulazizAl-Nasser for his highly positive contribution duringthe sixty-sixth session.As it did during the debates of the sixty-sixthsession of the General Assembly  the DemocraticRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe reiterates itshope that the United Nations will play a key role inmediating international conflicts. Unfortunately  todaywe continue to look on with concern as conflicts thatcould jeopardize international peace and securitypersist and further exacerbate the deep economic andfinancial crisis that is devastating the world. Sadly our Organization continues to suffer from roadblocksthat prevent urgent decisions from being taken andthat undermine this forum’s credibility. That inactiontranslates into impunity for leaders who martyrize theirown peoples  paving the way for more internationaldisorder  despair and the sentiment of injustice that isexperienced when peoples receive unequal treatment.We need no further evidence of the urgency forin-depth reforms of our Organization  primarily theSecurity Council  than our inability to put an end tothe horrific images of children  symbols of purity andinnocence  who are killed daily in Syria  to prevent thedestruction of the world’s historic and cultural heritage as by gangs of destructive criminals in Mali and inAfghanistan  and to forestall coups d’état or obviousattempts to destabilize States and democratically electedGovernments that in fact solve nothing and irreparablydelay the lengthy process of building democracy andfighting poverty.We must prevent the disintegration of territoriesand remedy the abnormal and degrading situationsof peoples who have already suffered from thepoverty and exclusion created by a lack of democraticleadership or of effective and democratic rule of law.In the specific case of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau with which Sao Tome and Principe maintains deeplyrooted historic  cultural and linguistic links  theinternational community should bring both firmnessand persistence to bear in finding a credible  inclusiveand lasting solution that will ensure that coups d’étatdo not recur in that country. To do so necessarilyrequires a reform of the armed forces as well as astrong warning to the political class as a whole to makea steadfast commitment to respect political dialogueand democratic legality. On our side  we will continueto make efforts  in cooperation with the Communityof Portuguese-speaking Countries and other engagedregional and international organizations  to guarantee abetter future for the people of Guinea-Bissau.Regarding the occupation of the north of theRepublic of Mali by groups of terrorists and the persistentconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  SaoTome and Príncipe acknowledges and applauds theefforts the international community has made throughthe United Nations and the African Union to establishpeace  security and stability. However  it seems that it isbecoming increasingly essential for us to ask the Statesthat share borders with those two African countries toestablish more effective  intelligent and effective waysto cooperate  based on trust and on a matrix of mutuallybeneficial and realistic economic interests.It is common knowledge that the forces ofdestabilization  despair and terror are fuelled andfurthered by differences and distrust betweenStates  which in turn paralyses the internationaldecision-making process. However  we must point outpositive signs in the trends of a few conflicts on theAfrican continent  such as the cases of the Republics ofthe Sudan  South Sudan and Somalia. Consequently  wecannot fail to applaud the recent agreement signed by theRepublic of the Sudan and South Sudan. Through thatframework  the two countries will be able to live in peaceand harmony. We also welcome the positive role of theAfrican Union Mission in Somalia  which paves the wayto returning the political  economic and social situationof that country and the region to normalcy. Moreover in our opinion  the important recommendations of theSecretary-General’s report on the situation concerningthe Western Sahara (S/2012/197) are a positive asset fora permanent resolution.The social movements that took place in NorthAfrica in 2011  which had the merit of reinstatingthe right to freedom and democracy for the differentpeoples  were popular movements that in many caseswere mobilized through social networking and moderninstruments of technical communication. Varioussituations of insecurity and reprehensible acts  as wellas the acts recently committed in Benghazi of whichAmerican diplomats were the victims  raise the issue ofhow we may live in this new context of the circulationand dissemination of images and information at theglobal level  in a world that we want to be free  openand tolerant  but in which large segments of the worldpopulation still live in a state of extreme poverty  withno access to education and with the growing convictionthat they face exclusion and discrimination.How do we deal with the offences committedby people  including even some persons with publicpolitical responsibilities such as State leaders  whofail to recognize the right of other peoples and Statesto exist? In that regard  we would like to take theopportunity that this platform affords us to expressto the mourning families of diplomats  journalists members of non-governmental organization andpeacekeepers our sincere and deep condolences as wellas our unfailing solidarity. Our ongoing obligation towork to build a better world and to invest in educationand the promotion of human and democratic values isfundamental  beginning with Member States complyingwith all United Nations resolutions.The massacres in Syria must cease  the integrityand security of the State of Israel must be effectivelyguaranteed  the Palestinian people must have theirown State  the embargo against Cuba must end countries  including Iran  must have the right to civilnuclear technology and must scrupulously observe thecommitments that that entails  and polluters must bethe principal payers. It must be our ambition  and nota mere hope  to ensure that we return here next yearwith an agenda that includes fewer of these troublesomeissues  many of which are recurring.We are pleased to note a few positive signs in thedialogue between the Republic of China on Taiwanand the People’s Republic of China on the one hand and  on the other  the willingness of the United StatesCongress and the European Parliament to admit Taiwanas a member of international organizations. Sao Tomeand Principe supports initiatives such as these  whichwill make it possible for the people of Taiwan to make asignificant contribution to international issues withoutignoring the necessity for the two parties in the Straitsof Formosa to work peacefully to agree to frame andnormalize their relations.The High-level Meeting that preceded the generaldebate was an excellent opportunity for Member Statesto share information on how democratic reforms arebeing implemented and the rule of law strengthenedboth in individual countries and at the internationallevel. It is very pleasing that this discussion is leadingto significant progress in implementing the democraticand institutional reforms that can help to strengthen therule of law  internally and internationally. In that regard Sao Tome and Principe congratulates the Republicof Angola on its recent successful and transparentgeneral elections  since they also constitute anotherstep towards strengthening the democratic process inits sister country of Sao Tome and Principe.Threats to our global security  particularlytransnational crimes such as piracy and the traffickingand sale of arms and drugs  are a matter of great concernfor Sao Tome and Principe  a country with a longcoastline located in the Gulf of Guinea. Such eventsare threats that we cannot ignore; they demand that wecooperate as closely as possible both with the Stateswe share the coastline with and the other partners andorganizations that have experience in dealing with suchissues  and adopt mechanisms — which we resolve tostrengthen — for preventing  managing and resolvingconflicts caused by organized crime in order to improveour collective security.In that context  we applaud the important resolutions2018 (2011) and 2039 (2012) adopted by the SecurityCouncil on maritime safety and security in the Gulfof Guinea. As part of the Gulf of Guinea region  werepeat our firm pledge to do everything we can  jointlywith our partners  to prevent that region  rich as it is inraw materials of strategic importance to industrializedeconomies  from becoming a stage for maritime piracyand other scourges that hinder economic trade  peaceand security in the region. To that end  we reiterate thatwe are absolutely ready and willing to help implementinitiatives to hold an international summit on maritimepiracy in the Gulf of Guinea.The substantial transformations that have occurredin the international political arena as a result of the graveglobal financial crisis have forced the citizens of smallStates  and of Sao Tome and Principe in particular  tomake major sacrifices. In that regard  Sao Tome andPrincipe believes that the continuing internationaland economic financial crisis and its effects on theeconomies of small countries  which have includedreductions and slowdowns in official international aid tend to threaten social cohesion as well as previousimprovements in fiscal discipline  the business climateand political stability itself. The acceptability ofcontrolling and reducing public deficits in developingcountries such as ours is reaching its limits whereour citizens are concerned  and good governance nowdemands measures that can effectively jump-start oureconomies through productive investments.We believe that the most vulnerable populations in both the northern and southern hemispheres of ourplanet  are demanding changes in the practices and rules of the international financial system  and newworld financial governance that is better able to holdaccountable the financial stakeholders and speculatorswho undermine the efforts of Governments and theirpeoples to develop economies that bring progress.Internally  the Government of the DemocraticRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe is making effortsto reduce poverty and increase transparency in publicmanagement and economic growth. Institutionalreforms in the areas of public finance  justice andnational defence  whose purpose is to strengthen thecapacities of our democratic institutions and developthe country  have been progressing at a good pace.Regarding the Millennium Development Goals  forwhich the United Nations has set a deadline of 2015 the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe canreport significant progress  particularly in the areasof education  with a literacy rate of 92 per cent of thepopulation  and health  especially in the fight againstmalaria. However  we realize that meeting the deadlinewill require further effort.To achieve those goals  our country hopes tocontinue to receive support in many forms from theinternational community. In that regard  I would liketo take this opportunity to extend the sincere thanks ofthe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe tothe entire international community  and in particularUNESCO and all of its member States  for designatingthe island of Principe a UNESCO World BiosphereReserve  thus recognizing and providing furtherincentives for our efforts to defend and preserve theenvironment.I would like to conclude by repeating that theGovernment of Sao Tome and Principe  which I havethe honour of representing  stands ready and willing totake part in efforts to mobilize the will and synergyneeded to achieve the honourable goals that guided thecreation of the United Nations."
"160",6464,"SUR",67,2012,"﻿On behalf of Mr. DesiréDelano Bouterse  President of the Republic of Suriname I avail myself of this opportunity to extend to Mr. VukJeremić my congratulations on his election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.The wealth of experience that he brings to this bodywill certainly assist him in successfully discharging hisduties. We pledge our full support and cooperation.Allow me to salute his predecessor for his skilfulleadership at the sixty-sixth session. We wish himwell in his future endeavours. To Secretary-GeneralBan Ki-moon we pledge our support for his valuablecontribution in advancing the purposes and principlesof the Organization.In his annual statement last week  in which heintroduced the 2013 national budget  the President ofSuriname highlighted Suriname’s strengths and theopportunities and challenges we are facing as a young vibrant member of the international community. Asrefiners and exporters of crude oil and its derivatives  aswell as producers and exporters of gold  a combinationof windfalls in earnings related to the trade of thosecommodities and the application of prudent fiscalpolicies  have resulted in a politically and economicallystable environment. That stability in turn has becomeconducive to solid domestic and foreign investmentsin the more sustainable sectors  in which agriculture and tourism score high. The design and constructionof relevant infrastructure demonstrate Suriname’spotential to be a player on the supply side of strategiccommodities.President Bouterse also presented a social packagein which education and health care figure prominently.He made the point that strong international ratings areencouraging indicators for investors. However  thecitizens of Suriname who lack the right opportunitieswill share in the achievements only if the Governmentis able to present them with a package comprising job-oriented education at an academic as well as a vocationallevel  adequate health services  sports facilities  accessto potable water  information and communicationstechnology facilities and proper waste disposal. Thechallenge of financing such an improved social packagemakes it necessary to empower our production andservice sectors by providing funds and know-how toour entrepreneurs.Suriname  as a young nation  is experiencing anongoing decolonization process that involves both itsstructure and its mindset. Building a nation of half amillion people constitutes an enormous challenge whenat least seven different ethnic and cultural traditionsoriginate from the Americas  Africa and Europe  whilea considerable part of the population traces its roots toIndia  Indonesia  China and the Middle East. .Suriname is known for the presence of a synagoguelocated next to a mosque in the heart of the capitalParamaribo  while Christian churches coexist withHindu temples and places of worship with a strongAfrican affinity. We are proud to state that we havebeen able to convert that challenge into a unique andexemplary benefit and that the divide-and-rule policyof colonial days is gradually disappearing  making wayfor mutual respect  tolerance and peaceful coexistence which redound to the advantage of all our citizens.Suriname is a country blessed with an exuberantarray of biodiversity. That splendid gift of the Almightymust be cherished and protected to the fullest extent.It needs to be mapped out in a way that allows forresponsible use. The challenge we face is responding tothe genuine developmental needs of our people  whileat the same time respecting and preserving biodiversityfor future generations  and indeed for humankind.My country has committed itself to that causeby  among other actions  creating a nature reserve of1.8 million hectares. We have accepted the obligation to educate our small gold miners in the use of moderntechnology that will not only prove more lucrative andsafe but also respect the need for a clean environment allowing for potable water and profitable agriculture.Suriname must remain green and smart.Suriname is very much aware of the fact thatwhile we have solid advantages as a nation  we canonly survive and prosper by adapting to a world that isbecoming more and more interdependent. Having beenblessed with oil reserves  trillions of cubic metres offossil water reserves  along with hundreds of rivers swamps  creeks  arable land and minerals  includinggold  copper  granite  rare earth and more  Surinamehas become a focal point in view of the ever-growingscarcity of those commodities.In order to maintain and enhance our politicalstability  we must deepen and widen our eco-commercialposition and be able to keep our country and peoplesafe from any outside intervention and interference.Suriname has engaged in a serious quest for integrationwith its immediate neighbours — Guyana  Franceand Brazil — at a bilateral and  wherever possible tripartite level. Suriname is also a devoted participantin the historic movement of regional integration that isgrowing in form and substance. We are active membersof the Union of South American Nations  the secretariatof which will be based in Suriname as from July 2013.We are committed to the creation of a CaribbeanCommunity multinational corporation  giving a moremeaningful basis to the single market and economicgoals put in place since 2006. As one of the foundingmembers of the Community of Latin American andCaribbean States  we continue to be dedicated to theintegration mechanism of the Americas  remainingcommitted to the principles and objectives of theOrganization of American States.Although our region is making enormous strides infurthering democracy and development  we must drawthe attention of the international community to the lackof progress in assisting one of the most disadvantagedcountries in the Western Hemisphere  namely Haiti.We call on the international community to honour itspledges to assist the Government and people of Haiti intheir efforts to rebuild their beloved country.Furthermore  our quest for integration will neverbe complete if we continue to accept the isolation of oursister nation  Cuba  as a consequence of the unjustlyimposed economic and trade embargo. Once again  we firmly call for an immediate end of those coercivemeasures  which cause so much suffering to the peopleof Cuba.When Suriname became a Member of the UnitedNations 36 years ago  we were little aware of theimportance of a number of issues not specificallydealing with decolonization. Now we have grownin our understanding. We realize that a properlyfunctioning United Nations  including a democraticallybased Security Council  has the potential to becomethe single most important stabilizing factor in a worldthat has moved from bipolarity to multipolarity. In theworld of ever-shifting economic  political  diplomaticand military Powers  the themes of the sixty-seventhsession of the General Assembly were appropriatelychosen.We specifically want to draw the Assembly’sattention to the need for dialogue in situations ofconflict. In our understanding  it is not easy for Powersthat have grown accustomed to controlling othernations to grasp fully what it means to move away fromdominance and dependence to interdependence and theneed for dialogue in solving real or alleged conflicts.Both the United States of America and the FederativeRepublic of Brazil clearly endorsed the concept in theirstatements at the opening of our general debate.We urge all Member States in general and theformer colonial Powers in particular to accept the newreality of our world by categorically refraining fromapplying their own standards in judging the outcome ofother countries’ democratic structures and aspirations disrespecting the internationally accepted principles ofterritorial integrity  sovereignty and independence ofnations all over the world.It is within that framework that I quote the closingremarks at the presentation of the 2013 national budgetby Mr. Desiré Delano Bouterse  President of theRepublic of Suriname:“As regards the sovereignty of our belovedSuriname as an independent nation  our principaltask is none other than to respect and to defend thesovereignty of our nation against all violations andattacks from outside.“Whenever and by whomever our sovereigntyis being challenged  our legitimate Governmenthas no other duty than to defend and safeguard theentrusted sovereignty of the country”. The United Nations was built on the ashes of theSecond World War  and we pledged to save successivegenerations from the scourge of war. The peacefulsettlement of disputes is the only avenue throughwhich we can ensure that the planet will be saved fromannihilation. That principled stand must be appliedto all areas of conflict  whether the conflict is in theMiddle East  Africa  the Americas or anywhere else inthe world.The target date for achieving the MillenniumDevelopment Goals is fast approaching. The year2015 will be a decisive year when world leaders willgather once again to assess the implementation of thecommitments made. We underscore the importanceof creating well-being for all and providing greateropportunities for the vulnerable in our society by givingfull access to high-quality education at all levels andaffordable and high-quality health care and services  aswell as realizing the commitments to gender equalityand the empowerment of women.It is necessary to increase the ability of women allover the world to bring about change  to ensure thatthey can exist in an environment free from violenceand conducive to their well-being  including access todecent employment  services and housing.We acknowledge the global burden and threat ofnon-communicable diseases. In moving towards thefull implementation of the Political Declaration of theHigh-level Meeting of the General Assembly on thePrevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases(resolution 66/2  annex)  as well as other commitmentswe have made  we stress the importance of multisectoralactions  strengthening health systems  ensuring theavailability of adequate and sustained resources  aswell as enhanced international cooperation througheffective partnerships. Suriname has increased itsefforts in the fight against those often overlooked silentkillers.The United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment concluded without an agreement on aclear commitment with regard to the financing ofsustainable development. That is a very serious matter considering the threat of climate change  among others to a successful outcome of the efforts of small Stateslike Suriname to achieve sustainable development. Theinternational community cannot abandon its obligation to provide the necessary means to combat the seriousconsequences of overconsumption  pollution and carbonemissions  which threaten to undo our achievementsaimed at protecting the environment and securing thewell-being of our peoples. We continue to expect theUnited Nations to spearhead the efforts for technicalassistance and to advance continued dialogue.Suriname is deeply concerned with regard to thebasis on which countries in development are classifiedin the international financial institutional framework.Such classifications  without due consultations negatively affect the type and level of assistance thata country can receive from international financialinstitutions. We can only characterize those decisionsas undemocratic and as a virtual punishment ofour achievements in improving our socioeconomicsituation.In conclusion  I wish to solemnly declare thatSuriname will always put its faith in multilateralismthrough its unwavering support for the principlesand objectives enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations."
"161",6488,"SVK",67,2012,"﻿At the outset  I wishto convey thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General for his true commitment to the fulfilment ofthe purposes and principles of the United Nations. The United Nations and its General Assembly are aunique tool  the one and only global forum that providesroom for dialogue to discuss strategic visions and toseek policy-level solutions to the problems that we arejointly confronted with at the international  regionaland national levels. It is our obligation and moral dutyto search together for ways of bringing peace andprosperity to all humankind. Conflicts do not stop atborders. The world we live in is so interconnected thatevery problem is a problem for all of us and every threatis a threat faced by all. At the same time  every successis of benefit to all of us.Besides numerous indisputable benefits  theprocess of globalization introduces new challenges. Iwill mention just three challenges encountered in theearly twenty-first century: the global economic crisis environmental change and man-made threats  includingterrorism and weapons of mass destruction. We needglobal partnership and cooperation. We need strongmultilateralism. We need a proactive United Nations thatcan lead effectively on all fronts: political  economic military  social and civil. We need a trustworthy UnitedNations that people can rely upon to save them from thescourge of war. We need to work together towards ourcommon goal: peace  security and dignity for all.The Organization’s primary objective is to preservepeace and security in the world. We have been throughan extremely challenging year full of unexpected twistsand turns  including some severe new conflicts  graveviolations of human rights  disease  famine  terrorismand extremism  as well as other threats to peace andsecurity  which  unfortunately  we cannot alwayssuccessfully prevent. Attacks have even occurredagainst diplomats and diplomatic missions  which weresolutely condemn as totally unacceptable.It is the way we go about resolving constantlyoccurring conflicts and the effectiveness of ourresponses to new threats that tells us how successfulwe are in meeting the objectives of the United Nations.Violence can never be the right way to settle a dispute.Open dialogue  respect for mutual differences and ajoint search for solutions by peaceful means is the onlyway to proceed; there is no alternative. Therefore  weappreciate the appeal to concentrate specifically onthat crucial aspect of international relations. We areall obliged under the Charter of the United Nations toresolve disputes by peaceful means so that peace andsecurity are not at risk.The Charter provides us with a range of options including negotiation  enquiry  mediation  conciliation arbitration and other peaceful means  which mustbe used effectively. Mediation under the auspicesof the United Nations is key to resolving conflictsby peaceful means. Reinforcing United Nationsmediation capacities  confidence-building  improvedimplementation of the Charter and enhanced respect forits provisions are central.While the nature of conflicts evolves and changes their essence remains the same — achieving goals byviolence. I refer not just to military battles. Famineand thirst have even more devastating consequencesthan weapons. Unfair distribution of wealth  socialimbalances  poverty and the feeling of injustice remainbreeding grounds for conflicts and disputes. Personswhose basic needs are met do not seek conflict; rather they seek ways of making the best of their lives. In thatcontext  I think that prevention is the most effectivetool for ensuring peace  sustainable growth and a lifeof dignity.It is crucial to eliminate the primary causesof conflicts  including through poverty reduction sustainable development  respect for human rights  therule of law and respect for its instruments  building ofdemocratic institutions  and arms control. Those arethe basic building blocks of peace and prosperity. TheUnited Nations  with its multipurpose focus  possessesthe potential to effectively assist its Members in allthose areas. But it must be adequately empowered todo so.However  we still differ considerably on what theUnited Nations should do  and how. Terrorism poses animminent threat to every one of us  yet we are unableto find common grounds to describe its characteristics.Climate change has brought about crucial changes withconcrete impacts on agricultural production  yet theproduction of greenhouse gases and emissions doesnot decline. The gap between the wealthy and the poorhas been growing. An increasingly important role isbeing played by non-State actors — multinationalcorporations and speculative investors.The crisis has shown that even the strongesteconomies are vulnerable. They are vulnerable whenthey live on credit  when the moral hazard goes beyondwhat is sustainable. The crisis has shown that peacehas its limits in every society  whether that society ismore or less advanced. It is important for the globaleconomy that the strongest economies are stable and  in particular  that they are aware of their responsibilityfor global development and the sustainability ofsocial stability in the world. This is not only about theapplication of the principle of social solidarity; it isabout the self-preservation of humankind.We therefore have to pursue a common target:to transform the United Nations into an effectiveOrganization with a leading role in a new internationalenvironment. We need a political willingness on thepart of all Members and a clear vision to adapt theUnited Nations to the global demands of the twenty-first century.One of the instruments for preventing conflicts isthe elimination of poverty and ensuring sustainabledevelopment for all  and in all aspects. The UnitedNations has the necessary tools in its hands. At a timeof fiscal constraints  we have to use the existing toolsmore effectively. We do not need to create new parallelor duplicate structures.At the United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment (Rio+20)  we agreed that we needed aninclusive  strong multilateral system that will be ableto effectively address threats in the area of sustainabledevelopment. Such a system is crucial for enduringpeace and  of course  for security.We support Sustainable Energy for All  aninitiative launched by the Secretary-General. In thespirit of the initiative  we emphasize  among otherthings  the positive aspects of the use of nuclear energyin the energy and health care sectors. I am convincedthat priority investments in research to increase theoperational safety and security of nuclear power plantswould be more useful than massive investment in theclosure of functioning power plants.Slovakia is prepared to intensively and constructivelycooperate with partners in order to maximize theeffective functioning of the United Nations system inthe economic  social  environmental and other areas.We support strengthening the Economic and SocialCouncil and more effective cooperation of the Councilwith the General Assembly and other entities across theUnited Nations system.Slovakia takes seriously its moral duty to helpdeveloping countries and countries in distress. We haveless than three years to go to accomplish the UnitedNations Millennium Development Goals. We needto step up our efforts. As a donor country  Slovakiacontributes its share to addressing the pressing problems of global development. Despite its tight budget  Slovakiaincreases its total contribution to official developmentassistance every year.A secure and stable environment conducive todevelopment cannot be achieved without effective armscontrol and universal disarmament as the fundamentalinstruments of conflict prevention. Slovakia is anadvocate of a comprehensive  universal and bindingarms trade treaty. Our objective is to curb irresponsibledealing in arms and to prevent their transfer to the handsof terrorists  criminals and other illicit groups. I regretthat the years-long efforts of States  in cooperation withcivil society  were not crowned with success at the July2012 Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty. I believethat further negotiations will lead to a consensus on aneffective agreement.A world free of nuclear weapons is one of thepriorities long pursued by the international community.Although we have made some progress in this respectin recent years  there are still countries that are notparties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons.We appreciate that a conference on a Middle Eastzone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of massdestruction has been scheduled for December 2012 inHelsinki. We believe that despite the regrettable turmoilin the region and the unwillingness of some countries tocooperate  we will overcome the differences and jointlybring the conference to a successful conclusion  for thesake of our common goal  namely  peace and securityin the Middle East without the fear of nuclear weapons.Success of the conference would also support long-lasting efforts to drive away concerns over the Iraniannuclear programme. Rocket tests performed by Irando not contribute to belief that its nuclear programmeserves a peaceful purpose.With regard to further improvements in thework of peacebuilding missions and increasing theireffectiveness  I would like to mention three aspectsthat I consider crucial: first  cooperation among UnitedNations missions; secondly  the protection of civiliansand the contributions to monitoring human rights; and thirdly  the need to prepare a strategy for the transitionfrom peacekeeping to peacebuilding  that is  increasedeffectiveness in the implementation of securitysector reform. More intensive cooperation amongpeacekeeping missions will allow for effective sharing offunds  equipment and personnel between neighbouringmissions  as well as contribute to improving thecapabilities of United Nations peacekeeping forcesto adequately respond to unforeseen situations. Theprotection of civilians is one of the main objectivesunder the mandates of peacekeeping operations. It willenable the restoration of political processes in a country including the implementation of measures aimed atthe disarmament  demobilization and reintegration ofcombatants  as well as of ordinary people affected by theconflict  including children. As the road from conflictto enduring peace is complicated  it is important thatwe prepare strategies for the peacekeeping forces toanticipate and transfer responsibility for peacekeepingin a host country with the aim of eliminating duplicateinstruments and procedures.Last year  the international community devotedconsiderable attention and funds to support Afghanistanon its road towards responsibility for its own securityand for meeting its obligations. Afghanistan remainsthe top-priority foreign military operation for Slovakia.Our troops will stay in Afghanistan as long as necessary.Security and stability also depend on a stableeconomy. Therefore we also wish to intensify ourinvolvement in the area of development assistance.Afghanistan remains one of the three primary recipientsof Slovakia’s official development assistance. At thesame time  we support the central role of the UnitedNations and the United Nations Assistance Mission inAfghanistan in capacity-building and stabilization inAfghanistan. Wherever in the world human lives are atrisk  the international community should be preparedto take resolute action.Allow me to express my deepest regret over thethousands of victims of the conflict in Syria. The SlovakRepublic has joined the initiative requesting that themost serious crimes under international law committedin Syria be investigated by the International CriminalCourt. The primary responsibility for the protectionof its citizens is always borne by the Government anddemocratic institutions of a country. The aim is tobuild a country governed by the rule of law  respectinginternational principles and at the same time reflectingtraditional common law.Slovakia is committed to the United Nationsprinciples set out in the Charter. We believe that the keyto resolving global problems in today’s interconnectedworld is an inclusive and effective multilateralism.Global threats to security  the economy  the environment or society know no borders and are so extensive that nocountry and no regional organization can alone respondto or defend against them effectively.We believe that  together  we will make progresson our agenda during the current session of the GeneralAssembly. That is what our citizens expect from us."
"162",6513,"SVN",67,2012,"﻿At the outset  let mecongratulate His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić  Presidentof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session  onhis election and wish him success in discharging hisduties. It is my honour to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his ableleadership and tireless efforts in guiding the UnitedNations in these demanding times.The theme of this session of the General Assemblyis “Bringing about adjustment or settlement ofinternational disputes or situations by peaceful means”.We had an opportunity to listen to the speakers at theopening of the session  who stressed the importance ofpreventing violence and the responsibility of all MemberStates  their leaders and international organizations to take any action they can to prevent and raise awarenessof such horrible events.Among other issues of global concern  I would liketo draw the Assembly’s attention to the horrific scenesin Syria. A civil war has been dragging on there formany months. Efforts at mediation unfortunately havefailed. It shocks our conscience that we have been unableto stop the bloodshed. Sadly  we have not succeeded inprotecting civilians. In my view  the situation is critical.It speaks to the urgent need to consider strengtheningthe preventive capacities of the United Nations  itsStates Members and regional organizations.Concerted efforts to avert mass atrocities areneeded. Last year we celebrated the sixtieth anniversaryof the entry into force of the Convention on thePrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.The Convention was the result of the tireless efforts ofMr. Raphael Lemkin  a Polish lawyer. He stalked thehalls of the United Nations every day until December1948  when the General Assembly finally adopted theConvention. Afterwards he continued his work  and hisendeavours paid off in 1951  when the Convention cameinto force.We then waited half a century to see the firstconviction of an individual for the crime of genocide.The establishment of the International Tribunals forthe Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the 1990s wasfollowed by the historic creation of the permanentInternational Criminal Court. That was anothermilestone in the humanization of international relations.A further encouraging development is that the UnitedNations system has improved its internal coordinationof activities related to the prevention of genocide. TheOffices of the Special Adviser on the Prevention ofGenocide and Mass Atrocities and the Special Adviseron the Responsibility to Protect were established at thattime. The Human Rights Council has helped to promotethe culture of prevention.Over the past months  the Syrian tragedy hasincreased awareness of our responsibility to preventand stop mass atrocities. United States PresidentBarack Obama has established a promising atrocitiesprevention board and  in his remarks at the UnitedStates Holocaust Memorial Museum in April  made thepoint that national sovereignty was never a licence toslaughter your people. I hope we all share his belief thatpreventing genocide is an achievable goal. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged in his speech at the opening of this session that we should give the responsibility toprotect concept a tangible meaning.To my regret  however  we have not yet achieveda common understanding on the modalities involved.We should therefore focus and strengthen our dialogueto that end. There is room for improving the modesof collaboration between the national  regional andinternational levels.It will be recalled that after the Second World Warmore than 80 countries witnessed mass atrocities. Atleast 53 million innocent lives were lost. Behind thosenumbers were real men and women made of f lesh andblood  and also children. They had futures but werenot allowed to live. Behind those numbers there arestill traumatized families and the distorted creativepotential of the affected societies. Bearing that in mind we should be able to set at least basic limits on humanbehaviour and stop mass atrocities.I therefore urge the States Members of the UnitedNations  the members of the regional and subregionalorganizations and the United Nations system to developa new strategy to prevent genocide and other massatrocities. Moreover  an intergovernmental forum oflike-minded countries should be formed to propose aUnited Nations resolution that would set a clear mandatefor the preparation and adoption of an appropriate legalmechanism — a legal mechanism that would providethe responsibility to protect concept with new tools  alegal mechanism that would enforce crime prevention a mechanism to facilitate a more rapid and effectiveresponse to acts of genocide and other mass atrocities.Slovenia stands ready to start a dialogue to thatend. We are going to convene the first meeting inthe following months. I am glad that we have alreadyenlisted substantial support for the initiative duringthis Assembly session. The initiative originates frominternational civil society. The Institute for CulturalDiplomacy in Berlin has collected many thousandsof supporters among international non-governmentalorganizations  lawyers  students  journalists and otherindividuals. Support is on the increase  and this isnot just one isolated initiative. There are many othersacross the globe.We should  of course  also enhance ourcollaboration with a view to the prosecution of allegedperpetrators of genocide and mass atrocities  includingindividual States. Effective prosecution undoubtedlyhas a deterrent effect and contributes substantially to a culture of prevention. Moreover  a genuine culture ofprevention needs to be developed globally. We shouldimprove our understanding of the warning signs  whichshould trigger early action.These days we witness numerous acts of violenceagainst diplomatic and consular missions in one partof our world. I strongly condemn such violent acts.They can never be justified. Freedom of speech isfundamental in a democracy  and a violent responsehas never been able to silence it. Only by strengtheningintercultural dialogue can we diminish the potentialfor conflict. Only mutual respect can contribute tomaintaining peace and security.Mr. Prosor (Israel)  Vice-President  took the Chair.It was in 1946 that Raphael Lemkin asserted thatour whole heritage is a product of the contributionsof all nations. Each and every nation and the UnitedNations as a whole have an enormous responsibility and also an opportunity  to prevent future atrocities.We cannot escape our history but let us learn from it.I fully believe that we do not want the mistakes ofyesterday to be repeated tomorrow. We took over theresponsibility for the world from our fathers and havean enormous responsibility to make it a better placefor our children. I therefore invite all here to do so byjoining in our efforts for a world free from genocide."
"163",6558,"SWE",67,2012,"﻿Our world is changing rapidly.The black-and-white photos that were taken whenthis Organization was created back in 1945 are trulytestimonies from another era. That was a time whencomputers had barely been invented. The Internetwas decades away. And it was not always easy forthe representatives at that founding conference inSan Francisco to establish contact with their farawaycapitals for instructions that might be needed.These days  we have instant access to the globalinformation network. Tweets are being written as Ispeak. There are more connected devices than there arepeople in the world  and development is accelerating inevery respect. In 2012  we who are gathered here haveall become representatives of the connected nations ofthe world. But  connectivity also carries risks  as wesaw recently in our interconnected financial system Recently  we also all followed with horror anddisbelief the fact that an odious film clip postedsomewhere on YouTube could lead to outrage and deadlyviolence 10 000 miles away. But the opportunitiescreated by connectivity are vastly more importantthan the risks. Globalization  marked by more opensocieties in a more open world and facilitated by theenormous advances of science and technology  hasbeen an incredible force for good. Mobile bankingbrings financial services to East Africans. Skypereinforces messages from the Arab street. Virtualmarketplaces unleash entrepreneurial talent. Morecontact  more movement and more trade — a moreopen world — have already lifted hundreds of millionsof people out of poverty and despair  and more iscertain to come.In this world of connected nations  people aroundthe globe  including tens of thousands of Swedes ofSyrian origin  are following the tragedy unfolding inDamascus  Aleppo and Homs with intense concern. Wehave all been reminded of a simple truth — violenceis easy to start but very difficult to stop. What beganas a popular protest has now turned into a civil war which  if unchecked  brings the risk of sectarianfragmentation across the wider region. We must doeverything possible to prevent that from happening.We call on the divided Security Council to put globalresponsibilities above narrow national interests. In thestrongest possible terms  we urge the Al-Assad regimeto stop killing its own people and start respecting itsobligations as a Member of the United Nations. Andwe remind those responsible for deadly violence andabuse that they should rest assured that they will beheld accountable one day.There is no alternative to a political solution.Together with our European partners  we offer ourfull support to the Joint Special Representative Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. Syria is a society that is richin culture  history and traditions. Damascus is one ofthe oldest continually inhabited cities in our world. Topreserve and protect the mosaic that Syria representsis vital to its future  and  I would argue  to all of ourfutures.But we must also help those now so tragicallyaffected by what is happening. A thousand people arebeing killed every week  according to the latest reportswe are receiving. We are witnessing an enormous humantragedy. More than 2.5 million people are in need ofhumanitarian help. More than a million people havebeen displaced inside Syria  and there are a quarter ofa million refugees in the region as a direct consequenceof the current crisis. The regime must give unhinderedaccess for assistance to the displaced and suffering  andthe countries that have generously opened their bordersshould be commended and supported. Sweden  whichis one of the world’s largest humanitarian donors  hascontributed massively  and we stand ready to furtherincrease our support here and elsewhere around theworld where people in need are suffering.In this world of connected nations  the humanrights of every child  woman and man are a matter ofconcern for us all. Protecting and promoting humanrights is one of the central duties of the internationalcommunity. Not only is that a question of protectingindividual human beings — their life  their freedom their future — but it is also crucial to promoting peace stability and prosperity around the globe. And criticalto those efforts is working for gender equality and theempowerment of women  because it is right  because itis smart and because it is fundamental to realizing theeconomic and political potential of society.Sweden  the largest financial contributor tothe work of the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights today  is a candidatefor a seat on the Human Rights Council for the period2013-2015. As a Council member  Sweden would bean active and reliable partner. We would work witheveryone who shares our conviction  reach out to thosewho disagree and support those who need it. But in thatarea as well  we must adjust to the world of connectivity.The human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrinedin the Universal Declaration of Human Rights mustapply in the modern world of today. Sweden will takeevery opportunity to champion freedom of expressiononline and the immense development potential that isvested in the Internet and all of the new communicationtechnologies. Earlier this year  the Human RightsCouncil decided that the rights that apply off line applyonline as well  and called on all States to promoteand facilitate access to the Internet. That landmarkresolution (Human Rights Council resolution 20/8) wasunanimously adopted in Geneva  and I hope that it hasbeen duly noted here in New York as well. The fight forfreedom on the Internet is the new front line in the fightfor freedom in the world.In this world of connected nations  we share a planetwith common development challenges. The world’spoor — indeed  all of us — need development that isinclusive  equitable and sustainable. The internationalcommunity has met three of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals well ahead of time  but we arelagging significantly behind in others. And while weaccelerate efforts to reduce child mortality and improvematernal health  we have started to look beyond theimmediate future. Sweden welcomes the high-levelpanel on the post-2015 development agenda and looksforward to contributing to its recommendations.In Rio  world leaders recently launched a processfor working towards sustainable development goals.It is up to all of us to take that agenda forward: toinvolve scientists and business  to explore the potentialof information and communications technology andinnovation  to pursue all three dimensions of sustainabledevelopment and to ensure that democracy and humanrights are part of the equation. And as an active partnerand a major donor  Sweden will certainly do its part.In this world of connected nations  geography issometimes of little consequence. Distances might attimes seem enormous. But the melting Arctic ice capin the North can pose an existential threat to smallisland States in the South. The Arctic today is warmingtwice as fast as the global average. And right now aswe gather here  the Arctic Sea ice cover has recededso much that it has reached a new historical minimum.There is less ice this autumn in the Arctic than everbefore in recorded history.The impact of climate change is global. The worldis not on track for keeping the increase in globalaverage temperatures to below two degrees Celsius.We therefore urgently need progress in the negotiationsunder the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and effective implementation of theglobally agreed outcomes. Sweden calls on everyone inthis Hall to do their utmost to contribute to ensuringthat that occurs  and developed nations should take thelead.There are severe challenges  but there are also greatopportunities. Technology brings new possibilities — toreduce emissions  increase growth  and move towardsa truly sustainable future. As the current Chair of theArctic Council — comprising the eight nations whoselandmass extends beyond the Arctic Circle — Swedenwill make its contribution. Together  we will set anexample of positive cooperation in an area drawingrapidly increasing global attention and where  not longago  many were predicting competition and conflict.We live in a new era. What happens in the Levant the Arctic or elsewhere has immediate implicationsfor us all. In order to deal with the challenges of thisera  the connected nations of this world need a strongUnited Nations — a United Nations to discuss theissues of today and to truly seize the opportunities forcollective action in order to shape a better tomorrow; aUnited Nations where we convene in these days to saythat  while ridiculing what by others is held sacred ismean and offensive  it can never be used as an excusefor violence  destruction and death.But the United Nations — our UnitedNations — needs to step up to the challenge. TheSecurity Council must assume its responsibilities  inSyria and elsewhere. Member States must empower theUnited Nations to become better at conflict preventionand peacebuilding  and ensure that it can deliverdevelopment results effectively and as one.It is up to us  the Member States  to meet ourinternational human rights obligations  not just in orderto protect the individual human being  but becauserespect for human rights is also  as we have bitterlylearned throughout history  critical to peace andsecurity.In these times of accelerating global change  with itsgreat risks and even greater opportunities  Sweden willremain a steadfast member of this global Organizationand  together with our partners in the European Union we will continue to promote an effective multilateralsystem with the United Nations at its core."
"164",6596,"SWZ",67,2012,"﻿It is an immense pleasure for meto join other Heads of State and Government at thissixty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I shouldlike to begin by congratulating the President uponhis election to steer the work of the Assembly at this session. His experience and abilities are well knownand respected. We have full confidence that he willtake the Organization to greater heights. The Kingdomof eSwatini is ready to give him all the support that hedeserves in carrying out this mammoth task.I also wish to thank the Secretary-General for hisdetailed report on the work of the Organization (A/67/1).We have seen the staff of the United Nations workingvery hard  sometimes in very difficult and hostileenvironments  dedicating their service to helping thosewho require our assistance and support. The Kingdomof eSwatini commends the Secretary-General and hisdedicated team for working tirelessly to ensure therealization of all aspirations of the Organization.As we gather here  we must always rememberthat the role of the United Nations is to keep peacethroughout the world  to develop and to help nations towork together in resolving challenges such as hunger unemployment  conflicts  disease and illiteracy  amongothers. The United Nations also aims to be the centrefor harmonizing the actions of nations to achieve ouraspirations.We are meeting here at a time when the wholeworld is facing numerous challenges  such as theeconomic and financial crisis. The Kingdom ofeSwatini believes that the United Nations is theappropriate forum to deliberate on these challengesin order to come up with united global solutions. Aspart of the global community  the Kingdom of eSwatinihas not been spared from this economic predicament.Our social development programmes that enhance thedelivery of the Millennium Development Goals andnational projects  such as job creation and povertyalleviation strategies  have been adversely affectedby the prevailing situation. The gains we have madein the fight against HIV and AIDS through the rolloutof antiretroviral treatments remain threatened by theuncertainty around the financial sustainability of theprogramme.We wish to acknowledge the support we continueto receive from the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria in mitigating all diseases.The Fund has gone a long way in injecting resourcesinto our national programme of promoting health asa key national priority. The need to work together toovercome these challenges could not have been moreessential. In our efforts to address global economic challenges we should be conscious of the social implications ofsome of the proposed solutions. Our strategies shouldnot create more hardship  but rather find answers thatmitigate the difficulties we face. I am confident that with our wealth of different experiences  we standto benefit from valuable strategies  especially fromthose States that have not been seriously affected bythe financial crisis. We urge those countries to sharetheir experiences for the benefit of all Member States.The Kingdom of eSwatini calls on the United Nationsto consider making these challenges among its toppriorities during this session.The Kingdom of eSwatini last month convergedon Sibaya for dialogue on social  economic andpolitical issues with a view to crafting solutions andagreeing on a way forward that would best improve ourlivelihoods. Sibaya is a place where every citizen is freeto participate irrespective of gender  creed  religion oraffiliation  among other things. We believe in the fullparticipation of all citizens at the grass-roots level in thedecision-making process. This forum is an institutionwhere key national pronouncements are made andnational sustainable development strategies conceived.Our national Constitution and National DevelopmentStrategy are outputs of this structure. This practice hasbeen passed on from generation to generation  and hascontinued to serve us well  since it allows the people tocontribute to their own welfare.Like many other States Member of the Organization the Kingdom of eSwatini has been working hardtowards the ratification of United Nations conventions as well as of continental and regional protocols. I ampleased to inform the Assembly that the Sibaya forumprovided the whole nation with an opportunity todiscuss those conventions and protocols  which havesince been ratified by Parliament and deposited withthe Secretary-General. We are pleased that we can nowbe counted among the countries that have successfullyratified United Nations conventions and protocols.The world we live in has become a complicatedplace with the advent of modern technology. We remainfaced with the challenge of how best to take advantageof this technology  such as social media  to promotepeace and stability. If there is anything we need to do  itis to promote peace in the world. It is true  and we fullyagree with the assertion that there is no need to promoteviolence of any kind  be it the killing of diplomats  theforced removal of Governments  or any other form. In this world  we must all live together in peace  whether asMuslims  Christians or any other traditional believers.We must learn to respect each other irrespective ofrace  creed or religious affiliation. If we practiced thoseprinciples  the world would be altogether a differentand better place. As human beings  we must turn thepage  forget the past and live together for the benefit ofgenerations to come.On the African continent  we are encouraged bythe concerted efforts of our fellow brothers and sisterswho are committed to resolving their differences ina peaceful manner. We encourage speedy resolutionsin areas where pockets of conflict remain  such as theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  the Sudan and someNorth African countries  to mention but a few.The Assembly knows that Somalia has also beenwithout a stable Government for a long time  and wehope that new developments will bring about lastingpeace. In that vein  the Kingdom of eSwatini welcomesthe recent development that has taken place in Somalia.We hope that the election of the President will bring thedesired stability.We extend the call for peace beyond Africa  to theMiddle East  where we continue to witness conflict. Thewar in Syria has claimed the lives of too many citizensand must come to an end. We appeal to the people ofSyria to discourage the use of force in resolving theirdifferences. We encourage the use of dialogue in caseswhere they do not see eye to eye. We implore the SyrianGovernment and the other stakeholders to sit down indialogue in order to find a lasting solution to the currentimpasse. The barrel of the gun will bring nothing butmisery.The United Nations and the League of Arab Stateshave sent a Joint Special Representative to work withthe people of Syria. We hope that all stakeholders willmake good use of the Joint Special Representativetowards finding a peaceful and lasting solution to theirdifferences. The Kingdom of eSwatini urges StatesMembers of the United Nations to work together insupporting all efforts aimed at helping the people ofSyria to resolve the conflict.We also note that the Israel-Palestine conflictremains unresolved. A peaceful settlement of the issueis deeply desired and urgently necessary. Our positionis unambiguous. The most viable solution is to have thetwo States of Israel and Palestine coexisting side byside in peace and harmony. We must commend the recent positive developmentswith regard to relations between the Republic ofChina on Taiwan and mainland China  which aresteadily improving. Indeed  it is very encouragingas it demonstrates that the tensions between the twocountries have subsided. We hope that one day theywill be able to resolve all of their differences and livehappily with each other. We are witnessing increasingtrade  as well as f lights  between the two countries.Recently  it was also interesting to see mainland Chinahost an African summit  to which the countries that arefriends of Taiwan were also invited.As an African country  we would like to thankmainland China for its continued support to Africancountries. We have no doubt that the potential of thetwo peoples working together side by side will makea significant difference in the world. We hope that thenew developments will pave the way for Taiwan toparticipate fully in all United Nations entities  becausethe people of Taiwan desire to become part of the globalcommunity.Peace will continue to elude us until we properlyaddress the issue of weapons of mass destruction.It is clear that those weapons are not necessary tohumankind. Their mere presence is a recipe for conflictas each country seeks to gain power over others. TheTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons adopted by many Member States  must be enforced toensure the complete elimination of these weapons.We have not seen any tangible proof of compliancewith the internationally agreed time frames  whichis a cause for serious concern requiring urgentattention. The mere existence of those weapons createsunnecessary tension that could result in a very hostileworld environment. We implore those countriesendowed with uranium resources to use them for otheressential economic development needs  such as powergeneration.The Kingdom of eSwatini recognizes the importantrole that the Security Council plays in the pursuit ofinternational peace and security. The Charter of theUnited Nations clearly stipulates an international orderthat ensures the rule of law. We call upon the GeneralAssembly at this session to deliberate on SecurityCouncil reform  as not all regions are well represented.We wish to reiterate the African position on the SecurityCouncil  claiming two seats in the permanent categoryand five seats in the non-permanent category. Thefull representation of all regions in the Council will ensure that we all own the decisions of that importantsecurity organ. We should all be given equal treatment.No region or country should impose its influence overothers. We wish to see finality in that urgent matter since it has dragged on for a very long time now.The high-level meeting on sustainable energy forall  which was held alongside this session  gave Headsof State and Government a forum to deliberate on issuesthat promote the protection of our environment. Thatmeeting provided us with an opportunity to revisit thecommitments made towards sustainable energy for all.The destruction of the environment has haddevastating effects on many of our countries. TheUnited Nations must expedite the processes towardsprotecting the environment by enforcing the use ofenvironmentally friendly technologies and practices byMember States. We call upon the developed countriesto honour their commitments made prior to the UnitedNations Conference on Sustainable Development in Riode Janeiro.Finally  allow me to say that as we meet duringthis session  let us adopt resolutions that will providelasting solutions to the challenges faced by humankindthe world over. We wish the United Nations everysuccess as it pursues its objective of creating a peacefulenvironment and coexistence among all the nations ofthe world. Let honesty  peace  stability and toleranceprevail across the globe."
"165",6624,"SYC",67,2012,"﻿In the modern world  thepace of change  whether political  social or economic challenges our ability to react in a constructive sustainable and just manner. And in the face of change the role of the General Assembly becomes even moreimportant  as the President of the General Assemblyhas reminded us. We look to the United Nations — ourUnited Nations and our General Assembly — to helpus find the common ground needed for the resolutionof the big questions of our time. We can truly be a“G-193”  as our President has previously remarked.As an oceanic island nation  Seychelles understandsintrinsically that the development of our region dependsupon being able to defuse conflict and tension throughdiplomacy and on defining a framework to properlyshare all the opportunities that our ocean offers us. Inthe Indian Ocean  we are particularly concerned withtwo issues that challenge the proper application ofthe rule of law in a sustainable manner: the continuedproblem of maritime piracy and the resolution of thepolitical crisis in Madagascar.Piracy fundamentally alters our relationship withour ocean. Piracy instils fear and uncertainty. We havetwo compatriots still being held captive in Somalia  and as long as they remain separated from their families our ocean represents risk for our nation  rather thanthe opportunity that it should. Establishing the rule oflaw in Somalia is obviously the only true long-term andsustainable solution to piracy. We welcome the movesin Somalia and by the international community tostrengthen those efforts.Seychelles is already working with the centralGovernment of Somalia  as well as the regions ofSomaliland and Puntland  to be able to transferprosecuted prisoners to serve their sentences in theircountry of origin. This is a key part of building the rule of law in Somalia. More resources are needed  however to accelerate the building of appropriate infrastructurein those parts of Somalia where stability has beenestablished. We must transform fear and uncertaintyinto hope and optimism in Somalia itself  as well as inthe Indian Ocean.Seychelles has committed itself to ending theimpunity associated with piracy. Piracy has become aglobal business  operated by a transnational criminalnetwork. Seychelles  in partnership with the Governmentof the United Kingdom and other international parties is in the process of setting up a regional anti-piracyprosecution and intelligence centre. The success ofthis initiative will depend on strong internationalcooperation. We count on all our partners to work withus to ensure a true long-term solution for this issue.The Indian Ocean Commission  which Seychellesis currently chairing  recognizes the work of theUnited Nations in favour of peace  democracy andhuman rights  in the interests of the people of its fivemember States. The crisis facing Madagascar is trulytesting the country. It is plunging the population intogreat economic and social difficulties  and is affectingthe entire region. The Seychelles presidency of theCommission continues supporting the implementationof the road map developed by the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC). In that context  itorganized two meetings between Marc Ravalomanana the former President  and Andry Nirina Rajoelina President of the Transition  in Seychelles  with thedual mediation of Presidents James Michel and JacobZuma  head of the SADC troika. Those talks  convenedat the recommendation of the most recent SADCSummit  enable us today to look forward to useful andrelevant actions for a return to constitutional order inMadagascar  in keeping with the electoral timetabledrawn up by the United Nations and Madagascar’sIndependent National Electoral Commission.In that regard  we should like to express our thanksto the transitional Government  which has confirmedits contribution to the financing of the elections  inaccordance with the recommendations of the UnitedNations. This is also the time to call on all internationalpartners to help ensure fair  transparent and equitableelections in that country  which is anxious to regainits place on the international stage. Through electionsMadagascar will return to the rule of law  and it is through the rule of law in Madagascar that we willbe able to depend on sustainable development in theIndian Ocean.Respect for the rule of law is also about ensuringthat conditions are in place for equity and fairness in theinternational system as a whole. Small island developingStates (SIDS) are too often on the periphery of mostinternational decision-making bodies. Seychelles isproposing that SIDS be considered as offering uniqueopportunities for testing innovative policies andtechnologies that can benefit all humankind. In thefight against climate change  SIDS could be at theforefront of groundbreaking solutions.For example  the Global Island Partnership co-chaired by Seychelles  Palau and Grenada  hasproposed considering debt cancellation for SIDSto enable them to better prepare for climate changeadaptation. A large number of SIDS have debt-togross-domestic-product ratios in excess of 100 percent  and such debt forgiveness would give them moreflexibility within their own budgets to prepare to faceclimate change  and thus protect some of the mostenvironmentally sensitive zones on the planet.With regard to the high volatility of internationalfuel prices  SIDS can strengthen their resilience throughinvestment in renewable energy. We warmly welcomethe Sustainable Energy for All initiative championedby the Secretary-General  and we commit our supportto making it a success. While the latest technology inrenewable energy often represents a significant capitaloutlay  by developing pilot projects in SIDS we canpotentially create economies based on 100 per centrenewable energy that can then be replicated on a largerscale.Finally  it is very important that considerationbe given to how to better support SIDS within theinternational trading system. Trade-based support forSIDS could easily be established without disruptionor distortion of the global f low of goods and services.Islands are particularly reliant on open access to tradewith as many countries as possible. In the context ofthe current challenges to food security  we urge thatall barriers affecting trade with islands  including theeconomic embargo on Cuba  be lifted  since they serveonly to increase the inherent challenges associated withtrading from a position of insularity. As an island State we are aware that the ocean must connect us  not divide us. The United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment has given new momentum to the conceptof the blue economy.We are also very aware that the ocean will alwaysbe a shared space. As an archipelago  we are privilegedto be custodians of that space. This year  for the firsttime in the history of the United Nations  Seychellesand Mauritius  two neighbouring SIDS  have agreed onjoint management of an area of extended continentalshelf of 3 000 square kilometres. That means that weare sharing the space for the benefit of our two peoples’development. We are sharing the responsibility and theopportunity. We believe that all nations  large or small must contribute to making this planet a better world tolive in.Seychelles recently announced its intention to standfor a non-permanent seat on the Security Council in theyear 2017  subject to endorsement by the African Union.We are doing so because we believe that the voices ofall nations matter  whether they are large or small  richor poor. As the smallest African nation  we keenlyunderstand that we need to fight for Africa’s economicindependence. We are committed to the ideals of theAfrican Union  on the basis of which we attained ourpolitical freedom. Now more than ever we must investin Africa’s economic freedom. We must create themeans by which Africa’s share of trade and financialpower can increase at a faster rate. We must empowerAfrican institutions. Seychelles adds its voice to the callfor more investment in the African Development Bank including by African nations themselves  by investingtheir reserves in it.We must also foster peace on our continent byleading efforts to find solutions to our problems such as in Somalia  Madagascar and elsewhere inAfrica. As a small island developing State  we have agreater understanding than ever of the ways in whichour planet is under threat from climate change  andof the need to act now for the sake of all humankind.Most of all  as citizens of planet Earth  we understandthat as individuals and as a nation our decisionshave consequences beyond our borders. They haveconsequences for our future and for our children. Theseare all issues that must be weighed carefully  and it isimportant that all voices be considered in the debate.We thank the Assembly for giving due consideration tothe voice of Seychelles."
"166",6671,"SYR",67,2012,"﻿I would like to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremićand his friendly country  the Republic of Serbia  on hiselection as President of the General Assembly at itssixty-seventh session and to wish him every successin conducting our work in a way that restores to theAssembly President his important and neutral role infulfilling his duties without regard for any political national or international agendas that violate the rulesof international law and contradict efforts to achievesecurity and stability in the world. We also wish theSecretary-General every success in carrying out hisduties and enhancing the purposes and principlesenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.Our world today faces many events that areaffecting its States and continue to cast their shadowon the international arena. Many countries are facingpolitical  economic and financial crises  whose theirnegative consequences exceed the capacity of States tocope with them individually.While the peoples of the world await effective andcoordinated international efforts to overcome thosecrises  the situation indicates instead an escalationof hegemony and domination over the fortunesand potentials of nations and peoples in a way thatcontradicts the principles and purposes enshrined inthe Charter and the norms of international law. Instead of seeking to contribute to the settlement ofregional and international disputes by peaceful means some well-known countries continue to pursue newcolonial policies based on political hypocrisy in dealingwith those crises. Under the pretext of humanitarianintervention  these countries interfere in the domesticaffairs of States and impose unilateral economicsanctions that lack any moral or legal basis. Under thepretext of concepts such as the responsibility to protect the drums of war are beaten and the seeds of seditionand unrest are sown to damage the structure of nationalsocieties. Perhaps worse of all  permanent membersof the Security Council  who have launched warsunder the pretext of combating terrorism  now supportterrorism in my country  without any regard for UnitedNations resolutions that established the regulations andmechanisms for concerted international efforts to fightthis scourge without political polarization or doublestandards.For over a year now  my country has faced organizedterrorism that has affected our citizens  our human andscientific cadres  our national institutions and many ofSyria’s historic and archeological landmarks throughterrorist bombings  assassinations  massacres  lootingand acts of sabotage that have horrified citizens inmany parts of the country. The most recent exampleis the terrorist bombing that took place in Damascuson 26 September. A terrorist group under the name ofthe Al-Nusra Front  one of Al-Qaida’s affiliates  tookresponsibility for that attack.It is no surprise that the Security Council hasfailed to condemn this and other terrorist bombings as some of its members support such acts. Thisterrorism is externally supported and is accompaniedby unprecedented media incitement seeking to ignitereligious extremism sponsored by well-known Statesin the region. Those States facilitate the f low of arms money and fighters through the borders of someneighbouring countries. They also turn a blind eye tothe activities of terrorist groups crossing their borders while others provide active material and logisticalsupport from their territory for such groups.These facts lead me to question whether theinternational consensus among Member States oncombating terrorism was serious or merely ink onpaper. How should we understand the explicit requestby the United States to the armed terrorist groupsnot to surrender their arms in response to amnestydecrees and decisions issued by the Syrian leadership?We also wonder about the statements by Qatar  SaudiArabia  Turkey  the United States  France and otherswho explicitly induce and support terrorism in Syriawith money  weapons and foreign fighters. To whatextent are those statements in line with those countries’international responsibility to combat terrorism?One of the ironies that we face today is evident in theefforts to encourage extremists in countries within andoutside our region to go to the Syrian border and enterthe country to carry out terrorist acts under the bannerof jihad  in collaboration with terrorists from withinthe country. This is a fact that has been confirmed byreports by both international and Arab observers. Tothis very day  and as a result of this terrorism  Syriahas lost thousands of martyrs from among its militaryranks and its civilians. This is the price that Syria haspaid for its efforts to defend the integrity of the SyrianState and its citizens in the face of that global terroristcampaign.The Syrian Government called for dialogue at thebeginning of the events in my country  but there wasno positive response from most opposition parties.Moreover  my Government responded positivelythroughout the crisis to each and every sincereinitiative aimed at finding a peaceful solution basedon national dialogue among Syrians  rejecting externalmanipulation  stopping the shedding of Syrian bloodand preserving the unity of Syria and its future.Based on this principled position  Syria cooperatedwith the Arab observer mission and the subsequentinternational initiatives linked to the work of the JointSpecial Envoy  Kofi Annan. We did so despite theconviction of the Syrian leadership that there are nosincere intentions on the part of certain regional andinternational parties who push for the escalation of theSyrian crisis  fuel its fire and prolong it by thwarting allattempts for dialogue  and insist on creating a state ofinstability to ensure the need for foreign interference.Syria  on the basis of its principled position received the United Nations Supervision Mission inthe Syrian Arab Republic (UNSMIS)  and furnished itwith all the facilities needed to enable it to deploy inrecord time. The Syrian leadership also announced itsfull commitment to the implementation of the six-pointplan presented by Mr. Annan and started the practicalimplementation of its provisions. It also welcomed theGeneva communiqué (A/66/865  annex) that stressedthe need for the implementation of those provisions. However  the armed groups sought to exploit the SyrianGovernment’s commitment to the plan and the Genevacommuniqué in order to make gains on the groundand expand the area of their presence. In addition  thestatements issued by some Western and Arab countriesexposed the actors and States working to thwart theseinitiatives.Syria welcomed the appointment of Mr. LakhdarBrahimi as the Joint Special Representative  succeedingMr. Annan  and stressed its willingness to cooperatefully with him based on the principles agreed on by theinternational community  in particular the six-point planand the Geneva final communiqué (S/2012/523  annex).I should point out that  in addition to the commitment ofthe Syrian Government  the success of any internationaleffort requires that the States supporting armed groupsin my country — in particular Turkey  Saudi Arabia Qatar and Libya  among others — stop arming  funding training and harbouring armed terrorist groups  andinstead encourage dialogue and renounce violence.For more than a year now  we have said that whatmy country is witnessing is a two-sided problem: oneside is based on the need for the political  economicand social reforms that the public demands; the otheris based on the exploitation of those public needs anddemands in the service of goals that are completelyunconnected to the demands of the Syrian people andtheir interests  and for which those peaceful demandsare being used as a vehicle for armed groups workingto sow sedition and undermine security in my country.I referred to that in my statement from this rostrumlast year (see A/66/PV.25). I have returned today totell the Assembly that the Syrian Government hastaken serious and important steps towards reform culminating in a new Constitution that embracespolitical pluralism and that has been adopted by popularreferendum. As a result  parliamentary elections opento multiple political parties were held. I can also saythat Syria is continuing to work with patriotic membersof the opposition to build a new and pluralist Syria thatis responsive to its people’s aspirations. At the sametime  Syria is determined to fulfil its duty to protect itspeople from jihadist and takfiri terrorism  which armedterrorist groups are using to spread chaos and seditionamong Syrians  threatening their peaceful coexistence.There have been calls from this rostrum and atother forums asking the President of the Syrian ArabRepublic to step down  made by people who are ignorantof or ignore the facts  or who have a stake in distorting them. That is blatant interference in the domestic affairsof Syria  which undermines the unity of its people andthe sovereignty of its decision-making. Only the peopleof Syria have the right to choose their own future andthe form of their State — one that accommodates allgroups and parties covering the entire spectrum ofthe Syrian people  including those who have beendeceived and misled. It is the Syrian people who willchoose their leadership through the ballot box  which isthe most important tool of democracy and democraticexpression.If some of the countries that are interfering inSyria’s internal affairs are proud of their democracy andtheir people’s freedom to choose  it would be better forthem to support us on our democratic path and leave theSyrian people to choose their leaders through elections whose form has been set by the new Constitution and therelevant legislation  after which the ballot box will havethe final say. I say to those countries that we have hadenough of illusions  and I invite the national oppositionto work together to stop the shedding of Syrian blood  tosit at the negotiation table and to participate in buildingthe present and future.We are not betting on any party or faction apart fromthe Syrian people  who are uniformly determined toreject all forms of foreign interference in their domesticaffairs and to defeat the advocates of sectarianism extremism and terrorism  because in my country thelinks between State policies and the aspirations of thepeople are very strong.Despite everything I have described about what mycountry is experiencing  we still believe in a politicalsolution as the essential way out of this crisis. From thisrostrum I call  first  on all parties and political groupsand factions  inside and outside Syria  to engage in aconstructive dialogue under the aegis of our homeland.The doors of Syria  like its heart  are open to anyonewho wants constructive dialogue. To that end  I callon all countries represented in the General Assemblyto exert pressure to end the violence in my country byputting a stop to the arming  financing  harbouring andtraining of armed terrorist groups. Secondly  the resultsof that national dialogue  after being agreed on by allparties  will determine the map and future direction ofthe country towards establishing a more pluralistic anddemocratic Syria.The events in Syria have produced a surge inhumanitarian needs in several key sectors in areasaffected by takfiri terrorist groups  which has led to deteriorating living conditions for Syrian citizenswho live there. While my Government is workinghard to meet the basic needs of citizens who havebeen forced to f lee their homes by the violence ofarmed groups  some have sought to fabricate a refugeecrisis in neighbouring countries by inciting armedgroups to intimidate Syrian civilians in border areas forcing them to f lee to those countries. There they areaccommodated in military training bases or camps thatresemble places of detention  in arid or rugged regions.Their plight is being exploited in order to secure aidthat is mostly spent on things that have nothing to dowith humanitarian purposes. I appeal to those Syriancitizens from this rostrum to return to their towns andvillages  where the State will guarantee their safe returnand dignified lives  free from the inhuman conditionsthey are enduring in those camps.At this point  I would like to ask a legitimatequestion about the credibility of those who claimto care about providing humanitarian assistance inresponse to Syrian citizens’ needs  and about how suchclaims correspond with a policy of tightening unilateraleconomic sanctions that have a severe effect on thosesame citizens’ living conditions  whose intereststhose imposing the sanctions claim to serve. How canimposing sanctions on the banking  health  transportand other sectors be consistent with caring for Syrians’best interests?I also wonder if the legitimate public demands of ourcitizens  to which the Syrian leadership has respondedtransparently and sincerely  justify their being used bysome as an excuse to continue providing every kindof military  financial and media support to those whoare killing innocent people in Syria — who includejournalists  doctors  university professors and evenreligious figures. Or is this simply another practicalinterpretation of the concept of creative chaos  whichcontributes only to strengthening Western hegemonyover Mediterranean countries  and serves only Israel’sexpansionist interests?What is happening in my country must not leadus to lose our basic focus  which is Palestine and theSyrian Golan. The Syrian Arab Republic thereforereaffirms its natural right to recover all of the occupiedSyrian Golan up to the 4 June 1967 borders. Syriaunderscores its rejection of all measures taken by Israel the occupying Power  to change the natural geographicand other aspects of the Golan  in clear violation of the resolution 497 (1981).Syria renews its support for the legitimate callon the international community to recognize a freeand independent Palestinian State on the Palestinianterritories occupied in 1967. As everyone knows  thefailure of efforts to achieve a just and comprehensivepeace in the Middle East on the basis of the internationalterms of reference endorsed by the internationalcommunity as a basis for peace between Palestiniansand Israelis is due to the unilateral positions and actionsof Israel  especially Israel’s insistence on continuing itssettlement policy and its evasion of the requirementsof peace.My country renews its call for the internationalcommunity to work to rid the Middle East of allweapons of mass destruction. In that context  we recallthe initiative put forward by Syria in late 2003  duringits tenure as a non-permanent member in the SecurityCouncil for the period 2002 to 2003  and we call on theCouncil to adopt it. Syria stresses that ridding the regionof all weapons of mass destruction cannot be achievedwithout forcing Israel  the only nuclear Power in theregion  to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons and to place its nuclear facilitiesunder the comprehensive inspections regime of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency. At the same time we emphasize the Treaty’s provisions guaranteeing theright of every State to acquire nuclear technology forpeaceful purposes.The insistence of the United States and countriesof the European Union and others to impose unilateraleconomic measures violates the rules and norms ofinternational law and the principles of free trade. Italso raises questions about the legality and morality ofsuch practices. On that basis  we call for the lifting ofthe embargo that the United States has imposed againstCuba for decades. We also renew our call for endingall unilateral coercive measures imposed on the peoplesof other countries  such as the Bolivarian Republic ofVenezuela  Belarus  the Islamic Republic of Iran  theSyrian Arab Republic and the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea.Our aspiration to achieve a positive reform of thisinternational Organization stems from our desire tocreate a world based on justice  security and prosperityfor all the peoples of the world  free from the colonialand hegemonic tendencies of some countries that seek to exploit the United Nations to achieve their owninterests at the expense of other countries.We hope that the United Nations can take thepeoples of the world to a better future that fulfils theiraspirations for life  coexistence  development and foodsufficiency  free from all forms of tension  confrontationand war  in accordance with the purposes andprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations  whichseek to preserve the sovereignty and equality of Statesin rights and duties."
"167",6716,"TCD",67,2012,"﻿At theoutset  allow me on behalf of the Chadian delevationto wholeheartedly thank the President for selectingthe theme for the sixty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly  “Bringing about adjustment or settlement ofinternational disputes or situations by peaceful means”.That subject is at the very heart of the principles thatunderlie the existence of our Organization  and reflectsthe global concerns of our day.Indeed  the world is in an period of unprecedentedtension  perhaps even more serious than that followingthe Cold War. From Afghanistan to Mali; from Pakistanto Somalia; from Libya to Syria; and from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to that of the Sudan and SouthSudan  most of the crises that have recently shaken andcontinue to shake our planet  while undoubtedly rootedin political and social claims  also have considerablereligious and cultural undertones that are often difficultto address.Africa is the crucible of all the scourges affectingthe world. The war and attacks in Somalia  the situationin Mali  the crises in the Democratic Republic of theCongo and between the two Sudans  violence inLibya and outbreaks in Côte d’Ivoire and the CentralAfrican Republic are situations which many attempts toresolve have proved ineffective. Based on the principlethat without peace and security development is notpossible  the international community  embodied in theUnited Nations  has the firm obligation to contribute to establishing peace by making use of all the legalmechanisms at its disposal for settling conflict.The Organization has been particularly activein recent years in different theatres of conflict  suchas Afghanistan  Darfur  Côte d’Ivoire  Libya and theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Since its inception the United Nations has never been so involved in differenthotbeds of tension around the world. We commend thatpresence because of its calming and legitimizing effecton populations and even on protagonists. However we also need to ponder the form and effectiveness ofthat presence. The stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinianconflict and the crisis in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  despite the massive and costly deploymentsof the forces mandated by the United Nations  clearlyreflect the inability of the international community toimpose peace where it is necessary.The crisis in Mali comes as a test and a challengefor the international community. Along with that crisis obscurantist and violent religious fundamentalism drug and human trafficking and irredentist claimshave taken root in the very heart of Africa today. Canthe world continue to stand by for much longer giventhat that gangrene  of which Mali is only the epicentre threatens to spread throughout the entire Sahel?Our delegation commends the determinationof the international community seen at the high-level meeting on the Sahel that was organized on theinitiative of the Secretary-General. We commend thecommitments of France  the Economic Community ofWest African States and above all those of the primaryparty concerned  namely  Mali  to act to eradicate thatgangrene. The United Nations  too  needs to expediteprocedures and act quickly by adopting a resolution thatwould authorize the intervention of an internationalmilitary force.I would like to take advantage of my presence atthis rostrum to warmly commend Mr. Omer HassanA. Al-Bashir of the Sudan and Mr. Salva Kiir of SouthSudan  who overcame their differences and reacheda peace and security agreement  albeit partial. Wesincerely hope that the agreement will quickly leadto a final understanding  which is so necessary to theprogress of the countries and to the stability of thesubregion.It is my pleasure to inform the Assembly that withinthe framework of subregional initiatives with respect topeace and security in the Sahel  the member countries of the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States (CEN-SAD)have undertaken a reform of our organization  whichwill incorporate peace and security dimensions into itsupdated texts. The President of the Republic of Chad Mr. Idriss Deby Itno  has invited his colleagues frommember countries to a summit meeting in N’Djamenaon 29 November to adopt new texts aimed at refocusingCEN-SAD’s objectives on the specific concerns of theregion.The ability of extremist groups to cause harmacross borders calls for a collective and appropriateresponse. Our community  CEN-SAD  which includesalmost all of the countries of the Sahel and the Saraha seems to be the appropriate structure in which to bringtogether all our response strategies.Drawing on lessons from the difficulties experiencedby the United Nations on the ground  Chad requestedthe departure in 2010 of the United Nations Mission inthe Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT).The Mission had been mandated to stabilize the regionand protect Sudanese refugee camps in Darfur andthose of internally displaced persons in eastern Chad.Despite a huge budget and considerable resources  thatforce did not prove to be an effective deterrent. It left thebulk of the work to the Détachement intégré de sécurité(DIS)  a special national Chadian force made up 600men and women. After MINURCAT’s departure Chad decided to entrust DIS with the protection ofrefugees and displaced persons and any humanitarianorganizations that provided assistance. A joint supportprogramme for DIS was signed in February 2011 inorder to mobilize the necessary logistical financialsupport to enable it to operate. The overall budget wasestimated to be $20 million  about 2 per cent of thebudget allocated to MINURCAT  which  I would remindthe Assembly  amounted to some $800 million per year.That support has not yet been forthcoming  and Chadhas been bearing the cost of the unit alone  estimatedat about $4 million per year. I would also remind theAssembly that the responsibility of providing securityto refugees  displaced persons and humanitarianorganizations living in that region cannot and shouldnot be left to Chad alone. The international communityhas the obligation to consider that issue and addressit. That is why Chad is reiterating the special appealit launched from this rostrum last year  requesting ourOrganization to take heed.Africa sorely needs international solidarity  notonly to settle the conflicts and crises sweeping through it  but also for its development. In both cases  the resultshave been disappointing. The Millennium DevelopmentGoals  official development assistance and debt relief in sum all of the commitments made in that regard have either not been met or have been met onlyhalfway. We would remind the Assembly that poverty unemployment and  at times  despair are the scourgesthat push young Africans to extremism and to seekbetter prospects elsewhere. Africa needs assistance ona large scale  not in small doses  in order to help thoseyoung people and give them new confidence in theircontinent. This would not absolve the African Statesfrom shouldering their primary responsibility to createthe right conditions for progress and prosperity.For its part  my country  Chad  under theleadership of President Idriss Deby Itno  is continuingthe necessary political and economic reforms for itsdevelopment and stability. We have just held the firstmunicipal elections in our political history  and therewere presidential and legislative elections in 2011. Inaddition  we are reviewing ways of establishing newarrangements for political dialogue with the democraticopposition  similar to those which enabled us to holdthe latest elections in a calm and tranquil environment.For that reason  we are patiently working toconsolidate the rule of law and strengthen the values oftolerance and democracy within Chadian society. Thatis a long and arduous process in a country that has justbeen through three decades of violence and politicalinstability. With stability restored and socioeconomicprogress achieved  Chad would like to make its modestcontribution to building a world of justice and peace.For that reason  my country is for the first time acandidate for a non-permanent seat in the SecurityCouncil during the elections of October 2013.The efforts undertaken by my country have however  been hampered by unexpected events: first the crisis in Libya  which required us to strengthensecurity along the borders with that country  in additionto our efforts to secure our borders with the Sudan  theCentral African Republic and the Lake Chad region thatborders Nigeria and the Niger; secondly  the arrival ofnearly 100 000 Chadians who had f led the war in Libya the majority of whom were young people needing helpwith reintegration; and  thirdly  the current f loods caused by exceptionally heavy rains. The Government’sappeal for help for the victims of the disaster has not yetreceived the expected response. Despite all those constraints and the sacrificesundertaken by Chad  we have not been able to benefitfrom the debt relief that comes with reaching thecompletion point. We therefore call on our bilateral andmultilateral partners to take into account our uniquesituation and support us as we move forward.The theme of our session this year reminds us thatall of the formulas that have been used to address theIsraeli-Palestinian conflict have failed. As the crisisgoes on and on  it is becoming accepted; yet  it is at thevery root of the worst violence the world has seen inrecent years. The community of nations cannot behavelike an ostrich indefinitely  allowing a crisis as old as theUnited Nations itself to drag on interminably — a crisiswhich is a constant threat to peace and the regional andglobal balance. Here  too  old postures need to changeand robust initiatives need to be taken to put an end tothe conflict  which has gone on far too long.The international realities of our time should alsostrengthen our determination to bring about the reformof the Security Council. The primary innovation shouldbe to expand its membership  with the admission ofAfrica as a permanent member with the right of veto.The world has greatly changed. We therefore need toadapt our global governance to these developments.In conclusion  the delegation of Chad  throughme  would like to express how much we admire thenewly elected President’s steering of the work of theGeneral Assembly. We also would like to pay tribute tothe Secretary-General for his personal commitment inthe quest for peace worldwide. We firmly hope that hisefforts will be successful and bring about more justiceand serenity for humankind."
"168",6762,"TGO",67,2012,"﻿At the outset I would like to address my warmest congratulationsto Mr. Vuk Jeremić on the confidence that the entireUnited Nations family has invested in him by electinghim to the high office of President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session.I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterateTogo’s support to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon forall of the work that he continues to undertake in order topromote peace in the world. We appreciate the immenseefforts that he is pursuing in Africa and many otherregions of the world in order to find a peaceful outcometo the conflicts that they face by prioritizing dialogue mediation and cooperation.The choice of the peaceful settlement of disputes asthe central theme of this session is a wise choice  and Iwelcome it. Indeed  it allows us  in the complex worldwe live in today  to reconnect with the original purposeand founding values of the United Nations. Over thedecades  our Organization has taken it upon itself torespond to the many challenges posed by a world thatis constantly changing. It remains present and active inall the areas that present opportunities for progress byhumankind.However  in spite of our efforts and the progressthat has been achieved  here and there  in the areasof technology  economy and social issues  we note unfortunately  that force continues to be used alltoo frequently in international relations. On manyoccasions  recourse to the use of armed force has beenchosen before all avenues for the peaceful means ofdispute resolution have been exhausted.The African continent  unfortunately  has paid andcontinues to pay a heavy price when it seeks to savetime by prematurely cutting short the process for thepeaceful settlement of disputes. Yet  experience hasshown that even in the rare cases where recourse to theuse of weapons has allowed one of the parties to theconflict to quickly prevail over the other  lasting peaceand stability have not been achieved.That is why my country  Togo  welcomes the factthat the sixty-seventh session of the General Assemblygives all of us the opportunity to revisit the originalvalues of the United Nations Charter in order to betterguide our work in dealing with the challenges of ourcontemporary world. Indeed  perhaps it is time to putdialogue among nations at the centre of the internationalagenda again. But today we need to go further  and also make dialogue within nations an important componentof our efforts to achieve peace. Dialogue within nationsis in fact an indispensable corollary of dialogue amongnations. It should be encouraged and cultivated in thesame vein  because it is the prelude to preserving peaceamong nations.Indeed  since the contemporary world is marked byinterdependence  when misunderstandings degenerateinto internal conflicts because there is no dialogue  it israre that they do not have repercussions in neighbouringcountries. The Syrian crisis and the climate of growinginsecurity in the Sahel-Sahara region are textbookexamples.That is why I would like to urge our commonOrganization and its Member States to persevere inthe efforts already under way to make dialogue withinnations a cornerstone of their conflict-prevention workin the world. Before all else  encouraging dialoguewithin nations comes down to adopting a constructiveapproach that strives to promote universal valueswhile taking into account the realities specific to eachcountry  as well as local and regional specificities. Itis also a matter of making citizens  whatever countrythey live in  responsible through various means for theculture of peace  for listening to one another and for asense of compromise in order to make dialogue a cross-cutting value in our modern societies.With that in mind  the West African Economicand Monetary Union — over which Togo is honouredto preside and which now enjoys observer status in theGeneral Assembly — decided at its May 2012 meetingin Lomé to give higher priority to matters of peaceand security than to purely economic issues. Thatnovel move by a regional economic organization isfundamentally guided by the desire to make dialogue apriority tool for conflict prevention.In that regard  I remain profoundly convinced thatdecentralization of conflict prevention and resolutionthat makes use of the contribution of subregionalorganizations is one of the most viable options forpeacekeeping in the world. The proximity of suchbodies to the geographic areas of conflict and to theirhistorical and cultural roots is a major asset that shouldbe maximized in conflict prevention and the settlementof disputes.Still  the increased responsibility of subregionalorganizations should not be a pretext to justify a kind ofdisguised renunciation of our collective responsibility in the area of promoting peace and security in theworld. As Members of the United Nations  we do nothave that choice  because the community of valuesthat unites us is a permanent call to promote solidarityand even complementarity between the specificgoals of subregional organizations and the search foruniversality that is the very foundation of the UnitedNations.On that point  it should be noted that the protocolestablishing a Peace and Security Council in theAfrican Union in 2002 created a great deal of hopeat the time. Modelled on the Security Council of theUnited Nations  that new institutional tool was intendedto enable the African Union to intervene directly incountries in crisis. Sadly  recent experiences  whetherin Libya or Côte d’Ivoire  have shown that  faced withthe antagonisms that characterize the internationalcommunity  that tool has not been able to fulfil ourexpectations. Those modest beginnings confirm theurgent need for close cooperation between regionalpeacekeeping mechanisms and the system establisheddecades ago by the United Nations to ensure collectiveinternational security.From that point of view  I would like to join myvoice to those of previous speakers to invite the entireinternational community to assist all the institutionalplayers who are proceeding with good will to help Maliin its determination to recover its territorial integrity asquickly as possible and to help that country re-establishpeace so that the transition period can be successful.That obligation of solidarity is a call to all of us.Recent events in the north of the African continent haveonce again exposed the sad reality that the reduction oftension and the prevention and settlement of internaldisputes all too often involve elements that extend wellbeyond individual States.Drawing on its experience of the past two decades which were marked by major political shocks  andhonoured to sit as a non-permanent member of theSecurity Council  Togo resolutely joins the dynamic ofthe continuing search for peace focusing on dialogueand cooperation. In that regard  on behalf of mycompatriots  and from this high rostrum  I wouldlike to salute the United Nations  other internationalorganizations and all friendly nations and partners ofgoodwill who recently helped the Togolese people setout on the path of dialogue to overcome the weight ofthe past. That wise choice enabled us to embark on the construction of a new country  one reconciled withitself and facing out onto the world.Our feeling of gratitude is all the more profoundbecause we have been able to see in just a few yearsthe economic and social progress that the Togolesepeople can achieve on their own  now that they areliving in peace and harmony among themselves  withtheir neighbours and with the rest of the world. We haverenewed our economic growth and are intensifyingour efforts to ensure better political and economicgovernance through sweeping institutional andconstitutional reforms. We intend to implement themout of respect for the republican agenda.From one year to the next  public freedoms havetaken root in Togo. Political pluralism  which is deeplyingrained in Togolese customs  has a natural ally in theacknowledged right of all citizens to demonstrate incomplete freedom  so long as they respect prevailingrules.The challenge in Togo today is to consolidateeconomic recovery  to promote a firm foundation fordemocracy and the rule of law  and to promote theindivisibility of human rights in order to propel thecountry towards new gains  particularly in the socialarena  where expectations are both numerous andurgent. Of course  the progress made in recent yearsin the economic  political and social realms is stillfragile. That is why the Government remains alertto the different views expressed on the best ways toconsolidate that progress. We have opted to make thesearch for consensus a central axis for managing theaffairs of State.In that same spirit  the Togolese Government isworking to build on the excitement that has grippedthe country’s political class on the eve of legislativeelections. Now that dialogue has been reopened  Ihave good reason to hope that it will lead to broadermembership in that class so that its conclusions willbe accepted by all. Our immediate priority is to holdsuccessful  free  peaceful and transparent legislativeelections. Indeed  we aim to raise Togo to the ranksof those countries that have managed to eradicate thesyndrome of violence before  during and after elections.Nonetheless  we must recognize that such violence hasunfortunately turned elections into a cause of mortalityin various regions of the world.That scourge has caused so much damage on theAfrican continent  in both the loss of human lives and in material destruction  that it is urgent to do everythingto prevent its reappearance in Togo or elsewhere. Thatis both an individual and a collective responsibility. Weshould leave no stone unturned in the struggle that hasbeen launched at all levels to prevent the elections frombeing synonymous with violence and chaos.Civil society has an important role to play in thatcrucial area. States must help civil society to betterorganize itself in order to play its full role and to becomea type of citizens’ watch that can truly contribute to theevolution of human societies. However  in return  thoseorganizations must demonstrate their probity and lackof bias. They must also refrain from aligning themselveswith belligerent factions or fighting for the cause of theprotagonists in political battles. Civil society must notbe a Trojan horse for political groups.Mr. Charles (Trinidad and Tobago)  Vice-President took the Chair.Because of their proximity to citizens  theorganizations of civil society must free themselvesfrom political cliques so as to contribute to the rapiddevelopment of human societies in key areas ofeconomic and social life. In that regard  I welcomethe decision taken several years ago to encouragecitizen action by accrediting to the Economic andSocial Council those organizations that have beenrecognized for their usefulness. That is a judiciousway to encourage  within those citizen organizations a heightened awareness of their responsibilities whenfacing today’s major challenges  economic crises environment crises and the aspirations to democracyand freedoms that  although they assume new forms should not obstruct the momentum of our societies.The peoples’ fight for more open and democraticsocieties should not dissipate at the borders of nationStates. That fight must extend to the international level in which the rules of the game must also continue toevolve in order to take into account the major changesthat have taken place since the creation of the UnitedNations. And yet  since 1945  the basic rules that governthe functioning of the Security Council have literallybeen frozen in an immobility that is increasinglyappalling. It is obvious that maintenance of the statusquo in a context of profound change cannot fail togenerate serious dysfunctions. The Council’s incapacityto agree on certain major cases of great importanceis a perfect illustration  and again sharply raises thequestion of reform of that body  which is at the heart of the entire United Nations system. That process  whichhas countless times been broached and put off for later today deserves full and immediate attention.Thus  Togo would like to solemnly reaffirm itssteadfast support for the African Union initiativethat seeks to grant the African continent  followingthe modalities that have not yet been defined  moreadequate representation within the United NationsSecurity Council. I firmly believe that it is up to thenations that have always had the privilege of havinga permanent seat on the Council to take a small stepthat would allow all of humankind to make a giant leapforward. That gesture seems essential to me becauseit is a sine qua non for generating a new dynamic thatwould allow us to collectively deliver more coordinated bolder and determined responses and to thus forge aglobal governance that is more mature and more free with greater analytical capacity."
"169",6807,"THA",67,2012,"﻿On behalf of thedelegation of the Kingdom of Thailand  allow me tocongratulate the President of the General Assemblyupon his election to preside over the Assembly at itssixty-seventh session.I would also like to convey our appreciation to theoutgoing President  Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his outstanding leadership of the General Assemblyduring the previous session.We continue to live in challenging times. Much stillneeds to be done to restore stability and confidence inthe global financial and economic system  and to findlong-term solutions to the eurozone crisis. The ArabSpring has taught us that it is very important to listen tothe voice of the people. The risk of conflict in variousregions around the globe may affect our efforts topromote peace  prosperity and democracy.We have also seen how religious insensitivity andhate can lead to violence. In the light of this  we needto promote a culture of tolerance  mutual respect andunderstanding  both in and among societies. These areessential factors to prevent conflict and promote lastingpeace.In our efforts to promote lasting peace and security we are confronted with a wide range of threats  bothold and new. It is therefore necessary for us to seekinnovative solutions and new thinking. We need strongleadership  political will and good global governance.It is imperative that we settle international disputesby peaceful means. But even beyond that  we need tothink in terms of preventive and preemptive actions toprevent such disputes from arising in the first place.Most important  we have to think in terms of promotinginclusive and comprehensive peace and development both within and among countries. Peace  security anddevelopment are all interconnected.Economic development must go hand in handwith political advancement. Here  I would like toemphasize three points. First  an inclusive nationaldevelopment strategy is vital. During this period ofeconomic uncertainty  we must not consider economicgrowth alone. It is important to put people front andcentre in the development agenda. Sustainable growthand development  job creation  promoting povertyreduction and equality and addressing climate changemust go hand in hand. That is what every Governmentshould do — put people at the heart of the country’seconomic development strategy — because we believethat the greatest asset of any country is the people  andhow much a country can excel depends on how much itspeople can fully realize their potential. Secondly  an inclusive regional development is theway forward and would help strengthen the fabric ofregional peace and security. Thailand strongly believesthat we and our neighbours in the region have a sharedobjective. We have a shared interest in fostering commonpeace and prosperity. We need to therefore strive toprosper together because only by working together canwe create a much-needed synergy that would supportour common development. That will also help limit thechance of conflict.In South-East Asia  that is the spirit that drives the10 States members of the Association of Southeast AsianNations (ASEAN) to establish an ASEAN Communityby the year 2015. As ASEAN moves towards greaterintegration  great efforts are being made to closedevelopment gaps and expand connectivity acrossSouth-East Asia and beyond to the wider East Asiaand South Asia. That would help spread developmentand growth more broadly across the continent. And aseconomic activities become more concentrated in EastAsia  that closer integration and expanded connectivity together with an expanding region-wide network of freetrade agreements  will further strengthen the resilienceof East Asia  create greater opportunities and unleashthe full potential of this promising region.Thirdly  an inclusive process at the global levelis crucial as the international community considersthe post-2015 development agenda. The MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) have been an importanttool that resulted in better livelihoods for millions ofpeople. With 2015 fast approaching  the internationalcommunity should mobilize an all-out effort to makethe final push in realizing those MDGs.At the same time  it is important to prepare beyond2015. The successes and failures of the implementationof the MDGs should be taken into account as theinternational community starts to frame the post-2015development agenda or the sustainable developmentgoals. The process towards that end should be asinclusive as possible to ensure that the post-2015development agenda will enjoy the broadest possiblesupport and ownership of the international community.Thailand will play an active and constructive role inthat process because development is an issue close toour heart.In this age of globalization  the concept of absolutesecurity has become obsolete. Peace can never beachieved in isolation. We can only seek peace through common security and stability. We must work closelywith our friends in each region to strengthen theircapacities in meeting their development goals. Webelieve that the peace and prosperity of our neighboursis that of our own. That is particularly relevant in thecurrent case of Myanmar during the critical period oftransition towards greater democracy  which Thailandfully supports. We must all work together as partnersto help Myanmar continue in its process of change. Wewill all benefit from that economic cooperation andintegration.We live in a world of increasing interconnectivity but our peoples continue to face insecurity from cross-border challenges. In this age of globalization  theconcept of security must be people-centred. Therefore transnational challenges — from people smuggling tohuman trafficking  from narcotics to pandemics  fromnatural disasters to illegal trade in arms and materialsfor weapons of mass destruction — must rank highon our national agenda. The international communityshould redouble its collective effort to act forcefullyagainst transnational crimes that exist in a world ofincreased interconnectivity.One of the worst forms of human indignity ishuman trafficking. I consider that inhumane form ofexploitation to be a matter of national priority and amfully committed to eliminating it.. Whether it is humantrafficking or other transnational crimes  the key isto ensure that the rule of law prevails and the basicrights of peoples are guaranteed. Vulnerable groups such as women  children  the elderly and people withdisabilities  in particular deserve our attention.Solutions to those challenges cannot be achievedby Governments alone. We need to work with allstakeholders  especially in strengthening internationalnorms and standards. Through the United Nations  weneed to promote the rule of law as a solid foundation toachieve peace  international security  human rights andsustainable development.We are committed to promoting peace andprosperity within countries and internationally  but ultimately  the process must begin at home. It can bestbe accomplished by providing space for all withina democratic framework and promoting nationalreconciliation. Above all else  we must think in terms ofpartnership and work together as responsible membersof the international community.Working through the United Nations  we needto reach out to people who have been denied theirlegitimate rights and aspirations. It is in that spirit thatthe Royal Thai Government established diplomaticrelations with the State of Palestine on 1 August 2012 in the hope that both Israel and Palestine can achievetrue and lasting peace based on a two-State solution.Elsewhere in the Middle East  the situation in Syriacontinues to worsen. Thailand is deeply concernedabout the humanitarian impact of violence againstcivilians and strongly condemns such violence. Wecall for an immediate end to the use of force againstcivilians. We call for all sides to engage in dialoguetowards a political solution  which can be achieved onlyby the efforts of the Syrian people themselves.In the quest for peace and security  we believe itis necessary to continually look beyond our borders.Thailand wishes to reaffirm our commitment topeacekeeping in difficult times as necessary. FromTimor-Leste to Haiti to Darfur and in the Gulf of Aden Thailand’s peacekeeping operations also assist in localand community development  sharing our best practicesin agriculture  health and water resource management.In sum  Thailand has continued to engage with theinternational community across all three pillars of theUnited Nations: peace and security  development andhuman rights. The management of those interconnectedissues will provide us with long-term solutions  not onlyfor conflict resolution via peaceful means  but also forways to prevent conflicts from arising altogether.I assure the Assembly that Thailand will continueto be a strong partner of the United Nations in helpingto address those shared challenges of humankind.It is with that conviction that we have submitted ourcandidature as a non-permanent member of the SecurityCouncil for the term 2017-2018."
"170",6832,"TJK",67,2012,"﻿First of all  allow me toextend to Mr. Vuk Jeremič my sincere congratulationson his election as President of the General Assemblyat its sixty-seventh session. I am convinced that hisextensive professional experience will contribute to thesuccessful work of the this session of the Assembly ofour universal Organization.It is my great pleasure to convey my greetings toSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and to express mycountry’s sincere appreciation for his tireless effortstowards achieving the goals of the United Nations.Once again  recent world developments haveproved that it is impossible to address global andregional issues without strengthening the central roleof the United Nations in international affairs or withoutcollective initiatives in world politics that fully respectthe norms of international law. In that regard  it hasbecome obvious that the Organization needs rationalreform  as a result of which a renewed United Nationswill emerge that will be able to respond quickly andappropriately to world developments and to effectivelymeet the numerous global challenges and threats of thenext generation.The efforts to strengthen United Nationspeacebuilding activities deserve further comprehensivesupport. In that regard  it is my pleasure to notethat Tajikistan continues to make a considerablecontribution in that area by participating in UnitedNations peacekeeping operations.Tajikistan is convinced that respect for culturaland religious diversity  as well as dialogue amongcivilizations  is essential for global peace andunderstanding. In that regard  we are deeply concernedat the increase in many parts of the world of attempts todenigrate religions  in particular Islam  by misusing thefreedom of expression. We strongly condemn such acts.There is no doubt that the establishment ofcomprehensive legal norms on human rights is one of themajor accomplishments of the United Nations. Humanrights  along with peace  security and development  arethe pillars of the United Nations system. As a signatoryto the major international treaties on human rights Tajikistan consistently implements measures aimed atensuring the protection and promotion of human rightsin the country.With the intent of making a greater contributiontowards the implementation of the noble goals of theHuman Rights Council  the Government of Tajikistanhas decided to present its candidature to that importantbody for the term 2015-2017. In that regard  we sincerelyhope that Member States will render their valuablesupport to our candidature.Within the context of the withdrawal of theInternational Security Assistance Force fromAfghanistan  scheduled for 2014  the Afghan issuewill acquire critical importance not only for theregion but for the entire world. We believe that thesocial and economic development of Afghanistan iskey to ensuring stable peace in that country. For thatreason  international assistance to Afghanistan shouldaim first and foremost to fully restore its economy  tofurther strengthen its social well-being and to createemployment. In that regard  the completion of projectsto build railroads  motorways  power transmissionlines and gas pipelines that connect Afghanistan withTajikistan and other countries of the region is of theutmost importance.Last March  Tajikistan hosted the fifth RegionalEconomic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan which submitted specific proposals and projects invarious areas that will contribute to regional cooperation and include the participation of Afghanistan. Asa close neighbour of Afghanistan  Tajikistan hasparticipated actively in the rehabilitation of the Afghaneconomy and the country’s social infrastructure. Weare convinced that the processes of multidimensionalregional cooperation should fully involve Afghanistan.The prevention of drug trafficking is one of theimportant areas requiring cooperative efforts on the partof the international community. It is essential that theinternational community coordinate measures aimed atreducing both the demand and the supply of drugs  andintegrate efforts undertaken at the national level intoan international strategy for drug control. Tajikistanhas designed its own anti-narcotics strategy  whichincludes short- and long-term programmes of action cooperation and interaction on bilateral  regional andmultilateral bases  and has begun to develop a newanti-narcotics strategy for the period 2013-2020.The Ottawa Convention calls on the internationalcommunity to put an end to the suffering and casualtiescaused by anti-personnel mines  which kill and maimhundreds of people  mostly innocent and defencelesscivilians  especially children  and that obstructeconomic development and reconstruction. Regrettably the suffering and misery that anti-personnel landminescause is a serious burden on those citizens of my countrywho live along the border with neighbouring States. Inthat regard  we are committed to the full and effectiveimplementation of the Convention  in cooperation withall parties concerned. Tajikistan is a strong advocate ofa mine-free Central Asia.The year 2012 will be remembered as a historicmoment. Two decades after their first meeting in Riode Janeiro  national representatives gathered thereagain to discuss and identify the most effective ways ofachieving sustainable development. The United NationsConference on Sustainable Development reiterated ourcommitment to a path towards sustainable developmentand to ensuring an economically  socially andecologically sustainable future for our planet: the futurewe want. Ensuring sustainable economic developmentdesigned to improve people’s living standards andquality of life is a strategic goal of the Government ofTajikistan. We give special attention to the effective rational and protective use of natural resources  theprimary dimension of a green economy.Making access to energy a priority is the key toachieving all the Millennium Development Goals.It is especially crucial for developing countries and remote mountain territories located far from majorinfrastructure. My country is no exception to that  andour access to energy is the key to social and economicdevelopment and poverty reduction. Regrettably however  we are compelled to state that due to a lack ofmutual understanding and cooperation in the region andto disregard for Tajikistan’s legitimate rights and vitalinterests  for the past 10 years our country has sufferedfrom a severe power shortage during the winter.Because of its lack of other energy sources  it isvitally important for Tajikistan  which has enormoushydro-energy potential  to develop hydropowerin a planned and integrated manner. According tointernational treaties  Tajikistan has every right to useits natural resources  including hydropower  for thebenefit of its people. At the same time  we wish to makeit clear from this rostrum  with full responsibility  thatin developing its hydropower potential  the Republicof Tajikistan has no intention of exclusively pursuingits own interests at others’ expense. On the contrary we sincerely advocate mutually beneficial regionalcooperation and partnership. It is against that backdropthat we should view Tajikistan’s active cooperationwith the World Bank in developing a technical economic  social and ecological assessment of theRogun hydropower station  a project of vital importanceto my country. Similarly  we expect that while theassessment is being carried out  the parties concernedin the region will abstain from hasty and unconsideredstatements and actions that may run counter to existinginternational agreements and to the spirit of friendship cooperation and good neighbourliness.Tajikistan attaches great importance to theinterests of landlocked developing countries  whoselocation makes them vulnerable. It is obvious thatTajikistan’s geographic isolation and lack of access tothe sea constitute a serious obstacle to its sustainabledevelopment. Under the circumstances  it is clear thata network of reliable and unimpeded transportationand communications arteries connecting Tajikistan tothe outer world via its neighbours is becoming vitallyimportant. In that regard  we call for the eliminationof any artificial and economically unsupported barriersand obstacles to transportation and communicationlinks among the countries of the region that do notcontribute to developing and strengthening regionalcooperation and partnership. We hope that the relevantUnited Nations missions in the region will pay dueattention to this issue. International Year of Water Cooperation  initiatedby Tajikistan  which coincides with the twenthiethanniversary of the proclamation of 22 March as WorldWater Day. To implement the goals of the InternationalYear of Water Cooperation  Tajikistan proposes holdinga number of events in 2013  including  in particular  aGeneral Assembly thematic session and an internationalconference dedicated to water cooperation issues. Inthat regard  my country will present a draft resolutionfor consideration by the Second Committee. I wouldlike to take this opportunity to express our sincere hopethat Member States will support this initiative.Tajikistan  as a strong supporter of broad andcomprehensive cooperation  believes that onlycollective  coordinated efforts and effective regionaland international cooperation can serve as a foundationfor joint success  render the world a better and saferplace and make the lives of the people of our planethappier and more dignified."
"171",6853,"TKM",67,2012,"﻿I wish at the outset to express my sincere gratitudefor being given the honour of speaking from this loftyrostrum.Allow me first of all to convey to the members ofthe Assembly and to the peoples of their countries thegreetings and wishes for peace and prosperity of HisExcellency the President of Turkmenistan  GurbangulyBerdimuhamedov.Allow me to congratulate His Excellency VukJeremić on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session and to wish himevery success in his upcoming critical work. I wouldalso like to express appreciation to His Excellency Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-sixth session  for the skilful andeffective manner in which he carried out his duties.Today the international community is witness tocomplex  multifaceted processes in geopolitics  theglobal economy and the humanitarian sphere. Seriousenvironmental problems challenge us with theirunprecedented urgency. It is no exaggeration to say thatmajor global issues related to energy supplies acquiringuniversal importance. All of these require a constructiveand effective response on the part of the United Nationsand the elaboration of appropriate internationalmechanisms aimed at maximizing the effective useof existing political  financial  organizational andother resources  so as to overcome existing problemsand challenges  enhance mutual understanding andtrust  and reaffirm the irreversibility of the process ofsustainable development of all the peoples of our planet.Objectively speaking  energy security isfundamental to the stable and conflict-free developmentof today’s world. As a leading energy provider withthe fourth-largest reserves of hydrocarbon resources Turkmenistan legitimately and consistently calls forthe establishment of a sound and reliable internationalenergy supply system and the drawing up of plansand projects for cooperation in world energy marketsappropriate to modern realities. We believe that it isnow time for the United Nations to adopt consensusdecisions on universal political and legal mechanismsto govern global energy cooperation.As members know  at previous General Assemblysessions  the President of Turkmenistan launched anumber of initiatives on energy security and mutuallybeneficial cooperation in the energy sector. The realitiesof modern life affirm the relevance of such initiatives.As a step towards those initiatives  Turkmenistanproposes that States Members of the United Nationsconsider in depth the establishment of an internationallegal framework to govern the operation of an energysupply system  taking into due account the interestsof hydrocarbon producers and transit and recipientnations.As a first step in that direction  we believe thatit would be appropriate to draw up a draft resolutionduring this session on the establishment of anexpert group to develop the relevant United Nationsinternational instrument. At the same time  we lookforward to constructive engagement with all States Members of the United Nations  which  we believe would significantly help to find common approachesto solving one of the most urgent problems of moderndevelopment.The United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment  held in June this year  clearly identifiedthe need to strengthen our efforts on ecological issuesand environmental protection. Speaking at the meeting the President of Turkmenistan noted that  at theinstitutional level  today’s main objective is to mergeand complement existing global  regional and nationalinstruments.It is no secret that the Central Asian and CaspianSea regions have difficult environmental conditions.We think that the efforts made to date to improvethe situation are clearly insufficient. We need a jointand results-oriented action plan that combines theuse of scientific  technological  political  diplomatic administrative and technical measures for effectiveoutcomes in that direction. We therefore propose settingup  in cooperation with the United Nations  a regionalcentre for climate change technologies in CentralAsia and the Caspian basin. We believe that such astructure would enable the countries in those regionsto significantly strengthen cooperation on ecologicalsafety. It would promote the effective coordination ofnational  regional and international efforts and wouldfurther mutual understanding and confidence-buildingtowards achieving sustainable development goals.With regard to international politics  Turkmenistangives particular attention to the issues of peace andsecurity and to ensuring sustainable development. Inthat context  one of the main challenges facing theinternational community today is the need for our jointefforts to ensure non-proliferation and disarmament.As a party to the principal international treaties andUnited Nations conventions in that field  Turkmenistanexpects to continue to fully support global disarmamentprocesses.We believe that it is relevant to pursue themultilateral dialogue on the validity of the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We proposethat a high-level consultative meeting be held next year under the auspices of the United Nations  to discusssteps to expand the international non-proliferation legalframework. Turkmenistan’s initiative is particularlyrelevant to the practical implementation of stepstowards a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia.As we know  the agenda of the sixty-seventh session includes an item on a nuclear-weapon-free zone inCentral Asia.Our country is ready to actively cooperate with theOffice of the Under-Secretary-General for DisarmamentAffairs and to participate in a number of initiativesin that regard. Given that further improving relevantUnited Nations agencies may be one practical step inimplementing consistent disarmament measures  wethink it appropriate to consider the establishment of aUnited Nations subregional centre for disarmament inAsia.Strengthening comprehensive  targeted and long-term cooperation with the United Nations is a strategicchoice of Turkmenistan and a priority of its foreignpolicy. As an important part of that cooperation our country is considering participating in UnitedNations activities to ensure human development  betterliving standards and people’s well-being; to establishconditions conducive to global economic and socialgrowth; to utilize human creativity; and to promotepeople’s rights and freedoms.In pursuing those lofty goals and striving tocontribute  where possible  to their achievement Turkmenistan has announced its candidacy formembership of the Economic and Social Council forthe period 2013-2015. That decision was made on thebasis of the country’s current progress in the political socioeconomic  cultural and other fields  its active rolein international processes and its understanding of theresponsibilities inherent to membership of the Council.If elected  Turkmenistan plans to use all availablemeans to improve international cooperation for theeffective implementation of sustainable developmentgoals. At the same time  Turkmenistan will activelycontribute to strengthening the Economic and SocialCouncil by expanding its role in addressing the urgentissue of global socioeconomic development.The most important element of the modern systemof international relations is humanitarian cooperation.To underscore that the humanitarian component is atthe centre of the highest principles and values of thecommunity of nations  our country will continue topromote its cooperation with the United Nations onprotecting human rights and on establishing conditionsconducive to human development. On that basis given that the United Nations plays a major role in thecomprehensive development of humanity and bearing inmind the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  we believe it appropriate during this sixty-seventh session to consider including the humanitarianissues on the United Nations international agenda as aseparate issue.In that context  Turkmenistan proposes establishinga United Nations platform of action for humanitarianaffairs with a view to it becoming the political andlegal basis for the consolidation of the internationalcommunity’s humanitarian efforts. We believe thatsuch a holistic approach will enable us to galvanizethe activities of United Nations agencies  to developlong-term solutions in line with international lawand General Assembly resolutions  and to ensure thepractical implementation of United Nations conventionson humanitarian matters.In conclusion  I would like to emphasize that ourforeign policy  which is based on our love of peace on neutrality and on broad international cooperation together with the constructive positions advocatedby our country  form a solid basis for Turkmenistan’swork in the United Nations. In that spirit  we will relyon broad cooperation with all countries of the worldin order to strengthen and develop a comprehensiveinternational partnership."
"172",6867,"TLS",67,2012,"﻿It is a greatpleasure for me to address this great General Assemblyfor the second year in a row. Last September  I tried to convey to the Assemblya message of progress and hope. Today I bring fromthe people of Timor-Leste a message of both joy andthankfulness.The United Nations has been in Timor-Lestesince the difficult times of our emancipation  havingled the popular consultation of 1999. Since then it has been enormously challenging to build fromscratch the foundations of a new State under the ruleof law  based on democratic governance and respectfor human rights. As such  after the United NationsMission in East Timor  we had missions such as theUnited Nations Transitional Administration in EastTimor  the United Nations Mission of Support in EastTimor  the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste andthe United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste(UNMIT) accompanying us in this crucial journeyof State-building  as well as in the creation of anatmosphere of reconciliation and harmony  with a viewto achieving peace and stability.In our still-brief existence as a State  we have beentrying to learn from the errors of the past. Today Ican say that we have decisively moved away from thedifficult circumstances that characterize post-conflictcountries or  in other words  countries with recenthistories of conflict and violence.We have come to understand — along with severalcountries — that peace and stability are essentialprerequisites for State-building. This year  2012 therefore marks not exactly the end of a chapter in ourhistory of peacebuilding but  more particularly  thestart of a new one — a chapter of ongoing institutionalstrengthening with the goal of boosting nationaldevelopment.After two rounds of presidential elections  in Marchand April  our people elected as the third Presidentof the Republic Major-General Taur Matan Ruak  ahistoric figure in the struggle for liberation  who hasbeen serving the motherland since 1975. Taur MatanRuak led the armed resistance and became Chief ofDefence Forces in 1999.In May  we had the pleasure of hosting five headsof State and many delegations from friendly countriesto celebrate with us the tenth anniversary of therestoration of our independence. That took place withinan atmosphere of peace  stability and confidence in thefuture. The landmark moment of the celebrations was theconstitutional transfer of power from the then Presidentof the Republic  Mr. José Ramos-Horta  to the new headof State  in a highly dignified manner for our youngdemocracy.On 7 July  the Timorese people were called to voteonce again  and on 30 July  the new Parliament tookoffice. As a result of those elections  three partieswere chosen to ensure the governance of Timor-Lestefrom 2012 to 2017. Consequently  on 8 August theFifth Constitutional Government was sworn in andgiven the mission of continuing to consolidate the vitalinstitutions of a peaceful and democratic nation. In thatway  we will also be continuing the work done by theprevious Government  which consisted of a five-partycoalition and undoubtedly sowed the seeds for nationalpeace and stability  in addition to boosting our economy.During the course of this year  we have also beenhonoured with visits by several eminent personalities including two high-level dignitaries: in August  theSecretary-General  His Excellency Ban Ki-moon decided to see for himself the changes that had takenplace in our country since his last visit five years ago.His visit was a magnificent gesture of support by a manwith a broad vision of peace and development  a visionthat is shared by the Timorese people. The Secretary-General acknowledged the progress made and spokewords of encouragement regarding the strengthening ofthe ties of cooperation between the United Nations andTimor-Leste in an important undertaking  EducationFirst  which is part of his global education initiative.More recently  we also had the pleasure of hosting theUnited States Secretary of State  Mrs. Hillary Clinton.That was the first time that a senior representative ofthe United States Government had visited our youngcountry. Mrs. Clinton also conveyed an importantmessage of confidence and solidarity  praising thestrong commitment by Timor-Leste to the values andprinciples of democracy and good governance. Thoseevents are even more important given that UNMIT andthe International Stabilization Force will withdraw bythe end of 2012. That will mark the end of peacekeepingoperations in Timor-Leste.All this has instilled in the hearts of the Timoresepeople a very special feeling of accomplishment andnational pride. I would like to convey that feeling of joyand thankfulness to all countries Members of the UnitedNations and to the various international organizations that have provided us with ongoing support in terms ofconsolidating peace  democracy and human rights.The President of the Republic  Taur Matan Ruak has asked me to make public that on 20 May 2013 theTimorese State will be honouring  with the highestinsignia of Timor-Leste  all countries and partiesthat have taken part in missions in Timor-Leste starting with the General Assembly and the SecurityCouncil. For our people  that will be an act of profoundrecognition  expressing the wish that from now on theUnited Nations will pay more attention to our brothersand sisters in need. The success of Timor-Leste belongsto everyone — to the international community for theirdedicated support and solidarity  and to the Timoresepeople for the courage to acknowledge their mistakesand for their firmness and determination in correctingthem.Throughout the past four years  our people haveclearly said no to conflict in order to fully embrace theaspirations of their own development. The Timoresepeople were also able to display a high degree of politicalmaturity by expressing  in a peaceful and constructivemanner  renewed confidence in their elected leadersand in State institutions. All of this is essential forreaffirming that  today more than ever  we are readyto continue leading the national development process including the full establishment of our democratic Stateunder the rule of law and the gradual implementation ofthe Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030.However  we want to maintain strong ties withthe United Nations and other partners under a newcooperation framework  taking as a starting pointthe current needs of the country in both institutionalstrengthening and in the development sector. Based onthe principles of the New Deal  which are advocatedby the group of seven plus (g7+)  we hope to seerelationships of cooperation being established in aninnovative  dynamic and effective manner.After overcoming the main obstacles in terms ofState-building  Timor-Leste is now looking to thefuture with optimism. Consequently  the Government’sprogramme for the 2012-2017 mandate  which hasalready been endorsed by Parliament  establishes short-term — five years — activities  lists sectors whereactivities can be started in order to have impacts in themedium term of 5 to 10 years  and includes objectivesfor the long term of 10 to 20 years   to be implementedaccording to priorities and execution time.We will continue to invest in social capital with theaim of building capacity and of dignifying Timoresecitizens by maximizing the quality of and access tohealth  education  professional training  information social justice and culture. We will invest in basicinfrastructures  which will be the driving force of thecountry’s development. We will develop the economicsector to make better use of our potential and to createemployment. We will encourage the growth of theprivate sector  both local and foreign. We will continueour efforts to consolidate the institutional frameworkso as to improve the functioning  management andimplementation of programmes. That includes a strongpublic sector  good governance and a credible systemof justice.Meanwhile  we will improve the social programmesthat cater to our most vulnerable citizens  including thedisabled  the elderly  and women and children at risk  inorder to ensure that no Timorese citizen is marginalizedor socially excluded. We will also continue to dignifyour veterans.Today we have a plan  a vision and a goal: totransform Timor-Leste from a low-income country toa medium-high-income one by 2030. We want to be aprosperous and safe nation with a healthy and educatedpopulation  a country that provides skilled employmentfor all.However  in the short term  by 2015  Timor-Lestewill not meet the Millennium Development Goals.The current major challenge for Timor-Leste is thefight against poverty — a challenge that we sharewith over one billion people in our planet. Regrettably around 20 per cent of the world’s population live inconditions of extreme poverty. Hunger and the lack ofaccess to water sources will remain insurmountablechallenges. Mothers and children throughout the worldwill continue to die tragically due to lack of access toservices to meet the most basic needs.Unfortunately  those are the current projections for2015. For that reason  it was very timely of the Secretary-General to create a high-level panel to help establishnew guidelines for beyond 2015. Here  I must confessthat we were proud to see a Timorese woman — ourMinister of Finance  Emilia Pires — deservingly chosenas a panel member. Timor-Leste wants to contributeto the debate on that issue in a clear and constructivemanner. It is urgent to address the structural factors that have hindered the efforts that so many people ofgoodwill have made without obtaining tangible results.We have a historical opportunity to change things.We can learn from the lessons of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals process  analysing what workedand what did not  in order to do better in the future.Strengthening the role of the United Nations is essential.However  it will require the courage to break withthe old way of handling things. We need new actionparadigms and new coordination mechanisms so thatprogrammes may truly benefit the people of the moreaffected countries.The g7+ was created in April 2010 in Dili  duringthe preparation for the International Dialogue onPeacebuilding and Statebuilding  which took place inTimor-Leste. Prior to the creation of the g7+  there wasno mechanism whereby fragile States with commonconcerns about peace and development could discusssuch matters in a less subservient way than in theirrelationships with donors and development agencies.It is quite common for recipient countries toconsider that the international assistance they receiveis not the most appropriate to meet their real needs.Countries complain of the lack of an accountabilitysystem in relation to the money that is actually spenton the poor  compared to the amounts spent to improvethe well-being of those who manage the projects andthose who manage the reports on the projects  longdocuments that are irrelevant because they are out oftouch with the reality on the ground. For those reasons in a true spirit of openness and sharing  with a commondesire to improve the living conditions of their peopleand to contribute to sustainable peace and development fragile countries created the g7+ as an internationalgroup through which they could speak with one voice.Yes  we say one voice. Speaking as one  we will be ableto demand responsibility from the leaders of beneficiarycountries and also accountability to the taxpayers of thedonor countries.Those are the same reasons why we are advocatingthe New Deal  which seeks to ensure better coordinationand ownership of international assistance by recipientcountries. We want assistance to have genuine impactson the people and to correspond better to the true needsof the beneficiary populations.Timor-Leste is fully committed to leading the g7+ bringing the same commitment it showed when movingfrom a situation of conflict and fragility to a situation of social and political peace and stability. We want tocontribute in a way that is sound and based on actualexperiences in the g7+ itself. We are a small countrythat is still fragile in some aspects  but we share thesame huge concerns of the 17 nations that make up ourgroup  with a total population of more than 300 millionpeople.We have seen how intolerance causes irreparabledestruction in several parts of the world  particularlyin the daily lives of innocent people. The brunt of theimpact is borne by women  mothers  children and theelderly  making them even more vulnerable. Intolerancebreeds hatred and the desire for vengeance. The worldis not changing so much as it is destroying itself.Consolidating the gains of the Arab Spring isproving to be difficult. Syria is a terrible example ofinternal conflict. Iraq and Afghanistan do not presentbetter perspectives of being able to solve their internaldifferences  which are becoming deeper.My good friend Mr. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono the President of the Republic of Indonesia  has beenhosting the Bali Democracy Forum  which has beenattracting greater interest each year  along with anincreasing number of participating countries. Wehave always maintained in that Forum that democracycannot be imposed upon people  for the same reasonsthat solar panels cannot be imposed on homes withoutfood  which therefore have no prospect of sustainability.Democracy must be an internal process. The process issometimes long  but it is vital for a lasting solution.The most recent  dynamic and inspirational examplecomes from Myanmar. I commend Aung San Suu Kyi  awoman with an unshakeable character  a born leader  aresolute democrat and a defender of peaceful solutions who is today an advocate for internal reconciliation.I also commend the leaders of Myanmar for theircourage in making changes in the country. On behalfof the people of Timor-Leste  I also salute the peopleof Myanmar and wish them prosperity  and I appeal fordialogue  reconciliation and tolerance.Today’s world faces very serious problems andis sliding towards an increasingly dangerous lack ofcontrol. In addition to a recent atmosphere of regionalinstability  environmental threats continue to grow hindering the legitimate aspirations of emerging anddeveloping countries to benefit from their naturalresources. In the Pacific region  some island States seetheir very survival at risk.Food security concerns are also coming to theforeground as a further result of climate changes requiring careful thought and an immediate and broadstrategy. In several parts of the world we see an immoralincrease in inequality  with a rich and powerful elitedominating the globe with impunity while the poorbecome even poorer and eternally dependent onwasteful assistance. What is more  it is difficult toknow from where that assistance will come.In order to meet these challenges  we need a strongand efficient United Nations that cooperates moreeffectively with international and regional organizationsand that operates with great respect for the sovereigntyof each State. The United Nations  which consists ofall of us here today  has a duty to humanity. We shouldall acknowledge that we are the privileged agents ofthe necessary collective change to a better and saferworld. Our collective efforts to preserve peace  securityand human dignity must be translated from altruisticidealism to a more interventionist plan. That in turnmeans replacing a reactive agenda with a proactive one.It also means reducing the dominance of political andeconomic interests in favour of social and humanitarianinterests. That requires the mobilization of publicopinion around the world through dialogue about thevalues of peace and harmony among civilizations andcultures  mutual respect among societies  and toleranceamong groups.We can also start with the reform of the SecurityCouncil  which should be more representative. Thereis an imperative need to renew mindsets by theincorporation of new members  so as to energize newcommitments and responsibilities reflecting the currentsituations in today’s world.Timor-Leste has been walking the corridors ofthe United Nations for 38 years. In the beginning  wewanted to mobilize public opinion in favour of ourcause and to warn the world that our fundamentalrights were being violated. Today  we are informingthe international community of our setbacks andachievements in the construction of a sovereign State.When we were guerrilla fighters in the mountains  weheard about a new world order. Today  many peopleare still oppressed because they suffer in one way oranother. We are here to speak in favour of dialogue andfair decision-making. Human dignity must be at thecore of decisions on problems affecting our planet. Wemust have an overall sense of the existence  the fears the suffering  the despair and the fight for survival ofmen and women around the world.Today we are here to ask for honest  constructiveand unceasing dialogue to solve the problems thattrouble the world — a dialogue encompassing problemslarge and small  conflicts large and small and nationslarge and small."
"173",6883,"TON",67,2012,"﻿I wish to conveymy sincere congratulations to President Jeremićon his election to guide and oversee the importantwork of the General Assembly at this session. I mustalso congratulate his predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of Qatar  for hisrecently concluded term as the outgoing President of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. During histerm  he enhanced the profile and work of the GeneralAssembly  and we are pleased that his presidency hasdecided to carry forward and build upon the sharedtheme of the settlement of international disputes orsituations by peaceful means.Our Organization continues to draw strengthfrom the steady leadership of Secretary-General BanKi-moon  in facing on a daily basis  together with theSecretariat  the increasingly volatile challenges andfast-evolving crises around the globe with unwaveringcommitment and steadfast determination.We remember those Organization personnel whohave fallen fulfilling their duty  in the pursuit of ourcollective aspirations as reflected in the Charter of theUnited Nations.We were pleased with the convening earlier thisweek of the High-level Meeting of the General Assemblyon the Rule of Law at the National and InternationalLevels. In all settings and all circumstances  includingwith respect to States such as Tonga  the rule of law is a core pillar and a fundamental component of thenational fabric.Tongans take great pride in the enduring qualities ofthe 1875 Constitution and the early legal codes of 1839and 1850 as instruments of visionary nation-buildingand  with reform over time  lasting peace and stability.They also laid the foundation for setting Tonga on afirm footing in the context of international relationswith the global powers of the time  and set us on a paththat ultimately has led to membership in the global bodyof our time  the United Nations. Tonga was thereforepleased to join other Member States in adopting theDeclaration of the High-level Meeting (resolution 67/1).To expand and improve the role and impact of therule of law at the national  regional and internationallevels requires the expertise and technical assistanceavailable from the United Nations system  the relevantintergovernmental agencies and interested developmentpartners  so as to be coordinated  continuous andcoherent.This week’s outcome is a positive development forsmall jurisdictions such as Tonga in strengthening theircapacity to address the political  social  economic andenvironmental challenges of our time.Building upon the Secretary-General’s historicattendance at last year’s meeting of the Pacific IslandsForum (PIF)  a further meeting took place this week for the first time  on the margins of this year’s generaldebate. The important outcome of the meeting providesa stronger and regular basis for high-level interaction and the meeting allowed for an exchange of viewson issues of mutual import and concern between PIFleaders and the Secretary-General.This year’s PIF meeting was hosted by the CookIslands  and our communiqué gives proper focus toissues important to Tonga and the region  includingsustainable development  climate change  the oceans renewable energy and gender equality.Tonga  like other small island developing States returned to Rio de Janeiro in June to the United NationsConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) tochart a new global course for sustainable development.For many  if not all  small island developing States that return amounted to a reaffirmation of the specialand particular vulnerabilities  recognized in 1992  thatmake States such as Tonga unique.With other small island developing States  we arelooking to advance  during this session of the GeneralAssembly  the agreement reached in Rio on the holdingin 2014 of a Third International Conference for theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates. That Conference should be hosted in the Pacificregion.Against the background of the recent Rio+20 and theongoing efforts to achieve the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs)  such a Conference would represent anearly but timely moment for small island developingStates to take stock of implemented outcomes. In orderto be successful  the Conference will require the strongand active participation of all small island developingStates and a strong  responsive and cohesive UnitedNations system attuned to the issues facing them.Working towards such a Conference will providea boost to ongoing national initiatives such as ourTonga strategic development framework and its priorityobjectives for 2011 to 2014.Tonga joined other States members of the Allianceof Small Island States yesterday  under the chairmanshipof Nauru  in adopting a declaration focused on thecontinuing serious threat posed by climate change tothe territorial integrity  viability and survival of allsmall island States.There is an urgent need to continue to addressthe security implications of climate change  includingthe impact on territorial integrity  the frequency andseverity of climate-related disasters  the threat to waterand food security  and the forced displacement ofpeople.Our challenge to the international community and to developed countries in particular  is to take thebold measures necessary to reduce emissions of allgreenhouse gases to levels that will ensure a viable andmeaningful future for small island developing Statessuch as Tonga. To safeguard the survival of the smallestand most vulnerable States among us is to safeguarda viable future for all States. A rising tide may lift allboats  but it will drown us all.The coming meeting of the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change in Qatar mustadvance the efforts of last year’s Durban Conference tobridge differences over key issues  such as those relatedto the future of the Kyoto Protocol  climate finance closing the pre-2020 mitigation ambition gap and constructively addressing loss and damage associatedwith the impact of climate change  while bearing inmind the cost of adaptation in developing countries such as Tonga.This year’s theme of the Pacific Islands Forum was“Large ocean island States — the Pacific challenge”. Itbuilt upon the positive outcomes of Rio+20 with regardto the conservation and sustainable use of the oceansand their marine environment  or what we call theblue economy. Like other Pacific neighbours  Tonga’sconnection to its oceanic environment has a stronghistorical dimension.The ocean and its resources are more than anancient pathway to a maritime and seafaring past amongdisparate islands. They potentially now represent aliquid highway to a more sustainable future for Pacificpeoples. An eminent Tongan scholar  the late Mr. EpeliHau’ofa  said:“We should not be defined by the smallness of ourislands but by the greatness of our oceans. We arethe sea. We are the ocean. Oceania is us.”As custodians of the ocean and its living andnon-living resources  we have long appreciated thatthe health of the oceans is critical to maintaining astaple source of sustenance and livelihood for islandcommunities.We welcome the focus of Rio+20 on sustainablefisheries and national capacity development  theimportance of access and the role of small-scaleand artisanal fisheries and women  and the need forconcerted action to address the vulnerability of coralreefs and mangroves.As a party to the United Nations Convention on theLaw of the Sea  Tonga is actively seeking to implementits obligations under the Convention  includingthrough the timely negotiation of maritime boundarydelimitation agreements with neighbouring States;effective participation in the work of the InternationalSeabed Authority and the Commission on the Limitsof the Continental Shelf; implementation of relatedagreements  such as the 1995 Fish Stocks Agreement;and consideration of the potential development offurther legal instruments  within the Convention’sframework  to reflect the new realities.During this International Year of SustainableEnergy for All  we welcome the Secretary-General’shigh-level event this week  which was dedicated in part to addressing the continued development of renewableenergy sources. With like-minded members of theAlliance of Small Island States  Tonga will build on theBarbados Declaration on Achieving Sustainable Energyfor All in Small Island Developing States and on Rio+20to implement its voluntary commitment to reducing itsgreenhouse-gas emissions and to improving energysecurity through a 50 per cent renewable energy mixby 2020.With the requisite financial resources  ongoingcapacity-building  appropriate technology transfersand genuine partnership with dedicated developmentpartners  such as New Zealand  Italy  Japan and theUnited Arab Emirates  national initiatives  like theTonga Energy Road Map  will continue to develop andprovide real benefit for Tongans. We are committed to astrong advocacy role on the Council of the InternationalRenewable Energy Agency and to the critical workthat it does in pursuing a more secure and sustainableenergy path.Tonga joined the other States members of thePacific Islands Forum in adopting the Pacific LeadersGender Equality Declaration as an important part ofthe Pacific Islands Forum communiqué this year. Itestablishes a valuable political platform for investing inthe empowerment and promotion of women and younggirls as a vital part of Tongan society and the region’sfuture.We thank Australia for its investment in the PacificWomen Shaping Pacific Development initiative. Thesteps taken to promote and protect the interests of Tonganwomen and gender equality include the extension of paidmaternity leave  within the public service  from one tothree months; Government approval of a draft law onviolence against women and children  which is to betabled during the parliamentary session; Governmentapproval of holding nationwide consultations towardsconsensus on ratification of the Convention on theElimination of All Forms of Discrimination againstWomen; the launch of a national study on domesticviolence against women; and  most recently  last week’slaunch of a social welfare scheme for the elderly  that is those over 75 years of age.Without genuine improvement in gender equality Member States will continue to struggle to achieve realprogress towards meeting their commitments under theMDGs and beyond.In closing  on behalf of His Majesty King Tupou VI Queen Nanasipau’u  the royal household  the Governmentand the people of the Kingdom of Tonga  I wish toconvey our profound appreciation for the overwhelmingmessages of condolence and sympathy from MemberStates  the Secretary-General  the Secretariat and theGeneral Assembly on the untimely passing earlierthis year of our much-beloved King George TupouV. I acknowledge in particular the assistance of thePeople’s Republic of China at that time. Though hisreign may have been brief  it may yet prove timeless inenabling an environment where Tongans now exercisegreater electoral democracy and enjoy a fully electedGovernment and a more representative Parliament.That may be his reign’s most enduring legacy."
"174",6923,"TTO",67,2012,"﻿HerExcellency Mrs. Kamla Persad-Bissessar  MP  PrimeMinister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago  onwhose behalf I speak  extends her congratulations toMr. Vuk Jeremić on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Thehonourable Prime Minister has also asked me to conveyto the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  Trinidadand Tobago’s appreciation for his untiring efforts inworking towards peace and security in today’s world.I am privileged to address this Hall at a timewhen the world is faced with turmoil and uncertainty.Today  the world is radically different from what it wasa year ago. The redistribution of wealth and the verynature of global power are shifting. New dynamicsare emerging as we witness the growing economies inLatin America  Asia and Africa. The global pattern ofdistribution of resources is being transformed by newdiscoveries and by changes in technological processesand in information. The world map of financial f lowshas changed  forcing us to look with more scrutiny onthe economic forces surrounding us and the threat theypose to financial sustainability.It is in this context that Trinidad and Tobagoendorses the President’s statement at the opening of theAssembly’s sixty-seventh session on 25 September: “A growing number of States are determined toenhance their external engagement  aspiring toplay greater roles in their respective regions andbeyond. As a result  power and influence in theinternational arena are becoming more diffuse”.(A/67/PV.6  p. 4)When Trinidad and Tobago mounted this rostrumfor the first time 50 years ago  our PermanentRepresentative Sir Ellis Clarke  an illustrious legalscholar  remarked:“We recognize the responsibility which we haveassumed with membership in this Organization.That responsibility we can neither shirk nordelegate.” (A/PV.1122  para. 126)Today  I stand in reconfirmation of that responsibility.In these decades of engagement  we are alwaysanchored by the three main pillars on which the UnitedNations was founded: peace and security  human rightsand development.At the core of our commitment has been the rule oflaw both within and beyond our borders  which is thebasis of the theme set for this year’s debate: “Bringingabout adjustment or settlement of international disputesor situations by peaceful means”  which reaffirms acore principle enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations.Too often we have witnessed the severity of theconsequences when States act unilaterally to solvedisputes through the illegal use of force. Trinidadand Tobago calls on all nation States to ratify theamendments to the Rome Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court on the crime of aggression. We expectto ratify those amendments by the next Assembly ofStates Parties. The entry into force of those amendmentswill fill a crucial gap by making it possible to bring tojustice those criminally responsible for the commissionof the crime of aggression.In the light of recent troubling developments Trinidad and Tobago is compelled to reaffirm theprovisions of the 1961 Vienna Convention on DiplomaticRelations. The Convention requires States to protect thepremises of diplomatic missions and ensure the safetyof diplomatic personnel. Those sacred principles mustbe upheld even in times of armed conflict and armedviolence.The United Nations is the principal vehicle forfacilitating the settlement of disputes or situations among States by peaceful means. The architecture is inplace to achieve that objective. However  it needs to bestrengthened. To achieve that noble goal  the politicalcommitment of Member States  whether large or small developed or developing  is absolutely necessary.Member States must move swiftly to restructure theSecurity Council. For Trinidad and Tobago  the statusquo is unacceptable. The Council must be reformedto reflect the geopolitical realities of the twenty-firstcentury. The legitimacy of that body can be reaffirmedonly if the new dynamics of global power are reflectedin its composition and operation.It is a matter of grave concern to Trinidad andTobago that the Security Council has not been able toeffectively address the situation in Syria. We appeal tothe Council to fully support the work of Mr. LakhdarBrahimi  the Joint Special Representative for Syriaof the United Nations and the League of Arab States.The Council must uphold its sacred Charter mandateand ensure that all sides involved in that conflict aremade to account for their actions  which have causedtremendous human suffering and continue to threateninternational peace and security.At the same time  we also call for more principledleadership by the permanent members of the Councilto bring an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Despite the adoption of numerous resolutions bythe General Assembly and the Council  and severalpeace initiatives  including that of the League of ArabStates  we continue to witness  almost on a daily basis wanton violence and tremendous loss of life  resultingin further escalation of tensions. A resolution of theconflict remains elusive  and the conflict is a catalystfor regional insecurity and instability. That makes evenmore urgent the need to find a formula for enduringpeace. The United Nations must commit all availableresources to mediating a two-State agreement in orderto begin to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian situation  infull accordance with resolutions reaffirming bordersexisting before 1967.I will now address other issues relating to the globaldevelopment agenda.The completion of Cuba’s reintegration as a fulland equal partner in the international system is anissue close to the Caribbean. Over the years  thatpolicy objective has been given practical contentthrough the establishment of a wide-ranging dialogueand in specific cooperation agreements in a variety of development sectors of interest to the Caribbean  as partof the Caribbean convergence initiative. In the view ofTrinidad and Tobago  the imperative of the initiativecompels us to regard the economic blockade of Cubaas an anachronism. We therefore call yet again for itsremoval.We are only three years away from the deadlineset by world leaders for the achievement of theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). WhileTrinidad and Tobago would have preferred a moreequitable geographical distribution on the Secretary-General’s panel on the acceleration of efforts to achievetargets set by the MDGs  we nevertheless welcome itsestablishment. We also call for fresh and bold changesand a paradigm shift in thinking in the design of thepost-2015 development agenda.We must safeguard the environment for futuregenerations and in that regard move decisively to fullyimplement our obligations under the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change and itsKyoto Protocol. That would guarantee the survival ofthose of us who are most vulnerable to climate change climate variability and sea-level rise. Every moment ofdelay takes us closer to our own demise.The health and well-being of our people is central toour development. The prevalence of non-communicablediseases  in particular  poses a serious threat toCaribbean development. Trinidad and Tobago lamentsthe lack of action on the Political Declaration on thePrevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseasesadopted one year ago (resolution 66/2  annex). Wecannot risk further inaction on the matter. The adverseconsequences are significant. We therefore urge thatthe matter be given high priority on the internationaldevelopment agenda.The stability of many regions is being underminedby the illicit trade in conventional weapons  which hasfuelled armed conflict and armed violence. Trinidad andTobago is encouraged by the support of many countriesfor the conclusion of a robust and legally binding armstrade treaty. However  we deeply regret the failure of theUnited Nations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty despite the support of an overwhelming majority.That reflects the refusal of a few States to agree to aninstrument that would prevent the diversion of armsto the illegal market. Illegal weapons  including smallarms and light weapons  in the hands of terrorists drug dealers  gang leaders and other actors involvedin transnational organized crimes  are an affront to the efforts undertaken to resolve disputes by peacefulmeans. In the Caribbean  and I daresay elsewhere  thehigh incidence of gun-related crimes is intolerable.We join with our Caribbean Community partners andothers in the call for the resumption of negotiations onthe arms trade treaty by the first quarter of 2013.We also recognize the important role of womenas agents of change — not as mere victims — in allinitiatives related to the resolution of disputes andconflicts. Trinidad and Tobago was privileged to hosta high-level discussion with representatives of otherMember States  the United Nations Office forDisarmament Affairs and the non-governmentalorganization community at the margins of the GeneralAssembly last week on the topic of women  disarmament non-proliferation and arms control. The high point ofthe discussion was the signing of a joint statement byGovernment representatives to promote the equitablerepresentation of women in all decision-making onthe matter. Trinidad and Tobago requests all MemberStates to support this draft resolution when it comesbefore the General Assembly later in the session.The majority of States settle disputes by peacefulmeans. We take this opportunity to applaud the specialagreement signed by the Governments of Belize andGuatemala to submit their long-standing border disputeto the International Court of Justice for adjudication.We in Trinidad and Tobago have delimited ourmaritime boundaries through bilateral negotiations andarbitration  in keeping with the provisions of the 1982United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Thisconduct has not only promoted good-neighbourlinessamong States in the region  but also provided anenvironment conducive to the exploration andexploitation of living and non-living marine resourcesso vital to the social and economic development of ourpeople.In this increasingly multipolar world  whereinterconnectivity is crucial  small States are faced withmounting challenges to find a space and a place in thenew world order. Trinidad and Tobago has promoted inevery forum the need for constructive dialogue betweensmall States  the Group of 20  Brazil  Russia  India China and South Africa  and the international financialinstitutions.Trinidad and Tobago recognizes this call for anew diplomacy  and we therefore join with Mrs. PortiaSimpson-Miller  Prime Minister of Jamaica  in calling on the major international lending agencies to recognizethe special circumstances of middle-income countriesand not push them to the margins of the developmentagenda.We must advance the global economic governanceagenda. To this end  middle-income and small nationsmust not be excluded from development cooperationand financing on the basis of per capita income alone.As we look forward to the next 50 years ofmembership of the United Nations  Trinidad andTobago has a renewed optimism. In spite of the hurdlesof the past  we are witnessing a new vitality in theUnited Nations today  and we reiterate our advocacy fora new dialogue and a new diplomacy. The internationalcommunity is once again embracing multilateralismwith higher expectations. The ongoing development ofnew rules and new norms in human rights; trade anddevelopment; protection of the environment; and peaceand security gives hope that the human tragedies whichbedevilled the twentieth century can be avoided. Anew leadership with a global mindset must engage thevarious communities of interests to find more durablesolutions in a volatile global environment. This newinternational leadership must find the right mix ofpower  politics and economics to achieve the necessaryperformance level for sustainable regional and globaleconomic growth  and ultimately development  thatwill benefit the citizens of all nations.Trinidad and Tobago will engage regional hemispheric and global partners to assist the UnitedNations in making the world a safer and better placefor all humankind. But let me conclude by remindingus all that we do not have the luxury of time. The eyesof the world are upon us. Our actions today must allowtomorrow’s generations to experience a better and moresecure future."
"175",6970,"TUN",67,2012,"﻿I should liketo start by conveying to the friendly Republic of Serbiaand to President Jeremić personally my most heartfeltcongratulations on his election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Ishould like also to congratulate Mr. Nassir AbdulazizAl-Nasser  President of the Assembly at its previoussession  as well as Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for the efforts thatthey have undertaken in favour of all peoples’ aspirationsthat are aimed at achieving stability  peace  securityand development throughout the world. I should like toconvey to them the congratulations of my people  who through the revolution of 17 December 2010  enteredthe fraternity of free people and democratic States.I should now like to express our views regardingthe major issues facing our world today.Today we are witnessing the great evil perpetratedby a few groups that are using the media to disseminatetheir destructive and chaotic views. That makes clear thegreat chasm that exists with respect to the psychological social and economic crises of our societies  which unfortunately  exacerbate the phenomena of violenceand extremism. Those warning signals need to beaddressed very seriously. The First and Second World Wars did not happen in a vacuum; they were the resultof extremist statements and policies that led to humancarnage and claimed tens of millions of lives.We in Tunisia believe that we must work under theauspices of the United Nations to bring about peacefor all humankind and to avert confrontations betweencivilizations. Tunisia’s access to this forum of free anddemocratic peoples came at a very high cost. Tens ofthousands of political prisoners  as well as exiles  weretortured before the revolution; they were the ones whopaid the price. During the revolution  more than 300citizens were killed and 2 000 others injured.A year and a half after the revolution  Tunisiacontinues to move forward. We are  however  faced bya great many difficult economic and social problems the legacy of a regime that lasted for more than twodecades and whose practices included corruption fraud and repression. But that price is negligible whencompared with that paid by our brothers in Egypt Yemen and Libya  and  of course  by our brothers inSyria  more than 25 000 of whom have been killed andtens of thousands injured  along with the destructionof the country’s infrastructure. All of that will forevermark the Syrian people and affect their future fordecades to come.That high price is something we all shouldremember in facing the difficulties that hamper us inthe building of an international system that will workto avert  lay siege to and curtail those accursed politicalsystems that threaten the freedom of peoples and peaceamong peoples. The Republic of Tunisia  which has justemerged from dictatorship and which is well aware ofthe high toll taken by such a regime  proposes that wecreate a new mechanism to fight dictatorships  whichare a disease threatening peace  stability and securityas well as the prosperity of peoples. They not only havean impact on the freedom of people in a given country but they also give rise to hatred and wars.Europe was able to enjoy peace  stability andprosperity only after the fall of the fascist  Nazi andCommunist dictatorships. In the medical field  methodswere developed by the World Health Organization thatmade possible the elimination of polio in the twentiethcentury; that would have seemed pure fiction to doctorsin the nineteenth century. We have acquired politicalmaturity and awareness in the face of dictatorship which  more than diseases  poses a serious threat to thelives of hundreds of millions of people.Because the United Nations  through its Charterand institutions  has at its disposal a legal arsenal thatcan serve to bring about basic freedoms and peaceamong peoples  we invite the Organization to declarethat dictatorship is a social and political scourge thatmust be eliminated through the combined effortsof all peoples throughout the world. It behoves usto implement a bold and ambitious programme toeliminate dictatorship in the same manner in which wegot rid of polio and smallpox.The creation of the International Criminal Court(ICC) demonstrates that we are on a historic journey ofbuilding international institutions that has not yet beencompleted. The ICC is but a further step in the directionof the complete elimination of dictatorship. However the Court tackles crimes only after their commission;what we require are mechanisms to prevent dictatorshipfrom taking root in the first place.Contemporary dictatorships are based on the useof excessive force and give themselves false legalitythrough the holding of fraudulent elections. They usethe appearance of democracy to undermine democracyitself. Those kinds of elections took place in Tunisiain 1999  2004 and 2009. Our deposed dictator wasprepared to remain in power forever. He intended  forthe 2014 elections  to rewrite the Constitution so hecould run for a third term. Each time he re-imposed thestatus quo because he knew that no internal domestic orinternational mechanisms existed that could rein in hispolitical activities.During that entire period  the Tunisian democraticopposition could not but note the paralysis of domesticand international laws and legal mechanisms. It wassimply impossible for the opposition to turn to aTunisian or international constitutional court. Althoughit was normal that such a constitutional court did notexist in the country  it certainly was not normal thata mechanism to that effect should fail to exist withinthe United Nations  because the Charter of the UnitedNations and the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  as well as many other international conventionsand instruments  backed by General Assemblyresolutions  all are texts that could be viewed as beingthe charter of humankind. The only thing missing is animplementation mechanism.The Republic of Tunisia therefore proposes thecreation of an international constitutional court similarto the ICC  which could be seized of challenging illegal constitutions or charters  or fraudulent elections. Such acourt would have to be competent to consider a numberof disputes and issues  to rule on the legality or illegalityof elections that are not in line with the Charter of theUnited Nations. All systems  especially democraticones  would face the clear duty of being recognized bythe international constitutional court. The court wouldalso make recommendations and provide the necessaryadvice to all those who so request. The body could serveas a deterrent against any despot  any tyrannical regime in the case of any such regime forging election results.The court would contribute to the very disappearanceof those regimes  because it would strengthen the roleof peaceful civic resistance. Otherwise  the only choicewould be to live under oppression or to turn to violence.We all know just how expensive that can be.Tunisia strongly advocates the protection ofthe environment to ensure that we leave succedinggenerations a sustainable world.We also want to leave a world living in peace andto douse the flames of war in Afghanistan  Mali  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  the Sudan andthe Middle East. Tunisia requests rapid humanitarianintervention to help save the heroic Syrian people andto ensure the departure of President Bashar Al-Assadand his criminal regime. We call for the deployment ofan Arab peace force to guarantee the transition and tocreate a democratic State  which would be pluralisticand that could live in peace.Tunisia wishes to reiterate its support for thePalestinian people and their right to a just peace andthe release of thousands of prisoners. We support thecreation of a Palestinian State with Al-Quds as itscapital and with membership in this Organization.We condemn violence against women and children.We denounce the fanaticism  the anti-Semitism and theIslamophobia that one often sees. We call for toleranceto allow all religious minorities  including Muslims inBurma and Christians living in all Muslim countries  toexercise their faith freely. The chasm between the richand the poor must be reduced.During the upcoming Nuclear MaterialsConference  Tunisia will insist on the need to freethe Middle East from nuclear weapons and all otherweapons of mass destruction.We champion pluralistic  tolerant civilian societiesand institutions. Tunisia is the country of peacefuldemocratic revolution. Tunisia asks the General Assembly to draw uponArticle 22 of the Charter of the United Nations  by whichit may establish such subsidiary organs as it deemsnecessary  and create an international constitutionalcourt and to include this item in the agenda of itssixty-eighth session. I hope this proposal will enjoythe broadest possible support by democratic States andthe mobilization of the international community  whichplayed such an important role in the creation of theInternational Criminal Court. We hope that the samewill be done to ensure that the proposed internationalconstitutional court becomes a part of a comprehensivesystem that would enable our people and succeedinggenerations to avoid a scourge of blood and tears likethat which has cost us so dearly."
"176",7017,"TUR",67,2012,"﻿At the outset  I wouldlike to congratulate my dear friend His ExcellencyMr. Vuk Jeremić on his election as the President of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I believethat  with his able leadership  he will contribute greatlyto the work of the Assembly.I want to be frank and speak the language of thepeoples we all represent. Every year  we all gather hereat the United Nations  the embodiment of the humanquest for peace  security and international order. Weexchange views on the daunting challenges that we allface and express our strong commitment to resolvingthem. On many matters  we speak as one  yet we oftenfail to act in unity. We express our commitment tothe settlement of frozen conflicts  but there is still noprospect for a solution to many such conflicts.For instance  we have time and again declaredour support for a two-State solution to the question ofPalestine and adopted numerous resolutions to that end. However  we still hope that  one day soon  Palestine willbe represented as an equal member in the Assembly.We also underline the need for a solution to theNagorno Karabakh issue in accordance with theterritorial integrity of Azerbaijan. Yet there has notbeen a single step towards the resolution of that problemfor the past two decades.In addition  the problem of Cyprus has remainedunresolved for almost half a century. Nearly a decadehas passed since the United Nations settlement planof 2004  which the entire international communityendorsed. However  Turkish Cypriots continue to faceisolation and an unlawful and unjust embargo as if itwere a token of appreciation for their support for theUnited Nations-led settlement.My point speaks for itself. We cannot resolvecurrent problems  and each year we find ourselvesbesieged by ever-increasing new ones. Terroristscontinue to strike and take the lives of innocent people yet we still have no effective international response to or adequate solidarity against  the scourge of terrorism.Today  some States employ methods of Stateviolence and brutal oppression with impunity  whichcosts the lives of innocent citizens whom they areobliged to protect. We firmly believe that human lifeis sacred and that life is the foremost blessing for anyhuman being  whoever and wherever they are.However  millions of people live in povertyand under oppression. They are deprived of theirfundamental rights and freedoms  suffering underextreme conditions that no human being should everhave to live under. To soothe our collective conscience we constantly reiterate our pledges to help alleviatethe misery of those people. However  we fall short ofmatching our words with deeds.We live in perpetual hope. After all  as humanbeings  we are the children of hope. For us  everydawn  every sunrise and every spring signifies a newbeginning of hope. We yearn for peace and idealizepeace. It is the essence of our nature.Humankind expects from us  the leaders of nations to move humankind towards real peace. However we lag far behind in meeting the expectations of ournations and of humankind. If it is not for us to providerelief and give hope to a child living in a refugee campor in open prisons in certain parts of the world  thenwhat is the chance that we will cultivate real peace? When a child opens his eyes to a world of extremepoverty and oppression in a refugee camp or in thestreets of his neighbourhood  or when a parent leavesbehind a destroyed house  orphans and widows  howcan we prevent them from succumbing to despair andpessimism? If we cannot regard the rights of a personin Syria  Palestine  Somalia  Afghanistan  the Rakhineregion or other places as equal to our own  how can wetalk about freedom and justice? If fundamental humanrights are sacrificed for the sake of power politics andbecome negotiable in talks among a few nations inthe Security Council  how are we to achieve universalhuman rights and security? If we remain incapable oftaking action to preserve the universal principles thatthe forefathers of the United Nations set out whenforming this body  how can we demonstrate to peoplethat the f lag of the United Nations represents hope for and a safeguard of  their destiny? If the use of forceis accepted as unlimited; if indiscriminate attacks andcollective punishment become weapons in the handsof cruel regimes against their own citizens  as weare currently witnessing every day  day and night  inSyria; if we fail to hear and rise to join the cry of theinnocent masses  wherever they are; and if we cannotforce such brutal regimes to submit to justice and therule of law  how are we to maintain international peaceand security?A peaceful world  as the founders of the UnitedNations envisioned  cannot be established if we remainineffective in our work against those challenges. Letus not forget: our inability to act becomes a tool in thehands of despots and destructive regimes to demolishcities  towns and villages  massacre their own citizensand make a mockery of the civilized world and theUnited Nations.The failure to address humanitarian crises shakesour collective conscience. Worse  however  inactioneventually emboldens oppressors and aggressiveregimes and creates evil alliances that perpetuateand commit crimes against humanity. Let us makeno mistake: mercy shown to an oppressor is the mostmerciless act towards people under oppression. If notnow  when are we supposed to act in unity? If not theUnited Nations  who is to lead? If not us  then whowill shoulder the responsibility to protect innocentcivilians? Let us now imagine that we are in the shoesof those people. How can we even dream about a realfuture?We need a strong  efficient and credible UnitedNations. To that end  we must first tackle the long-outstanding issue of reforming the United Nations tomake it fit for its purpose. The working methods andstructures of the United Nations are not commensuratewith the current realities of the world. The SecurityCouncil  with its primary responsibility to maintaininternational peace and security  should becomemore representative  functional and effective. It hasto respond to the real needs of the world. That is theonly way that it will remain relevant to the enormouschallenges that we all face in the twenty-first century.I can freely appeal to the Assembly’s conscience as Turkey has a solid record — be it in Afghanistan Somalia  Syria  Yemen  Libya or Bosnia andHerzegovina or when it comes to cooperation withleast developed countries  the United Nations Allianceof Civilizations and the Mediation for Peace initiative among other examples.Allow me now to brief ly touch upon some specificissues that continue to pose formidable challenges forthe international community.Let me start by underlining that the recent attacksagainst Islam and the Prophet Muhammad — peace beupon him — and Islam are outright provocations. Theyaim to pit nations and peoples against each other. Wedeplore in the strongest terms the malicious attempts todenigrate the most sacred values of Islam or any otherfaith. We condemn any type of incitement to hatred andreligious discrimination against Muslims and people ofother faiths.Unfortunately  Islamophobia has become a newform of racism. It can no longer be tolerated underthe guise of freedom of expression. Freedom does notmean anarchy. It means responsibility. The purpose ofIslamophobia is clear and simple. It aims to create anabstract and imaginary enemy out of the millions ofpeace-loving Muslims all over the world. Regretfully accepting generalities  stereotypes and prejudice astruth  many people unknowingly become Islamophobic.However  no agenda  no provocation  no attack and noincitement to hatred can darken the bright face of Islam.At the same time  we condemn all the provocationsand violence that have led to the loss of lives in manycountries  including the death of the United StatesAmbassador in Libya. I express our sincere condolencesfor all who have lost their lives. Violence againstinnocent people cannot be justified under any pretext. Any such activity  no matter whom it is carried out byor for what purpose  is a betrayal against the soul  spiritand letter of Islam.However  the recent events are testament to a moreserious problem that should concern not just Muslims but the adherents of all faiths and religions. Thealarming increase in the number of acts that defamereligions  and thereby people who adhere to them  nowhave serious implications for international peace andsecurity. The time has therefore come to establish thedenigration of any religion and its followers as a hatecrime. We have to take swift measures. We cannot  andwe shall not  leave our future vulnerable to the recklessprovocations of all sorts of extremists.We need to craft a universal policy and a legalinstrument that  while protecting free expression  alsoensure respect for religion and prevent intentionalinsults against anyone’s faith. The solution should notbe arbitrary. It has to focus on those who defame a faithwith the intention of inciting discrimination  hostility orviolence. We have to find a balance between protectingthe rights of an individual or group to free expressionand protecting the right of another individual or groupnot to become the target of hatred or of emotional incited or psychological violence.Therefore  from this rostrum  I would like to makea strong appeal to the members of the internationalcommunity to set up all the necessary instrumentsto combat all hate crimes  including the denigrationof religions and defamation of their followers. TheUnited Nations must lead that effort and should providethe international legal framework to that end. We areresolved to actively pursue this objective and to workdiligently with like-minded nations and internationalorganizations to ensure that we take a united andeffective stance against Islamophobia and all forms ofhate.Moreover  we are well aware of the need to ensurethe safety  security and protection of diplomats. Inthe past four decade  the Turkish nation has lost 33diplomats to terrorist acts by the Armenian SecretArmy for the Liberation of Armenia. We encouragethe United Nations to focus on a new understandingof  and international instrument for  the protection ofdiplomats.As a mockery of the values we all share  the peopleof Syria have continued to suffer under the brutalityand tyranny of the regime in Damascus for the past 18 months. The numbers speak volumes. More than 30 000people have been killed so far  approximately 300 000Syrian refugees have f led to neighboring countries including Turkey  and more than 1 million people areinternally displaced.Unfortunately  this humanitarian tragedy hasbecome just a statistic for many. What has theinternational community done to stop this carnage?Literally nothing. We have yet to see a single effectiveaction to save innocent lives. It is a great disgraceto witness that today  after 20 years  the ghosts ofSrebrenica and Halabja continue to haunt us  this timein the cities of Syria.One can argue about the reasons for the failure ofthe Security Council to stop the violence of the Syrianregime. However  there can be no legitimate explanationfor the failure of the Security Council to reflect thecollective conscience of the international community.It has to uphold its primary responsibility to maintaininternational peace and security. It is the inability of theCouncil to act that continues to encourage the Syrianregime to kill ever more people.If the Security Council does not follow theconscience of the international community  as reflectedby the resolutions adopted by a more than two-thirdsmajority of the General Assembly  who will respond tothe cries of the Syrian people? For how long will we the international community  allow this humanitariantragedy to continue?The responsibility to protect the people of Syriais our fundamental duty. No political differences no balance of power politics and no geopoliticalconsiderations should prevail over our conscience andour concern for the destiny of the Syrian people.More important  the situation in Syria has evolvedinto a real threat to regional peace and security. TheSyrian regime deploys every possible instrument toturn the legitimate struggle of the Syrian people intoa sectarian war  which will engulf the entire region inflames. Unfortunately  the longer the regime is allowedto wage its campaign of violence  the harder it will beto prevent such a dreadful eventuality.It is high time that the Security Council takeaction  as the Assembly called for. There has to be asolution to ensure the immediate safety and security ofthe Syrian people. There has to be a solution for a soundtransition process that paves the way for the creation of a new and democratic Syria. The regime in powerhas to step down and allow an interim Government tolead the country to free and fair elections. The Syrianpeople need our united support and solidarity in theirstruggle for their future and their right to a legitimateand representative Government.The Turkish nation stands by its brethren  theSyrian people  in their legitimate struggle. We now carefor 90 000 displaced Syrian refugees in Turkish homes.Let me underline once again that  since the beginningof the conflict  we have never hesitated  nor will weever  hesitate to be at the side of our Syrian brothers andsisters in their most difficult hour.Another tragedy that has long been takingplace before our eyes in the Middle East is that ofPalestine. This is the fourth General Assembly sessionwhere we continue to stress the unacceptability andunsustainability of the situation in Gaza. However  todate  there has been no progress. As a result  in thefourth year of the unlawful blockade by Israel  thepeople in Gaza  children in particular  continue to livein despair  desolation and fear.Many decisions and resolutions have been adoptedat the United Nations calling for the lifting of thatunlawful blockade. However  Israel persists in its illegalpolicy to this day  thereby causing misery and anguishin Gaza. In fact  we see the same attitude by Israel in allof the occupied Palestinian territories. Despite insistentcalls by the international community  it carries on withits illegal settlements in Palestine  and thus deliberatelyundermines the prospects of a peaceful two-Statesolution.Indeed  when President Mahmoud Abbas spoke inthe Assembly last year (see A/66/PV. 19) and declaredthe right of Palestine to be recognized as an independentState  I remember seeing the whole Assembly in astanding ovation. But as of this day we have yet to seethe State of Palestine as an equal member of the GeneralAssembly  with the f lag of the independent Palestinef lying. How can we convince the Palestinian peoplethat the international community is serious about atwo-State solution when no United Nations resolutionshave helped their cause for an independent State ofPalestine? However  we will one day see the f lag ofPalestine in the Hall. Turkey will certainly support thePalestinian people in their quest for statehood  dignityand peace.While the whole world’s attention is rightly focusedon the Middle East  we should not forget that there areserious human tragedies taking place elsewhere aswell. We do not have the luxury to turn a blind eye toany human suffering.As I personally witnessed during my visit in June  thepeople of the Rakhine region  especially the RohingyaMuslims  are in desperate need of humanitarianassistance. The democratization process under way inMyanmar provides us with a window of opportunity  asthe Government has repeatedly stressed its readiness tocooperate with the international community to ease thesuffering of those people.Before concluding my remarks  I wish to touchupon yet another long-standing conflict that alsorequires immediate practical steps towards a fairand lasting solution. I am referring to the problem ofCyprus. Unfortunately  the new round of talks startedin 2008 are at a stalemate  with no end in sight  dueto Greek Cypriots’ intransigence and lack of politicalwill. Today  despite half a century’s experience and abody of United Nations work  there is still not a clearprospect for a solution.The Turkish Cypriots have so far proven their firmcommitment to a negotiated solution  but remain subjectto an inhumane and unlawful embargo. That is simplyunfair. They should not be forced to play this game foran indefinite period without a clear perspective andtimeline for a solution.The international community must not remainindifferent to what is happening in Cyprus  either. After all  the continuation of the problem creates additionalrisks for the stability of the region. Moreover  theunilateral exploration of oil and natural gas by theGreek Cypriots around the island further intensifiesthose risks.Under those circumstances  the United Nationsmust do more than what it is currently doing. TheSecurity Council in particular has to facilitate a solutionrather than merely sustaining the status quo. A changeof mentality is essential. There should be a distinctionbetween those who seek and aspire for a solution andthose who reject it. It is no longer enough to pay lipservice to a bi-zonal  bi-communal federation. It is timeto act before it is too late.In conclusion  I wish to go back to what I said atthe beginning of my remarks. We are at the end of theopening of yet another session of the General Assembly.We have all expressed our desire for and commitmentto a more peaceful and prosperous world. However positive change can only be realized if our actionsmatch our words and promises. Every attempt toachieve our objective for real peace  every moment wespend to uphold rightness and justice and every effortwe make for freedoms and human rights will providegreater comfort for those who struggle to have a say intheir destiny. A while ago  I asked if not now  when?This year  let us make a difference and let us hope thatwe will not repeat the same question next September inthe Assembly."
"177",7033,"TUV",67,2012,"﻿It is my great honour andpleasure to participate in the general debate of theAssembly on behalf of the people and Governmentof Tuvalu. As Tuvalu will commemorate the thirty-fourth anniversary of its independence on Mondaynext week  1 October  let me take this opportunity toacknowledge with profound appreciation the continuedassistance and support given us by the United Nations the international community and in particular ourtraditional development partners in our pursuit of ourdevelopment goals.The overarching theme  “Bringing about adjustmentor settlement of international disputes or situations bypeaceful means”  together with a myriad of core issuesthat have been chosen for the Assembly’s sixty-seventhsession  is fully supported by Tuvalu. In view ofcircumstances facing the world today  there is certainlyan urgent and critical need for the United Nations and for each Member State in particular to address thoseissues  individually or collectively.As a small and peace-loving nation  Tuvaluwelcomes and fully supports the important servicesprovided by the United Nations and other organizationsin the maintenance of peace and security around theworld  especially in conflict regions. We firmly believethat the use of force through military or violent actionas a means for settling disputes and conflicts should beavoided at all costs. It is also important that countriesinvolved in such disputes should be encouragedand supported in discussing the root causes of theirdifferences among themselves in a non-confrontationalmanner.We concur fully with the President’s vision thatwe cannot be defeated by terrorists  extremists and thesponsors and supporters who back them. The worldwe want to give our future generations is not one ofterrorism and fanaticism  or of proliferation of weaponsof mass destruction  maritime piracy  organizedcrime  drugs and narcotic smuggling  child labour andtrafficking  slavery and religious intolerance. In theUnited Nations  we strive for international peace andsecurity; that is the world we want to give to all futuregenerations.Faced with globalized agendas  the United Nationsmust cooperate and seek engagement with otherorganizations and their memberships for partnershipsin development activities. The United Nations shouldalso seek to ensure participatory planning in the designof any engagement so that we co-opt and work togetherwith the existing diverse fabric of our societies  whoseissues we are trying to address and assist with. TheUnited Nations should also align its programmes andactivities with those of the host country’s needs andaction frameworks  heeding the distinctiveness of ourmembership.When Tuvalu became the 189th Member of theUnited Nations in September 2000  we were consciousof the complexity and breadth of the United Nationsagenda in comparison with our relatively modestcapacity. Yet there was one issue that we wereconfidently determined to bring to the fore. Does theUnited Nations hear the plea of small island developingStates (SIDS) for fair treatment by the internationalcommunity?Today  12 years later  we consider this lastingconcern almost totally unanswered. That may sound surprising to some representatives  as we all tend to beunder the impression that much work  time and energyhas been spent over the past two decades for the benefitof SIDS. Without going into detail on the state of theSIDS agenda  I would like to make three observationson the subject and outline Tuvalu’s intentions in thesame vein.First  as much as we appreciate the work ofvarious United Nations departments and programmeson SIDS  we observe that this work has been almostentirely focused on stating and indefinitely reiteratingthe challenges and problems SIDS are facing. We haveseen nearly 20 General Assembly resolutions on SIDSadopted since the Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States  heldin Barbados  and numerous reports of the Secretary-General on the subject. Two United Nations conferenceson SIDS have been organized  and now new momentumis gathering towards a third conference in 2014.Secondly  there is no part of the SIDS work in theUnited Nations that has ever generated internationalsupport measures specially reserved for SIDS. In otherwords  in 20 years the United Nations has not been ableto hear and answer the pleas our island States have beenmaking for special treatment. SIDS status and SIDS-specific treatment are truly what our small island Statesare in need of  just as the least developed countries(LDCs) need the special treatment extended to them bythe international community.Thirdly  we would like to reply to those  within andoutside the United Nations  who have been arguing thatthe case for special treatment of SIDS is not and shouldnot be on the United Nations agenda  because specialtreatment of SIDS would imply the existence of a SIDScategory  and apparently  we are told  SIDS cannotbe considered and dealt with as a special category.Therefore  SIDS are only an abstract notion deliberatelykept undefined  because any clarity or debate on whatthey are and what precisely could be done for themwould be too challenging or disturbing.That seemingly accepted sense of SIDS work in theUnited Nations does not match Tuvalu’s vision of whatthe United Nations ought to be doing in support of thosecountries. We believe that the time has come for us tospell it out; the third decade of United Nations work onSIDS should not be another round of lip service. Thatwill require a number of needed special internationalmeasures for SIDS to be identified and  naturally also  that some order be put in the definition of SIDS as a necessary condition for making SIDS a genuine internationally accepted special category of countries.Tuvalu greatly appreciates the decision takenby the Economic and Social Council to note therecommendation of the Committee for DevelopmentPolicy to graduate Tuvalu from the least developedcountry category and to consider that issue at its nextsubstantive session in 2013. That will allow the Councilthe opportunity for full consideration of the particularchallenges Tuvalu faces. In that regard  despite thefact that Tuvalu has met two of the three criteria forgraduation from LDC status  there is an urgent need forthe United Nations to revisit such criteria in order toreflect and capture the real situation of the economiesof the countries eligible for graduation.We believe that treating the case of Tuvalu thesame way one deals with other countries is a denialof what decades of United Nations advocacy have setin place. It would be something akin to the principleof equal treatment  namely  the principle of specialtreatment  which is precisely the foundation of thevery existence of LDC status. If the geographicallimitations and extreme vulnerabilities of Tuvalu donot justify special consideration  what is the purposeof special and differentiated treatment  the cornerstoneof international cooperation? Obviously  countriesare acutely uneven and unequal  and treating them onthe basis of a one-size-fits-all paradigm would simplybe wrong. Tuvalu looks forward to the continuedunderstanding and support of members of the Economicand Social Council on the question of its graduationfrom the LDC category.Tuvalu also accords the highest priority to theattainment of the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs). Tuvalu has passionately pursued those Goals and we sincerely thank the donor community for itsinvaluable support  be it in-kind or financial. As weprogress to the end of the MDGs in 2015  we continueto seek such partnerships so as to ensure that the MDGsare achieved fully and effectively as we anticipate thetransition to the sustainable development goals.We are also fully committed to the strategicimplementation of the essential dictates of the BarbadosProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Developmentof Small Island Developing States  the MauritiusStrategy for its further implementation  and theIstanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020  and seek thecooperation of development partners to provide  in atimely and predictable manner  financial and technicalsupport to ensure their successful implementation.We have repeatedly called on developed andemerging countries and their partners to take aleadership role in reducing their greenhouse-gasemissions and to help small and poor countries likeTuvalu in their mitigation and adaptation activities.Tuvalu’s security and nationhood are continuously beingthreatened by the adverse impact of climate change especially by sea-level rise. Much has been said anddocumented on the root causes of climate change andits negative consequences for many countries  not justthe most vulnerable small island States like Tuvalu. Yetthe ongoing global pleas to address such consequenceshave so far fallen on ignorant  if not deaf  ears.Our smallness and lack of natural endowments  aswell as being only four metres above sea level  leaveus extremely vulnerable to natural shocks  particularlyto the effects of climate change and sea-level rise. Asis well known  sea-level rise and f looding threatenTuvalu’s limited agricultural production  underminefood security  and increase our vulnerability to supplydisruptions. We therefore support advances and urgeperseverance with the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocolas the primary international  intergovernmental forumfor negotiating the global response to climate changein order to give substance to international agreements.As a sea-locked country  we in the Pacific haveoffered the resources of our vast oceans to be utilizedby developed countries. We ask the partner countriesto be more responsible and to reward us as guardianswith the appropriate compensations that are conduciveto our development needs  as well as environmentallyrecompensing. Domestically  Tuvalu is pursuing energyefficiencies  development strategies and goals that areboth green or blue and sustainable. We have challengedourselves to be 100 per cent renewable in 2020 in ourenergy sector. We could miss the mark  but we will notbe comforted by remaining inactive  be it in our visionor in our action. We have asked developed countries toreduce carbon emissions; we will do the same at home regardless of scale contrasts.With the advent of technology  Tuvalu seeksthe donors’ assistance in realizing their pledges toestablish early-warning systems pertaining to tsunamisor tropical cyclones in order to mitigate any risk and subsequent cost to Tuvalu. Tuvalu wishes also to offerits established trust fund protocols to the United Nationsand development partners’ funding mechanisms forclimate change adaptation as innovative financinginstruments and architecture for channelling suchresources to Tuvalu. Our trust funds are governed byinternational agreements and renowned worldwide astransparent and accountable mechanisms with highinternational standards of accounting and governance.Many suggestions for enhancing the role of theUnited Nations have been documented. We alsocontinue to hear from the experts and technicaladvisers of the development of alternative energydrives and technologies  be they solar  wind or wave.In our region  and I believe in many other remote areas we ask how we can get those new technologies to bereadily available and price-effective to the membershipof the United Nations  especially LDCs and SIDS. Wetherefore urge the United Nations and the Secretariat toact as facilitators of such developments and to expeditetechnology transfers  where appropriate  to bring ourmany words and resolutions to fruition.Our collective and global efforts to have peaceand security as a prerequisite for the stability neededfor global economic growth  sustainable developmentand social progress will be meaningless if the UnitedNations continues not to recognize and acknowledgeTaiwan’s significant contribution and efforts towardsthe East China Sea peace initiative for regionalstability and peace. Furthermore  Taiwan’s continuedcontribution to the international community as one ofthe committed development partners and responsiblestakeholders in achieving the Millennium DevelopmentGoals should be recognized and accepted by theUnited Nations system as a valuable contribution toour collective efforts. In that regard  Tuvalu callsupon the United Nations subsidiary bodies  especiallythe International Civil Aviation Organization and theUnited Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange  to recognize and allow Taiwan to participatein and contribute meaningfully to their meetings andactivities without reservations.Incidentally  any legitimate claim for newnationhood or independence  be it in the Pacific regionor the world over  should be supported  as colonialismin any form is contradictory to the United NationsCharter  just as any form of discrimination by race gender or belief is not accepted in a civilized  modernand free world. I conclude by asking that the United Nationscontinue to cooperate in an unprecedented way.The United Nations must work together moreenterprisingly and reform our strategies to conformto new developments  contemporary innovations andissues. Holding and hosting meeting after meeting isa good engagement strategy and directs our activities.However  delaying the implementation of resolutions isdetrimental  as resolution after resolution is shelved ordeferred until they are redundant. The United NationsCharter  I believe  is premised on timely actions andachievements to gauge whether we are effective andsustainable or merely validating our inactivity.I wish the President  the Secretary-General andall our membership every success in the sixty-seventhsession of the General Assembly."
"178",7079,"TZA",67,2012,"﻿At theoutset  allow me to convey the fraternal greetings ofHis Excellency Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete  Presidentof the United Republic of Tanzania  who could notattend this session of the General Assembly due toother equally important engagements.On behalf of the Government and people of theUnited Republic of Tanzania  I wish to congratulateMr. Jeremić on his well-deserved election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Itis indeed a pleasure for me to participate in the generaldebate under his presidency. Similarly  I congratulate hispredecessor and commend him on the manner in whichhe steered the work of the sixty-sixth session. It wouldbe remiss of me not to acknowledge and commend theSecretary-General and the entire Secretariat on theirservice to the Organization.Echoing the President’s words during the openingof the session  we meet here amid upheavals ofunprecedented scope  characterized by multiple intra-and inter-State conflicts in the world and a time ofemerging and worsening conflicts  most of whichare taking place in Africa and the Middle East (seeA/67/PV.1). Those conflicts have caused the deathsand suffering of millions of people  including children women and the elderly. Undoubtedly  a new world orderof lasting peace  security and freedom  as envisaged inthe United Nations Charter  can be achieved throughdialogue and reconciliation.We applaud the fact that the theme of this generaldebate is “Adjustment or settlement of internationaldisputes or situations by peaceful means”. Similarly we welcome the many initiatives undertaken at thenational  regional and international levels in promotingthat matter.During the 50 years of the independence of theUnited Republic of Tanzania  we have witnessed andrespected the effectiveness of preventive diplomacy. Wehave participated in various mediation processes in theregion and on the continent  such as in Burundi  Côted’Ivoire  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Kenyaand Madagascar. The involvement of former Presidentsof Tanzania the late Mwalimu Julius KambarageNyerere and Benjamin William Mkapa  as well asHis Excellency Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete  President ofthe United Republic of Tanzania  in those processesis a clear testimony of our continued commitment topreventive diplomacy.We are all too aware of the dire consequencesof conflict  particularly when all the mechanismsprovided for under the Charter of the United Nationsto resolve conflicts fail to find a permanent solutionand to ensure lasting peace. The situation in Syria isa case in point. It is important that we find ways to strengthen early-warning mechanisms and to preventconflicts before they occur. In no case should wepursue actions that would encourage parties in conflictto resort to armed solutions instead of dialogue. Whilefacilitating dialogue  it is also important that we upholdthe principles of impartiality  objectivity and respect forinternational law. The unity of the entire membership iscrucial in ending impunity and human rights violations wherever they occur.The pacific settlement of disputes as provided underChapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations hasnever been so pertinent. In the interest of maintainingpeace and security  we should learn to keep ourdifferences aside and not allow them to create divisionsamong us. I believe the presidency of Mr. Vuk Jeremićwill guide us in that direction.Tanzania is the current Chair of the Southern AfricaDevelopment Community (SADC) Organ on Politics Defence and Security. We have taken up the mantle ofleadership of the Organ at a time when some countries ofthe region face security challenges. Under the umbrellaof SADC and the International Conference on the GreatLakes Region of Africa  we have resolved to find adurable solution to the crisis in the eastern part of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  where rebel groupssuch as the Mouvement du 23 mars are destabilizing andthreatening the peace and security of the entire region.Members of the International Conference on the GreatLakes Region have agreed to establish an internationalneutral force comprising 4 000 troops to address theproblem. Tanzania has committed to contribute troopsto the neutral force. Through the African Union (AU) we are taking the necessary steps to ensure that thedeployment of this international neutral force is doneunder the mandate of the United Nations.Likewise  Tanzania will work assiduously withother SADC member States to support the returnto constitutional normalcy in Madagascar and thefinalization of the drafting a new constitution inZimbabwe  which will open the way to democraticelections by June 2013. We proceed in that endeavourwith the firm belief that a solution in both countrieswill finally be achieved through the effective andconstructive engagement of all parties concerned.Twelve years ago  in the month of September we met in this very Hall to adopt the United NationsMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2)  which gavebirth to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).Three years from now  we will reach the deadline weagreed. We have undoubtedly made some progress onmany fronts  but most developing States are unlikely toachieve all the goals by the deadline of 2015.My country has also made progress in theachievement of the MDGs. It attained Goal 2  onuniversal primary education  back in 2009. It has alsoregistered considerable gains on Goal 3  on promotinggender equality and the empowerment of women  aswell as on Goal 6  on combating HIV/AIDS  malariaand other diseases. We have also achieved moderateresults on MDGs 4 and 5  dealing with infant andmaternal mortality  respectively. However  much moreremains to be done to emancipate our people from thetraps of poverty.Our goals to improve the livelihood of our peoplemust go beyond 2015. It is therefore necessary that weconsider the post-MDG agenda as one that complements instead of diverting our focus from the current MDGs.My delegation proposes a second generation of MDGs whereby all our efforts are directed to ensure thatMDGs are achieved post-2015 in those countries thatwill not have achieved them by 2015.At the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly President Kikwete expressed serious concern regardingglobal food insecurity (see A/66/PV.15). Since then the situation has worsened and the vulnerability ofmany developing countries has increased. We mustwork collectively to address food insecurity. Wemust increase food production and productivity ona sustainable basis  strengthen agricultural systems and establish early-warning mechanisms  as we alsomust develop effective responses to calamities suchas those in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel region.While ensuring food security  we need also to addressthe issue of nutrition. It is in that regard that Tanzania isa proud member of the Scaling Up Nutrition movement.At the national level  the Government is undertakingvarious initiatives to ensure food security throughpublic-private partnerships. My Government has hadthe pleasure of hosting the Africa Green RevolutionForum  in Arusha  which concluded today  with theparticipation of African leaders  ministers  privateagribusiness firms  financial institutions  farmers non-governmental organizations and agriculturalexperts. The Forum was organized by the Alliance fora Green Revolution in Africa.United Nations reforms are long overdue. TheUnited Nations is composed of its States Members without which there is no United Nations. If we MemberStates cannot agree on reforms then the United Nationswill never be reformed. It is a fact that we have had longdiscussions without reaching concrete agreements. Thetime has come to walk the talk.It is important to remind ourselves that Africa isthe largest regional group in the United Nations andthe only continent that is not represented among thepermanent seats on the Security Council. That situationequally overlooks the fact that most discussions in theSecurity Council concern Africa. We  African leadersand the African Union  have voiced our sentimentsand agreed to have two permanent seats with the vetopower. We will continue working together based on theagreed Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration to which we all subscribed. I therefore appeal to Africato maintain that momentum and solidarity.My country will continue to support reformof the United Nations  including the Delivering asOne initiative  which has been implemented withconsiderable success in Tanzania since 2007. TheGovernment will continue to support that process including its continuation in programme countries.The endorsement of that initiative by some membersof the Assembly is a clear testimony to the value ofthe approach. We believe that the 2012 quadrennialcomprehensive policy review will take into accountthose positive achievements.The United Nations is anchored in the principlesof human rights  the rule of law  good governance anddemocracy. We the Member States must implementwhat we deliberate and agree upon  otherwise thecredibility of the United Nations will be at stake. TheSecurity Council and the General Assembly haveadopted many resolutions on Palestinian independence.Tanzania applauds the admission of the PalestinianState to UNESCO. As we do so  Tanzania would likeonce again to appeal to the major Powers and donors inUNESCO to review their decision to punish UNESCOby withdrawing their contributions. That decisionimpacts more on developing countries  in particularAfrican countries  which draw on up to 65 per cent ofUNESCO funds in education  science and culture.With regard to Western Sahara  Tanzania callsupon the Secretary-General to continue his mediationefforts in bringing together the Government of Morocco and the leadership of Western Sahara to resolve thelongstanding crisis. In that regard  my delegationencourages Morocco to rejoin the AU so that togetherwe can find a durable solution on the independence ofWestern Sahara.Tanzania remains troubled by applications ofunilateral sanctions and embargos imposed againstCuba and its people. As President Kikwete said atthe previous session of the General Assembly (seeA/66/PV.15)  Tanzania is in full solidarity with thepeople of Cuba in demanding the end to all unilateralsanctions and embargos against them.We Member States have the duty and responsibilityto make the world a better place. We should maintain thesanctity of humankind before our ambitions and desires.In order to achieve that  we should recommit ourselvesto and uphold the objectives and principles containedin the Declaration on Principles of International Lawconcerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation amongStates in accordance with the Charter of the UnitedNations (resolution 2625 (XXV))."
"179",7122,"UGA",67,2012,"﻿Uganda joins otherdelegations in congratulating Mr. Jeremić on hiselection as President of this body. My delegation has fullconfidence in his ability to steer our deliberations  andhe can count on our support. I also wish to commendMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his effectiveleadership during the last session.The international community has made significantprogress in reducing conflicts around the world overthe two decades since the end of the Cold War andthe eventual freedom of South Africa from apartheid.However  we still face challenges arising from conflictsthat take a heavy toll on nations and people around theworld. The theme for this session’s debate is thereforetimely and pertinent. We are again seeing an increasein conflicts brought about by unconstitutional changesof Governments  disputed elections  social tensions extremist ideologies and territorial or border disputes among other causes. We must redouble our efforts toresolve conflicts and disputes through peaceful meansand in conformity with justice and international law  asenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.From Uganda’s experience over the years  conflictsare best handled  first and foremost  by the politicalactors and citizens of the countries in question following democratic principles and guided by theprinciple of equality of all persons before the law. Incases where national actors for some reason cannotresolve the problem  then subregional organizationsshould step in. In the case of Africa those include the EastAfrican Community  the Intergovernmental Authorityon Development  the International Conference on theGreat Lakes Region (ICGLR)  the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community  the Economic Communityof West African States and others. The United Nationsand the international community would then providethe necessary support to subregional and regionalinitiatives.Our recent achievements in the peace processes inBurundi  the Sudan  South Sudan and Somalia  amongothers  attest to the progress we can achieve by workingtogether. The advantages of such an approach includethe use of local actors who have more discerningknowledge of the problems and those in close proximityand with a greater stake in getting the problemsresolved. In addition  there is the international support and legitimacy that the United Nations provides. Thecurrent ICGLR initiative on the situation in the eastof the Democratic Republic of the Congo is based onsuch experience. We call upon the Security Counciland the international community to give the necessarysupport to the decisions of the ICGLR summit held inKampala on 8 September. That regional initiative isaimed at addressing the root causes of the conflict ineastern Congo  deploying a neutral international forceand responding to the humanitarian crisis.Our preference for home-grown solutions ispremised on the realization that external influencesor interventions do not necessarily offer sustainablesolutions for the resolution of conflicts. On the contrary external interventions often contribute to a cycle ofdestabilizing tendencies — which is why we are stillgrappling with situations like the one in eastern Congo.The African Union (AU) has shown strong politicalwill to resolve conflicts on the continent peacefully andto contribute to the maintenance of international peaceand security. We call upon our partners to support thedispute resolution mechanisms  as well as the peace andsecurity efforts of the AU and subregional organizations.Uganda’s participation in and contribution to conflictresolution in our subregion  on the African continentand on the international scene are guided by thatapproach  which has proved to be largely successful inresolving conflicts and wars.Regional initiatives need to be complemented byinternational support  including assisting countriesemerging from conflict to build the requisite capacitiesfor the consolidation of peace. It is also important thatsuch support include provision of immediate post-conflict humanitarian assistance and material inputfor reconstruction and development. We welcome thecontinuing deepening of cooperation between the UnitedNations and regional and subregional organizationsin the resolution of conflicts and the maintenance ofpeace and security. This positive trend should continue and every effort should be made to avoid repeating themistakes of the past.Uganda strongly believes that conflicts that mightarise between and within countries should be resolvedthrough dialogue among all the parties concerned. Inthe recent past we have witnessed regrettable instancesin which peace initiatives have been frustrated throughthe intransigence of the parties  with support from somemembers of the international community. That can only be a recipe for long-term turmoil and instability in theaffected countries and neighbouring regions.In our view  in situations of armed conflict thefirst priority should be securing a verifiable ceasefire followed by a political process involving an all-inclusivedialogue without preconditions. It is up to the parties with the assistance of a mediator or facilitator  to reacha settlement that addresses their interests.There is no doubt that resolving conflicts requiresidentifying and addressing their underlying causes which include social  political and economic factorsthat are often deeply entrenched and interwoven. Inseeking to resolve any conflict  national  regional andinternational actors need to adopt approaches that takeinto account the following complexities.First  it is important to address the substantive issuesthat give rise to conflicts in the first place  such as lackof access to or inequitable distribution of resources social or political exclusion and other grievances.The linkage between development and security inpeacebuilding is now widely recognized  and onceconflicts are resolved  the affected communities needpeace dividends in terms of delivery of basic servicessuch as health and education as well as opportunitiesfor employment.Secondly  efforts should be made to defuse the fear hatred and other negative emotions that make conflictsintractable and often violent. We must collectivelyspeak out against intolerance and extremism in orderto advance mutual respect and understanding of thevalues and beliefs of others. Uganda condemns all actsof terrorism and violence. We strongly condemn therecent spate of violence and attacks  including targetingdiplomatic missions of the United States and otherMember States.Thirdly  political leaders and all actors needto forge national reconciliation  including throughtransitional justice mechanisms  as well as establishingtruth and reconciliation mechanisms  which play a keyrole in promoting durable peace. We would also liketo reiterate the need to increase the role of women andyouth in the peaceful settlement of disputes  given thesignificant contribution they can make.On the Israeli-Palestinian question  Ugandacontinues to call upon both parties to negotiate andreach a peaceful settlement based on a two-Statesolution  with a Palestinian State living side by sidewith Israel in peace  security and mutual recognition.Finally  we affirm our commitment to the peacefulsettlement of conflicts and to fostering internationalcooperation based on the principles of sovereignequality  justice and adherence to international law."
"180",7169,"UKR",67,2012,"﻿On behalf ofUkraine  I sincerely congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić onhis election as President of the General Assembly at itssixty-seventh session. I wish him every success in thepost and hope that all his actions bear fruit.The theme of this year’s debate  “Bringing aboutadjustment or settlement of international disputes orsituations by peaceful means”  is always a pressingone. That imperative was enshrined in the Charter ofthe United Nations by its founding members  includingUkraine. I am convinced that the fundamental principleof the peaceful settlement of disputes remains todaythe cornerstone of the modern system of internationalrelations. It is the underlying mission of our Organizationand the immediate duty of every Member State.Today  we are closely watching the situation inSyria  which remains extremely alarming. Ukraineshares the deep concern of the international communityregarding the escalation of violence in that country. Wecall on all relevant parties to make every effort to settlethe conflict on the basis of respect for the principles ofthe Charter of the United Nations and the universallyrecognized principles of international law.The people of Ukraine have never been and willnever be indifferent to human suffering. We make nodistinction between our grief and that of others. Lastyear  thanks to Ukraine’s humanitarian mission toLibya  people of many nationalities  mostly women andchildren  were evacuated and saved from hostilities. Inreferring to that case  we are speaking not just aboutone action but about Ukraine’s resolute intention to useits capabilities to protect civilian populations in hotspots.That is why this year  when the situation in Syriadeteriorated  we immediately evacuated the first groupof Ukrainian and Polish citizens who had stated theirintention to return home. Let me assure the Assemblythat any Ukrainian aircraft and ships available forevacuation purposes in hot spots will always be atthe disposal of those in need of help  regardless oftheir nationality. Ukraine has approved a decision toextend humanitarian assistance using United Nationsmechanisms to Syria’s internally displaced persons andrefugees. I am confident that through the joint efforts ofthe international community we will manage to ensurethe safety of the civilian population in Syria. I believein international solidarity in that regard.Recently  on 11 September  we witnessed thetragic attack on the United States consulate in Libya.Ukraine roundly condemns any act of violence againstdiplomatic missions and their personnel.For many years  Ukraine has actively supportedthe expansion of preventive diplomacy in internationalrelations  with  of course  the leading role played bythe United Nations. Guided by that approach  Ukraineinitiated a dialogue in the Human Rights Council on theprevention of human rights violations  in particular byinitiating a relevant thematic resolution.Mr. Kanda (Ghana)  Vice-President  took the Chair.Ensuring early conflict prevention was amongthe key elements stressed by Ukraine during its firstmembership in the Security Council as an independentState  in 2000-2001. We also are conducting relevantwork in the Peacebuilding Commission. The same goalfeatures among the priorities of Ukraine’s chairmanshipof the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope (OSCE) in 2013.We intend  during our OSCE chairmanship  tomake every effort to strengthen security in our regionand to consolidate the democratic institutions ofMember States. We will also promote the enhancementof the OSCE’s efficiency as a regional organization in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter of theUnited Nations. We will also underscore the need fornew impetus to be given to the resolution of protractedconflicts in Europe and to address new threats andchallenges to security  in particular energy security.We will strive to increase OSCE efficiency in earlyconflict prevention. The Ukrainian chairmanship willactively contribute to the deepening of international  cooperation and dialogue so as to maintain stability resolve crisis situations and ensure post-conflictreconstruction. We will devote special attention tonegotiations on the Transdniestria conflict; Ukrainehas for many years actively participated in efforts tosettle that conflict.We will promote in every possible way the NagornoKarabakh settlement process  as well as the Genevadiscussions on security and stability in the Caucasus.I would like to stress that Ukraine  as a non-blocState  cannot but be concerned with the erosion ofthe Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.We consider that international legal document to bea cornerstone of stability on the continent and thattherefore States parties should make every effort toensure its fully fledged and efficient application.Ukraine  in the framework of its OSCEchairmanship  will therefore pay special attention tothe resolution of the crisis surrounding that Treaty.Peaceful settlement and conflict prevention will be thefoundation and the starting point of Ukraine’s activitiesif it is elected to non-permanent membership in theSecurity Council for 2016-2017.At the beginning of this year  Secretary-GeneralBan Ki-moon made public a five-year Action Agendafor the Organization. We fully support the prioritiesidentified in the agenda and consider them a road mapfor United Nations activities in the near future.We are currently going through a period ofunprecedented change. Unfortunately  and especiallyin view of the world crisis  there are global tendenciestowards the stagnation of economic development growing poverty and social inequality  and increasinginstability in certain States and regions.It stands to reason that the only way to effectivelycounteract those threats is for the internationalcommunity to deploy joint efforts. In that regard  wedeem it especially advisable to increase the efficiencyof international cooperation among security and law-enforcement agencies  develop best practices foraddressing new challenges and threats  and introducereliable confidence-building measures.It should be noted that this year’s United NationsConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) leftopen a number of issues  given the close interconnectionof the environmental and socioeconomic aspects ofmodern life. However  we view the Rio+20 Conference as an important milestone in the development ofinternational cooperation under the auspices of theUnited Nations in that sphere. The outcome documentof the Conference has proved the ability of countriesof different political and economic weights to reach acompromise  even in today’s difficult times.We support the complex approach that has beeninitiated in connection with sustainable energy forall  sustainable consumption and production  theelimination of hunger  and ensuring urban infrastructuredevelopment.Ukraine welcomes the decision of the Conferenceto consolidate the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme with a view to a system-based managementof the whole complex spectrum of environmentalproblems.We deeply appreciate the establishment of a high-level political forum on sustainable development andthe creation of an intergovernmental working groupthat will chart post-2015 sustainable developmentgoals. That theme is of special interest for Ukraine as demonstrated by the voluntary presentation ofUkraine’s national achievements with respect to theMillennium Development Goals  which took placeat the Economic and Social Council in July. I availmyself of this opportunity to assure the Assembly thatparticipation in the sustainable development efforts ofthe United Nations will remain Ukraine’s unwaveringpriority.Global  man-made climate change represents athreat on a planetary scale. Therefore  we considerefforts to counteract that challenge to be a priority taskfor humankind as a whole. Let me note that Ukrainehas voluntarily acceded to the second commitmentperiod of the Kyoto Protocol  undertaking to reduceits greenhouse-gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020.Bearing that in mind  Ukraine will also promotediscussions  in the framework of its future OSCEchairmanship  on the environmental impact of energy-related man-made activity  energy efficiency and theuse of renewable energy sources.Turning to international security problems  Ishould like to stress that Ukraine is deeply committedto the cause of bringing about a safer and more secureworld. That commitment emanates from the nationalconscience of the people of Ukraine  who haveexperienced the scourge of war  totalitarianism andartificial famines  as well as the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster  the largest man-made disaster inhuman history.Therefore  Ukraine’s aspiration to save the worldfrom tragedies similar to those that we have experiencedstems from the very hearts of the Ukrainians people.During the more than two decades of its independence Ukraine has been a steadfast supporter of globalnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. We havevoluntarily renounced the third-largest nuclear arsenalin the world; we kept our word this year and completedthe removal of the last stocks of highly enricheduranium from our country.I consider those important steps  as well asthe Kyiv Summit on the Safe and Innovative Useof Nuclear Energy  held last year  to be examplesworthy of following. I also view in that light the jointdeclaration by Ukraine  Mexico and Chile — countriesthat have made special efforts to neutralize the risksof the exploitation of highly enriched uranium. Thedeclaration remains open for signing. Unfortunately the ambitious goal of the gradual complete liquidationof nuclear weapons remains unachieved.In that regard  we insist that the security guaranteesfor States that have renounced their nuclear stockpilesand made other strategic concessions should bereflected in internationally binding legal instruments.This year Ukraine marked the twentieth anniversaryof its participation in United Nations peacekeepingoperations.I am truly proud of the contribution of the sons anddaughters of Ukraine — servicemen  law enforcementofficers and civilian personnel who have served andcontinue to serve the noble ideals of peace under theUnited Nations f lag. During these years  over 34 000Ukrainians have performed noble peacekeepingmissions in over 20 international operations under theUnited Nations mandate  from Guatemala to Timor-Leste  from Croatia to Mozambique. The experiencethey have acquired gives Ukraine the right to speakabout achievements and advantages  as well asabout problematic issues in modern United Nationspeacekeeping operations. The latter include thethreatening situation related to air mobility and legalgaps in investigations of crimes committed against BlueHelmets. I count on the continued support of Ukraine’sinitiatives aimed at resolving the current problemsfacing United Nations peacekeeping operations.Ukraine welcomes the successful completion of theGeneral Assembly’s High-level Meeting on the rule oflaw that took place here in New York on 24 September.At the Meeting  Ukraine announced the politicalobligations that we will fulfil consistently. We arecertain that international efforts to ensure the rule oflaw should remain centred around the United Nations.At the same time  relevant internationalorganizations should continue to play an important rolein that sphere. For Ukraine  such an organization wouldbe the Council of Europe and its Venice Commissionin particular. Our close cooperation with the Counciland the Commission has assisted us in making steadyreforms to ensure the rule of law and thereby realizeour aspirations to European integration. That processis actively promoted by Ukraine’s ConstitutionalAssembly  a special political institution established tofind a nationwide consensus on the provisions of thebasic law. In the course of constructing and developingUkraine’s Constitution  we will study and take intoaccount best practices from other countries.I am deeply confident that global advances in each ofthe crucial areas I have mentioned would be impossiblewithout a United Nations that is more efficient  viableand updated to the realities of the twenty-first century.The key here is to deepen United Nations reform and primarily that of the Security Council. Ukraine’sposition is well known. We are ready to discuss allprogressive concepts of Security Council reformcapable of achieving the broadest possible consensusamong States Members of the United Nations. Thelatter invariably make allowances for the legitimaterequirements of all regional groups  in particular thoseof Eastern Europe.Only the United Nations is up to the task ofstrengthening humankind to face contemporarychallenges. The united will of all 193 Member Statesrepresents an overwhelming force capable of copingwith the most complicated global crises. We muststrengthen and preserve our unity. I believe that thesixty-seventh session of the General Assembly will beconducive to that noble goal."
"181",7216,"URY",67,2012,"﻿Onbehalf of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay  I wouldlike to congratulate my friend Ambassador VukJeremić on his election to preside over the work of theGeneral Assembly during its sixty-seventh session. Hisexperience  competence and reliability will be crucialin ensuring that the most representative body of theUnited Nations effectively fulfils its duties. We assurehim of the full support of Uruguay.The focus of the General Assembly this yearon the promotion of the rule of law at national andinternational levels is extremely relevant  and I takethis opportunity to welcome the declaration adoptedby the General Assembly on Monday on that matter(resolution 67/1). Respect for and promotion of the ruleof law at the national and international levels are twosides of the same coin  which has the well-being of theindividual as its raison d’étre. It means also that neitherindividuals nor States are above the law  but are subjectto it. Uruguay considers rule of law a constitutive elementof the social contract that sustains its democratic systemand that stands out as a pillar of its foreign policy. Itis important to stress that this was not motivated byforeign influence  nor did it come through the adoptionof an abstract political model from outside. Rather  itwas the result of a profound internal process of buildingand organizing the free coexistence of our people.The principle of juridical equality of States like equality among individual people  is one ofthe fundamental principles of our Organization guaranteeing to all the same right to participate inthe responsibilities of the international community independent of the power possessed by each nation. Itis precisely in respect of this principle that our countryrejects any coercive unilateral or extraterritorialmeasure that contravenes the rules of international lawand the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.The clearest contemporary example of such a measureis the embargo unfairly set against the Republic ofCuba.The principle of the self-determination ofpeoples — understood as a collective right that must beobserved in a manner analogous to respect for freedomof the individual at the domestic level — is also anessential pillar of the rule of law. That freedom  whichincludes freedom of expression and other fundamentalfreedoms  is closely related to the effective operation ofdemocratic institutions.In that respect  and without prejudice to reaffirmingthat any attempt at the partial or total disruption of thenational unity or territorial integrity of a country isincompatible with the purposes and principles of theCharter of the United Nations  Uruguay has alwaysdefended the right to self-determination of peoplesas a key principle for the international coexistenceof States. It reiterates its desire for a peaceful  just sustainable and mutually accepted solution of thequestion of Western Sahara  based on international lawand resolutions of the General Assembly and SecurityCouncil and respectful of the human rights and the willof the Saharan people.An independent judicial system  to which allpersons have access on the basis of the principle ofequality before the law  is necessary for the genuinerule of law. Projecting this concept of the State andof the law beyond our borders is a vocation for peaceand the peaceful settlement of disputes  of which mycountry was an early promoter. My country showed its firm commitment to those values and principlesalready at the Hague Conference of 1907  where it triedto introduce compulsory international arbitration  andalso in 1921  when it became the first country to legallyaccept the compulsory jurisdiction of the PermanentCourt of International Justice  under only the conditionof reciprocity.The strenuous efforts of the internationalcommunity to build a fair system and to achieve greaterbalance among countries and greater well-being fortheir societies have not yet achieved the necessaryethical and policy solutions.Recently we have seen what appears to be an eraof change in some regions of the world. Peoples areseeking their freedom with the means they have athand  with a legitimate desire to achieve democracyand greater well-being. Political actions of peoplesseeking new alternatives of power have come upagainst those who are better organized politically andwho thus will prevail  as they have always prevailed.Those who have now assumed power must be aware oftheir responsibilities towards those peoples.Eradicating tyranny  consolidating peace andmaking social benefits available to everyone areenormous challenges. The task is to build realdemocracies  and to build them with all of thecontradictions  differences and difficulties that existwithin a society.Even in our region we have received threats with amajor ideological component. The attempted coup d’étatin Ecuador and the breakdown of the democratic orderin Paraguay have shown that Governments of changehave been affected in the development of their policies.The rule of law and democracy are not acquired values;rather  they must be defended each day as preciousgoods.Recent events such as what happened in Paraguaydemonstrate that the rule of law is still threatened andthat despite progress in terms of democratic institutionsin all our nations  threats to the full exercise offundamental rights and democratic values persist.That represents a great challenge to our aspirationto strengthen the integration and development of ourcountries  making the defence of the rule of law andthe democratic order a necessary and unavoidablecondition.Despite the great changes that have afflictedhumanity  the international system continues to work hard  yet it does not resolve the problems  or resolvesthem unfairly. It has been unable to create equalfinancial or commercial opportunities. Even today  itis not a priority to invest in countries’ human resourcesaccording to their specific needs. The political systemhas acted to control or decide political destinies  ratherthan to ensure the security or well-being of the people.Those who suffered before are suffering now. Powerfulcountries still threaten or intervene in other countries.We have written about values and principles andhave incorporated them in our constitutions. We havepreached in many ways about what is good for everyone.But we have not succeeded in meeting the basic needsof billions of poor people  nor have we guaranteedthem programmes for health  education  housing oremployment.The basis of social justice has not changed. It ispeace  it is freedom  because without that we cannot beactively aware of noble causes that require that one notbe dominated or oppressed — and without that  there isnothing. It is dignified housing that protects a family work with dignity at a fair wage  the right to educationand the responsibility of each individual. It is the healthcare that can save the 7 million children under 5 yearsof age who die each year around the world and thatcares for the elderly  for women and for the destitute.What is truly revolutionary is to change theconditions of life for those who cannot fully enjoy theirrights  because our political ideal must be  essentially the human dimension. The solution requires that thesystem provide each person the greatest guarantees ofhis political rights and that it be fair with regard to theobligations and responsibilities in that respect.The greatest freedom implies the greatestresponsibility. Each person  as both an individualand part of the community  must receive  possess andenjoy the rights that are fundamental to ensuring thewell-being of all as a way to transform solutions intoreality. The struggle for transformation determinesthe struggle of each person to find a solution for hisproblems. Resolving the issues inherent in poverty lack of freedom or impediments to the enjoyment ofeconomic  social and cultural rights requires concrete urgent and immediate action.Almost 200 years ago  someone declared thatthe most unfortunate would be the most privileged.His thinking was truly revolutionary  but there wassomething in it even more revolutionary  because he took on the task of orchestrating and executingthe changes that would provoke the redistribution ofresources. He took his solutions to the most needy:widows with children  children  and poor blacks zambos and creoles.Development requires change. The present day hasgiven us  as a fundamental condition of our projects insoluble problems such as poverty  malnutrition overcrowding  unemployment  child mortality andother socioeconomic scourges that still afflict most ofhumanity. Therefore  this system requires a change and the only way to carry it out is to transform reality.Our responsibilities as a community of nationscannot be avoided  as some of those problems occur asa natural result of the conditions and characteristics ofrelations among States. The international context tendsto concentrate wealth  efficiency and competitivenessand has no mechanisms to redistribute the resources ina fair and efficient manner that would provide a roof toevery homeless person  a plate of food to every hungryperson or break the chains of the oppressed. Theinternational system is based on the struggle of nationalinterests for a more powerful position  and that meansthat the concentration of power becomes ever greater.Everyone is aware that countries such as oursoperate within highly competitive international markets that we do not determine prices  that commodity pricesf luctuate thus altering our national export matrix  andthat we are exposed to successive financial crises.Continuing with this line of thought  it is essential toprioritize Uruguay’s involvement in the internationalcommunity  integrating international aspects of thecountry’s issues in the areas of agriculture  industry commercialization and financing  all with the purposeof eliminating poverty  achieving social justice andfirmly establishing primary education. Among otherthings  this requires reducing or eliminating thedistortions that pose obstacles to commercial exchange particularly agriculture subsidies  internal supports andother protectionist measures that prevent internationaltrade from becoming a factor that contributes to solvingthe financial crisis that is currently affecting the globaleconomy.Economic and social development requires thestability and predictability that the rule of law ensures.The United Nations has grasped that reality  and it isencouraging to see that strengthening the rule of law and the institutions whose job it is to implement that rule of law  is central to the tasks of the Organization’svarious peacekeeping  peacebuilding and specialpolitical missions  including the United NationsStabilization Mission in Haiti  to which Uruguay is aprincipal contributor.Our historical belief that a national society must beruled by law means that we believe that the communityof sovereign nations should regulate itself in conformitywith international law. In that context  it is Uruguay’shope that the international community can takeeffective steps towards eliminating nuclear weaponsand focus its efforts on eliminating this terrible threatstill hanging over humankind. Similarly  we call forredoubled efforts to enable us finally to conclude atreaty regulating the arms trade  which has a seriousimpact on Latin American and Caribbean countries andother developing regions of the world.Regarding the promotion and protection of humanrights  Uruguay’s coordination with the internationalsystem has reached a very high level. Our country isparty to all legal instruments relating to human rightsand international humanitarian law. It offers an openinvitation to all universal and inter-American specialprocedures to visit the country and recognizes thebinding jurisdiction of all monitoring committees forreceiving individual complaints and communications.At the same time  Uruguay has expressed its preferencefor establishing international jurisdictional bodiesand institutions. Our country’s longtime goal in thisarea was realized at the regional level through theestablishment in 1969 of the Inter-American Court ofHuman Rights under the San José de Costa Rica Pact.Uruguay has been a member of the Human RightsCouncil since its creation in 2006 and is its Presidentfor the period 2011-2012. During our mandate  wehave advocated for a new culture of dialogue  for theprogressive and incremental utilization of specialprocedures and other instruments for action beforeresorting to coercive or confrontational measures  fora two-way cooperative model between States and theUnited Nations system  for greater regional coordinationand for the importance of civil society’s participation.We have promptly  clearly and constructively expressedour position on situations involving serious violationsof human rights  ethnic cleansing  crimes againsthumanity and war crimes.Uruguay has been a party to the Rome Statute since2002 and has enacted a law that can be seen as a modelof cooperation with the International Criminal Court. Seven years ago  when the Assembly wasconsidering the concept of the responsibility to protect we committed to ending mass atrocities  giving priorityto prevention and aiding States that so requested tocomply fully with their responsibilities to protect theirpeoples from such scourges and to respond speedilyand decisively in accordance with the provisions of theUnited Nations Charter.We firmly condemn the serious violations ofhuman rights that are taking place in Syria. Thesituation has deteriorated and the suffering of thecivilian population has become intolerable. We supportthe work of the independent international commissionof inquiry established by the Human Rights Council which in its most recent report (A/HRC/21/50) statesthat there is reason to believe that Government forcesare committing crimes against humanity. All violencein Syria must cease immediately; it is essential thatwe establish a process of dialogue aimed at reaching apeaceful solution. Uruguay supports the mediator roleof the United Nations within a framework of a strictrespect for international law and the principles of theCharter. The protection of civilians is a multifacetedtask  of which the most sensitive and important aspectis protecting those facing imminent danger of physicalviolence.Through its firm commitment to peacekeepingoperations  Uruguay has played and will continue to playa proactive and constructive role both at Headquartersand on the ground. Nevertheless  we must make greaterefforts and work for better coherence among all theactors involved in order to eliminate or minimize asfar as possible the numbers of civilian victims of armedconflicts.Human rights are universal  interdependent andindivisible. Ensuring that they are enforced  protectedand promoted is possible only through a firmlyestablished rule of law and well-functioning democraticinstitutions  democracy  good governance and a moreeffective multilateral system.It is essential that the United Nations adapt toglobal challenges  guarantee its presence on the groundand respond to all the challenges faced by developingcountries in accordance with their priorities andneeds. It is thus imperative that development processesemphasize one of the greatest threats to the rule oflaw and democracy — poverty  particularly extremepoverty  which causes instability and insecurity. Our country has given absolute priority to combating thatscourge purposefully and head on. In the past yearalone  Uruguay was able to reduce the percentage ofpeople living in poverty from 18.6 to 13.7 per cent  andof those in extreme poverty from 1.1 to 0.5 per cent.Combating the adverse effects of climate change  a keychallenge to achieving sustainable development  is alsoone of our priorities.Now more than ever  we must revitalize our globalalliance for development and increase internationalcooperation.Finally  if the strength and sustainability of therule of law at the national level depend on the activeparticipation of citizens in defending the standardsthat ensure every society’s continued coexistence anddevelopment  at the international level it requires fullcompliance with the principles of international law andthe provisions of the Charter of the United Nations andstrong commitment to the causes of peace  the peacefulsettlement of disputes and multilateralism. That is themain goal that Uruguay has pursued during the processof building the United Nations  both as a foundingMember and through its participation in the activitiesof the General Assembly. It is our ambition to continuethose efforts from within the Security Council shouldour country be elected  as we hope  to that body as anon-permanent member for the period 2016-2017."
"182",7263,"USA",67,2012,"﻿I would like to begin today bytelling the Assembly about an American named ChrisStevens. Chris was born in a town called Grass Valley California  the son of a lawyer and a musician. As ayoung man  Chris joined the Peace Corps and taught English in Morocco  and he came to love and respectthe people of North Africa and the Middle East. Hewould carry that commitment throughout his life.As a diplomat  he worked from Egypt to Syria  fromSaudi Arabia to Libya. He was known for walking thestreets of the cities where he worked  tasting the localfood  meeting as many people as he could  speakingArabic  listening with a broad smile. Chris went toBenghazi  arriving on a cargo ship  in the early daysof the Libyan revolution. As America’s representative he helped the Libyan people as they coped with violentconflict  cared for the wounded and crafted a visionfor the future in which the rights of all Libyans wouldbe respected. After the revolution  he supported thebirth of a new democracy as Libyans held elections andbuilt new institutions and began to move forward afterdecades of dictatorship.Chris Stevens loved his work. He took pride in thecountry he served  and he saw dignity in the people thathe met.Two weeks ago  he travelled to Benghazi to reviewplans to establish a new cultural center and modernizea hospital. That is when America’s compound cameunder attack. Along with three of his colleagues  Chriswas killed in the city that he had helped to save. He was52 years old.I tell this story because Chris Stevens embodiedthe best of America. Like his fellow Foreign Serviceofficers  he built bridges across oceans and cultures andwas deeply invested in the international cooperationthat the United Nations represents. He acted withhumility  but he also stood up for a set of principles  abelief that individuals should be free to determine theirown destiny and live with liberty  dignity  justice andopportunity.The attacks on the American civilians in Benghaziwere attacks on America. We are grateful for theassistance we received from the Libyan Governmentand from the Libyan people. There should be no doubtthat we will be relentless in tracking down the killersand bringing them to justice. I also appreciate that in recent days  the leaders of other countries in theregion — including Egypt  Tunisia and Yemen — havetaken steps to secure our diplomatic facilities and calledfor calm. So have religious authorities around the globe.But it should be understood that the attacks of thelast two weeks are not simply an assault on America.They are also an assault on the very ideals upon whichthe United Nations was founded — the notion that peoplecan resolve their differences peacefully; that diplomacycan take the place of war  and that  in an interdependentworld  all of us have a stake in working towards greateropportunity and security for our citizens.If we are serious about upholding those ideals  itwill not be enough to put more guards in front of anEmbassy or to put out statements of regret and wait forthe outrage to pass. If we are serious about those ideals we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of thecrisis  because we face a choice between the forces thatwould drive us apart and the hopes we hold in common.Today  we must affirm that our future will bedetermined by people like Chris Stevens  and not byhis killers. Today  we must declare that such violenceand intolerance has no place among our United Nations.It has been less than two years since a vendor inTunisia set himself on fire to protest the oppressivecorruption in his country and sparked what becameknown as the Arab Spring. Since then  the world hasbeen captivated by the transformation that has takenplace  and the United States has supported the forcesof change.We were inspired by the Tunisian protests thattoppled a dictator  because we recognized our ownbeliefs in the aspirations of the men and women whotook to the streets.We supported change in Egypt  because oursupport for democracy ultimately put us on the side ofthe people.We welcomed a transition of leadership in Yemen because the interests of the people were no longer beingserved by a corrupt status quo.We intervened in Libya alongside a broad coalitionand with the mandate of the United Nations SecurityCouncil  because we had the ability to stop theslaughter of innocents and because we believed that theaspirations of the people were more powerful than atyrant.And as we meet here  we again declare that theregime of Bashar Al-Assad must come to an end  sothat the suffering of the Syrian people can stop and anew dawn can begin.We have taken those positions because we believethat freedom and self-determination are not unique to one culture. Those values are not simply Americanvalues or Western values — they are universal values.And even as there will be huge challenges that comewith a transition to democracy  I am convinced that ultimately  Government of the people  by the people andfor the people is more likely to bring about the stability prosperity and individual opportunity that serve as thebasis for peace in our world.So  let us remember that this is a season of progress.For the first time in decades  Tunisians  Egyptians andLibyans voted for new leaders in elections that werecredible  competitive and fair. That democratic spirithas not been restricted to the Arab world. Over the pastyear  we have seen peaceful transitions of power inMalawi and Senegal and a new President in Somalia.In Burma  a President has freed political prisoners andopened a closed society  a courageous dissident hasbeen elected to Parliament  and people look forward tofurther reform. Around the globe  people are makingtheir voices heard  insisting on their innate dignity andthe right to determine their future.And yet the turmoil of recent weeks reminds us thatthe path to democracy does not end with the castingof a ballot. Nelson Mandela once said  “To be free isnot merely to cast off one’s chains  but to live in a waythat respects and enhances the freedom of others”. Truedemocracy demands that citizens cannot be thrown injail because of what they believe and that businessescan be opened without paying a bribe. It depends on thefreedom of citizens to speak their minds and assemblewithout fear and on the rule of law and due process which guarantee the rights of all people.In other words  true democracy — real freedom — ishard work. Those in power have to resist the temptationto crack down on dissidents. In hard economic times countries may be tempted to rally the people aroundperceived enemies at home and abroad  rather thanfocusing on the painstaking work of reform.Moreover  there will always be those who rejecthuman progress — dictators who cling to power  corruptinterests that depend upon the status quo  and extremistswho fan the flames of hate and division. From NorthernIreland to South Asia  from Africa to the Americas from the Balkans to the Pacific Rim  we have witnessedconvulsions that can accompany transitions to a newpolitical order. At times  the conflicts arise along thefault lines of race or tribe  and often they arise from the difficulties of reconciling tradition and faith withthe diversity and interdependence of the modern world.In every country  there are those who find differentreligious beliefs threatening; in every culture  thosewho love freedom for themselves must ask themselveshow much they are willing to tolerate freedom forothers. That is what we saw play out in the last twoweeks  as a crude and disgusting video sparked outragethroughout the Muslim world. Now  I have made itclear that the United States Government had nothingto do with that video  and I believe its message mustbe rejected by all who respect our common humanity.It is an insult not only to Muslims  but to America aswell  for as the city outside these walls makes clear  weare a country that has welcomed people of every raceand every faith. We are home to Muslims  who worshipacross our country. We not only respect the freedomof religion  we have laws that protect individuals frombeing harmed because of how they look or what theybelieve. We understand why people take offence at thatvideo  because millions of our citizens are among thosepeople.I know there are some who ask why we do not justban such a video. And the answer is enshrined in ourlaws; our Constitution protects the right to practice freespeech. Here in the United States  countless publicationsprovoke offence. Like me  the majority of Americansare Christian  and yet we do not ban blasphemy againstour most sacred beliefs. As President of our countryand Commander-in-Chief of our military  I accept thatpeople are going to call me awful things every day  andI will always defend their right to do so.Americans have fought and died around the globeto protect the right of all people to express their views even views that we profoundly disagree with. We do notdo so because we support hateful speech  but becauseour founders understood that without such protections the capacity of individuals to express their own viewsand practise their own faith may be threatened. We doso because in a diverse society  efforts to restrict speechcan quickly become a tool to silence critics and oppressminorities. We do so because  given the power of faith inour lives and the passion that religious differences caninflame  the strongest weapon against hateful speechis not repression; it is more speech — the voices oftolerance that rally against bigotry and blasphemy  andlift up the values of understanding and mutual respect.I know that not all countries in this body sharethat particular understanding of the protection of freespeech. We recognize that. But in 2012  at a timewhen anyone with a cell phone can spread offensiveviews around the world with the click of a button  thenotion that we can control the f low of information isobsolete. The question then is how do we respond? Andon this we must agree: there is no speech that justifiesmindless violence. There are no words that excuse thekilling of innocents. There is no video that justifiesan attack on an embassy. There is no slander thatprovides an excuse for people to burn a restaurant inLebanon  or destroy a school in Tunis  or cause deathand destruction in Pakistan. In our modern world withmodern technologies  for us to respond in that way tohateful speech empowers any individual who engagesin such speech to create chaos around the world. Weempower the worst of us if that is how we respond.More broadly  the events of the past two weeks alsospeak to the need for all of us to honestly address thetensions between the West and the Arab world  whichis moving towards democracy. Now  let me be clear:just as we cannot solve every problem in the world  theUnited States has not and will not seek to dictate theoutcome of democratic transitions abroad. We do notexpect other nations to agree with us on every issue nor do we assume that the violence of the past weeks orthe hateful speech of some individuals represents theviews of the overwhelming majority of Muslims  anymore than the views of the people who produced thatvideo represent those of Americans.However  I do believe that it is the obligation of allleaders in all countries to speak out forcefully againstviolence and extremism. It is time to marginalize thosewho  even when not directly resorting to violence  usehatred of America  or the West  or Israel  as the centralorganizing principle of politics. For that only givescover  and sometimes provides an excuse  for those whodo resort to violence.That brand of politics  one that pits East againstWest  and South against North  Muslims againstChristians and Hindus and Jews  cannot deliver on thepromise of freedom. To young people  it offers onlyfalse hope. Burning an American f lag does nothing toprovide a child with an education. Smashing apart arestaurant does not fill an empty stomach. Attackingan embassy will not create a single job. That brand ofpolitics only makes it harder to achieve what we mustdo together  namely  to educate our children and create the opportunities that they deserve; protect humanrights and extend democracy’s promise.It should be understood that America will neverretreat from the world. We will bring to justice thosewho harm our citizens and our friends  and we willstand with our allies. We are willing to partner withcountries around the world to deepen ties of tradeand investment  science and technology  energy anddevelopment — all efforts that can spark economicgrowth for all our peoples and stabilize democraticchange.But such efforts depend on a spirit of mutualinterest and mutual respect. No Government orcompany  no school or non-governmental organizationwill be confident working in a country where its peopleare endangered. For partnerships to be effective our citizens must be secure and our efforts must bewelcomed. A politics based only on anger — one basedon dividing the world between us and them — notonly sets back international cooperation  it ultimatelyundermines those who tolerate it. All of us have aninterest in standing up to those forces.Let us remember that Muslims have suffered themost at the hands of extremism. On the same day thatour civilians were killed in Benghazi  a Turkish policeofficer was murdered in Istanbul only days before hiswedding; more than 10 Yemenis were killed in a carbomb in Sana’a; several Afghan children were mournedby their parents just days after they were killed bya suicide bomber in Kabul. The impulse towardsintolerance and violence may initially be focused on theWest  but over time it cannot be contained. The sameimpulses towards extremism are used to justify warbetween Sunni and Shia  between tribes and clans. Itleads not to strength and prosperity but to chaos. In lessthan two years  we have seen largely peaceful protestsbring more change to Muslim-majority countries thana decade of violence. And extremists understand this.Because they have nothing to offer to improve the livesof people  violence is their only way to stay relevant.They do not build; they only destroy.It is time to leave the call to violence and the politicsof division behind. On so many issues  we face a choicebetween the promise of the future or the prisons of thepast. And we cannot afford to get it wrong. We mustseize this moment. And America stands ready to workwith all who are willing to embrace a better future.The future must not belong to those who target Coptic Christians in Egypt; it must be claimed by those inTahrir Square who chanted  “Muslims  Christians  weare one.” The future must not belong to those who bullywomen; it must be shaped by girls who go to school and those who stand for a world where our daughterscan live their dreams just like our sons.The future must not belong to those corrupt fewwho steal a country’s resources; it must be won by thestudents and entrepreneurs  the workers and businessowners who seek a broader prosperity for all people.Those are the women and men that America standswith; theirs is the vision we will support.The future must not belong to those who slanderthe Prophet of Islam. But to be credible  those whocondemn that slander must also condemn the hate wesee in the images of Jesus Christ that are desecrated or churches that are destroyed  or the Holocaust that isdenied.Let us condemn incitement against Sufi Muslimsand Shia pilgrims. It is time to heed the words ofGandhi: “Intolerance is itself a form of violence andan obstacle to the growth of a true democratic spirit”.Together we must work towards a world where we arestrengthened by our differences  not defined by them.That is what America embodies; that is the vision thatwe will support.Among Israelis and Palestinians  the future mustnot belong to those who turn their backs on the prospectof peace. Let us leave behind those who thrive onconflict  those who reject the right of Israel to exist.The road is hard  but the destination is clear: a secure Jewish State of Israel and an independent  prosperousPalestine. Understanding that such a peace must comethrough a just agreement between the parties  Americawill walk alongside all who are prepared to make thatjourney.In Syria  the future must not belong to a dictatorwho massacres his people. If there is a cause that criesout for protest in the world today  peaceful protest  itis a regime that tortures children and shoots rocketsat apartment buildings. We must remain engaged toensure that what began with citizens demanding theirrights does not end in a cycle of sectarian violence.Together  we must stand with those Syrians whobelieve in a different vision: a Syria that is united andinclusive  where children do not need to fear their ownGovernment and all Syrians have a say in how they are governed  Sunnis and Alawites  Kurds and Christians.That is what America stands for. That is the outcomethat we will work for  with sanctions and consequencesfor those who persecute  and assistance and supportfor those who work for this common good  because webelieve that the Syrians who embrace this vision willhave the strength and the legitimacy to lead.In Iran  we see where the path of a violent andunaccountable ideology leads. The Iranian peoplehave a remarkable and ancient history  and manyIranians wish to enjoy peace and prosperity alongsidetheir neighbours. But just as it restricts the rights ofits own people  the Iranian Government continues toprop up a dictator in Damascus and supports terroristgroups abroad. Time and again  it has failed to take theopportunity to demonstrate that its nuclear programmeis peaceful and to meet its obligations to the UnitedNations.So let me be clear. America wants to resolve thisissue through diplomacy  and we believe that thereis still time and space to do so. But that time is notunlimited. We respect the right of nations to accesspeaceful nuclear power  but one of the purposes of theUnited Nations is to see that we harness that power forpeace. Make no mistake: a nuclear-armed Iran is not achallenge that can be contained. It would threaten theelimination of Israel  the security of Gulf nations andthe stability of the global economy. It risks triggeringa nuclear-arms race in the region and the unravellingof the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of NuclearWeapons. That is why a coalition of countries is holdingthe Iranian Government accountable  and that is whythe United States will do what we must to prevent Iranfrom obtaining a nuclear weapon.We know from painful experience that the pathto security and prosperity does not lie outside theboundaries of international law and respect for humanrights. That is why this institution was established  fromthe rubble of conflict. That is why liberty triumphedover tyranny in the cold war  and that is the lesson ofthe last two decades as well.History shows that peace and progress come tothose who make the right choices. Nations in every partof the world have travelled this difficult path. Europe the bloodiest battlefield of the twentieth century  isunited  free and at peace. From Brazil to South Africa from Turkey to South Korea  from India to Indonesia people of different races  religions and traditions have lifted millions out of poverty  while respecting therights of their citizens and meeting their responsibilitiesas nations.It is because of the progress that I have witnessedin my own lifetime  the progress that I have witnessedafter nearly four years as President  that I remain everhopeful about the world that we live in. The war inIraq is over. American troops have come home. Wehave begun a transition in Afghanistan  and Americaand our allies will end our war on schedule in 2014.Al-Qaida has been weakened  and Osama bin Ladenis no more. Nations have come together to lock downnuclear materials  and America and Russia are reducingour arsenals. We have seen hard choices made  fromNaypyidaw to Cairo to Abidjan  to put more power inthe hands of citizens.At a time of economic challenge  the worldhas come together to broaden prosperity. Throughthe Group of 20  we have partnered with emergingcountries to keep the world on the path of recovery.America has pursued a development agenda that fuelsgrowth and breaks dependency  and has worked withAfrican leaders to help them feed their nations. Newpartnerships have been forged to combat corruption andpromote government that is open and transparent  andnew commitments have been made through the EqualFutures Partnership to ensure that women and girls canfully participate in politics and pursue opportunity.Later today  I will discuss our efforts to combat thescourge of human trafficking.All those things give me hope. But what givesme the most hope is not the actions taken by us  notthe actions of leaders; it is the people that I haveseen — the American troops who have risked their livesand sacrificed their limbs for strangers half a worldaway  the students in Jakarta or Seoul who are eagerto use their knowledge to benefit mankind  the faces ina square in Prague or a parliament in Ghana who seedemocracy giving voice to their aspirations  the youngpeople in the favelas of Rio and the schools of Mumbaiwhose eyes shine with promise. Those men  women and children of every race and every faith remind methat for every angry mob that gets shown on television there are billions around the world who share similarhopes and dreams. They tell us that there is a commonheartbeat to humanity.So much attention in our world turns to whatdivides us. That is what we see on the news. That is what consumes our political debates. But when you stripit all away  people everywhere long for the freedom todetermine their destiny; the dignity that comes withwork; the comfort that comes with faith; and the justicethat exists when Governments serve their people andnot the other way around.The United States of America will always stand upfor these aspirations  for our own people and for peopleall across the world. That was our founding purpose.That is what our history shows. That is what ChrisStevens worked for throughout his life.I promise you this: long after the killers are broughtto justice  Chris Stevens’s legacy will live on in the livesthat he touched  in the tens of thousands who marchedagainst violence through the streets of Benghazi; in theLibyans who changed their Facebook photo to one ofChris; in the signs that read simply  “Chris Stevens wasa friend to all Libyans”. They should give us hope. Theyshould remind us that so long as we work for it justicewill be done  that history is on our side and that a risingtide of liberty will never be reversed."
"183",7285,"UZB",67,2012,"﻿Allow me very brief lyto address what are  in our opinion  some of the mostimportant items on the agenda of this session of theGeneral Assembly. First of all  today  in this centuryof globalization and rapidly changing situations andgrowing tensions and confrontations in many regionsof the world  we need to come up with unconventionaland extraordinary responses to crisis situations andwars that have been ongoing for many decades and aretherefore persistent features of our agenda.To our great regret  instead of seeking to deeplyunderstand emerging problems and confrontations inone region of the world or another and addressing themin a timely manner  finding their true origins or focusingthe international community on preventing them fromgrowing into large-scale crises and wars  the worldis letting its most precious resource — time — slipthrough its fingers. That leads  of course  to enormouscosts and the waste of other precious resources. Let meoffer a few examples.As early as in 1993  President Karimov of theRepublic of Uzbekistan  when he spoke before theforty-eighth session of the General Assembly (seeA/48/PV.6)  drew the international community’sattention to the need to immediately resolve the situationin Afghanistan  given the close connection betweenregional and global security  the need to respect the civiland religious rights of the people of Afghanistan and theneed to prevent the conflict from growing into a full-scale civil war. Otherwise the problems in Afghanistanwould turn into a painful and bitter issue of concernto the international community as a whole. Difficultproblems may resurface when the imminent withdrawalof the International Security Assistance Forces fromAfghanistan occurs by late 2014 and the responsibilityfor ensuring stability in the country is turned over tothe newly created Afghan National Security Forces. Itis obvious today that that turn of events may lead to astand-off between opposing forces in Afghanistan itselfand in neighbouring countries. It may also lead to thegrowth of extremism and radicalism  cause a surge in drug trafficking and aggravate tensions in the regionas whole.As the situation is unfolding  the best way toaddress the situation in Afghanistan is to establish acontact group under the auspices of the United Nationswith the participation of the country’s neighbours the United States  NATO and the Russian Federation.The principal goal of such efforts should be to reach acompromise and an agreement between the opposingforces and form a coalition Government on that basis.Such a coalition Government could be comprised ofthe core ethnic  national and religious groups involvedin the military and political stand-off taking place inAfghanistan.Uzbekistan has suggested that approach a numberof times  for example  at the NATO summits inBucharest in 2008 and in Chicago this year  as well asat the High-level Plenary Meeting on the MillenniumDevelopment Goals held in New York in 2010 (seeA/65/PV.3). The Republic of Uzbekistan has alwaysconducted  and will always maintain  a friendly  good-neighbourly policy towards its neighbour Afghanistan.Uzbekistan has built its relationship with Afghanistanon a bilateral basis  taking into account the nationalinterests of both countries and respecting the Afghanpeople’s choice in terms of the future of their country.Today  Uzbekistan offers comprehensive forms ofassistance to Afghanistan so that it may return onceagain to peace. Specifically  we have contributedto the construction of bridges  motorways and thestrategic Khairaton-Mazar-e-Sharif railroad link which connects Afghanistan with the States of CentralAsia  as well as providing an uninterrupted supplyof electricity to Kabul. Uzbekistan plays a key rolein ensuring the stable and effective operation of thenorthern distribution network.Secondly  climate change and the globaldeteriorating ecological situation have made ensuringthe reasonable and rational use of water resources themost acute problem of the modern world. Increasingshortages of fresh water  which is needed to providefood security and protect human life  serve to confirmthat assertion. In that connection  I would like topresent the Republic of Uzbekistan’s main approach toaddressing those issues  which are of vital importancefor all the States of Central Asia.We believe that all water and energy issues in ourregion  where the largest transboundary rivers — the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya — are the main sourcesof water and life for the millions of people residingnear them  should be addressed in accordance withthe universally recognized norms of international lawprovided for in the 1992 United Nations Convention onthe Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercoursesand International Lakes and the 1997 United NationsConvention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses ofInternational Watercourses.Those instruments require adherence to theprinciple of doing no harm to the environment or tothe interests of neighbouring States when exploiting theresources of transboundary rivers.It is therefore reasonable that Uzbekistan calls forthose principles and standards to be our guides in thesearch for mutually acceptable compromise decisionson water use. We believe that all hydropower facilityconstruction projects in the upper waters of the SyrDarya and Amu Darya basins should be evaluated byinternational experts under the auspices of the UnitedNations and agreed to by the downstream countries.Only after such agreement and coordination shouldconstruction begin on two proposed dams  whichare practically the largest in the world  namely  the350-metre-high Rogun hydropower station in the upperwaters of the Amu Darya and the 275-metre-highKambarata 1 station in the upper waters of the SyrDarya. Furthermore  that construction has to be carriedout in mountainous terrain where seismicity levels canreach 9 to 10 points on the Richter scale.To comply with international requirements  it isessential to set priorities for water use. The region’slimited water resources must first be used to meetdrinking and sanitary needs  and only after that toensure food security and to meet ecological demandsand the needs of the industry and power sectors.Thirdly  Uzbekistan remains committed topreserving peace  stability and security in the region.That principled position is stipulated in the Republic ofUzbekistan’s position paper on foreign policy activity formulated on the initiative of the Head of State ofUzbekistan. In particular  the document includes thefollowing important provisions.First  the Republic of Uzbekistan reserves the rightto enter into alliances  join commonwealths and otherinter-State establishments  as well as to leave them guided by the supreme interests of the State  the people their well-being and security  the priority guidelines for modernizing the country  existing national legislationand international obligations that have been assumed.The paper continues  stating that Uzbekistan maintainsa peace-loving policy  does not participate in military-political blocs  and reserves the right to leave anyinter-State body if the latter is transformed into amilitary-political bloc. Next  the Republic of Uzbekistanwill take political  economic and other measures toprevent its involvement in military conflicts or hotbedsof tension in adjacent States and will not allow thedeployment of foreign bases and facilities on its ownterritory. Next  the armed forces of the Republic ofUzbekistan will not participate in military operationsabroad. Finally  the main priority concern of the foreignpolicy of Uzbekistan is the region of Central Asia where the country’s crucial interests lie.The problems of Central Asia must be addressedby the countries of the region without interferencefrom external Powers. Uzbekistan remains committedto pursuing an open  friendly and pragmatic policytowards its immediate neighbours  and proceeds froma position that all outstanding political  economic andecological problems of the region should be addressedon the basis of the mutual consideration of interests constructive dialogue and the norms of internationallaw.We set great store by the United Nations as auniversal structure and the only worldwide  universallyaccepted body capable of ensuring security  stabilityand consistent development  including in our region.Uzbekistan stands ready to continue to cooperateeffectively with the Organization and its specializedbodies in order to achieve those high and noble goals."
"184",7298,"VAT",67,2012,"﻿As I congratulate the President on behalf of the HolySee on his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its sixty-seventh session  I have the honourof conveying warm greetings from His Holiness PopeBenedict XVI  who wishes for him and all members theblessings of all-powerful God.At a time when the world is witnessing a disturbingincrease in bloody regional conflicts  the Holy Seeis particularly pleased to note the central themethat has been chosen for the work of this session namely “Bringing about adjustment or settlement ofinternational disputes or situations by peaceful means”.Since the establishment of the United Nations  atight web of structured legal relationships has evolved covering virtually every aspect of the relations betweenStates and of life in the societies within States. Inthat regard  the Charter of the United Nations  themajor human rights treaties and the treaties governinghumanitarian law  along with the Vienna Conventionson the law of treaties and diplomatic law and the keyconventions on disarmament  may be viewed as a nearlyuniversal legal corpus that promotes social relationsbased on the law and that furthers durable peace.That is a historically unprecedented developmentand a genuine achievement of the United Nations; itstands as a credit to the United Nations and certainlyas one of its most successful achievements with respectto the aims enshrined in the Preamble and first Articleof the Charter.Over the course of the 67 years since theestablishment of the United Nations  the worldhas undergone profound transformation. Growingtechnical and economic interdependence  alongwith the exponential development of new forms ofcommunication  has led to the advent of what hascommonly been known  ever since the middle of thetwentieth century  as the global village: a diverse andcontinuously evolving village that has experiencedastonishing development but that has also seen terribleinjustice. In that regard  the labour of legal constructionundertaken by the United Nations is a worthy response that promotes the development of that global village  aresponse that deserves the continued and wholeheartedsupport of Governments and social organizations.Human history has always presented paradoxicalor conf lictive situations that have given rise tofrustration and feelings of injustice. Today  in acontext of generalized interdependence  the disparitybetween wealth and poverty is more pronounced andunacceptable than ever. The disorderly expansion oftechnical and economic progress has intensified the gapbetween those who have the education and the means toadvance and those who lack both. The multiple legaland economic ties that unite nations are not sufficientlyjust and equitable  and they have become a conveyorbelt for the serious economic and financial crisis  whichhas spread as quickly as a forest fire  affecting themost vulnerable first. For some of the world’s people resorting to crime and terrorism or waging war in thename of ideological  ethnic or cultural beliefs seems tobe the easiest  if not the only available way to escapepoverty and become the heroes of the global village.Such acts of violence are abetted by the perverse useof communications technology and by the excessivelyeasy access to the tools of war.If  in the 1990s  the state of legal and politicalprogress allowed us to believe that the danger of nuclearwar had receded  today the likelihood of regionalconflicts with unpredictable outcomes has once againcreated a threatening atmosphere that should impel usto intensify our efforts to establish a truly constructivedialogue within the international community.During the period of the Cold War  the UnitedNations was a meeting place and a point of discussionand balance between the opposing Powers. TheOrganization managed to support the decolonizationand independence of a large number of new States andto mitigate  and even at times resolve  regional  bilateraland civil conflicts in a context that was nonethelessmarked by severe ideological confrontation. At thesame time  United Nations agencies made an importantintellectual  political and judicial contribution to theuniversal recognition of human rights and strengthenedcooperation for development and regional economicintegration. Those advances constituted fundamentalprogress towards strengthening the rule of law  whichitself provides a favourable framework and is the bestguarantor of human rights and peaceful internationalcooperation. Allow me here to welcome the Declarationof the High-level Meeting of the GeneralAssembly on the Rule of Law at the National andInternational Levels (resolution 67/1)  which wasadopted at the beginning of this session. The 67years since the establishment of the United Nationsalso include a distinguished history of humanitarianinterventions  peacekeeping operations and  morerecently  peacebuilding operations. Also of specialimportance for the fate of humanity as a whole have beenthe adoption of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons and the activities of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency aimed at promoting universalaccession to the Treaty  controlling the implementationof the Treaty and facilitating international cooperationon the peaceful use of the atom.Over the past 20 years  the United Nations  togetherwith regional organizations  has made an essentialcontribution to resolving a number of urgent situations particularly in Africa  by collaborating with theAfrican Union and other institutions of that continent.Nonetheless  the current reality presents us with aUnited Nations system without the strength of unity andpersuasion that could legitimately be expected of it; asystem in which  unfortunately  power relationships areplayed out to the benefit of specific strategic interests.Yet the possibilities that emerged at the end of theCold War seemed to portend a possible strengtheningof the institutional and political presence of theUnited Nations in the service of world’s most criticalchallenges  such as climate change and the preservationof the environment. How is it possible that  despiteuniversal adhesion to the Charter of the United Nationsand the essential treaties  we are still unable to establisha just and true form of global governance?The Holy See would like to offer a moral answerto that question by calling attention to the importanceof the values that  of necessity  underlie all humansocieties. Indeed  before engaging in political ortechnical considerations  it is important to ask whetherthe crises currently convulsing the planet are linked toa crisis of trust in the collective values enshrined inthe very Charter of the United Nations. Moreover  thequestion arises whether the crises afflicting the planetare linked to a serious anthropological crisis  whichis to say the lack of a shared understanding of what itmeans to be human.Today we are witnessing a weakening in thepractical reach of the purposes and principles set out in the Preamble and Chapter I of the Charter.I note in particular saving succeeding generationsfrom the scourge of war  practicing tolerance witha spirit of good-neighbourliness  uniting strengthfor the maintenance of peace and security  recourseto peaceful means to settle disputes  in conformitywith the principles of justice and international law and cooperation to solve international problems of aneconomic  social  cultural or humanitarian characterand to promote and encourage respect for human rightsand for fundamental freedoms.The loss of trust in the value of dialogue and thetemptation to favour a priori one party in nationalor regional conflicts endanger respect for the legalmechanisms of the United Nations. However  thepre-eminence of the values affirmed by the Chartershould lead to the adoption of all means possible toguarantee the protection of the most vulnerable  upholdthe rule of law and human rights  and safeguard ancientcultural and religious balances.Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola)  Vice-President  took the Chair.The urgency of the situation is all the more obviousgiven the events taking place in the Middle East especially in Syria. There can be no solution outsidethe rules of international law and humanitarian lawand implementation of mechanisms established by theCharter of the United Nations. All parties concernedmust not only do everything possible to facilitate themission of the Joint Special Representative of theUnited Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria but also to guarantee humanitarian aid to populationsin distress. The international community must unite itsefforts to ensure that all parties concerned substitutenegotiation for recourse to arms and demand effectiverespect for religious freedom  human rights and allfundamental freedoms.As Pope Benedict XVI recently reiterated duringhis trip to Lebanon  we should import ideas of peaceand creativity  we should find ways of accepting eachperson in his otherness  we should therefore makevisible before the world the respect that religions havefor one another  respect for man as a creature of God and love of neighbour as fundamental to all religions. Inthat way  using all possible means  including materialassistance  we must help to bring an end to war andviolence so that all can help rebuild the peace. On hisreturn from Lebanon  the Holy Father called on Arab countries  as brothers  to propose workable solutionsthat respect the dignity  the rights and the religion ofevery individual. Those who wish to build peace mustcease to see in the other an evil to be eliminated. It isnot easy to see in the other a person to be respected andloved  and yet that is necessary if one desires to buildpeace  if one desires fraternity.Moreover  only an international communitystrongly rooted in values that genuinely uphold humandignity can provide viable solutions to the new typesof conflict perpetrated by transnational groups which spread a pseudo-religious hegemonic ideologycontemptuous of individual rights and civil peace. Wethink of the instability and the recent terrorist attacksin some countries of Africa and Asia  or the collusionbetween drug trafficking and terrorism in other regionsof the world.Beyond even situations of conflict  today allStates  rich and poor  see their stability threatened bythe economic crisis to which no true and sustainablesolution has been found to date. Just a few yearsago international discussions were essentially aboutpotential ways to share the resources of the richcountries  where well-being appeared to be firmlyestablished  or about the legitimate recognition ofthe rights of developing countries. The debate wasabout finding the right balance between free tradeand financial assistance; the transfer of know-how technologies and direct aid to the poorest populations;the clash of ideas about the foreign debt of the poorestcountries; the role of the World Trade Organization andits connections to the United Nations; the reform ofmultilateral financial institutions; and comprehensiveaccess to essential drugs.That unavoidable debate must be continued  evenif today it is overshadowed and made more complex bythe issues related to financial stability  whose impact isglobal. In fact  we can all see that the financial stabilityof the most developed societies has been seriouslyendangered  especially because of shortsightedeconomic policies often based only on maximizingshort-term profits.The threat of collapse of financial systems ineconomies that were until now the most prosperoushas serious consequences for social cohesion. It has ledto the resurgence of old fantasies such as exacerbatednationalism  populism and xenophobia. Add to that thetragedy of millions of people weighed down by hunger  the lack of basic health care and abject poverty  as wellas of vast populations living in inhuman conditions displaced populations and refugees  among whom arethousands of children.Given the difficulty of finding common solutionsthat respect the principles of self-determination independence  and the equality of States and the rightof peoples  the anthropological crisis of which I spokehas emerged  that is  a lack of conviction in the supremedignity of every individual  even when they have justbeen conceived or are in a vegetative or terminal state.It is an illusion to want to create true harmonyamong peoples  to guarantee peaceful coexistenceand real cooperation between States if we confineourselves to a vision of mankind that — without intheory denying the importance of the dignity andfundamental rights of the individual — consigns theprofound dimension of the person and his uniquenessto the rank of secondary factors  and insists on vaguecollective concepts that reduce the individual to thesimple category of consumer or agent of production inthe market. A human being is not a mere number inthe masses of the global population. And the masses ofthe global population cannot be viewed coldly or withsuspicion as a danger threatening the environmental andsocial balances. We are talking about men and women each with dignity and rights. Ideological visions thatdo not take that into account lead irreparably to socialdisintegration and conflict.In that sense  we must reject attempts to view theMillennium Development Goals and the post-2015development agenda  as well as the interpretation ofhuman rights treaties  on the basis of a limited andrelativist vision of humankind that  cleverly usingambiguous expressions  threatens the right to life andpresents a deconstruction of the family model based onthe union of a man and a woman and oriented towardsprocreation and the education of children. In the end those attempts risk the irremediable weakening of thecredibility and legitimacy of the Organization as auniversal tool for sustainable cooperation and peace.It is of the first importance to provide an effectivesolution to the open debate on the reform andimprovement of the functioning of United Nationsorgans in order to revitalize its ability to anticipateconflicts and resolve them peacefully. However  thatwill be possible only with a constantly renewed effortto return to the founding vision of the Organization.  Sustainable peace will not be possible without each andevery one of us engaging in a constructive dialoguedirected toward achieving dignified and decent livingconditions for all human beings.That can be done only through a shared belief withregard to fundamental values that guarantee respectfor human life. In that regard  respect for religiousfreedom is essential  within national public life as wellas internationally. Reason tells us that each person hastranscendental dignity  which brings with it freedomto determine one’s own ultimate destiny and whichnational and international authorities  as well as socialmechanisms  must fully respect. That is why actionsby Governments and international organizations mustnecessarily strive to promote comprehensive humandevelopment  creating legal  economic and socialconditions that genuinely reflect the importance ofhuman dignity and its transcendental dimension  bothat the personal level and collectively.Religion should not be thought of other than asa factor of peace and progress  a living force for thewell-being of all. Indeed  it leads human beings toovercome every egotistical interest and to devote theirenergies to the service of others  including for peaceamong peoples. That is why all forms of fanaticismand exclusivism and all acts of violence towardsone’s neighbour are an exploitation of and a deviationfrom religion. Moreover  history has shown that abiased concept of secularism  or tolerance that wouldlimit religious matters to the private sphere  can onlyundermine the bases for peaceful coexistence  at boththe national and international levels.The Holy See has been involved in internationalcooperation activities since they were first giveninstitutional structure. We established our PermanentMission to the United Nations in New York in 1964. Thereason for its presence as a subject of international law inthis intergovernmental institution is first of all its desireto offer to the international community a transcendentview of life and social relations  recalling in particularthe dignity of the individual and his fundamentalrights  in the first place the right to religious freedom.The international community has always welcomedthis contribution  which allows common initiativesto put back into a profound perspective  in which theunderlying unity of the human family and the call tothe generosity of individuals and peoples must alwaysbe reaffirmed.  It is in that spirit that the Holy See wishes to offerits contribution to the present session of the GeneralAssembly  aligning itself with the wish you expressed inyour inaugural address  Mr. President  that all MemberStates  which share the responsibility to implement theprinciples and objectives of the Organization  wouldrenew their commitment to resolve disputes by peacefuldialogue and not by resorting to confrontation. Onlyin that way will the aspirations and hopes of all beachieved. Only in that way can the United Nations playits indispensable role in peace and development."
"185",7333,"VCT",67,2012,"﻿My country extends heartfelt congratulations to Mr. VukJeremić on his assumption of his responsibilities asPresident of the General Assembly at this cruciallyimportant session. We also express our appreciationto his predecessor  Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser ofthe State of Qatar  who left an indelible mark on theGeneral Assembly.We meet again in the quest for development  equity and peace. Last year  our debate took place against the backdrop of rapid  often violent  geopoliticalchange  as well as continuing economic instability anduncertainty. Last year’s general debate  though markedby winds of change and clouds of uncertainty  was notwithout hope and optimism. Member States anticipatedmeaningful progress at the United Nations Summiton Sustainable Development. We predicted a robustand legally binding arms trade treaty. We embracedpopular  home-grown calls for political change. Andwe scanned the economic horizon for encouragingsigns of recovery and growth.Today  global optimism  though still enduringlypresent  is in scarcer supply  as the internationalcommunity has encountered the challenges of a newworld and found itself wanting. Our global structures including the United Nations  are faced with changesof a scope  scale and rapidity that substantially outpaceour ability to react  partly exceed our capacity torespond  and demand a level of courage  principleand decisiveness that is not sufficiently matched byour political will. Today  we are not merely spectatorswatching a moment of global change; rather  we arenations in the valley of decision  confronted with twoquestions that we must answer: “What is our visionof tomorrow’s post-crisis  post-conflict world?” And:“How  collectively  can we achieve that vision?”Our avoidance of these fundamental questionsthreatens to set our Assembly adrift and rudderless shirking responsibility and afraid of action. We mustresist the temptation to bury our heads in the shiftingsands of meaningless resolutions while we studiouslydisregard our imperative quest for a unifying principle and purpose. To succumb to such a temptation wouldbe to condemn this institution to a future marked notby new ideas  but new rationalizations. Our noblebattle of ideas will descend into a battalion of excuses;of blame-sharing and buck-passing; of soundbitesdisguised as insights. Such a future  which we areon a path to realize  would do a disservice to ourrespective States  our international obligations  and theproud history of the United Nations. We would  by ourimpotence  acquiesce to the possible obsolescence ofthis Organization  as peoples and Governments would justifiably or not  turn elsewhere for the solutions toglobal challenges. Such a future can and must bevigorously avoided  in the interest of our peoples’collective advancement and humanity.In our Caribbean region  the global economic andfinancial meltdown continues to be felt most acutelyby the poor  the youth  the elderly and the vulnerable who bear no responsibility for the rampant financialspeculation and unregulated movement of capital thatspurred the crisis. Today  four years into an externallyimposed meltdown which has produced negative ormarginal growth across the Caribbean  our region isforced to contemplate the implications of a potential“lost decade” of development.Our region is not immune to the economicpressures and fissures that have turned other parts ofthe world into tinderboxes of social unrest and politicalupheaval. Our citizens  who have nobly struggled underthe weight of externally sourced contraction  austerityand hardship  are not possessed of limitless patienceor endurance. Our hard-won development gains are injeopardy  and our settled political stability is in possibleperil. The international community cannot ignore ourplight based on a distorted calculus of middle-incomestatus and relative prosperity  or on simplistic even offensive  stereotypes of Caribbean paradises.Small  highly indebted middle-income developingcountries  like those in the Caribbean  which arevery vulnerable to natural disasters and internationaleconomic convulsions  have special concerns whichthe international community is obliged to addressproperly  in partnership with the peoples of our region.External shocks derived from nature or the workings ofan uneven  casino capitalism  are not merely episodicto our Caribbean; they are a constant feature of ourregional economies.Central to our urgent re-examination andreconfiguration of the existing economic apparatus isthe recognition that our modern context and individualnational characteristics do not lend themselves tostrict classical or Keynesian economic prescriptionsor their variants. In the case of Saint Vincent andthe Grenadines and our Caribbean neighbours  ourpeculiarities of small size  openness and vulnerabilityrequire uniquely home-grown economic policies thatare rooted not in any prevailing ideology or fashionabletheories from outside  but in a sensible  flexible andfocused practicality.We have little interest in esoteric arguments aboutthe role of the State in economic activity  because historically  our national Governments have been aforce for good in the stimulation  diversification andgrowth of our economies in tandem with the privateand cooperative sectors. While we welcome andsolicit assistance and consultations with the relevantinstitutions and organizations  such consultationsought to be free of the type of textbook orthodoxiesor formulaic prescriptions that are inapplicable to ourtimes and circumstances. Our path to developmentmust be our own.The cause of development  as a goal and as a right has suffered from the neglect of the internationalcommunity in recent  post-crisis years. Withinthe United Nations system  the current budget forpeacekeeping dwarfs the resources allocated tofostering development  even as we recognize that mostconflict is rooted in underdevelopment. The age-oldpledges of development assistance have been skirted and their fulfilment delayed  by States that cite theirown struggles with the global economic fallout. As aresult  even as we contemplate post-2015 sustainabledevelopment goals  it is painfully apparent that theMillennium Development Goals will not be met acrosslarge swaths of our planet.The poor  especially in Asia  Africa  the Pacific Latin America and the Caribbean  can hardly beexpected to wait any longer for relief and sustainabledevelopment. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines isthankful to the nations and organizations that havefound it possible to continue extending their hand incooperation with our people  even in difficult economictimes. The support and assistance of those States andorganizations is a mark of their friendship  solidarityand strong global citizenship.The prolonged global economic uncertainties havepropelled the international economy into a dangerousnew phase. Even the International Monetary Fund has so concluded. In the process  the crisis has foundthe principals wanting  even unaware of the extantcondition  with no clear idea as to the way forward.In both economics and politics  the ancien régime ispassing. The discerning acknowledge that a transitionis at large  but immense challenges arise immediatelyfrom at least four pertinent queries: first  is thetransition manageable  or must it be played out in achaotic manner? Secondly  assuming that the transitionis manageable  how is it to be managed in the mostefficacious way  and in whose interest? Thirdly  is thistransition a dead end? And fourthly  given that thetransition itself  like all human conditions  is dynamic what is the destination of this transition?It is a truism that men and women make history notin circumstances of their own choosing  but in thosewhich they meet  which they inherit  and which emergeon their watch. Noteworthy is the fact that the historiesof nations and the ghosts of the dead weigh heavilyon the brains of the living. Often unacknowledged isthe abiding truth that each people possesses its ownhistory  its own legitimacy  its own nobility and its owntrajectory for further ennoblement.Unfortunately  the power of some to define thingsglobally distorts these elemental truths. It is wellknown that the lion’s view of history does not coincidewith that of the gazelle or the lamb; the elephant andthe ant do not see things eye to eye. But human beingspossess the capacity to go beyond the limitations ofthe animal kingdom. That is fundamentally why wehave gathered together under the rubric of the UnitedNations  with a Charter so uplifting and magnificent inits ideals and purposes as to constitute the best hope forthe human race. Arrogant and unbridled power  fromwhatever source  is thus to be contained. It is alwayswise to remember that the greatest exercise of power isrestraint in the use of that power. That is true within andbetween nations. It is the surest way for the malevolentacross the globe to be accorded no space to flourish andto be defeated.It is within this context that the text of a prosperous safe  independent Palestinian State must be writtenalongside a secure State of Israel  living in friendshipand non-belligerence. This is a matter of grave urgency;the injustice meted out to Palestine must end now.So  too  must continue our global quest for interfaithdialogue and an alliance of civilizations  initiated bythe Governments of Qatar and Turkey  respectively. Similarly  let us not forget our pledge of solidarityto Haiti. Likewise  reparations for the genocidescommitted against indigenous peoples and for Africanslavery must continue to be pursued vigorously on ourinternational agenda.All of that and more is achievable by the UnitedNations. Thus  our collective will can bear fruitabundantly through the strengths and possibilities ofwise leadership  peaceful dialogue among and betweensovereign nations  international cooperation andregional compacts.Closer to home  our developmental andpolitical partnerships increasingly reflect a spirit ofstrengthened regional integration and greater South-South cooperation. In the immediate post-colonialphase of our national development  the nations of theCaribbean and Latin America often have had strongerand closer relationships with distant colonial Powers anddeveloped nations than we did with the countries in ourimmediate neighbourhood. After centuries of colonialconquest  settlement and exploitation  our deepeningbonds of friendship  cooperation and integration withinthe Caribbean and Latin America are a fundamentalmanifestation of our States’ growing independence andpolitical maturity.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines enjoysmembership in a number of interconnected circlesof regional integration. The Organization of EasternCaribbean States (OECS) is in an economic union witha shared currency  judiciary and nascent representativeAssembly. The 15-member Caribbean Community(CARICOM) also furthers the cause of Caribbeanintegration with important implications for trade and thefree movement of people. Our State is a proud memberof the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of OurAmerica  which has created bonds of socioeconomicsolidarity and cooperation among Caribbean  Centraland South American States. The Caribbean Forum ofAfrican  Caribbean and Pacific States  the Associationof Caribbean States  and the Community of LatinAmerican and Caribbean States are also home-grownmanifestations of our peoples’ desire to forge linkagesand partnerships with our regional brothers and sisters.The strength and genuine cohesion of thosegrowing regional integration initiatives is built on asolid foundation of shared experiences and values which deserve the support of the United Nations. Themembers of OECS and CARICOM are bastions of goodgovernance  democracy and the rule of law  and we share those experiences and aspirations with our Southand Central American sister States  which have alsoestablished unshakeable foundations of democracy andgood governance after fitful periods of political unrestand foreign interference in the past. The upcoming7 October presidential election in the BolivarianRepublic of Venezuela is but one example of themanner in which that country and the region continueto institutionalize popular  participatory democraticsystems that reflect and respect the will of the people.As we strengthen relations with our immediateneighbours  we remain deeply committed to ourhistorical ties and traditional friendships. The bondsthat we share with our friends in Europe  Canada  theUnited Kingdom and the United States are as strongas they are mutually beneficial. As a multi-islandnation  the people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadineshave always been highly migratory and outward-looking — so much so that even the words of ournational anthem memorialize our proclivity for travelto distant lands. Many of the largest and most vibrantcities of our nationals exist not in Saint Vincent and theGrenadines  but in major metropolitan hubs  includingthose in Brooklyn  Toronto and London. Thoseproductive and hard-working centres  and many others have immeasurably enriched their adopted homes andprovided needed remittances to relatives in the landof their birth. We remain grateful to those friendlyStates that have opened their doors and embrace toour migrants  and we view the ongoing  hassle-freemovement of our peoples back and forth as the truesttestament of our friendship and solidarity.The recent increase in regional conflicts and unrestaround the world cannot be ignored. The hopefulnessand idealistic optimism that were much in evidenceduring the early days of the so-called Arab Springhave been replaced by a cynical fatalism and rampantopportunism in many important quarters. In othercontinents  some nations flirt with border wars  whileothers grapple with insidious and barbaric terrorism.In the midst of the global upheaval  we have witnessedthe aggressive re-emergence of those that would seek toreshape the world in their own image and to their ownpurposes. Would-be interventionists  unilateralists andhegemons  both new and old  have rushed to fill andexploit political vacuums  to settle ancient grudges andto strengthen their grip on global or regional power.It is a pattern that predates colonialism and theCold War and one that once again brings into focusmany of the United Nations founding principles. Thoseprinciples cannot be ignored  reinterpreted or sacrificedon the altar of poll-driven political expediency andelectoral ambition. We have bound ourselves togetherin the solemn goal of promoting peace  not fosteringwars; of self-determination  not unilateral intervention;of the economic and social advancement of all peoples not the callous disregard for the well-being of ourfellow human beings. To depart from those principles explicitly or by implication  would be to abandon thebetter angels of our nature and to succumb to the forcesthat made this institution necessary in the first place.The war against global terror is real  and it is beingfought by all responsible States on multiple fronts. SaintVincent and the Grenadines is firm and unequivocalin its rejection of all forms of terrorist activity andits revulsion at the methods and twisted logic thataccompany that barbarism. Our friends and brothersin the United States of America are unfortunately anddisproportionately targeted by those repulsive killers most recently in the deeply saddening murder ofChristopher Stevens  the United States Ambassador toLibya  and some of his staff. We support unreservedlythe determination of the United States to bringAmbassador Stevens’s killers to justice.At the same time  we are baff led by the continuedreference to the Republic of Cuba in some quarters asa State sponsor of terrorism. The undisputed evidenceis that Cuba neither supports nor harbours terroristsof any type. Indeed  the Cuban Government  itself avictim of orchestrated terror campaigns  has cooperatedon numerous occasions with the Governments of bothallies and ideological opponents in the fight againstterrorism. It has also played a useful and constructiverole in facilitating peace talks between Governmentsand armed rebel groups in Latin America. Those factsare not contested. Therefore  to label Cuba a Statesponsor of terrorism  in any context  is to cheapen ourshared global struggle against that insidious scourge.In his famous 1960 speech to the General Assembly then President Fidel Castro observed that hysteria couldgo to any length and was capable of making the mostfar-fetched and absurd claims. That particular absurdand far-fetched claim  like the absurdity that undergirdsthe continued economic embargo against Cuba  is onethat is best abandoned.The fascinating rapprochement unfolding across theTaiwan straits between the People’s Republic of Chinaand the Republic of China on Taiwan lends practical weight to the reasonable and overdue call for Taiwan’smeaningful participation in the specialized agenciesof the United Nations. My country and several othersin the Caribbean and Central America bear witness toTaiwan’s principled conduct of its intergovernmentalrelations. Surely the time has now come for thisexemplar of the magnificent Chinese civilization to bepermitted to participate in the work of various agenciesof this world body.Allow me to turn to certain existential challengesfacing my country  my region  and the world. SaintVincent and the Grenadines is angered by the continuingand inexcusable failure of the States assembled in thisHall to move decisively towards a meaningful andlegally binding climate change treaty. Entire nations represented here today as friends and equals  maysimply cease to exist as a result of our inaction andpolitical cowardice. Other nations  including my own are already the victims of increasingly intense andfrequent storms  hurricanes and weather events. Thesechanges not only threaten our way of life but riskreversing our recent development progress.The islands of our planet are at war against climatechange  warming temperatures and rising seas. Thatwar is not a future event  it is a present-day and ongoingbattle. As all of us in this Assembly are aware  it is awar that we are currently losing. The survival of ourislands is at stake  and the responsibility for immediatechange lies undisputedly with those whose recklesspollution over generations has led us to the brink ofcatastrophe. In a different time and context  WinstonChurchill inspired his people with the words “we shallfight on the seas and oceans... we shall defend ourisland  whatever the cost may be”. Today  know this:We shall fight the rising seas and encroaching oceansand defend our islands’ right to exist at any cost. Wecall on all nations to join us in the fight  for that is awar that can still be won. Our negotiations to arrestclimate change are not merely some arcane academic ordiplomatic pursuit  and they cannot be treated as someinterminable  run-of-the-mill United Nations process.Let us set aside narrow  short-term interests and act aswe are capable of acting: for the benefit and protectionof all mankind.Another existential threat whose solution has fallenvictim to United Nations paralysis is our common pursuitof a global  robust and binding arms trade treaty. In theCaribbean  over 70 per cent of homicides are committedwith firearms  a remarkable statistic for a region thatproduces not one single gun or bullet. Saint Vincentand the Grenadines has a largely unarmed constabularyand lacks a standing army  yet we struggle daily againstan influx of illicit and untraceable firearms that posea grave threat to our national security and way of life.The producers of firearms  as well as the source anddestination markets for illicit narcotics  can and mustcooperate to restrict and regulate the international f lowof small arms  light weapons and ammunition. Whilewe have failed in our initial attempt to forge an armstrade treaty  I call on members at this session of theGeneral Assembly to redouble their efforts to negotiatea binding agreement in this matter before we reconvenenext September.This year it is imperative  too  that the UnitedNations continue its focused work in the fight againstnon-communicable diseases  which the CaribbeanCommunity has rightly placed at the forefront of theglobal agenda.The people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadinesare strong and fiercely independent. Ours is anindependence forged in the heroic struggles of ourindigenous and Garifuna peoples against genocideand hardened in the fires of our resistance to slavery indentureship  and colonial and neocolonial domination.Our strength  independence and sovereignty do notpermit us to look to the United Nations or any othercountry or group of countries for the solutions to ourown problems and challenges. However  as a small Statein an interconnected world  we recognize that many ofthe difficulties we face have been born and incubatedbeyond our national boundaries. The United Nationstherefore is our primary multilateral forum to addressand confront those externally imposed challenges.My statement today is not intended merely tochronicle the global ills that have befallen Saint Vincentand the Grenadines. No. It is a call for principled andpractical global action to address and resolve theseproblems. To do so  we stand ready to work with thePresident and with all States in this Assembly to effectmeaningful change throughout our planet. As thegreat novelist Ernest Hemingway once wrote  “Moralcourage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battleor great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential  vitalquality of those who seek to change a world whichyields most painfully to change”. Today  Saint Vincentand the Grenadines calls on this body  and on allnations assembled here  to harness that essential moralcourage to produce change in a world whose potential is limitless  and whose problems are soluble. Therhetoric of change and hope may lack the cachet that itenjoyed hitherto  but we still believe that our peoplesand Governments possess within them the courageand conviction collectively to change and materiallyimprove the condition of our nations’ citizens.Let us at this sixty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly establish conclusively that that faith is wellplaced. We move with our burdens from yesterday.We go forward with our strengths and possibilitiestomorrow."
"186",7380,"VEN",67,2012,"﻿We would like tocongratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventhsession.Our world is afflicted by new political  economicand social turmoil that has disrupted the peacefulcoexistence of the peoples of the world and reducedthe quality of life for millions of human beings. Newneocolonial wars have been launched aimed at seizingthe natural resources of developing countries.The proponents of capitalism  while attempting toovercome the deep economic crisis that has affectedthe global financial system  have been resorting to newimperialistic strategies and overexploiting workers including those in developing countries. The socialwelfare State and the social achievements attainedafter the Second World War are now in the process ofbeing dismantled. The new imperialists have soughtto transfer responsibility for the crisis to those born inother countries and to immigrants  whereas the currenteconomic crisis was caused primarily by financialspeculators. Social policies are gradually being reducedor eliminated. The middle class has been growing poor.Hunger  poverty and unemployment are reappearing inthe developed countries and are spreading around theworld. Suffering and despair are increasing.Meanwhile  Latin America and the Caribbean havemanaged to tackle  with relative success  the impactof those global economic and financial imbalances.The United Nations Economic Commission for LatinAmerica and the Caribbean reports that the economiesin our region have had a significant rebound beginningin 2010  which enabled our region to mitigate theeffects of the 2008 to 2009 crisis. Latin America andthe Caribbean are well positioned on the world stage thanks to the strengthening of initiatives in the area ofregional integration  designed to strengthen politicaland economic autonomy. Therefore  the dominationthat the imperial Powers and their multinationals haveimposed on developing countries is gradually beingovercome.The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of OurAmerica is a new coordination mechanism for dialogueguided by cooperation  complementarity and solidarityamong sovereign nations. It represents an alternativefor the liberation and independence of our countries.The Community of Latin American and CaribbeanStates (CELAC) and the Union of South AmericanNations (UNASUR) are regional spaces of multilateralcooperation aimed at strengthening the unity of LatinAmerica and the Caribbean and are constructinga multipolar  balanced and just world in which the sovereign equality of States will prevail as well as aculture of peace in a world free of nuclear weapons andof weapons of mass destruction. CELAC and UNASURhave inspired social and human development  withequity and inclusion  and seek to eradicate povertyand overcome inequalities in the region. In LatinAmerica and the Caribbean  we are seeing a new typeof regionalism that is being promoted by diplomaticsolidarity.Today  the unipolar system of imperial dominationis in crisis. A pluripolar and multi-centred system hasbeen coming into being  in which emerging countriesand new regional blocs are able to contribute to thedemocratization of international relations. Meanwhile the imperial Powers have been promoting  within theUnited Nations  a new regulatory framework enablingforeign intervention in the internal affairs of States trying to get States to give up their sovereignty  politicalindependence and self-determination. Those Powershave become the judges  jurors and administrators ofinternal conflicts in the countries of the South  resortingto interventionist initiatives that are conceived hereat the United Nations and implemented through theSecurity Council.A new international order  truly based on the legalequality of States  is an imperative demand. Reform ofthe United Nations is necessary. The Security Councilmust become more democratic if it wishes to expressthe will of all nations. The General Assembly isbegging for revitalization  and the Secretary-Generalshould be elected democratically  by all Member States.International peace and security cannot be built on thebasis of privileges for a few.The international financial architecture thatemerged at Bretton Woods is anti-democratic. TheGeneral Assembly and the Economic and SocialCouncil are never taken into account when decisionsare made on vital economic and financial matters thataffect all of humankind. Reform of the global economicand financial system must be addressed in the UnitedNations  and all countries should have an equal voicein the search for solutions to problems related todevelopment.In Syria we are following the same interventionistscript that was applied in Libya. Imperial Powers arefomenting ethnic  political and religious divisionsbetween Syrians and between Syria and its neighbours.They are shamelessly supplying weapons to the rebel forces in an attempt to overthrow the Government ofthat Arab country. Venezuela supports the peace effortsbeing made by the Joint Special Representative of theUnited Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. We should encourage politicaldialogue between Syrians  but we reject foreignintervention and the deadly policy of regime change.We support the positions of Russia  China and othercountries on the issue; they demand that the SecurityCouncil respect the territorial unity and integrity of theSyrian State. The Non-Aligned Movement can play aproactive role in helping to solve that crisis.The Bolivarian Government reaffirms its supportfor the existence of a Palestinian State  independentand sovereign  within internationally recognizedborders  in accordance with the relevant resolutions ofthe Security Council and the General Assembly. Wealso reiterate our support for Palestine’s admission asa State Member of the United Nations with full rights.We are concerned about the warmongering threatsof the Governments of Israel and the United Statesagainst Iran. A military attack on that Persian nationwould have fatal consequences for world peace. Werecognize the sovereign right of the Islamic Republic ofIran to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.Respect for cultures and religions ensures thepeaceful coexistence of the human beings who populateour planet. Within the crisis of capitalism  we haveonce again seen a resurgence in Western countries ofracial hatred  xenophobia and hostility to other culturesand religions. The reprehensible video against the greatProphet Muhammad and Islam has naturally provokedprotests among Muslim peoples. Such anti-Islamicexpressions are not random; they are part of a politicaland ideological climate that fosters hatred against thosewho are different.We deplore the fact that freedom of speech is beingused to offend religions and denigrate religious prophets.What are the limits of the freedom of expression? Is it anabsolute freedom that allows one to besmirch people’sdeepest beliefs and religious feelings? Venezuelarejects exhibitions of xenophobia against Muslims andsupports dialogue between cultures and civilizationsaimed at promoting peace and brotherhood amonghuman beings. At the same time  we call for respect forthe inviolability of diplomatic premises and the dignityof human life.  The United States continues to maintain its criminaleconomic and financial blockade of the fraternal peopleof Cuba. Venezuela emphasizes its solidarity with theGovernment of the Republic of Cuba and demands anend to that unilateral coercive measure. It is ironic thata country that practices State terrorism and sheltersthe well-known terrorist Luís Posada Carriles includesCuba on its list of countries that support terrorism.We demand that Cuba be removed from that arbitraryclassification  whose sole purpose is to justify theeconomic  commercial and financial embargo againstits people.Venezuela appreciates all efforts on the part of theUnited Nations to improve its mediation capabilities incrisis situations that could have negative consequencesfor international peace and stability. The United Nationsshould act in a neutral and impartial fashion  with aview to strengthening its ability to mediate in cases inwhich it is voluntarily and expressly requested to do soby the parties involved in international conflicts. Thecountries of Latin America and the Caribbean havevery valuable experience in the use of dialogue andmediation for the settlement of disputes. The Rio Groupmade a major contribution in helping to end the terriblearmed conflicts in Central America in recent years  andUNASUR has also helped to prevent and settle disputesin our region.Venezuela welcomes the announcement made bythe President of Colombia  Mr. Juan Manuel Santos that negotiations will begin between his Governmentand the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia(FARC)  with a view to achieving stable and lastingpeace. Venezuela  Cuba  Chile and Norway aretaking part in the dialogue process as supporters  byagreement between the Colombian authorities andFARC. The Bolivarian Government is backing peaceand reconciliation for the Colombian people.Venezuela supports the Republic of Argentina’sright of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands  theSouth Georgia Islands and the South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas. We reiterate ourcall to the United Kingdom to begin talks with thatfraternal South American country in order to arrive ata negotiated and peaceful solution to that dispute.On Sunday  7 October  democratic elections will beheld in Venezuela to elect the President of the Republic.They will be transparent and credible  because  asformer United States President Jimmy Carter saida few days ago  we have the most modern electoral system in the world. Between 1999 and 2012 we haveheld 14 clean national elections  a world record inpolitical participation. We should issue a warning  herein this forum  that anti-democratic national elements in alliance with foreign interests  are attempting touse violence in order to subvert the will of the people.The Venezuelan people are prepared  however  onceagain to defend their democratic and revolutionaryachievements.Venezuela needs a democratic opposition. Pluralismand diversity coexist in democracy. And peace is theonly path for the homeland of Simón Bolívar. PresidentHugo Chávez Frías is guaranteeing the continuity ofour sovereign and supportive foreign policy  focusedon improving Latin American and Caribbean unity enhancing cooperation with the peoples of the South  andbuilding a multicentric and multipolar world  withoutimperial hegemonies. Similarly  he is guaranteeing thecontinuity of a national policy based on social justice.The successes of the Bolivarian Revolution areevident. Venezuela has met the targets set by theMillennium Development Goals before 2015. Thenumber of households in extreme poverty has fallendramatically  from 21 per cent in 1998 to 7 per centin 2010. Social investment in my country is amongthe highest in the world. Venezuela has the highestminimum wage in Latin America and the Caribbean.According to the Gini coefficient  our country is themost egalitarian in Latin America and the Caribbean.According to the Food and Agriculture Organizationof the United Nations  we are ranked tenth among thebest-fed peoples in the world. We are the country withthe fifth-highest percentage of university enrolmentin the world. Education and health care are free. AllVenezuelans  without exception  have access to thoserights.Those extraordinary achievements in economic social and cultural rights have been attained in thecontext of a participatory democracy  in which civiland political rights are fully respected  as never beforein our country’s history. The Venezuelan people haveregained their sovereignty and self-determination. Arevolution for freedom  justice and equality is underway. That is the Bolivarian revolution."
"187",7419,"VNM",67,2012,"﻿On behalfof the delegation of Viet Nam  I extend my warmestcongratulations to you  Sir  on your election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Iam confident that under your stewardship this sessionwill be crowned with success. I appreciate the excellentwork done by the Secretary-General and welcome theoutcomes of the sixty-sixth session  presided over byMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser.To start with  we would like to welcome the themeproposed for this year’s general debate  “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of international disputesor situations by peaceful means”. This theme is ofparticular relevance in today’s world  when instabilityand conflicts continue in various regions  especially inNorth Africa and the Middle East. The decades-longPalestinian-Israeli conflict lingers on and requires asatisfactory solution  including the establishment ofan independent sovereign Palestinian State coexistingpeacefully with the State of Israel. Progress has yetto be made in disarmament  particularly nucleardisarmament  while the risk of the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction continues to grow. New complicated developments are emerging in the Asia-Pacific region  a dynamically growing and importantregion of the world.We believe that the success of this GeneralAssembly session will significantly contribute to theprimary goal of the United Nations  maintaining worldpeace and security. Accordingly  we must further upholdinternational law and strengthen compliance withit. Nations must strongly commit to the fundamentalprinciples of international law and the United NationsCharter  particularly the peaceful settlement of disputesand non-use of force  as well as respect for the nationalindependence  sovereignty and territorial integrityof States. We must promote dialogue and the use ofpeaceful means in the settlement of disputes  especiallyrecourse to international and regional organizationsand international legal mechanisms. And we mustnot accept the imposition of sanctions like thoseagainst Cuba  the removal of which the Assembly hasrepeatedly called for.International law is an intellectual creation of thecivilized world  which all States must respect and abideby in good faith. If international law is enforced  therisk of conflict will be minimized and sustained peacewill be better secured.Viet Nam therefore welcomes the importantoutcome of the recent High-level Meeting on theRule of Law at the National and International Levels(resolution 67/1)  which reaffirmed that the rule of lawis fundamental to political dialogue and cooperationamong States and is the indispensable bedrock for amore peaceful  prosperous and just world. Compliancewith international law is an essential principle thatguides the policies and actions of each nation  as wellas the joint endeavours of the international community.When we commemorate the thirtieth anniversaryof the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) later this year  we should furtherreaffirm our strong commitment to and compliancewith that constitution of the seas  which contributesto the maintenance of peace  stability and maritimesecurity  safety and cooperation.The United Nations continues to play anindispensable role  entrusted to it by the internationalcommunity  in the maintenance of international peaceand security. Viet Nam commends the work done bythe United Nations  especially in helping settle regionaldisputes and conflicts by peaceful means  includingthrough the strengthened use of peacekeepingoperations. We expect the Organization will continueto build further upon its experience in that area andpromote a culture of peace and dialogue  to betterresolve ongoing conflicts and prevent the eruption ofnew ones.The United Nations must step up efforts indisarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclearweapons and other weapons of mass destruction  whilestrengthening international cooperation and ensuringthe right of States to use related technologies forpeaceful purposes. Multilateral negotiating forums inthis area  particularly the Conference on Disarmament must be revitalized and intensified.Furthermore  we should recognize the increasinglyimportant role of regional organizations. In East Asia the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)continues to play a central role in the regionalarchitecture and helps promote peace  stability andsecurity in the region  including maritime securityin the South China Sea. Viet Nam fully supportsASEAN’s six-point principles statement on the SouthChina Sea  which further reaffirms the settlement ofdisputes by peaceful means  respect for internationallaw  particularly UNCLOS  the full implementationof the Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the SouthChina Sea and a timely agreement on a code of conduct.Peace is the prerequisite for development. Yet it issustainable development  including the end of poverty the promotion of social justice and the elimination ofinequality in international relations  which helps resolvethe root causes of conflicts and lays the foundation fora sustained peace.Today  the global economy continues to be indifficulty. The Doha Development Round has yet tomake progress  while protectionism persists and theshortcomings of the international economic and financial systems have yet to be overcome. As a result  manycountries  especially developing countries  continue toface great difficulties in their development  includingin their efforts to achieve the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs). In that context  it is essential that wereaffirm our strong political commitment to ensuringthe realization of the MDGs  the promotion of inclusivesustainable and green development  and the effectiveresponse to natural disasters  climate change and otherglobal challenges.The United Nations needs to strengthen globalpartnerships for development and take the lead inan inclusive process to formulate the post-2015global development agenda  including the proposedsustainable development goals. In that regard  we urgedeveloped countries to fulfil their pledges for increaseddevelopment assistance and support developingcountries in capacity-building.This year  Viet Nam commemorates the thirty-fifthanniversary of its membership in the United Nations.Throughout that time  Viet Nam has consistently beenan active and responsible member of the Organization striving for peace  national independence  democracy social progress and prosperity for all nations. Building onits 25 years of reform and important accomplishments Viet Nam has been working towards a growth modelthat links economic development with social progressand environmental protection.In the face of recent global economic difficulties Viet Nam has taken steps to effectively maintainmacroeconomic stability and ensure social security.Viet Nam continues to strengthen the rule of law andbuild a State of the people  by the people and for the people  which places the people at the centre andpromotes their ownership and rights in all spheres.Pursuing the policy of proactive internationalintegration  Viet Nam continues to contributeactively to the work of the United Nations  ASEAN the Non-Aligned Movement  the InternationalOrganization of la Francophonie and others. We alsocontribute constructively in multilateral forums inendeavours designed to respond to global challengesincluding nuclear security; disarmament and thenon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction;sustainable development; climate change; water  foodand energy security; and the achievement of the MDGs.Viet Nam has been implementing with good resultsthe United Nations initiative of Delivering as One. Tofurther contribute to the work of the United Nations Viet Nam has put forth its candidature for membershipin the Human Rights Council for the term 2014-2016 and we look forward to the Assembly’s support.Viet Nam always endorses efforts to enhancethe role and effectiveness of the United Nations toenable the Organization to become the true centre forharmonizing the actions of nations in the attainmentof the common goals enshrined in its Charter. Wetherefore support the continued reform of the UnitedNations  including the strengthening of the GeneralAssembly as the most representative deliberative body and of the Economic and Social Council in the field ofsocioeconomic development  as well as the expansionof Security Council membership and reform of itsworking methods."
"188",7450,"VUT",67,2012,"﻿Vanuatu wishes toassociate itself with other delegations in congratulatingthe President and the members of his Bureau on theirelection to lead us through this sixty-seventh sessionof the General Assembly. I am indeed profoundlydelighted  as Mr. Jeremić assured us in our meetingearlier this week  that he will do his utmost to assistwith and bring to the forefront the issues that confrontthe Pacific island States and other marginalizednations. We trust that with his guidance  this sessionwill conclude with successful outcomes.Allow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  who  with strongleadership and diplomatic finesse  led us to greatoutcomes during the sixty-sixth session of the Assembly.Our world has seen unprecedented disputes andconflicts  most of which have spanned successive generations. The theme of the sixty-seventh session “Bringing about adjustment or settlement ofinternational disputes or situations by peaceful means” should therefore lead us to focus on finding lastingsolutions to the numerous ongoing conflicts in variousparts of the world that are causing vulnerable people tosuffer. Members have the solemn responsibility to steerthis multilateral gathering towards deeper considerationof the founding goals of the Organization  which areto encourage and create a more secure and peacefulworld in which diverse cultures and civilizations cancoexist without having to resort to force and violenceto achieve their goals.This rostrum can testify to all the speeches thathave been delivered by the world’s great leaders on avast array of issues that affect humankind. Many of usrepresenting politically independent nations here haveshared the journey and the litany of heartaches anddreams deferred of many of our global citizens  whosehuman rights to larger political and civil freedom arestill bound by the tentacles of imperialism and thelegacy of colonialism. Even now  for the remainingcolonized territories  this rostrum represents thepinnacle they so greatly aspire to reach one day.Since 1980  the Republic of Vanuatu has repeatedlycalled for the United Nations to strengthen its effortstowards achieving the full decolonization of territoriesstill controlled by administrative Powers. I call on theindependent  free nations of the world to complete thestory of decolonization and to close that chapter.At this juncture  I urge the United Nations notto reject the demands for French Polynesia’s right toself-determination and progress. In the same manner negotiations for the self-government of the indigenouspeople of New Caledonia must continue. We encouragethe parties to ensure that the process towards achievingself-government will stay on track.I also call upon Members to ensure that collectiveaction is taken to lift the embargo on Cuba. We  theMembers of the United Nations  must revive ourpolitical motivation and courage  dispel our feelings ofanimosity  and ensure that United Nations resolutionson that issue are fully implemented. Our actions mustnot detract from the universal values of love and respectfor people  no matter how insignificant they may be tothe powerful nations. I hope that one day we will at lastbe able to echo the message of freedom to many of ourfriends who still suffer from the burden of conflictingideologies.Last year  I reiterated to this Assembly our seriousconcerns over the denial of a country’s right to exerciseits full political freedom and inherent cultural rightsover its maritime territories. Since we gained ourindependence 32 years ago  our territorial dispute withthe French Republic over the southern two islands ofVanuatu  Matthew and Hunter  has been a reminderthat we must continue to uphold the notion that the ruleof law should not be used by powerful nations as aninstrument to coerce weak and small nations  especiallyin territorial disputes.The French and the Vanuatu Governments met inParis in April to commence dialogue on the issue of theterritorially disputed islands. We take this opportunityto thank the French Government for finally opening itsdoor to dialogue and negotiation in an attempt to resolvethat outstanding international dispute. We acknowledgethe procedures outlined within the United Nations toensure that such disputes are amicably resolved.As a small island State surrounded by the vastPacific Ocean  Vanuatu is exposed to the notoriousillegal transshipment of and trade in illicit arms. Theinternational arms trade has continuously lacked properand coherent regulation and is responsible for the loss ofinnumerable lives. Like many other countries  we callon the United Nations to take a much firmer approachin expediting the conclusion of an arms trade treaty which would provide greater security and control oversuch illegal activity. That is an issue of paramountimportance to all countries exposed to the illegal tradein arms and light weapons.My country has consistently argued that themechanisms and criteria for assessing graduationeligibility must not be isolated from the permanent andinherent vulnerabilities of our countries. It is unrealisticfor United Nations agencies to assess progress andmake projections without taking into consideration thematter of permanent vulnerabilities and the capacityto sustain growth in our countries after graduation. Iwish to further state that  according to the World RiskReport 2011  Vanuatu scored highest on the World RiskIndex as the country with the greatest disaster risk  dueto its high exposure and weak coping capacities. Thefindings of that report are critical  and we therefore askthat the United Nations Committee for DevelopmentPolicy carefully weigh its arguments and reassess thevulnerability graduation criteria.I would also like to state that  prior to anothertriennial review of the least developed country (LDC) category  the United Nations will need to ensure thatproper resolutions are adopted by the General Assemblyto ensure that small island States graduating from LDCstatus continue to enjoy certain preferential treatment even after graduation  to offset the vulnerability factor.Let me take this opportunity to invite the members ofthe triennial review to visit my country to establishfirst-hand information and ascertain the findings ofthe World Risk Report prior to escalating the process ofgraduation in 2013.Our own experience has shown that the differentways that multilateral organizations and institutionscategorize member countries can affect the f low ofdevelopment assistance. For instance  Vanuatu  togetherwith 15 other countries  was selected several years agofrom among the Pacific island countries to benefit fromthe Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) fundingof the Government of the United States of America. Atthe time of our selection  Vanuatu was graded as a low-income country and  by the eligibility criteria of theMCC  was automatically qualified for and benefitedfrom $66 million to build two major national roads ontwo different islands in the country. I wish to expressour appreciation to the United States Government forits assistance.However  when the Report on Countries that areCandidates for Millennium Challenge CorporationAccount Eligibility for Fiscal Year 2010 was released Vanuatu failed to qualify. The reason was simply thatthe MCC was using World Bank criteria and graduatedVanuatu from the status of low-income country to thatof low-middle-income country. In other words  theWorld Bank’s criteria may be totally different from theLDC criteria defined by the United Nations. I thereforewish to call on the United Nations  especially theEconomic and Social Council  to ensure that the LDCdefinition and criteria used by United Nations agenciesare compatible with those of the international financialinstitutions.The vast Pacific Ocean is our heritage and theprime means of livelihood of the people living in itsisland countries. Like other Pacific Island countries Vanuatu continues to be exposed to and threatened bythe negative impacts of climate change  such as coastalerosion  coral bleaching and ocean acidification. At theForty-Third Pacific Islands Forum in the Cook Islands the Forum leaders noted that many challenges remain inrealizing benefits from the pledged new and additionaltargets of the Copenhagen Accord. In that respect  I would like to seize this opportunity to express our wishfor United Nations assistance in facilitating effectiveresponses to global climate change  particularly throughthe prompt implementation of adaptation measures  aswell as mitigation efforts  climate change financing capacity-building and international negotiations.While we tend to direct our main focus of attentiontowards global climate change  we must address othermatters  such as environmental pollution  with thesame exigency and rigor. The potential for permanent irrevocable damage to the environment by marinepollution has been constantly highlighted by thescientific community and should not be tolerated.The future growth of international maritime trafficwill further exacerbate the situation. Vanuatu urgesall remaining States that have not yet done so toexpeditiously sign and ratify the 1972 LondonConvention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution byDumping of Wastes and Other Matter  as well as the1996 Protocol thereto  and to promulgate and enforcelegal regimes  both in the domestic and internationalarenas.At this point  I would like to reiterate theunnecessary risk to which we expose our children andourselves by not taking a firm precautionary approachwith regard to marine geoengineering practices such as sub-seabed carbon sequestration and oceanfertilization. In our global efforts to combat climatechange  the strict promotion of and adherence to onlythose responses that are environmentally sensible isour crucial responsibility  and I am not only speakingon behalf of a small island nation when I recall that by forgetting the essentiality of the oceans as thevery foundation of life on Earth  one neglects a vitalguarantor of mankind’s future survival.As I conclude this speech  I have to make a lastappeal to all assembled leaders. I urge them to takeimmediate action upon their return to their homecountries to initiate the change that needs to come aboutif we wish to preserve a planet capable of providing oursons and daughters with a bright future. If the leadersof the industrialized countries want to achieve theproposed 1.5° C target  they have less than eight yearsleft to close a vast mitigation gap. Who if not they canor will implement the required measures for that crucialchange? This may well be their last chance. In theirhands lie the hope and destiny of the world’s nations.It is a responsibility that they must assume not only fortheir own people  but for humankind as a whole. I am grateful for the opportunity to express myviews in this forum. Long live our aspirations to createa better and a more secure world for everyone  and mayGod bless the United Nations."
"189",7482,"WSM",67,2012,"﻿Samoa commemoratedthe fiftieth anniversary of its independence this year at home and abroad. The Headquarters of the UnitedNations was one of the venues  and for good reason.Our aspirations to be a sovereign State founded ondemocratic principles  Christian beliefs and our culturalvalues were ably facilitated by the United Nations. NewZealand  as the administering Power  was sympatheticand supportive  which hastened the attainment of ourindependence. Our people were given the choice todecide the future of our country. The United Nationsand the administering Power supported the process andpaved the way. As we also heard from the President ofthe United States  people everywhere must ultimatelylong for the freedom to determine their destiny.Half a century later  there still remain territoriestoday  even in our Pacific region  where people have not been able to exercise their right to self-determination.In the case of French Polynesia  we encourage themetropolitan Power and the territory’s leadership  withthe support of the United Nations  to find an amicableway to exercise the right of the people of the territory todetermine their future.The outcome document of the UnitedNations Conference on Sustainable Development(resolution 66/288  annex) provides a blueprint for thefuture we want. It is a future we all signed on to  apartnership of shared responsibilities  commitmentsand undertakings among all Members  big and small.For all the goals to be achieved  every country mustdeliver on its pledges in good faith and not try tonegotiate a way out.For Samoa  the gains include the reaffirmationthat small island developing States (SIDS) are a specialcase in the area of sustainable development  owingto their unique and particular vulnerabilities. Butacknowledging the vulnerabilities of SIDS without theattendant resources for strengthening their resiliencemakes that achievement only a hollow victory. Theoceans and seas are resources that most members ofour group have access to. The call to conserve andharness the marine biodiversity beyond nationaljurisdictions  including taking a decision on developingan international instrument under the Convention onthe Law of the Sea  is a major achievement  worthy ofsupport.The decision to hold a SIDS review meeting in2014 is important and timely. Samoa’s offer to hostthat meeting is a matter of record. Coincidentally  2014holds special significance for our country. Barringany natural catastrophes  we will graduate from thecategory of least-developed countries (LDCs) on1 January of that year. That was one of the motives forour bid to host the SIDS review meeting. We want tounderscore that  through genuine partnerships withdevelopment partners  our small island developingState  which is also an LDC  has been able to markedlyraise our country’s socioeconomic situation and ourpeople’s standard of living. It is important that everyMember State be afforded the opportunity to hostUnited Nations meetings  and the success of meetingsshould be measured on the quality of the decisions andcommitments agreed to  not merely on considerationsof costs and numbers of participants.The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) arenot merely aspirations of what might be  but tangible outcomes of what should be. By their very nature  theyare a restatement of our peoples’ development needsand hopes. Thus for us  the achievement of the MDGsby 2015 is not just a matter of pride but one of necessity and we will continue to do everything possible to bringabout the desired result. Success would also mean thatwe would start the post-2015 sustainable developmentgoals framework at higher thresholds  which wouldhelp spur greater effort to improve the lives of moreand more of our people.The sustainable development goals that will succeedthe MDGs are already a major focus of attention in somequarters. From Samoa’s perspective  clear  time-bound targeted and measurable global benchmarks are critical.We must ensure that the post-2015 development agendabuilds on the important progress made in the MDGprocess and is expanded to cover broader sustainabledevelopment issues  as agreed on in Rio. We mustalso ensure that the important priorities identified inthe outcomes of the 2014 SIDS meeting are integratedinto the post-2015 global development frameworks andcomprehensively addressed in order to respond to theneeds of SIDS.Climate change is the world’s most urgent problem requiring a decisive global response. It is a challengethat should unite and not divide us. Entrenchedpositions that ignore today’s realities and pursueunrelated agendas have no role in our collective effort.All countries are affected to varying degrees by climatechange. No one should be detached or unconcernedabout our common plight. We must work together  witha sense of urgency and commitment  to address climatechange — today  not tomorrow. It should not be onlyscience that recommends what we should do  but alsoour consciences and the political will to follow through.We clearly want leaders who view the world as a singleconstituency where everyone works together within thelimits of their capacity and capability to be part of thetotal solution.The climate change negotiating process has been along and frustrating journey  especially for small islanddeveloping States  which contribute the least to thecauses of climate change yet stand to suffer the most and are least able to effectively adapt to its adverseimpacts. Climate change cannot be wished away. Eventhose countries that have been in denial to date mustsurely now accept the weight of scientific evidence.Climate change  facilitated largely through humanactivity  poses one of the gravest threats to humankindand to the continuation of life in our world as we knowit today.Samoa’s unwavering support for United Nationspeacekeeping work is underscored by its 12 years ofuninterrupted police deployment in service of missionsin Liberia  the Sudan  Timor-Leste and South Sudan.Our commitment is rooted in our firm belief in the rolethat United Nations peacekeeping plays in helping toeliminate the causes of conflict and in bringing aboutpeace and stability. A peaceful environment helps toimprove the lives of those who have been affected byconflict and  ultimately  to achieve our common goal ofpeaceful coexistence for our peoples and nations.We are determined to gradually increase over timethe level and number of our officers in peacekeepingduties. Regionally owned and coordinated solutions toregional upheavals can be quite effective and successful.The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands under the umbrella of the Pacific Islands Forum demonstrates the effectiveness of that approach verywell  and Samoa will continue to provide strong supportto regionally owned solutions when required.Samoa reaffirms its unequivocal condemnation ofterrorism in all its forms. Our continuing determinationto work with other Member States to fight terrorismusing all possible means is consistent with human rightsand the rule of law. The horror of terrorist atrocitiesis a common and almost daily occurrence. Terroristacts committed under whatever pretext or purpose aredeplorable and morally unjustified. In its various formsand manifestations  terrorism is responsible for thepermanent scars of horror and fear that have grippedinternational attention in recent years. Those attackshave underlined the fact that when terrorists are able toinfiltrate national borders  no peoples or countries willever be immune to the threat of terrorist violence.So many innocent lives have been lostindiscriminately and unceremoniously. More than ever terrorism is a major threat that must be confrontedby a collective international response at the national regional and international levels. It must be condemnedin the strongest terms possible in order to send outan unequivocal message that it is neither acceptednor condoned and that perpetrators should not expectany sympathy for their actions. The tragic events inBenghazi recall and underscore the importance of all nations working together  including through the UnitedNations  to implement practical and effective measuresto provide for the protection  security and safety ofdiplomatic and consular missions and representativesworldwide. Samoa will continue to work withlike-minded countries towards that goal.Samoa’s membership of the United Nations isgrounded on the promise of the hope  equality andjustice that the United Nations offers its Member States irrespective of their economic  political or militarystrength. States in leadership positions and thoseaspiring to that status must lead responsibly and byexample. Every Member State  irrespective of its sizeor strength  should be able to contribute appropriatelyto decisions and actions of the United Nations in orderto make our Organization an agent of change duringchallenging times. The United Nations continues to playan important role in our collective effort to achieve itsobjectives  whether in the areas of peace and security the environment  poverty alleviation  the fight againstterrorism and many other challenges that threaten ourworld.This week  at the treaty event  I deposited Samoa’sinstrument of ratification for the Kampala amendmentsto the Rome Statute of the International CriminalCourt. We ratified those amendments because we placegreat faith in the rule of law and the vital protectionthat the law offers to all States  especially to the weakand small.Lately  serious disputes have arisen amongbordering States  with the potential to escalate intoconfrontation with far-reaching consequences. Wewould encourage the parties concerned to resolve theirdifferences through appropriate peaceful settlementarrangements.Clearly  Member States can do only so much.We need a committed Secretariat that is aware andsensitive to the needs of the peoples it exists to serve.That is why Samoa supports the Secretary-General’svision to create a flexible and mobile professionalcareer service to allow for quick and positive responsesto the diverse demands of Member States. The needfor the United Nations to deliver as one entity cannotbe overemphasized. It adds value and quality to theprocess  eliminates waste  minimizes duplication  andensures that the scarce resources entrusted to its careare used optimally to supplement Member States’ hard-earned contributions.The United Nations remains the only viableinstitution that draws all the nations of our worldtogether. The need to revitalize the General Assemblyand reform the Security Council has been obvious formany years. In the case of the Security Council  aslong as its composition and rules ignore today’s globalrealities  it will continue to struggle for legitimacy andstrain to effectively carry out its intended tasks  as hasbeen witnessed over many years.Samoa remains firm in its position that thepermanent and non-permanent membership categoriesof the Security Council should be expanded. MemberStates with appropriate credentials and the dispositionto contribute to the Council’s work and resourcesshould be encouraged to apply for membership of thatimportant organ of our Organization. Importantly  theintergovernmental process should continue in earnestduring the current session to bring finality to an issuethat has taxed Member States’ patience and endurancefor over a decade and a half.If the United Nations is to be truly reformed  we alsoneed a strengthened and revitalized General Assemblyas the primary policy and decision-making organ ofthe Organization. Moreover  we encourage the effortsunder way to streamline the work of the different UnitedNations agencies to eliminate the wasting of resourcesand unnecessary duplication of time and effort.We often congregate around points of commonality finding legitimacy and safety in numbers. It isdiversity  however  that has historically ensured humanadaptability  resilience and true dynamism. Our ownPacific region is going through a process of maturity where subregionalism is evolving and the uniquenessof capacity and comparative advantages are coming tothe fore. The same can be said of our United Nationsfamily and its dynamic leadership. Diversity can createa platform for collective progress if  in the words ofPresident Obama  “we ensure that we are strengthenedby our differences  not defined by them”.As we heard from other leaders  including theSecretary-General and the President of the UnitedStates  it is of critical importance that the Palestiniansbe allowed to realize their right to a viable State oftheir own  existing alongside a secure and safe JewishState of Israel. That has also been and continues tobe Samoa’s long-standing position on the issue. Weremain hopeful that current efforts to secure a peaceful durable and fair settlement in the Middle East will be successful. All efforts towards that goal rekindle hopeand should be supported. A peace deal is central toproviding conditions conducive to the achievement ofa two-State solution.We wish the President well as he leads the work ofour General Assembly. We also wish to place on recordour appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon forthe leadership he brings to the work of our Organization and to wish him success in the discharge of his keyresponsibilities in the challenging times ahead."
"190",7528,"YEM",67,2012,"﻿To beginwith  I offer my deep congratulations to Mr. VukJeremić on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly to steer its work at its sixty-seventh session.We trust in his capacity to ably manage the affairs ofthe Assembly during this session. I would like also tothank Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser  President ofthe General Assembly at its previous session  for all ofhis efforts. We also commend Mr. Ban Ki-moon for hiswise management of the affairs of the United Nationsand his interest in the developments in my country.During the past few weeks the Islamic world hasexperienced a wave of outrage and anger as the result ofa film containing explicit denigrations directed at theMuslim Prophet Muhammad  peace be upon him  andthe values of true Islam. It is deplorable that a campaignexists with the aim of deliberately insulting Islam andMuslims in order to distort their image worldwide andto sow seeds of hatred between nations and religions.Yet given all of that  such behaviour has attractedpeople who defend the film based on the justificationof freedom of expression. Those people  however  mustnot overlook the fact that there should be limits on thefreedom of expression  especially if such freedom isused to blaspheme the beliefs of nations and defametheir religious figures and symbols.While my country has strongly denouncedthe film  it has also called for respect for religionsand religious figures  enhanced understanding anddialogue between religions and civilizations  and theadoption of international instruments to prevent anyfurther similar practice or abuse of the right to freedomof expression. My country also calls for adherence topeaceful expressions of opinion  while denouncingviolence and incitement to hatred that contradict thevalues of true Islam.The current session of the Assembly is being heldwithin the context of important global developmentsand events that are directly affecting political economic  social  security and environmental situationsin all nations of the world. Those circumstances haveresulted in various pressures on all international actorsand have destructively impacted the least developedcountries — the so-called the countries of theSouth — including my country  the Republic of Yemen.These days we are celebrating the fiftiethanniversary of the 26 September 1962 Revolution andthe forty-ninth anniversary of the 14 October 1963Revolution. I therefore take the opportunity to extend from this international rostrum  my warmest greetingsand best wishes to the great people of Yemen on thisoccasion. No doubt  the 50 years since the Yemenirevolution have contributed to sparking the Yemenipeople’s aspirations for change and for freedom equality and national dignity that resulted in a newreality where the wheel of change continues to turn despite all difficulties obstacles and barriers.Recently  we experienced the historic achievementof a peaceful transfer of power for the first time in thecountry. That transition would not have been possiblewithout the Yemeni people’s determination to fulfilthe goals of the revolution: freedom  sovereignty an end to autocratic and family rule forever  and theestablishment of a republican regime governed by theConstitution under a new social contract between theState and its people.All Members know that Yemen is one of the so-called Arab Spring countries. We Yemenis experienceda difficult situation for over a year that could haveled to catastrophe. However  the country avoided thattrajectory because the disputing parties were wiseenough to follow a role model designed to reach anagreement. Thus  they accepted the political settlementunder the initiative of the Cooperation Council for theArab States of the Gulf (GCC) and its implementationmechanism  which had become the accepted referencefor all parties and enjoyed international support.Early presidential elections were conductedrepresenting a public referendum for change. Thereferendum granted the new authorities full legitimacyto pursue the implementation of the provisions of theGCC initiative with a view to steering the countrytowards the safe side and a brighter future wherepeople have faith in their future and can freely and withconviction choose their rulers and thus contribute tobuilding the new Yemen.In that respect  please allow me to express mygratitude and appreciation to the Custodian of the TwoHoly Mosques  King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saudof Saudi Arabia  the leaders of the GCC countriesand the Secretary General of the GCC  Mr. AbdellatifZayani  for all of the various forms of attention andsupport they have extended towards the politicalsettlement of the crisis.Thanks also go to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon;the five permanent members of the Security Council;Mr. Jamal Benomar  Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on Yemen; the League of Arab States and itsSecretary General; and the European Union for allof their efforts to bolster the political settlement andprovide the necessary economic support to Yemen inall areas  including for convening the national dialogueconference.The conference will outline the future of Yemen byaddressing various situations such as conflict  war andpending problems  including the monopoly of powerand wealth. The aim is to build a modern civil Statebased on the principles of the rule of law  equality inclusion  equal opportunity  the fair distribution ofwealth  participation in decision-making and managingelements linked to the new State’s sovereignty at thenational level under a political regime to be decided bythe people of Yemen in the awaited national dialogueconference. I stress that the doors of the nationaldialogue conference are open to all Yemeni partiesand all issues and demands. The conference shall bethe means for correcting mistakes  achieving nationalreconciliation and developing the principles of amodern civil Yemeni State  under a unified Yemen  asstipulated by Security Council resolutions.The current political arrangements in Yemenfor the implementation of the settlement agreementand resolutions 2014 (2011) and 2051 (2012) have thesupport of the brothers and friends of Yemen. However Yemen still faces many political  economic  securityand social obstacles and impediments. Those obstaclesrepresent weaknesses and jeopardize the progressand prosperity of Yemen in the coming decades. It isa fact that 95 per cent of the Yemeni people have thewillingness and ambitions to move with the rest of theworld into the twenty-first century. The political andsocial problems and the escalating political conflicts anarchy and acts of violence and extremism shall neverstand as obstacles in the way of the Yemeni people.Therefore  the right way to address the situation inYemen is to adopt an overarching vision that takes intoaccount all circumstances and conditions related to thecountry’s history and geography and the challenges ofthe present and the future. A key factor is the strategiclocation of Yemen at the juncture of trade routes and in the heart of international sea navigation routes. Yemenfaces the security challenges of organized crime  piracyand terrorist acts  in addition to the influx of illegalmigrants and refugees to its coasts.There is an increasing trend of unemploymentamong young people under 30  who represent 70 percent of the total population of the country. The youthlook forward to a better future and a modern civil State.That requires the international community and donorcountries to understand those factors and to provideurgently needed support to our country in variousfields  including in the areas of establishing a moderncivil State based on democracy  good governance respect for human rights and social justice. Thereis a need to abandon the traditional standard andbureaucratic mechanisms adopted by donor countriesand international parties supporting the path towardssettlement in Yemen.As for us  we stand ready to provide a favourableand appropriate atmosphere for their work  absent ofany complex Government bureaucracy  by adopting ahigh level of transparency and removing any obstaclesthey may face. I confirm that it is investment thatresults in stability  and not vice versa.Terrorists  who have pervaded our country for morethan 10 years and were recently poised to seize controlof different Yemeni regions and provinces  represent ahuge threat to local  regional and international peaceand stability. Although  following the heroic acts of theYemeni armed forces and local popular committees anda series of defeats  Al-Qaida is today much weaker thanbefore  we cannot underestimate its desperation. Due toits failure to adapt after its successive defeats  Al-Qaidahas equipped its members with explosive belts andtransformed them into time bombs against innocentand unarmed people. That has resulted in Al-Qaidalosing any local or national sympathy.We reaffirm our commitment to eradicatingterrorist elements and demand that its sources ofinternal and external support be eliminated. We inviteour international partners in the fight against terrorismto provide more logistical and technical support to oursecurity forces and counterterrorism units  and thatthey expand intelligence cooperation and coordinationin that field.I cannot pass up the opportunity to draw attentionto the humanitarian crisis in Yemen as a result of theterrorism and acts of violence in Sadah and the events of the past year that have resulted in the displacementof more than 500 000 people from their villages  inaddition to the increasing number of refugees fromthe Horn of Africa region. That led the United Nationsand its agencies to launch an appeal for approximately$600 million. However  the funding gap stands at50 per cent of the required amount. I therefore callon brotherly and friendly countries to respond to theappeal of the United Nations to enable it to meet thebasic needs of internally displaced persons and refugeesin our country.It has been more than six decades since the GeneralAssembly  which I have the honour to address today issued the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Itis deplorable that  after all these years  many nationsstill suffer violations of their rights and dignity. ThePalestinian people have been subjected to a gruesomeescalation of Israeli violence. Israeli settlements areexpanding  innocent Palestinians are maimed  activistsare besieged  prisoners and detainees are oppressedand the attempts of the Israeli side to demolish theAl-Aqsa Mosque are continuing. That requires astronger role and a more united and effective presenceof the United Nations and its various agencies againstIsraeli arrogance and f louting of the resolutions ofthe international community and its rejection of allpeaceful proposals and initiatives.The lack of international pressure on Israelrepresents a key failure in international justice standards.The role of the United Nations and international forcesin achieving justice and freedom requires the exertionof pressure to implement international resolutions. Inthat regard  I ask: has Israel forgotten that its Statewas created on the basis of an international resolution?We declare our full support for the application of theState of Palestine to become a full State Member ofthe United Nations in order to affirm its legitimacyand to ensure respect for its recognized rights underinternational law.We also call on the United Nations to adoptappropriate solutions to end the crisis and internal warin Syria and to put an end to all forms of violence againstthousands of civilians in Syria  including women andchildren. Proposed initiatives and announced peacefulsolutions shall be revived to end the crisis and tomake a success of the mission of the Joint SpecialRepresentative of the United Nations and the League ofArab States for Syria  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi.I reiterate the call on all concerned parties in Syria the Government and the insurgents  to heed and respondto repeated calls to initiate dialogue and make mutualconcessions as the only way to stop the bloodshed.The only option for our brothers in Syria is to agreeon an initiative to mark the path towards change and apeaceful transfer of power through the ballot box.There is no doubt that Somalia has been living indire crisis since the early 1990s. Yemen and Somaliahave deep historical relations and both providestrategic depth for each other. On that basis  Yemenplayed a leading role in restoring peace and stabilityin Somalia by supporting the reconciliation effortsand hosting various rounds of negotiations betweendifferent parties. Yemen did not stop there; it opened itsdoors to more than a million Somali refugees  despitethe difficult circumstances Yemen is encountering andall the economic  health and security impacts of therefugee process.While we congratulate the Somali people on theirsuccess on their accomplishing a peaceful transfer ofpower and electing Mr. Hassan Sheik Mohamud as theirnew President in a democratic environment  we hopethat those elections will lead to reconstruction of Stateinstitutions; the restoration of peace and security toSomalia; and an end to the humanitarian suffering andits consequences  including the suffering of a millionSomali refugees in our country. We reaffirm theRepublic of Yemen’s position of support for the electedSomali president and the Government he is forming. Wewill spare no effort to enhance relations between ourtwo brotherly countries for our mutual benefit and inthe interests of security and stability and of counteringterrorism and piracy in the region.In that context  the continuing and intensive influxof migrants and asylum seekers into Yemen representsa real threat to national security  peace and stabilityin the region. It is essential that the internationalcommunity share that burden with Yemen  especiallysince Yemen’s resources are being drained. Under theexceptional conditions that Yemen is dealing with  it isextremely difficult for us to cope with the continuedf low of arrivals.The brutal ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Myanmarmakes it incumbent on the international community topay attention to that humanitarian tragedy and takeconcrete steps to stop the series of violent and savageacts being committed against that group. Considering the acts of ethnic brutality and other practices that haveoccurred in recent months  it is not enough to issuestatements condemning and denouncing them. Aninternational committee should be set up to investigatehuman rights violations against Muslims in thatcountry  deliver humanitarian aid to them and provideguarantees to protect them against further violence andatrocities.Finally  I would like to reiterate my thanks to thePresident of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General. We greatly appreciate the role of the UnitedNations as an international platform that brings togetherall countries and nations of the globe for the sake ofpeace  security  freedom  human rights and coexistencebetween nations  religions and civilizations and theircommon interests."
"191",7566,"YUG",67,2012,"﻿Your presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session  Sir  isa great honour for Serbia. In congratulating you onthe appointment to that post  I express my belief thatyou will discharge such responsible duties with fullcommitment to respect for the values and principlesenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. I amsure that you  Mr. President  will rise to the tasksentrusted to you by all Member States that supportedyour appointment.The Republic of Serbia pays particular attentionto strengthening cooperation within the framework ofthe United Nations. The Charter of the United Nations which unites us  its purposes and principles and theinternational system based on it are the only foundationfor the development of international relations  thepromotion of human rights and the maintenance of peaceand security. Those purposes cannot become obsolete.They must always remain current  and therefore requirethat we be resolute in our goal to join forces and effortsin order to ensure a brighter and safer future for allhumanity.The world in which we live and the changes broughtabout by development in many areas on a daily basismake it incumbent upon us to change together and toface the numerous challenges that none of us can dealwith individually. For that reason  we must alwaysbear in mind the responsibilities vested in us as therepresentatives of our countries and the consequencesof the decisions that we take.The challenges facing the world have been furtherexacerbated by the continuing global crisis havinglonger lasting consequences than expected. Today more than ever before  we need cooperation andunderstanding in order to overcome problems and toachieve the Millennium Development Goals.We have no choice but to get to grips with problemsand end the recession  which can be measured againstthe crisis of the 1930s  and to hope that it will not lastlonger than that calamity. The crisis  from bankingto the balance of payments  mortgages and debts  isaffecting all countries without exception. However  byfar the greatest burden is borne by the most vulnerable:poor countries and countries in transition that have noteven caused it.We are faced with a serious threat to internationalintegration and to the further definition of national andsupranational policies. The problem is not insoluble.The solution lies in greater responsibility  coordinatedinternational activities and the appropriate correlationbetween the actions of countries and their nationalinterests.The growing poverty in many countries andthe widening gap between the rich and the poor arebecoming increasingly alarming and an unwarrantedand unacceptable trait of the great scientific andtechnological progress of the modern world. In manycases  we see sanctions and isolation exacerbating theproblem.Poverty reduction is one of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. In that context  I would like topoint out the importance of support for and solidaritywith underdeveloped and developing countries. We needsolidarity. Be mindful that today  poverty and starvationare not only a characteristic of underdevelopedcountries. The continuing global economic crisis hasalso highlighted the issues of poverty and a lack offood and drinking water in some developed and  untilrecently  wealthy countries. Those phenomena are  atthe same time  a real source of serious security risks.Consequently  I take this opportunity to call upon therich and powerful countries drawing special benefitfrom globalization to direct a part of their wealthtowards the economic and social development ofunderdeveloped countries.A more equitable distribution of assets  solidarityand support to underdeveloped and developing countriesshould be jointly agreed upon along  with systematicallyplanned and organized solutions. Such measures wouldfoster implementation of the principles enshrined inthe Charter of the United Nations in the real world oftoday. An economy based on renewable energy sources energy efficiency  responsible utilization of resourcesand socially responsible commerce would significantlycontribute to reducing poverty and starvation in theworld.I underline our political commitment to the idea ofsustainable development and welcome the initiative ofthe Secretary-General of the United Nations regardingrenewable energy sources for all. I hope that it  alongwith other provisions of the Declaration adopted atthe United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment  will be among the agenda items to whichthe General Assembly will pay special attention at itssixty-seventh session.I consider it our joint obligation to preserve planetEarth in a way that it deserves. The idea of a betterworld involves this planet that we will preserve for thenext generation. We should understand that the Earthshould be treated like a living organism  and we can only hope for the better if we look after it on a dailybasis.Within the limits of its possibilities  Serbia willcontribute to research into renewable sources of energy devoting special attention to the education of youngergenerations on ways of achieving harmony amongefforts in planet conservation  development and profit.Climate change is one of the problems affectingus today that we were not sufficiently aware of in thepast. In the opinion of many  climate change is thedirect consequence of irresponsible behaviour on thepart of mankind towards nature and the immediateenvironment.I wish to stress our principled position that it is thecollective obligation of all of us to fight the negativeimpact of climate change through cooperation  tirelessresearch  the sharing of knowledge and experience andby defining and strictly applying measures designed torespond to the new climatic conditions. The survivaland progress of mankind are the eternal ideals of eachhuman community  while sustainable development is anecessary precondition to achieving those ideals.Poverty  famine and limited access to clean waterpose grave threats to human health. Anything is possiblefor a healthy man  although he may have many problems;however a sick man has only one problem — how toget healthy. Therefore  I would like to particularlyemphasize the importance of quality medical care forchildren and women  in particular mothers  as well asthe importance of the continuing struggle against allcommunicable and non-communicable diseases.When it comes to the progress of humanity  theimportance of education must not be ignored. I believethat investing in education is the best way to invest infuture development. Furthermore  access to knowledgeand education should not be the privilege of the chosen but the standard available to all. Only when a computerand book replace a gun in the hands of young peoplewill happier pages of human history be written.For several decades  my country has spared no effortin contributing  within its capabilities  to multinationaloperations mandated by the United Nations. Thousandsof Serbian soldiers have been deployed in missions to allcontinents. Even today  under new national legislationin line with modern defence and security strategies members of the Serbian Army and the Serbian police aretaking part in the international effort to keep the peacefrom the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Liberiaand Côte d’Ivoire  to Lebanon  Cyprus and Haiti. Ouractive participation in the coming period will be evengreater and more visible.Despite the great efforts made by nearly allcountries  terrorism continues to pose a threat tointernational stability. That phenomenon is not onlycharacterized by sporadic attacks  but today representsa danger to the core values of the United Nations anda threat to international peace  security and the rule oflaw.Terrorism is an attack against fundamental humanrights  including the right to life and individual civil political  economic  social and cultural rights. Inaddition  it undermines the development of countries inevery sense of the word. Given the fact that all countriesare vulnerable to various manifestations of terrorism only by joining forces will we be able to fight that evil.Serbia has aligned its legislation regulatingits security sector with the relevant internationalinstruments. Through regional cooperation  my countrystrives to contribute to global and regional effortsaimed at countering terrorism. In that context  it is ofvital importance to make progress on the adoption of acomprehensive convention on international terrorism.At the same time  Serbia has undertaken variousactivities to suppress organized crime  which is oftenlinked with terrorism  as well as to fight trafficking innarcotic drugs  human beings and arms.Encouraging dialogue among various cultures andfaiths is increasingly important in today’s world. TheRepublic of Serbia is a country of religious people  whoworship God in Christian churches and cathedrals orin mosques and synagogues. I can proudly say that mycountry is a place where various cultures and religionshave intermingled  and spiritual and material heritageshave incorporated traditions and elements derivedfrom various completely different religious and ethnicaffiliations  which have continued to intermix andwhose wealth will be passed on to future generations.No one should suffer or be humiliated becauseof their religion. Religious feelings are sacrosanctand safeguarded as fundamental human rights. Nolife should be lost in religiously motivated clashes.Irresponsible individuals ridicule relics that othersworship  yet certain people who have been hurt havereacted inappropriately. That is why we stronglycondemn attacks on innocent people  who should be especially protected. On behalf of the Serbian people I offer our sympathies to the United States over thekilling of the United States Ambassador to Libya.Serbia plays an active role in regional organizations including the Organization of the Black Sea EconomicCooperation. That regional cooperation mechanism isbased on the principles of understanding and mutualrespect aimed at achieving common goals. Serbiahas successfully presided over regional initiatives including the Organization of the Black Sea EconomicCooperation  the Central European Initiative  theMigration  Asylum  Refugees Regional Initiative  theSouth-East European Cooperation Process and theAdriatic and Ionian Initiative.Serbia truly wishes to become a full-fledgedmember of the European Union (EU) and is patientlybuilding relations of confidence and peace in a regionthat is burdened with the heavy legacy of the past.Serbia wishes to head for a better and more prosperousfuture  on an equal footing with all nations of the world.Much has been achieved so far in the implementationof reforms  the fight against crime and corruption andthe harmonization of its laws with the regulations of theEuropean Union.In that sense  Serbia has performed even better thansome countries that have already become EU members.Unfortunately  despite its strong commitment to strictcompliance with international law and all fundamentalinstruments regarding the work of the United Nations the Republic of Serbia is now faced with a violationof certain fundamental principles enshrined in theCharter of the United Nations in a part of its territory.On 17 February 2008  the authorities of the self-proclaimed Republic of Kosovo unilaterally declaredthe independence of the territory of Serbia’s southernprovince. I am not a prophet  but I must say that theunilateral declaration of independence by the provinceof Kosovo constitutes a dangerous precedent and along-standing threat to the stability of the region of theWestern Balkans and beyond.That unilateral act also violated the bedrockprinciples of the Helsinki Final Act and SecurityCouncil resolution 1244 (1999). I wish to emphasize thatthe majority of Member States of the United Nationshave refrained from recognizing the unilaterallydeclared independence of Kosovo  thus remainingtrue to the obligation to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia  which isan obligation derived from the Charter.I take this opportunity to express our gratitudeto those countries for their support and solidarity  aswell as my hope that  in spite of any pressure and witha view to maintaining peace and stability  they willnot recognize any solution that is not the outcome ofnegotiations and a clearly defined agreement betweenthe Serb and the Albanian parties.Serbia is a peace-loving country that is open to theeast  west  north and south and has friends all over theworld. It stands ready to discuss all outstanding issueswith all parties and will do its utmost to ensure that allits citizens live well  including in Kosovo and Metohija.According to our Constitution  Kosovo and Metohija isan integral part of Serbia  and the territorial integrityand the sovereignty of United Nations Members formthe cornerstones of key international documents. Serbiais a sovereign and independent State and a Member ofthe United Nations  with defined and internationallyrecognized borders and a part of its territory is underthe administration of the family to which it belongs  theUnited Nations.As a Member of the United Nations  Serbia is avictim of the application of double standards. Theprinciple of respect for territorial integrity implies thenon-acceptance of bids for secession and the preventionof efforts to change the internationally recognizedborders of other States. For the country I represent peace and respect for international law come beforeall other interests and objectives. Political and armedviolence are not nor will ever be acceptable means forachieving State interests in international affairs. Ourbattle against the unilaterally declared independence ofKosovo and Metohija is part of the general struggle topreserve the principle of respect tor territorial integrity.Today  the struggle for the territorial integrity of Serbiais also the struggle for peace in all countries of theworld and for the rule of law in international relations.Serbia is proud of having excellent and substantiverelations with most countries and it is proud of its ownhistory. As is true in all nations  some individual Serbianshave made mistakes and even committed crimes. Wehave turned over those of our own citizens suspectedof having breached international law to internationaljustice. For that reason  we rightfully expect justicefor our country and its people  who were on the side oflaw and justice in both World Wars. We paid a heavy price fighting fascist and totalitarian ideologies  losingalmost half of our population  and we fought shoulderto shoulder with the Allies  along with whom we thenfounded this Organization. A community is based onjustice  which implies reconciliation and trust. Howis it possible that the rules of international law andjustice have been violated to such an extent that  in thecase of Serbs in Serbia  one can reasonably speak ofdiscrimination?American President Dwight Eisenhower said  in aspeech delivered on 31 October 1956 “There can be no peace without law and there can beno law if we were to apply one code of internationalconduct to those who oppose us and another for ourfriends.”Is it possible to have negotiations in which one party getseverything  including territory and even many of theother party’s people  and the other party gets nothing inreturn  except further pressure and new conditions? Weare more and more frequently forced by the powerfuland mighty to face the tough choice between giving upKosovo and Metohija and membership in the EuropeanUnion. What kind of a choice is that? Am I to tell ourcitizens that they are going to live better if they abandontheir own interests? Has Serbia ever asked anyone tomake such a decision? I hope that no one in this Hallwill ever have to face such a choice.Serbia is seeking a lasting  sustainable andacceptable solution to all problems. It aspires tomake progress towards a European future and is fullycommitted to a process that will result in enduring peacebetween Serbs and Albanians. The Republic of Serbiaand myself  as its democratically elected President  areready to participate constructively in the negotiatingprocess  because Serbia cannot move forward withoutKosovo and Metohija  and the inhabitants of Kosovoand Metohija cannot move forward without Serbia. Westrongly desire that the talks be continued in good faithand with good intentions  taking into account  amongother things  that it is important to carry forwardEuropean integration involving Serbia and the WesternBalkans as a whole in order to ensure long-termprogress and stability for the entire region.Serbia has made committments and will fulfilall obligations it has undertaken as a State in theagreements reached thus far  even though to myeye they represent essentially the wish list of theAlbanian party with some concessions made by our leadership at that time under heavy pressure. At thesame time  it should be understood that Serbia is notready to recognize  and cannot nor will ever under anycircumstances recognize  either explicitly or implicitly the unilaterally declared independence of its southernprovince of Kosovo and Metohija. The issue of Kosovoand Metohija can be resolved and will be resolved ina peaceful manner. Serbia will enter the follow-upnegotiations ready to help all citizens of Kosovo andMetohija to live a better life in democratic and secureconditions  but it will not negotiate the implementationof the independence of the so-called State of Kosovo.The situation will come to an end  even thoughwe constantly hear that the status of Kosovo isnon-negotiable and that it is not up to us to decide it.I wonder  then  what the subject matter of negotiationscould be and what entity has any authority to determineit? Serbia offers a concrete proposal: direct negotiationsat the highest political level. An agreement can bereached only through consensus without unilateraldecisions and actions.I take this opportunity also to condemn moststrongly the attempt by the so-called Republic ofKosovo to dispossess Serbs of the tangible heritage ofthe Serbian medieval State  the spiritual heritage of theSerbian people and the property of the Serbian OrthodoxChurch in the territory of the southern Serbian provinceof Kosovo. I can only understand the attempt to turn fourmonasteries of the Serbian Orthodox Church into a partof the cultural heritage of the so-called Kosovo Stateas an effort f lagrantly to falsify history  as historicalrevisionism and as an attempt to obliterate any traceof the existence of the Serbian people in Kosovo andMetohija.I am particularly concerned over the fact that even now in the twenty-first century  such an attemptto falsify history and to steal the cultural heritage of anation is taking place before the very eyes of the entireinternational community. That sets a very dangerousprecedent  encouraging each and every secessionistgroup in the future to take over the history of theexpelled people after illegally separating the territoryfrom the State in question. In the case of Kosovo 220 000 people were driven out of their homes.Serbia urges an investigation into the allegationscontained in the report by Mr. Dick Marty  SpecialRapporteur of the Parliamentary Assembly of theCouncil of Europe. Some people ought to have a guilty conscious because of the fact that two years haveelapsed since the publication of the report cataloguingcases of harvesting and trafficking in human organsbefore  during and after the events of 1999. We aresimply asking for the truth. We seek to uncover thedestiny of hundreds of Serbs missing from Kosovo andMetohija  who are reasonably believed to be the victimsof illicit trafficking in human organs and of othercrimes committed in Kosovo and Metohija. In the nameof my people  I simply demand justice for the innocentvictims. For the sake of the truth an investigation shouldbe carried out  bearing in mind that Serbs were alwaysunjustly portrayed as the sole perpetrators of crimes and never as victims Serbia is merely asking for the same obligations andrights for itself as for others  for the same appreciationof its interests as for those of others and for the samekind of attention to itself as to others  so as not tobecome unworthy of its ancestors and so as not to failin its debt to its born and unborn children.I conclude by affirming that the Republic of Serbiawill make a self less contribution to achieving theobjectives of the General Assembly and its MemberStates. I am convinced that the accomplishment ofthose objectives is only possible through respect for thefundamental principles of the United Nations Charterand through an active involvement of all Members inthe promotion of multilateral cooperation."
"192",7594,"ZAF",67,2012,"﻿I thank you  sir  for the opportunityto address the General Assembly at its sixty-seventhgeneral debate. Let me start by congratulating Mr. VukJeremić and the Republic of Serbia on his election topreside over the sixty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly. We also acknowledge the contribution ofthe President of the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser.South Africa fundamentally believes in theprinciples and purposes contained in the Charter ofthe United Nations  and correctly so  given our nation’shistory. This year  we are proudly celebrating 100 yearsof our people’s self less struggle for freedom  led by theAfrican National Congress movement. We recall withgreat appreciation the immense contribution of the United Nations to the creation of a free and democraticSouth Africa.In 1966  the General Assembly labelled apartheida crime against humanity in resolution 2202 A (XXI) which ultimately led to the International Conventionon the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime ofApartheid  later known as the Apartheid Convention.The United Nations defined the crime of apartheidas “inhuman acts committed for the purpose ofestablishing and maintaining domination by one racialgroup of persons over any other racial group of personsand systematically oppressing them” (resolution 3068(XXVIII)  annex  article II). The Apartheid Conventionwas adopted by the General Assembly on 30 November1973 and set the tone for vociferous action againstapartheid around the world.Let me repeat the words our leader and internationalicon  President Nelson Mandela  uttered in his veryfirst address to the General Assembly  in 1994  the firstby a democratically elected leader and Head of State ofour country. He said “The millions of our people say ‘Thank you’and ‘Thank you again  because the respect for yourown dignity as human beings inspired you to actto ensure the restoration of our dignity as well.’”(A/49/PV.14  p.7)The theme of this session is most appropriate as ittakes us back to the basics — to the founding principlesof the United Nations. The founders intended theUnited Nations to be the foremost multilateral forumentrusted with bringing hope  peace and order to theworld. Indeed  the United Nations enjoys universalmembership and is at the centre of global governanceand multilateralism. The theme reminds us that peace isa choice. We can either choose peace as Member Statesor choose the path of conflict.The founders of the United Nations made that choice67 years ago. They decided that the United Nations mustlead the world to peace. It is important for the UnitedNations and its organs  especially the Security Council to execute the Organization’s mandate of working forpeace without fear or favour. We must not steer awayfrom the founding objectives of the Organization.The United Nations faces immense pressure whenthe world sees the unprecedented loss of lives  as it nowdoes in Africa and the Middle East. It is of concernwhen it appears as if the United Nations were unable to act and assist  and when it comes across as paralysed incertain instances  due to the actions of some MemberStates. We have seen a divided Security Council unableto muster the collective courage to say “no more” towarring parties in the interest of peace. That bringsto the fore the need to continue and deepen the reformof the United Nations and its organs to make it agileand nimble in addressing the contemporary challengesfacing humanity.The debate on the reform of the United Nationsand its organs  in particular the Security Council  hasbeen going on for the past 18 years. However  therehas been no significant movement forward. I wouldlike to focus in particular on the Security Council.Given its mandate  the Council has to be legitimate democratic and transparent. Its current composition hasa propensity for deadlock and paralysis even in the faceof crisis. It remains unrepresentative and undemocraticin both its composition and decision-making.We would like to see a more meaningfulrepresentation of Africa in the Security Council. About70 per cent of the Council’s agenda is taken up by issuesfrom the African continent. The Security Council hasto be expanded in both categories  with at least twoseats for Africa in the permanent category and five inthe non-permanent category. In addition to seats for thecontinent in the composition of the Council  the UnitedNations should also fully recognize and appreciate therole of regional organizations working with the UnitedNations in conflict management and resolution.In that regard  we urge closer collaboration with theAfrican Union (AU) peace and security mechanisms especially given the progress being made by the AUin conflict resolution and peacebuilding in some partsof the continent since its formation 10 years ago.Therefore  cognizance should be taken of Chapter VIIIof the Charter  in particular when dealing with Africanissues.That is why South Africa piloted resolution 2033(2012) during our rotating presidency of the SecurityCouncil in January.Currently  the AU continues to address one of thelongest outstanding conflicts on the continent throughone of its mechanisms  the African Union High-levelImplementation Panel on the Sudan. Together  as theinternational community  we recently celebratedthe creation of the State of South Sudan. We wishto congratulate the Somalis and their leadership onchoosing the path of peace  democracy and prosperity.The international community and the United Nationsmust continue to give the people of Somalia all thenecessary support.Africa is indeed making progress and  with UnitedNations support  that could go further. To promotethe peaceful settlement of disputes  we also wish toemphasize that the Security Council should carry outits Charter mandate within the confines of internationallaw.Any Member State or international body thatimplements Council resolutions should be accountableto the Council  so as to ensure that we avoid theabuse of internationally agreed principles such as theresponsibility to protect and the protection of civilians.Those principles must not be used  amongst otherthings  to justify the notion of regime change. Theyexist to prevent mass atrocities  war crimes  genocideand ethnic cleansing.We should continue the debateon them in order to develop norms and standards foraccountability when actions are taken.It is also of critical importance for the UnitedNations to closely guard its impartiality  independenceand objectivity and not allow itself to be dragged into aconflict to take sides with any party under the guise ofprotecting civilians.The situation in the Middle East  in particular thePalestine-Israeli question  continues to be of concernto us. The United Nations should play a central anddecisive role in efforts to resolve the long-standingconflict in that region. Any act of aggression orviolations of international law should be condemnedunequivocally by the United Nations at all times. Asthe United Nations  we cannot be seen to be strong incondemning some acts while being soft on others. AsSouth Africa  we remain committed to the two-Statesolution based on the 1967 borders  with Palestine andIsrael coexisting side by side in peace.Let me also emphasize that South Africa fullysupports the application by Palestine for full membershipof the United Nations. It is unacceptable that  eventoday  Palestine remains outside the membership of theUnited Nations. We trust that that matter will soon bepositively concluded.In further promotion of the peaceful resolution ofdisputes  we believe that the sovereign right of Statesto nuclear energy for peaceful and civilian use shouldbe respected in accordance with international law.We have taken note that the Director General of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency has been able todraw the conclusion that all declared nuclear materialin Iran is used for peaceful activities. Clarificationof the nature of undeclared materials will enable theinternational community to have full confidencein the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclearprogramme. South Africa therefore encourages Iran tocontinue its cooperation with the Agency.We should also remember that so long as someStates are allowed to operate outside internationallyagreed norms  such as those of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  it will bedifficult to expect others to operate within them. SouthAfrica supports the long-standing call for a nuclear-freezone in the Middle East. In that regard  the peacefulresolution of the Iranian nuclear issue is very important.Let me use this opportunity to reiterate our supportfor the ongoing struggle for self-determination by thepeople of Western Sahara. We urge the internationalcommunity to support their quest for freedom  humanrights and dignity.We also reiterate our call for the lifting of theeconomic and financial embargo against the people ofCuba in order to help the Cuban people to gain theireconomic freedom.Poverty  underdevelopment  lack of opportunitiesand competition for scarce resources contribute tosome of the conflicts in the developing world  includingAfrica. Therefore  the promotion of sustainabledevelopment and the fight against poverty cannot bedivorced from the quest for peace.In 2015  the United Nations will be 70 years oldand will also reach the target year for the achievementof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Worldleaders committed themselves to eradicating extremepoverty  facilitating universal primary education attaining gender equality  improving maternal andchild health  reducing the burden of disease primarilyby combating HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis protecting the environment  and mobilizing globalpartnerships for development by 2015. The Heads ofState also committed themselves to promoting genderequality and the empowerment of women as effectiveways to combat poverty  hunger and disease and tostimulate truly sustainable development. We urge theUnited Nations to continue promoting the achievement of the MDGs and other instruments whose tenetsadvance the human rights of women.We are concerned that sub-Saharan Africa isunlikely to meet the targets for the MDGs. Awarenessof that possibility should not make us give up; in thenext three years  we must accelerate the implementationof the MDGs. We appeal to all who have made financialcommitments to Africa for the achievement of theMDGs not to renege on those commitments. We wouldlike to express our appreciation to those developmentpartners that continue to stick to their 0.7 per centofficial development assistance commitment despitetheir financial difficulties at the domestic level.We support the Secretary-General’s High-levelPanel of Eminent Persons to focus on the accelerationof the implementation of the MDGs  and would urgethat much of its focus be on assisting Africa in meetingall its targets. However  we wish to caution againstprejudging the review outcome and prematurely settingin motion processes that would undermine the ideals ofthe MDGs.The protection and promotion of human rightsand fundamental freedoms should be at the centre ofour collective desire to resolve international disputesby peaceful means. Racism and racial discriminationcontinue to be an affront to the very basic foundingprinciples of the United Nations and must be foughtrelentlessly. We should shun any idea in any part of theworld that seems to suggest that there is a superior raceor human being on the basis of skin colour. The dangerof such ideas is still fresh in our collective memory.We have learned from the evils of colonialism  twoWorld Wars and the system of apartheid. We should allrenew our commitment to continue to build on the solidfoundation laid by the Durban Declaration and the Planof Action that we adopted more than a decade ago atthe end of the World Conference against Racism  RacialDiscrimination  Xenophobia and Related Intolerance.In Durban last December  South Africa hadthe honour of hosting the seventeenth session ofthe Conference of the Parties to the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change and theseventh session of the Conference of the Partiesserving as the Meeting of the Parties to the KyotoProtocol. Member States must ensure that agreementsare implemented. In that regard  the Durban Platformoffers an opportunity for progress that we must utilizeto move forward.Today’s timely debate is a reminder that  ultimately peace is a choice. Peace is achievable. The wise and bravechoices we have the power to make can deliver lastingpeace to every corner of the world. We are called uponat this sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly tochoose peace by reforming and strengthening the UnitedNations so that it can play its rightful role and deliverpeace  security  sustainable development and respectfor human rights and fundamental freedoms throughoutthe world. As the foremost multilateral forum bringingtogether all nations of the world  the United Nations isbest placed to play this role. It requires our support asMember States at all times  both for our sake and forthat of future generations."
"193",7636,"ZMB",67,2012,"﻿I am greatly honoured to deliver myinaugural address to the General Assembly. Allow meto begin by congratulating the President on his electionto oversee the sixty-seventh session of the Assembly and to wish him every success in his position. His greatcountry  Serbia  has historically enjoyed close ties withZambia. We are therefore delighted to see him in thatimportant seat.I would also like to thank His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the steady manner in whichhe has continued to steer our global Organization. InZambia we are particularly appreciative that  despitehis busy schedule  the Secretary-General made time tovisit our country earlier this year to undertake someimportant programmes.About a year ago  I ended my decade-long careeras an opposition politician when the people of Zambiaoverwhelmingly chose to change their politicalleadership through a democratic and peaceful electoraltransition that ushered me into office as the fifthPresident of the Republic. I am indebted to the peopleof Zambia for once again undertaking that process in apeaceful manner.It is my desire to utilize my experience at bothends of the leadership spectrum to make a worthwhilecontribution to our democracy. I trust that Zambia willbe able to share its lessons  as well as to learn from thosewith longer and even better democratic experiences.As the Assembly is aware  we still face considerablechallenges with respect to meeting the basic needs ofthe majority of the Zambian people. Shortly before Itook office  there was much publicity about our positive macroeconomic indicators  but those results did nottrickle down to the average citizen.In the quest to develop at the micro level  the focusof my new Government is on enhancing agriculturalproductivity and access to markets for peasants andsmall-scale farmers  providing improved healthservices as close to the families as possible  improvingthe quality of education and facilitating access to decenthousing and accommodation.As we draw closer to the 2015 deadline for meetingthe Millennium Development Goals  the internationalcommunity needs to maximize its efforts towardsachieving all eight goals. Zambia has made steadyprogress in achieving some of them.That is most visiblein the education sector  which has seen an increase inthe net enrolment of children in primary schools  whilethe health sector has seen reductions in the prevalenceof HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria.Notwithstanding our progress in tacklingcommunicable diseases  Zambia is also attemptingto address non-communicable diseases such ashypertension  diabetes and cancer.While still considering matters related to thehealth sector  allow me to mention that my Governmentrecently reviewed statistics that indicate that Zambianow has the second-highest rate of cervical cancer inthe world. From 22 to 24 July  our capital  Lusaka hosted the sixth annual Stop Cervical Cancer in AfricaConference  made up by the Forum of African FirstLadies against Breast and Cervical Cancer and theAfrican Parliamentarians and Health Ministers againstCancer. Just last year  former United States PresidentGeorge W. Bush travelled to Lusaka to launch thePink Ribbon Red Ribbon campaign against breast andcervical cancer. He has since facilitated some generouscontributions for the facilities now in place to fight thediseases. I would like to express the Zambian people’sdeep appreciation for all those efforts. However  thechallenges in the health sector and elsewhere do not endthere  and by no means have we stood by with foldedarms.Since my Government assumed power  in September2011  our country has seen reasonable improvementsin our economy  with an inflation rate that is down to6.6 per cent and a gross domestic product growth rateof about 6 per cent  in spite of slow global economictrends. That has been attributed to enhancement of theinvestment policy framework and to improvement of the infrastructure and to human capital development.Despite those efforts  however  60.5 per cent of theZambian people continue to live in poverty.My Government attaches similar importance topromoting good governance. As such  we have putin place a robust anti-corruption programme withimproved and increased resources  which shouldset a new stage for our development. In addition  forthe first time  Zambia has entrusted the governanceof our legislative and judicial institutions to ourwomen. The Inspector-General of Police  the ChiefJustice and the Deputy Chief Justice  the chair of theanti-corruption commission and the commissioner ofthe drug enforcement commission are all women. Iremain convinced that they will improve our record andsurpass the nation’s expectations.Our national programmes are also focused oncreating employment for our youth. Despite our vastnatural resources  unemployment continues to be themost pressing problem for the younger generation. Weare therefore looking to improve partnership with thevarious United Nations agencies and the rest of theinternational community to harness best practices fromacross the world. After all  it is the youth of 2012 whohave made Zambia the African football champion.Our Government has recognized that without therule of law  social justice and an independent judicialsystem Zambia will not be able to attain sustainablesocial and economic development. As an initial step inthat regard  our Government is currently undertakinga constitutional review process that is intended toensure the primacy of the individual citizen and hisliberties. We further wish to speed up the process ofdomesticating the international conventions that seekto bridge the gaps for minorities. Special emphasis willalso be placed on improving the treatment of peoplewith mental and physical challenges.Zambia participated in the process leading to theRio+20 United Nations Conference on SustainableDevelopment. Over the years  we have learned toappreciate the transboundary nature of matters suchas our common environment. I would like to expressappreciation to the Government of Brazil  the Chair ofthe Conference and all who made tremendous effortsto bring about the final outcome document of thathistoric conference. We are concerned  however  thatas States Members of the United Nations we missedthe opportunity to develop a formidable international process for promoting sustainable development.The failure to commit any funds to the means ofimplementation  and indeed the little progress inoutlining the sustainable development goals  hasunderscored the lack of ambition in addressing ourdeteriorating environment  worsening inequality anda growing global population that shares the Earth’slimited resources. In that instance  we failed the test forglobal solidarity.Today  Zambia is encouraged that three committedglobal citizens have been appointed as co-Chairs of theSecretary-General’s high-level panel to advise on thepost-2015 global development agenda. We thereforewould like to congratulate His Excellency PresidentSusilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia  HerExcellency President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberiaand His Excellency Prime Minister David Cameron ofthe United Kingdom. We wish them every success asthey take on that onerous task. We must support thehigh-level panel to help recoup the lost opportunities ofthe recent past. As I indicated earlier  we are still a longway from attaining the Millenium Development Goals.Discarding them entirely would be to the detriment ofthe poorer nations. I trust that the Secretary-General’spanel will take that into consideration.The theme for this year’s session of the GeneralAssembly  “Bringing about adjustment or settlement ofinternational disputes or situations by peaceful means” is undeniably significant in the wake of the turmoil thatcontinues to threaten international peace and securitywith the persistent conflict situations on the Africancontinent in places such as the Sudan  South Sudan Guinea-Bissau  Mali and Somalia. I therefore wish toreport that our Government has in certain instancessupported measures to help mitigate the humanitariansituation. I urge the international community toredouble its efforts in bringing peace to those troubledregions.Farther afield  but no less important  is thesituation in Syria  which has seen the indiscriminatekilling of many innocent people. There is a need forconcerted efforts to utilize peaceful means  such asmediation and negotiation  to put a halt to the killingsand to restore peace to the country. Humanity has againbeen embarrassed by the unnecessary carnage. Despitethe trouble spots  Zambia remains convinced that theUnited Nations has since 1945 performed quite well.However  circumstances have since changed greatly  and we need only look at the sovereign representationin this Hall to prove that.It is therefore imperative that ongoing efforts toreform the United Nations be approached with renewedvigour. We are concerned that a seemingly difficultdeadlock has been created in the reform process of theUnited Nations.In addition  I wish to reiterate that despite the slowprocess of the reform of the Security Council  Africashould not relent or become frustrated. We shouldstand up and be counted. As enshrined in the EzulwiniConsensus and the Sirte Declaration  Africa must begiven two permanent seats with a veto immediatelyexercisable and two non-permanent seats to correctthe historical injustice that the continent has sufferedand also adhere to the geopolitical realities of moderntimes. Furthermore  the Council should improve itsworking methods.I wish to appeal to all nations to renew theircommitment and to strive for new common groundwhere individual national interests take a back seat.Just as many international conventions have beensubject to innovative translations in the recent past  wemust plan to be as flexible in creating a new UnitedNations  sooner rather than later. To ignore this needfor transformation would be tantamount to killing theOrganization."
"194",7672,"ZWE",67,2012,"﻿On behalf of my delegationand myself  may I extend to Mr. Jeremić our warmestcongratulations on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Hisextensive experience in both regional and internationalaffairs will undoubtedly enrich the debate and theproceedings during this session. I wish to assure him ofthe full cooperation of Zimbabwe as he discharges theonerous duties of that high office.If I may be allowed  I would like to preface myspeech with a reference to the most glowing and movingspeech that we heard from the President of the UnitedStates yesterday (see A/67/PV.6)  the significance ofwhich was to get us to condemn the tragic death of theUnited States Ambassador to Libya. I am sure that wewere all moved and that we all agree that it was  indeed an appalling event that we all condemn.A year ago  we saw the barbaric and brutal deathof the Head of State of Libya  which is a member ofthe African Union. His death occurred in a context inwhich NATO was operating supposedly in order toprotect civilians. As we join the United States in spiritin condemning the Ambassador’s death  will the UnitedStates also join us in condemning the barbaric death ofthe Head of State of Libya  Al-Qadhafi?That great and tragic loss to Africa occurred incircumstances in which NATO had sought the authorityof the Security Council under Chapter VII to operatein Libya in the protection of civilians  who were saidto be at the mercy of the Government of Libya  led byColonel Al-Qadhafi. The mission was strictly to protectcivilians  but it became a brutal hunt for Al-Qadhafiand his family. NATO caught up with them. Al-Qadhafiand some of his children suffered the brutal deathsabout which we know.As the United States President spoke  I am sure thatthat he was aware that his country  as a NATO Power had  alongside the other NATO Powers  the authorityunder Chapter VII to operate in Libya in order to protectcivilians. But is that what the operation turned out tobe? In a very dishonest manner  we saw the authorityentrusted under Chapter VII being used as a weapon inorder to rout a whole family and to commit the murdersthat occurred in that country. Bombs were hurled in acallous manner. Quite a number of civilians died. Wasthat the protection they had sought under Chapter VIIof the Charter? So the death of Al-Qadhafi must be seenin the same tragic vein as the death of Chris Stevens.We condemn both. Let me begin by reaffirming the rightful andimportant role of the United Nations in the managementof issues affecting international peace and security. Inthe quest for a more just and equitable international order Zimbabwe remains strongly opposed to unilateralismand committed to multilateralism. We would thereforelike to see a United Nations that continues to be aguarantor of world peace and security and a bulwarkin the fight for justice and equality among nations. Itbehoves us all  therefore  to take the necessary steps toensure that the United Nations is not marginalized oninternational issues.Equally important  the United Nations must  infuture  never allow itself to be abused  as it was in thecase I referred to earlier  when NATO sought underChapter VII authority to protect civilians  but it did notturn out to be that. In the future  the Security Councilmust never allow itself to be abused by any MemberState or group of States that seeks to achieve parochial partisan goals. The Charter of the United Nationsclearly stipulates that it is an international body thatshould work for the good of all the peoples of the world big and small.We recognize that there are existing and emergingthreats and challenges that continue to frustrate ourindividual and collective efforts to attain greatereconomic development and social progress  as wellas peace and security. But the increasing trendamong the NATO member States  inspired by thearrogant belief that they are the most powerfulamong us — demonstrated in their recent resort tounilateralism and military hegemony in Libya — isthe very antithesis of the basic principles of the UnitedNations. In the case of Libya  the African Union and itspeacemaking role was defied  ignored and humiliated.The African Union sought dialogue between the Libyanauthorities and the so-called revolutionaries. May weurge the international community to collectively nipthis dangerous and unwelcome aggressive developmentin the bud before it festers.In that regard  the theme that the President haschosen for this session — “Bringing about adjustmentor settlement of international disputes or situations bypeaceful means” — is very appropriate. This is what wein the African Union stress — the settlement of disputesin a peaceful way  through dialogue. The warmongersof our world have done us enough harm. Wherever theyhave imposed themselves  chaos in place of peace hasbeen the result. One example was the situation created by the Bush-Blair illegal campaign in Iraq — an illegalcampaign undertaken because it was alleged thatSaddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction when it was well known to those two and theirGovernments that he did not have such weapons — and indeed  after invading Iraq  creating much havoc andgetting rid of Saddam Hussein  they admitted that hehad no weapons of mass destruction. So why had theyattacked Iraq in the first place? Why did they seek toget rid of Saddam Hussein? Was it merely because hewas a dictator  as they alleged? No  he was the head ofa country that sat on tons and tons of oil. It was oil theyrequired  and we saw companies — indeed  one suchcompany was headed by a brother of Bush — rushingto suck oil from Iraq.That is also what happened with Libya. The situationthey created in Iraq has now brought about greaterinstability than there ever was. We have Sunnis risingagainst Shias  and vice versa  let alone the disastrouseconomic consequences of that unlawful invasion. Theeconomy is unstable  society unstable  and people arefighting one another. Libya has been made equallyunstable after NATO’s deceitful intervention under thesham cover of Chapter VII of the Charter of the UnitedNations and the phony principle of the responsibility toprotect. I listened to the speech made by the Secretary-General. He made reference to that principle. It isone that can be abused  and it has been abused. And anyway  it is still being debated.Zimbabwe fi rmly believes in the peaceful settlementof disputes between and among States in a manner thatis consistent with the principles and purposes of theUnited Nations. In the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  much more must be done to preventconflicts from erupting in the first place  and to preventrelapses once a situation has been stabilized. Beyonddeploying adequate resources for managing conflicts it is important to address their underlying causes  andto pursue  more proactively  a comprehensive approachfocusing on conflict prevention  peacebuilding peace-maintenance and development. In pursuing thstcause  my delegation strongly believes that adherenceto the Charter of the United Nations should be a solemnobligation of all Member States.We have noticed  with deep regret  that theprovisions of the United Nations Charter dealing withthe peaceful settlement of disputes have  on occasion been ignored by the Security Council. In contrast there appears to be an insatiable appetite for war  embargoes  sanctions and other punitive actions  evenon matters that are better resolved through multilateralcooperation and dialogue. Instead of resorting to thepeaceful resolution of disputes  we are daily witnessinga situation where might is now right. We have said “Well  yes  those who are powerful might hang on theprinciple that might is right”  but certainly right is alsomight.We need to take stock of the inspiring Preamble tothe United Nations Charter  where the plenipotentiarieswho met in San Francisco in 1945 undertook to “savesucceeding generations from the scourge of war”. Thatis especially pertinent at present  when global eventsrepresent a radical departure from that solemn andnoble San Francisco declaration. What do the NATOalliance members have to say about that  one may ask.It is therefore important that the Security Councilshould respect and support the decisions  processes andpriorities of regional organizations. In contrast  recentevents — as has already been stated — particularly withreference to Africa  have demonstrated the scant regardthat the United Nations and certain powerful membersof the international community give to the pivotal role ofregional organizations. Effective cooperation betweenthe United Nations and regional organizations willbecome viable and sustainable only when developed onthe basis of mutual respect and support  as well as onshared responsibility and commitment.It is regrettable to note that certain unacceptableconcepts are currently being foisted on the UnitedNations membership in the absence of intergovernmentalmandates. For instance  there is no agreement yet onthe concept of the responsibility to protect  especiallywith respect to the circumstances under which it mightbe invoked. We are concerned by the clear and growingevidence that the concept of responsibility to protecthas begun to be applied and seriously abused  thusinevitably compromising and undermining the cardinalprinciple of the sovereignty of States and the UnitedNations Charter principles of territorial integrity andnon-interference in the domestic affairs of countries.For the international community to successfullydeal with global economic  social  security andenvironmental challenges  the existence of internationalinstitutions to handle them and a culture of genuinemultilateralism are critical. The United Nations its specialized agencies and international financialinstitutions are the only instruments available forresponding effectively to the global challenges we face in the global village. It is therefore critical that thosestructures be reformed and realigned in response toboth global challenges and our contemporary realities in order to enable them to better serve our collectiveinterests.This Assembly is the most representative organwithin the United Nations family. We must thereforededicate ourselves to finding consensus on measures torevitalize it so that it fulfils its mandate in accordancewith the provisions of the Charter. We wish to reiterateour deep concern that the mandate  powers andjurisdiction of the General Assembly are shrinkingas a consequence of the Security Council’s gradualencroachment on the Assembly’s areas of competence.That  in our view  upsets the delicate balance envisagedunder the Charter and undermines the overalleffectiveness of the United Nations system. TheGeneral Assembly must remain the main deliberative policy-making organ of the United Nations.We have been seized with the debate on the reform ofthe Security Council for far too long. My delegation fullysupports the current intergovernmental negotiations onthe reform and expansion of the Council. However  wewish to caution against an open-ended approach thatshort-changes those of us from regions that are notrepresented at all among the permanent membership ofthe Council. Zimbabwe stands by Africa’s demand fortwo permanent seats  complete with a veto if the vetois to be retained  plus two additional non-permanentseats  as clearly articulated in the Ezulwini Consensusand the Sirte Declaration.For how long will the international communitycontinue to ignore the aspirations of a whole continentof 54 countries? We shall not be bought off with emptypromises  nor shall we accept some cosmetic tinkeringwith the Security Council disguised as reform. It isindeed a travesty of justice that the African continent which accounts for almost a third of the membershiprepresented in this Assembly  has no permanentrepresentation in the Council. Is that good governance?Is that democracy? And is that justice?My delegation condemns unreservedly theeconomic sanctions imposed against my country andpeople in an unjustified effort to deny them the chanceto fully benefit from their natural resource endowment.We wish to remind those who have maintained sanctionsagainst us that there is international consensus — fullysupported by the Southern African Development Community  the African Union  the Non-AlignedMovement and the rest of the progressive world — thatthese sanctions must go. We hope they will go.Allow me to conclude by reaffirming Zimbabwe’scommitment to the principles that have brought ustogether in the United Nations for the last 67 years.My country is confident that in this inextricablyinterdependent world  our commitment to the commongood  which the Organization embodies  will beresolute and enduring. Zimbabwe will continue to standfirm and to condemn unilateralism  the imposition ofunwarranted and illegal sanctions on nations and theunwarranted extraterritorial application of nationallaws."
